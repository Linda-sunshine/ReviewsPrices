review/summary: Cant sew my jeansreview/text: I bought this for my wife and she was so excited to use this to do basic alterations and projects but it works a bit too hard to get through denim pant cuffs. I had to take my jeans in to be professionally altered because we were afraid to break the machine. I like that the machine didn't break the bank but I feel that should be able to expect a bit more from this machine!
