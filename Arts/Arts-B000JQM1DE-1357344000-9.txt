review/summary: Sweet Little Machinereview/text: This is one sweet little machine. It is light weight, but a great performer. Has nice decorative stitches, great tension, easy to use. I liked the dummy proof diagrams on the machine for threading and bobbin insertion. No more looking in the manual to see if you did it correctly. Can't beat it for the price!
