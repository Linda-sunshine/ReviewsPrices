review/summary: GREAT MACHINEreview/text: I GOT THIS ONE FOR MY MOTHER IN LAW AND SHE LOVED IT. IT'S A NICE AFFORDABLE MACHINE THAT GETS THE JOB DONE. IT BRINGS A LOT OF GADGETS FOR SEWING AND IT GIVES A PROFESSIONAL FINISH TO EVERY PIECE. NOW, WHEN PANTS ARE TOO LONG MY MOTHER IN LAW FIXES THEM WITH THIS MACHINE AND THE PANTS LOOK IDENTICAL TO THE ORIGINAL SEWING.
