review/summary: No pedal needed!review/text: I love it because I don't need to use the pedal. The front panel has buttons for forward, backwards and up/down needle function. You can use the pedal which is included. Also came with a large platform for quilting or large project needs. Super easy to use, instructions with pictures and you will be sewing in no time.
