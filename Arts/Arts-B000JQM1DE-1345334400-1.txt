review/summary: Brother CS 6000i sewing machine - worst faultreview/text: I've had this machine more than 3 years now, and I'm telling you,I want to buy another machine, but am afraid to buy another Brother.The thread bunches up at the least inoportune times. It has a very hard time pulling fabric, especially,but not only, at the start. It's like the feeder mechanism is madetoo low in the machine, and can't get hold of the fabric. I do alot of pulling, trying to get the material going and staying goingunder the presser foot. It's a royal pain, I'm telling you, and I havesewn for many, many years. I've never had a machine that I had tocoax to work like this one. It breaks needles. When winding abobbin, if you don't hold something under the thread, it ends up beingwrapped around the bottom of the spindle, instead of on the bobbin itself.I get so mad when I have to unwind and unwind and unwind thread off thewinding spindle, when I forget to put a small pair of scissors, or ametal measurer under the thread, so it doesn't get wound around thewrong thing. These are just SOME of the aggravations of this machine.I would NOT recommend it to anyone, especially to a beginner, whodoesn't know how to deal with an unruly sewing machine. You'd thinkBrother would have worked out all these problems by now, but NO.This machine will drive you nuts !!
