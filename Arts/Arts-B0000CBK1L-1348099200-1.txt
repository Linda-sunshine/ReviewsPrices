review/summary: An Amazing Sergerreview/text: I wanted to wait a while before giving a review on this machine. I have heard nothing but fantastic reviews for this serger, and after using it I understand why. One of my initial concerns was that it would be difficult to thread. I hear nightmares about the length of time that requires, but this machine isn't as bad as sergers are made out to be. Granted, I don't enjoy changing the threads everytime I want to switch colors, but it isn't hard. Before this machine, I was a total novice in the serger world, and this has made me want to get the Coverhem to continue.My stiches have been amazing. I've had so much fun playing with this machine and learning what it can do. I know I've only explored 1/10 of it's capabilities (if that), but it's just wonderful. I'm dying to get more material to get more creative with it.
