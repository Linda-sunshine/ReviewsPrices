review/summary: Broke, now it clunksreview/text: I purchased this model in 2008, and have used it occasionally. It was having problems this year, so I took it in to a local shop, who charged me a hundred dollars to fix it, but told me this model just plain wears out faster and that it was a poor purchase. Seems like it would be worth it to spend twice the price on a better serger (NOT a Brother) and maintain it half as often. I am very disappointed.
