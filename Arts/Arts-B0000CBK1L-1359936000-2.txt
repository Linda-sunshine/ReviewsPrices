review/summary: Bad product?review/text: I used this serger once. It didn't perform the best stitches. It was jamming up and I didn't have time to try to examine the problem. I finally rethreaded it and found the mechanics of the machinery is not working properly. It had nothing to do with threading it. I took it to a repair shop and it will be $169 just to look at it. It is to late to return it for any refund.
