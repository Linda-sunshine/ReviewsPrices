review/summary: Amazing for the pricereview/text: I bought this as a second serger for my weekend place. My first serger is a Babylock Imagine, which cost almost ten times as much. The Brother serger has as good stitch quality as the BL. It doesn't have the jet air threading or the automatic tension features, but it is easy to thread and easy to set tensions on this machine. The instruction booklets do a great job in walking the sewist through both.I can't believe this works so well and is so easy to use. There are a couple of stitches that the BL has and the Brother doesn't, but they are not very important to me (for example, blanket stitch).On the other hand, there are a couple of features I like better on the Brother. One is the free arm and the other is the presser foot lifter, which is easier to use and more conveniently located than the one on the BL.The quality I like least on this serger, and the reason for the four stars, is the noise and vibration it generates at higher sewing speeds. It is better when I sew at a moderate speed and with a thick pad under the serger.Other than that, I find it hard to believe Brother can sell this machine at this price. It is a true bargain, with good quality and design and one of the lowest price tags of any serger on the market.
