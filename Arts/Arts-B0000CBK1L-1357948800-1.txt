review/summary: Not for mereview/text: For the sale price of $189 this was probably worth what I paid for it. It is very finicky and has to be threaded just right for it to work. The instructions were not very helpful but I was able to find tutorials on youtube that helped. When it worked, it did a good job. However, I bought it to use on my new business and need a serger that will work every time, at least once a week. I only got to use this machine on 2 items before the upper looper motor settings jammed and now it won't work due to the looper bumping on all the other parts. I am returning it to buy a more reliable brand serger. If you are just using it on basic projects, once or twice a year, it might work for you but if you are planning to use it often, it won't be worth the headache.
