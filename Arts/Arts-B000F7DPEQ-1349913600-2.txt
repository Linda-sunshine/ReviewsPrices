review/summary: Great sewing machinereview/text: Backstory: I bought a sewing machine on impulse when I saw it at Target for less than $100. Had now sewn in decades, but when I saw the machine my headed flooded with ideas for projects and I figured it would be worth the money. That machine was made by that brand that is known for sewing machines, and I thought I could not go wrong with it.I was wrong. The machine kept jamming for no reason I could see. I could only think that the cost of repair would be more than the cost of the machine itself, so I didn't want to call anyone. And, because I had not sewn in so long, the sewing part of my mind was still in the 70s and I didn't think of calling tech support.So I gave that machine away to someone who may be able to fix it and searched for something better. This machine, the Brother L2600I, had good reviews on Amazon and was even cheaper, so I thought I'd check it out.It works beautifully. The few times it has jammed, I've been able to find the reason -- always something I've done wrong. And it has a couple of nifty features. There is a needle threader. It's a little tricky and it takes some practice, but once you get it it works very well. And the bobbin case is covered in transparent plastic and you open it from a horizontal surface. The result is that you can see what's going on in the bobbin case as you sew. When you go in there to change the bobbin, it no longer feels like a dark underworld.If there's a minus -- and I'm not sure this is a real problem -- it's that you can't use the same bobbins you use for other machines. I have not had to buy extra bobbins yet, so I don't know how much of a problem this will be. I'm thinking you probably just have to be careful to buy the right ones.
