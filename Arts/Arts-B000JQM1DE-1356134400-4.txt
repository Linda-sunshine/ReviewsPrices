review/summary: Best investment ever!review/text: Purchased this machine because I needed one that was more transportable than my 1931 Singer. I've used it constantly since I purchased it in June and it hasn't given me a single problem. This machine is perfect for what I need. I think it's great whether you're a seasoned seamster or just beginning to sew. I can't justify spending thousands of dollars on a Bernina if I can accomplish so many of the same things with this machine at a fraction of the price.
