review/summary: This machine has tension problems need to use metal bobbins!review/text: I was VERY unhappy with this machine and had worked for over two hours trying to get the stitch tension to work. I was informed by Bryan (Amazon customer service supervisor) that the review stated to use a "metal" bobbin, even though the machine comes with plastic bobbins! So I bought some metal bobbins and tried again - it worked just like the review said (LIKE MAJIC!!!)So ONLY use metal bobbins on this machine and don't trim the bobbin thread on the razor that is part of the machine - leave the thread be about 3-5 inches long. Also, the thread show go over the top of the bobbin even though the manual doesn't show that - then the bobbin tension is correct!
