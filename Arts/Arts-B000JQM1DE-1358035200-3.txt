review/summary: Perfect for quiltingreview/text: This is a great little machine. I returned two others before settling on this one, and I'm glad I did!Pros:- Very lightweight, but doesn't shift around on the table- Comes with an extension table (which is usually around 70 dollars separately)- Fairly bright light, definitely brighter than most- Automatic needle down (whenever you stop sewing, the needle will automatically move to the down position)- The button to the right of the backstitch moves the needle 1/2 stitch, so it's easy to move the needle up from its automatic down position, with just the press of a button!- It won't let you sew when the foot is up; it will beep at you and flash E1 on the display. This is FANTASTIC for beginners; I find when teaching others to sew, the thing they forget most often is to put the foot down.- I really like the drop-in bobbin.- Speed control on the front; you can still adjust the speed by foot pressure, though.- There is a switch to lower the feed dogs in the back (essential for free-motion quilting)- The Walking foot accessory is the best thing everCons:- It sews fairly slowly, to me, even when you have the pedal to the metal and the front speed control set to >>> (fastest). Not a deal-breaker, though.- There's no way to switch it from automatic needle-down to automatic needle-up. Just a small feature that is on some other machines.- Doesn't come with a 1/4 seam allowance quilting foot- When you turn the machine off, it will reset to stitch 00 instead of saving your previous settings. Stitch 00 has the needle all the way to the left, and I mostly sew with the needle in the middle (Stitch 01), and sometimes I forget to change the stitch, so that's a little annoying.Really, all the accessories that this comes with makes it worth the price, if you can get it here on Amazon when it's on sale. I've found that a lot of the people who give this a 1-star review are having thread/bobbin issues, which will happen with any machine if you're not using the right thread and needle with your fabric.
