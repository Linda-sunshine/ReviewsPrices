review/summary: First time novicereview/text: I purchased this machine never having sewed before. I read the manual and had to make two or three calls to Brother's customer service dept. on exactly how to thread the machine. They probably were laughing inside but they were very helpful and within an hour after I received this machine, I was hemming my pants like a pro. You can't beat the simplicity of this machine.
