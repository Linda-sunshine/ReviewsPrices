review/summary: Brother sewing machinereview/text: I love this machine. For the money...how can one go wrong. My biggest question is...how do they make any money given the complexity and quality of the machine...with such a low price. Had trouble with the thread tension but found a couple of tutorials on UTube that showed me what I was doing wrong.
