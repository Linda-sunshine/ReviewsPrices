review/summary: Awesome sewing machine!review/text: Prior to owning this machine, I had only sewed on buttons by hand, but wanted to get into sweater-quilting and hemming pants. This machine has great instructions for new sewers but tons of features for those with advanced skills, too. It is AWESOME. Great machine for a great price!
