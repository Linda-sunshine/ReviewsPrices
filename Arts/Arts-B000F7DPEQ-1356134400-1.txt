review/summary: Outstanding performancereview/text: I love this sewing machine. I have been sewing for 49+ years. I previously owned a Singer in a cabinet model that I purchased for $300.00 when I got married. I bought this machine on sale for $80.00 (what a deal) because I wanted something that I could just put on my kitchen table.I like this more modern machine better than my old one. It is very easy to operate and at my age threading a needle has gotten harder so I definetly love the needle threader. I used to waste a lot of time threading my old machine.Sewing parts (extra accessories and rufflers) are available on line for Brother & other sewing machines and I just can't say enough how great this machine has worked out.Have a problem with this machine post it I am sure I could tell you how to correct the problem. There isn't anything I haven't encountered that I wasn't able to figure out.
