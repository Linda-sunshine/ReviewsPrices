review/summary: Exceeds expectationsreview/text: My Brother CS6000i arrived yesterday and has exceeded expectations. I have not quilted in 20 years and decided to dust the cobwebs off some unfinished projects. Due to arthritis, I cannot hand quilt as in the past so I started researched sewing machines with quilting functions. I found this machine and was a little skeptical because the price was so low. Within 10 min. of unpacking the machine, I was sewing! I could not be more pleased.
