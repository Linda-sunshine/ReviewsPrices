review/summary: Great and Portablereview/text: I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it, even though her father also accidentally bought her a project runway edition sewing machine at the exact same time. She prefers this model because it is light, portable, it always works and it seems at local shops around here the parts are more readily available. You can't go wrong with this entry level sewing machine form Brother!
