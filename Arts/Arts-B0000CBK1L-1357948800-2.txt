review/summary: Fantastic sergerreview/text: I am new to Serging. I am working on a big project for Days For Girls, Int. I couldn't afford a Babylock, but this one was within my budget. What I love? It works Well and is easy to operate, love the speed of Serging.. I was terrified of threading it, but did it successfully on my first attempt. There a great You Tube video a woman made with even more Lear directions. She point out all the potential pitfalls.
