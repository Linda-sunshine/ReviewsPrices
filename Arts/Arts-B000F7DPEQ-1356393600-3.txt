review/summary: Entry level machine that does a lotreview/text: I'm a guy, and we had to sew up some pants for my daughter school uniform. After figuring things out, I was able to hem up a pair of pants with no drama. Decent little machine for run of the mill stuff like this, as well as plenty of other crafty stuff you may run across from what I can tell with all the stitches this thing can produce.
