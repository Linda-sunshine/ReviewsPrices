review/summary: Not bad but not in it for the long haul.review/text: I've had this machine for a few years now. The pros... it does what it's supposed to do. Worked great right out of the box. Has all the stitches you need for basic sewing and then some. The cons... it's all plastic and doesn't hold up over time. I can no longer use my machine to wind bobbins, the part you have to move to do so will not move. The case is cracked now and it doesn't like to sew through really heavy fabrics no matter what size needle I try. I think it's worth the price I paid (right around 100) but it's not a machine you'll keep for the rest of your life. Expect to replace it in a couple of years if it sees moderate to heavy use.
