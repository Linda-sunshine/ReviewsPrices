review/summary: I am loving my sergerreview/text: I was very intimidated by sergers. First, their price was too high and second, they seemed very complicated. I finally got the nerve to order this Brother 1034D because Amazon had such a great price. I said to myself if I can figure out a computer, cell phone, and embroidery machine, I can figure out this serger. I read the instructions and practiced and now I just love it. Love it to death. I've made like a dozen napkins just so I can do the rolled hem, it comes out perfect each time. No regrets! If you are serious about sewing you must have this little workhorse.
