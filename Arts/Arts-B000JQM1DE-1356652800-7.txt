review/summary: Sewing machinereview/text: I've never had much experience sewing so this was my first new sewing machine and I really like it. I've been making fancy breast collars for Miniature Horses and people love them. Couldn't have done it without the machine. I can't seem to master the self threader so I just thread by hand, but otherwise I really like the machine.
