review/summary: Great machine for the price!!review/text: I have only ever used borrowed, 30 yr old sewing machines, and after borrowing a terrible machine that chewed up all my new fabric I decided to purchase my own machine.I am so glad that I bought this one, it has a lot of great features, different feet included and working with automated options is so nice!It stitches smoothly, evenly and with such ease that I am thrilled! I have used it non-stop since I purchased it over a month ago, and I have completed about 10 different projects, ranging from re-covering an old glider chair to appliqu&eacute; and quilting. Everything has worked beautifully. The only problems I ever have: occassionally the thread falls out of the top hook and flops down, changing the tension and making a mess of stitches under the fabric, but if you keep an eye out for the problem you can catch it in time and simply re-hook the thread back up and continue sewing. I had the occassional problem with tension with one type of fabric, but haven't had any issues since (might have been a user error).It is simple to use, learn on, and change the feet out and bobbin. I love this machine, it sews beautifully!
