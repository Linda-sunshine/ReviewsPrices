review/summary: it's okreview/text: It works good. I can't get rolled hem out of the machine. Good for beginners, I think. For the money I spent I can't complain much.Have made 5 outfits using it-quite happy with the results.Threading -yes!-takes some practice- but there is nothing to be scared of.I'm giving 3 and a half stars.
