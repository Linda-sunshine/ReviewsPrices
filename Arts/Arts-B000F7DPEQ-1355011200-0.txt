review/summary: Gift that is lovedreview/text: Bought this for my girlfriend who makes garb for both of us to wear while performing and working at renaissance faires. She LOVES her Brother XL2600I ! She has been going like a house afire with it since I gave it to her, and has created pirate garb, mens' shirts, beautiful renaissance gowns for herself, chemises, so many different things. All in all, a superb bargain.
