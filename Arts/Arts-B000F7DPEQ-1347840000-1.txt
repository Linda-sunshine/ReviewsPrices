review/summary: Tension terriblereview/text: I am returning the machine after three days of use. There is no way to adjust the lower thread tension, and it is too loose to make the machine usable. I am sewing on basic cotton scraps, but the tension is so loose, even after repeated adjustments, that the seams will not hold. Very disappointed.
