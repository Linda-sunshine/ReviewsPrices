review/summary: Insanely great value.review/text: I needed to replace the pockets in a beloved leather jacket. It would probably have cost me as much to have it done at a local tailor's. Of course, I spent 5 hours on the project. But anyway, this really did pay for itself the first day I used it. It is about as simple a machine you can get today. I learned on Mom's 75 year old Singer (sadly lost to the ages), which had two settings; go and stop. So this thing is mind boggling in its versatility. It would be nice if they made the free-arm smaller, I'm sure there is &#34;room&#34; in there. You can't go wrong with this. But READ THE DIRECTIONS!
