review/summary: WOW!!!review/text: All I can say is WOW!! what an amazing machine. I have been considering a serger but had no clue how to use one at all. Let me tell you, if you want one this is the one to get. I easily read the manual and had it threaded and sewing in no time. This is a great machine for the money and I would definatly recommend to all!! I have been sewing up a storm. Thanks!
