review/summary: Good machine for the moneyreview/text: I bought this machine to get me started on quilting, and made the decision to buy based on the features like the quilt table, walking foot and pre-programmed quilting stitches.So far, I am very pleased with the machine's performance. The stitches are neat and even, and once tension is adjusted there is no need to fiddle with it. The walking foot moves the three layers of a quilt together without bunching or snagging. The quilt table is easy to set up, and I leave it on most of the time while I am sewing to provide a larger work area. On the piecing stitch settings, the machine sews a very precise 1/4" seam so long as the edge of the fabric is lined up against the outside of the presser foot. The presser feet are very easy to change, and the machine is easy to thread and to wind bobbins. According to the manufacturer, the machine does not need oiling, so there is none of that mess to deal with, and so normal maintenance is just keeping the work area and bobbin case lint-free.That said, there are some things that need improving - the needle threader is fiddly and rarely works right. It would probably be completely unnecessary if the task lighting on the machine were better. The folding legs on the quilt table tend to slip and try to fold up again, and I find myself having to periodically fold them back out. The tool storage area on the front of the machine is not big enough to hold all of the accessories and the walking foot.
