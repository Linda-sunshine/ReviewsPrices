review/summary: Fabulous Machinereview/text: I have been looking for a new sewing machine but, because I am a 'senior', did not want to put a lot of money into one. I do not do enough sewing to justify spending that kind of money. My daughter talked me into sending for this one because of the price and because it was very similar to her expensive Janome.When I received it, I showed it to all my friends and stuck it in my sewing nook. For a couple of days, I didn't touch it, fearful of all the new features. However, since then, I have decided to teach myself to quilt and I am having a ball. I have even sent for 2 more 'feet' from amazon.com, as well as more needles (just in case). Every day I cannot wait to 'play' with my new toy.
