review/summary: Great machine!review/text: For a beginner sewer like myself, this machine is perfect! And for the price I paid, it is amazing and the quality is great. I am constantly searching for projects to work on just to use it. Everything is labeled to help you become familiar with using the machine itself, and the manual is easy to read. The machine I ordered also came with a few bonus accessories and pretty much everything I needed to start sewing then and there. I would highly recommend this sewing machine, and Amazon's price was the cheapest I found.
