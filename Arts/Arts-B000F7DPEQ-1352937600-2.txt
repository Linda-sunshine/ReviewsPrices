review/summary: Great first sewing machine!!review/text: I haven't sewn since my freshman year in HS 12 years ago and decided I would like to try it again. Since it has been sooo long since I have sewn anything I wanted to get something that was inexpensive and easy to use since I wasn't sure how I would like it and didn't want to spend money on something that I wasn't going to use. I went with this sewing machine after checking lots of online reviews and am very happy with my choice. It worked great right out of the box. I have only had this machine for a week and have made 2 decorative pillows, 2 pairs of pajama pants, and 3 different outfits for my daughters american girl doll and this machine has worked great. It's really easy to use, I love the automatic threader. I didn't have any trouble with the tension or even sewing through denim. I love that it's light weight too so when I start taking sewing classes I'll have no problem taking it there and back. When I'm ready to upgrade to a different machine I am going to stick with Brother because I have been so pleased with the quality of this one.
