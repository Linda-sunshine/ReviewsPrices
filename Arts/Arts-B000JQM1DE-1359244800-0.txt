review/summary: Glad my old sewing machine broke!review/text: I love this sewing machine! It is smooth and quiet and I love all the stitches, they are so much fun! I also really like the drop in bobbin and the self-threading needle. It took me a while to get the hang of the self-threading needle but I use it every time now. I'm not a fan of the cover it comes with because I like the one I already have that has a bottom to it. I like the computerized aspect of it. It took some getting used to but I really like it. This is perfect for a beginner or seasoned sewer. When I sew with it I keep expecting it to have the same problems I had with my other one and I am pleasantly surprised every time! i would recommend it to anyone!
