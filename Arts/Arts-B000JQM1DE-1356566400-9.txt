review/summary: Nice machinereview/text: I like the sewing machine with all the different settings. Since I got it a few months ago, I have already made 3 bags/purses. They turned out really nice. I like the fact that it adjusted so well to the thinkness of the materials. My only complaint is where the lever for the foot is. It would be more convenient if you were able to lift it either from the front or back not under the arm.
