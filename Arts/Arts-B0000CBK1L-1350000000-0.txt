review/summary: Love this little machinereview/text: I love this little serger, my old one was, well really old and a real problem when it came to threading it. But this Brother 3/4 serger is a dream come true. I do a lot of sewing, mostly quilting and handbags and it works like a charm. Plue the most important, it threads in a breeze. Just follow the little arrows and in the correct order and off you go.I would recomend this to anyone who is looking for a new serger.
