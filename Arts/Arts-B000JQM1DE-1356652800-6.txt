review/summary: So much of a machine for so little money!review/text: I was very sceptical about purchasing this machine because the price was so inexpensive. However, I just wanted an additional machine to leave set up for straight stitching while I use my high-end machine for free-motion quilting. To my surprise, this machine does lovely free-motion with the quilting foot included. My husband joked that I may like this better than my own machine...maybe he's right! It is a dream to sew with. I've tested all the decorative stitches along with some free-motion testing. All passed with flying colors! It's amazing to me that a sewing machine with a quilting table along with a walking foot and free-motion quilting foot can be this affordable. (A walking foot for my high-end machine is almost as much as this whole package costs!!!) It is also very lightweight, so it would be wonderful to take to classes. The machine does have enough weight to hold it firmly on the work surface. The only drawback I have is that the hard cover case is only a cover and not for carrying, so it would be necessary to purchase a carrying bag.
