review/summary: Great machine, except ...review/text: I bought this machine nine months ago, and it really is a super little machine except for one thing: you can't maintain it beyond removing dust from the bobbin area. After nine months of reasonable (not even heavy) use, the motor locked up and gave me an error message. Turns out, it just needed oil, but the user can't do it--you must take the machine to an authorized service center, and in my case that service center was over 100 miles away.Except for that one little wrinkle, I like the machine a great deal. It has loads of decorative stitches and sews beautifully on all the fabrics I've tried it on. But if you're any distance from a Brother authorized service center, consider buying a different machine that doesn't require service to perform a simple task like routine maintenance.
