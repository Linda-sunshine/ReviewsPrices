review/summary: Brother CS6000ireview/text: I LOVE this machine! I'm a beginner sewer & this machine is so easy to thread and use! It is lightweight, quiet & does beautiful stitching. It has so many different stitch choices that it should be fun for a more experienced sewer too. For the price, you can't beat it!
