review/summary: finally: a brother i actually likereview/text: this is a cute sewing machine that does simple/easy work with no hiccups. (read the instructions and you'll be fine) it uses plastic pieces (bobbin) instead of metal, which isn't so great... but otherwise, it's a good machine for the price. i would recommend it for a beginner only if they weren't heavy-handed- i really liked learning on an older machine with metal pieces that could take punches from me without breaking. i'd say something like this is better for someone who already has basic knowledge and some experience with sewing, as the plastic bits will break easily if you abuse them. they also currently sell this machine at my local wal-mart (higher price there!) so you can find out if a wal-mart near you carries it and check out the store's model before purchasing it on amazon. quick shipping but it came in actual box with no wrapping or shipping box... so mine had a big dent in it.
