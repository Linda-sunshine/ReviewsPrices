review/summary: Bad machine - bought based on price = bad decisionreview/text: I bought this machine to replace my 27 year old Kenmore. I had it 62 days when it locked up and quit working. I called customer service and had to bring it to the nearest service center - 27 miles away - to have it serviced because it is sealed and can not be fixed. I had to leave it with them for 10 days during which I had to borrow back my old machine to finish some projects that needed to be done right away. I got the machine back and I am looking for a better machine. I bought the machine thinking it was a great buy but it stalls on heavy fabric and shows an error which you can not override. I can't return it because of the 30 day return policy so I am stuck with it. I don't have a lot of expendable cash so I will have to use this one. I'm looking for a better machine now and would not recommend this machine at all. What a terrible disappointment.
