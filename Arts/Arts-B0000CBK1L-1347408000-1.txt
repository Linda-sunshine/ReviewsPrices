review/summary: Love my sergerreview/text: just purchased and already made my first cardigan. I am very happy with this machine. I read the reviews here before I purchased and that helped me make my decision. Now, I know a lot of people have trouble threading. I found this to be very, very easy. The machine comes with two CD's - one of those CD's instructs you on how to thread. The machine comes with 4 spools which is already threaded on the machine. All you have to do is snip the thread that's on the tree, tie a knot to the existing thread and run the machine until the "newer" thread comes out. Does that make sense? I probably don't explain it well. I posted a link to a blog that discusses this in a much better manner on my blog: [...]*/. Go take a look - it's very simple. You can also see the cardigan I made. Please feel free to ask questions about the serger or sewing machine (it's a Brother too).
