review/summary: Brother CS6000ireview/text: Product preforms exactly as described. The manual is not very clear about how some procedures are performed. I am still having problems with the automatic threader. The manual is not clear where the thread is supposed to go so it is inserted in the needle. Other than that, it is an excellent machine and well worth the price.
