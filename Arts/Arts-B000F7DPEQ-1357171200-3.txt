review/summary: A Great Christmas Giftreview/text: This was purchased for a serious minded eight year old as a Christmas present. She would have totally disdained a "Dora" or other kid's sewing machine. This is a nice little machine but it is not a toy. Frankly considering the price, it seems live an amazing value. It is also easy to use. She was sewing on Christmas day. For ease of use, size, features and quality this is a very nice product. I am not a seamster or seamstress but this beats the bejabbers out of my old four times the cost and three times as heavy sewing machine.
