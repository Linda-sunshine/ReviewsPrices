review/summary: Loops in straight stitchreview/text: I bought this machine based on its excellent reviews.. but I'm always getting loops on straight stitch. I followed threading instructions, width and length settings to the letter and I couldn't get a proper stitch. The thread coming from bobbin is very loose which is causing this issue.
