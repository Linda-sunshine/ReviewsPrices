review/summary: Seems pretty goodreview/text: I haven't used a sewing machine in many years, but all in all, things went pretty well with my first small project. I had a bit of trouble threading it and the instructions weren't great, but was able to figure it out eventually. Seems like a sturdy machine. Time will tell how it holds up over the long run.
