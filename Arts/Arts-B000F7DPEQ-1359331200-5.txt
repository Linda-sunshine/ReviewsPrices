review/summary: Good machinereview/text: after i mastered the self threading feature, which took awhile, i had problems fillingthe bobbin. the instructions are easy to read and there are visual aids on the top ofthe machine, but the thread is not tight and the bobbin does not spin like it shoud.I think i just need t practice more, once in awhile it works properly.
