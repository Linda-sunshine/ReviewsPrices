review/summary: Great sewing machinereview/text: I LOVE this machine! Once you figured it out it is easy to use - plus it is easy to figure out, even for people that are starters! I have used this sewing machine alot already for different things - my biggest project were making two roman shades myself and with that machine it was fun and easy to make them! It is easy to get the thread on the bobbins and its easy to get into the needle with the little help thingy they have next to the needle! I bought this machine for an amazing price and if anyone wants to get a new machine - if beginners or not - I would highly recommend it!
