review/summary: Brother CS6000i Advance Sew Affordable 60-Stitch Computerized Free-Arm...review/text: This is a totally new machine for me. My old Kenmore did not have all of these options. I am relearning to sew and will reserve the remained of my review for later. This is one of those things which I am going to have to keep the booklet next to me.For now, it was relatively easy to thread the machine, love the self threading (once I got my hands to work together).
