review/summary: Great Sewing Machinereview/text: This is a great sewing machine. My mother owns a much more expensive Brother model and this little machine shares many of the same features as hers. I love the simplicity of it and how easy it was to thread as well as wind bobbins. I have no problem with how much light it puts out. Love that you can control the machine with a foot pedal or with the button on the unit. Haven't had a chance to use all the stitches so far but I can say it gets through thick material really well. It comes at a great price and it was an excellent deal in my opinion. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
