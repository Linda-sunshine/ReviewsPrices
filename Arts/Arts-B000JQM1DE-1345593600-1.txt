review/summary: Not sturdy, authorized repair centers few and far awayreview/text: Thread tension not the best and getting worse though we haven't used it much. Problem may have been worsened by putting bobbin in wrong one time. Will now have to take it to be repaired,which is going to be an expense and hassle. Advise renting or buying a sturdier machine depending on how long you need it for.
