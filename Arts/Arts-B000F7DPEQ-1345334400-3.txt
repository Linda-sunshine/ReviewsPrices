review/summary: Brother XL2600 I Sewreview/text: This is my first real sewing machine and I really like it. It has a lot of different stitch options and is VERY quiet. I'm just learning to sew and this machine has been great. It's lightweight and the light at the front really helps me to see what I'm doing. There is a large diagram that came with it to show you how to thread the bobbins. However, the actual instructions for the machine are combersome. I just use trial and error. I'm learning that the speed is also based on how much pressure you put on the foot pedal. I didn't know that previously. I like the reverse button on the front that allows me to backtrack for correction or reinforcement. You just have to hold it while you do it because it only reverses for as long as you hold it down. One problem I keep having is that the needle frequently becomes unthreaded and I don't always realize it right away. I'm not sure how to get it to stop because I pull at least 5-6 inches through the needle and to the back.I bought the generic sewing machine case to go with it so I can stuff the pedal and a few other items into it as well.
