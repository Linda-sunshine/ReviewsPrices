review/summary: Sewing Machinereview/text: I was so excited for this machine, its my first one. Its a little tricky but the manual helps a lot. The only i thing i cant figure out is why the thread in the bobbin puckers sometimes. I've changed fabrics, thread tension, stitches...i don't know. I have threaded a bobbin before so i know i did it right. I'll get right soon.
