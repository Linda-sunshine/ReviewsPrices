review/summary: Nice price and versatile machinereview/text: I was looking for a new sewing machine for my 15 year old daughter, something sturdy, inexpensive ( but not cheap), something for first timers. This is perfect, I am even thinking of taking up sewing. I love the amount of stitch patters also.
