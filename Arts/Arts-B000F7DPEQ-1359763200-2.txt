review/summary: Happy with my choice of machinereview/text: Just used my machine for the first time today. I read over the instructions as well as a book I brought at my fabric store before attempting anything. I've been terrified of using a sewing machines so I was so relieved that this machine is fairly quiet and easy to understand. I did 4 practice stitches, had to put my tension on 7 and it looked great. Made my daughter a barbie blanket in about 10 minutes :)I highly recommend searching for online videos of this machine, there are 3 on YouTube that were so great and really helped me. I'm happy with this machine and pretty proud of myself for overcoming my fear.
