review/summary: Very pleased!review/text: I am a beginner at sewing, but this machine was very easy to use. I have enjoyed learning how to make a few things with this machine. I was disappointed with the threader. I haven't yet figured out how to make the machine thread itself...maybe I should ask someone more experienced. Other than that, everything has been very easy to figure out and to use.
