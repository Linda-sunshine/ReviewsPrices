review/summary: Nice and easyreview/text: Very nice machine and easy to use. Will do just great for my crafts and quilts as well as all other sewing I may need to do. I am a beginning quilter. Easy to understand instructions for someone familiar with a sewing machine. I have been sewing some for years but may be more difficult for a beginning sewer to understand. I really love this nice light machine.
