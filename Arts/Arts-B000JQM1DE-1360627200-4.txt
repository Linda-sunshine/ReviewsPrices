review/summary: Shower gifts got finished in time!review/text: While recently making a baby shower gift I needed later in the week, my 20+ year old Singer &#34;froze&#34;. My Singer machine was one of the first computer models so I figured fixing it could possibly cost almost as much as a new machine & I would still have an older machine. Besides, maybe someday my daughter will decide she enjoys sewing & take it up as a hobby. Knowing I liked sewing on the machine I use with the volunteer sewing group at my local hospital, I immediately went online to Amazon.com to check out the current models. I knew these machines would work well for me since I mainly use the basic stitches, plus a few decorative stitches. My sewing group has 9 machines that we use weekly, with 5 of them being fairly new Brothers, so I knew this was the machine for me. Still having to finish up the shower gifts, I ordered my new machine, using the next day shipping. I received my new machine the NEXT afternoon! Needless to say I finished the gifts in time for the shower & have even finished up several other projects I found in my sewing room! I love my new machine & would recommend this machine to anyone who enjoys sewing. And it is so simple to use!
