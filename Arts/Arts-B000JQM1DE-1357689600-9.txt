review/summary: bought this as a gift for my girlfriendreview/text: My girlfriend loves to craft, so when she asked for a sewing machine I came across the Brother CS6000i. It had a lot of great reviews from people who looked like they knew what they were talking about, so I took the plunge and bought it for her as a gift. She loves it and uses it all the time. There are a ton of stitch patterns available through the sewing machine and she so far has no complaints.
