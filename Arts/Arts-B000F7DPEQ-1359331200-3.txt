review/summary: Good machinereview/text: I love the simplicity of this machine. I haven't used a sewing machine in over thirty years and really wanted to learn some basic skills so I didn't need a lot of frills. This machine will do a whole lot more than I know how to do. It handles quilting weight easy enough but go slow with real heavy materials and you will do ok. I would recommend it as a beginner or intermediate machine. Shipping was awesome and the price was great too!
