review/summary: Easy to use.review/text: They weren't kidding when they recommended NO PINs used with this machine. I broke the cutter knife with one pin and had to order another. Once you understand the threading, the machine is a little work horse. A real good machine. I don't know how to do curves and corners though. Maybe I should only do straight runs. The cutters cut too much out of curves and corners so I should just read reviews to find how best to use the machine. The DVDs that come with this machine are CRAP. Use You Tube and get good, high-def instruction.
