review/summary: Great machine!review/text: I bought this machine after I purchased the Singer Esteem II (2273) machine from Target. The Singer machine was SO frustrating; the bobbin would tangle and jam after every single time I would stop/start sewing again so the machine would have to be re-threaded every time. This Brother machine is fantastic and has so many more features. It is also much quieter than the Singer machine. So far I have worked on two projects and have not had a single issue. I'm excited to get into some of the different features, and I am SO happy I decided to give this one a try. Luckily Target took back the SInger machine with no problems. I would highly recommend this machine to anyone!
