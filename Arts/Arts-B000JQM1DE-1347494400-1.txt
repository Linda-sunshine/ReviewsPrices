review/summary: Great for a beginner like me!review/text: OK, let me first say that this is my first sewing machine. I decided on this one after a lot of research, and WOW am I happy.I read all of the reviews on Amazon before I purchased it so I was aware of the jamming issues some users have experienced. I too had a jamming problem- several test stitches went fine, even fancy ones with the N foot. When I switched back to the J foot, all of the sudden the machine jammed and I was getting E6 errors. I reset the bobbin to make sure it was wound the right direction. Everything looked OK. I tried again. and again, and again, until FINALLY I noticed that it wasn't the bobbin at all! The threading through the free arm had come off completely, and I needed to rethread the top. The second I started sewing again everything looked and felt right, and I was back on track.Things I love about this machine: It's lightweight and quiet, the controls are easy to use and read, and I like the little sticker reminders for proper threading. I like that it comes with a big table for larger projects, and I really like that there's a super bright LED lighting up the work area. Oh, also, I like the "speed limiter" function. There's a slider that sets the "top speed" for the machine so if you have a lead foot you don't accidentally go too fast and mess up your project.I started using it yesterday, and other than being surprised about the top thread coming off at all, As a brand new sewing enthusiast, I'm very impressed and pleased. I was up and running a few minutes after getting it out of the box. I'm so excited to start on all of my projects!
