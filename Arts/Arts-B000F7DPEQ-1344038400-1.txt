review/summary: Brother XL2600i Sewing Machinereview/text: This sewing machine is fantastic. I was able to teach myself how to use it after a very short period of time (having no prior sewing machine experience). Now I have been able to make clothing and other sewn items. This machine is extremely easy to use and is great for a beginner. I highly recommend this machine if you have little to no experience with sewing machines and don't want to spend a ton of money.
