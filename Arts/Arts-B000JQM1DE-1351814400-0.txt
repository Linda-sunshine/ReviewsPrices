review/summary: Sew like dream!review/text: My previous machine was Brother's just under $100 beginners' machine. I wanted my new machine to have 1) more speed control and 2) more stitches 3) more pressure feet. After researching candidates came down to Singer, Janome and this machine. Both Singer and Janome are more expensive and noisier. I bought this at $159 (MSP was over $400).Pros: What a difference does $60 ($300) make! I spend most of my sewing time for sewing, not ripping stitches for re-dos that I used to do. The speed control is night and day! And it's really quiet. I often sew throughout the night without disturbing my husband who sleeps in the next room.I haven't tried all the stitches but am very happy with them.It came with 8 0r 9 pressure feet, including walker foot! These feet cost over $100.Cons: Automatic needle threader is no so automatic. I may get better at it if I get a tutor. Plastic button hole pressure foot seems too wimpy.Overall: I'm giving 5 stars even with two cons. Those two are so minor to me. If these two are the issue you want to resolved with your next machine, don't buy this machine. For a price you pay, I believe this is the best deal in the market.
