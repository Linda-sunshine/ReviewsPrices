review/summary: Serger is fantastic!review/text: Thank you so much for the prompt, well packaged delivery of my Brother 1034D serger! All of the included accessories are amazing and the instructional dvd was a life savers, as I am definitely an auditory learner. I am a member of a THREADS OF LOVE sewing group, and we sew burial gowns for infants who die prematurely. The serger's rolled hem is beautiful and makes me proud to add my part.Thanks again for your excellent service and product!
