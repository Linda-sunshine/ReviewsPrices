review/summary: I love this serger!review/text: I purchased this serger and I love it! I recommend watching the video to understand the basics of threading and serging. A bonus to buying a serger in a store is that you get free lessons, so when buying online you do not. I was able to pay a small amount to get a private lesson at a local sewing shop. Which still came in way cheaper than buying a serger at a store. So far, so good!
