review/summary: Love this machinereview/text: I am a novice sewer and finally killed my first 80 dollar singer. I wanted a middle of the road quality replacement. This one has been a fabulous machine, sews quickly and efficiently, come with tons of extras, most of which I haven't even tried yet. The automatic threader is more work than it's worth I think but perhaps it will become easier as I learn the machine for now it's easier just to thread the machine without it. So far so good.
