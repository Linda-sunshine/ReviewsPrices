review/summary: So far, so great!review/text: I just got this machine in the mail last week. So far I am very glad I purchased this machine, even though I was unsure about the machine's quality while researching what machine to buy (since this machine has mixed reviews). I usually do quilting projects, so this machine is perfect (it even comes with a quilt guide). The bobbin winder is very efficient and easy to use. The machine sounds great when sewing and comes with many accessories. The quality of the stitches are also very good, even when working with many layers of fabric and thick denim. This machine has everything I want, but at an extremely affordable price. I would definitely recommend it!
