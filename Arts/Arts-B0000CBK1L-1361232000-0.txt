review/summary: Completely satisfiedreview/text: This was a birthday present for my daughter. She took up sewing as a hobby and had really wanted a serger to do more things. I have no idea how this works. She does the demonstration and is ecstatic about owning one. Me I'm ecstatic knowing how much she loves and uses it.
