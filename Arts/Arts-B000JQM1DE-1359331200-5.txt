review/summary: Works greatreview/text: This is the first sewing machine I've used, and I bought it because I felt like it was the best quality for the price. So far, it's worked great for sewing some simple curtains. The automatic threading is very nice and easy to use. I feel like they made this sewing machine with beginners in mind (as it is very easy to set up and use for the first time) but it looks like it won't have problems with bigger projects either.
