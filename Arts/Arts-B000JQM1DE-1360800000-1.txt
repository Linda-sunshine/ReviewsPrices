review/summary: Second project and I have to bring to service centerreview/text: Purchased this machine in Nov 2012. I am new to sewing and there were great features, easy to thread and seemed to be perfect for my beginner projects. I started my second project and as soon I began to sew, it started as if it was in reverse and gave me an error 6 code. I cleaned the bobbin case, changed the needle, looked for any loose thread (as that was supposed to be the problem) and alas, still reverse, E6. Called customer service to see if there were any other areas I should check and it needs to go to service center. Disappointed. Hopefully, it's a quick fix and I can get back to it quickly.
