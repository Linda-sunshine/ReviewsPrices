review/summary: a beginnerreview/text: So, I would consider myself pretty much a beginner using sewing machines. This past summer I started learning on my grandmother's old Kenmore. Features about this machine that I love now that I have it are: well, for one all the stich choices, the needle threading feature (so nice!), and the forward and backward automatic button. I give the machine 5 stars because it comes with all the accessories I think would ever need, but I don't really like the case if you can even call it that... it is really more like a hard plastic cover/lid (can't really store anything in it... not even the extension for the table), but it really is a great machine, and the instructions are very easy to read and follow.
