review/summary: Brothers sewing machinereview/text: Great machine for the money. Love the needle self threading feature. Love the instructions and start up guide. Easy to understand and easy to operate. Did see some tension issues, but it could have been from the type of material and stitch that was chosen. I wish it had a case for keeping the bobbins organized, but I guess for the price, I am not going to get everything.
