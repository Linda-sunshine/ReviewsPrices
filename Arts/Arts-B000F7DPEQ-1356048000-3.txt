review/summary: great beginner machinereview/text: read lots of reviews and finally made the purchase! I was looking for a good simple to use, low frustration machine for my 9yo daughter. This is it. I personally own embroidery machine, sergers, computerized machines etc. I wanted her to have her own. Out of the box, set up and 20 minutes later she was sewing herself. Very easy and no problems so far. have had it 1 yr. good little first machine!
