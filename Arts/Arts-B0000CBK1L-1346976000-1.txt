review/summary: 3+ years & going strongreview/text: I bought this serger 3 1/2 years ago and it still works great. I use it several times a week. Keep it clean, and oil it regularly. I used it right out of the box, never having touched a serger before, using only the included instruction book to figure it out. Great deal especially if you make a lot of clothing (which I do, both personal use & to sell.)
