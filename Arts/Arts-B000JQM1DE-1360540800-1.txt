review/summary: Great Price for this machinereview/text: I am a novice seamstress with a desire to someday be an "experienced seamstress". I have an older model singer sewing machine that is as tough as nails and can sew through anything but as I am getting older - was finding it more and more difficult to see to thread the needle. So I was on a mission to find one with automatic threader that was easy to use. What I got was much more. This machine sews like a dream. I love the adjustable speed controller and the stop and start button on the front. I have made several outfits and quilts so far without any problems. The only problem was when I didn't thread the bobbin correctly and it jammed up. But that was completely user error.I will say that the better quality threads seem easier to work with. So far I have no complaints and absolutely LOVE my new machine.
