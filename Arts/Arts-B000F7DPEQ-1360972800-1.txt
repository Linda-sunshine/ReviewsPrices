review/summary: Terrific Machine!!review/text: I am very happy with this machine. It is a real &#34;powerhouse&#34; for the price. I have been using it as a take along machine to work on a church quilting ministry (making quilts for the wounded warriors in military hospitals and the Fisher House). It is light weight and easy to use. I have been sewing for 50 years and have used Singer, Kenmore and Phaff. This machine sews as well as all of those. I have not had any tension probems. The bobbin is easy to fill and insert. The stitch selection are all stitches that I will use in the future. I recommend this machine for anyone from a beginner to a veteran sewer.
