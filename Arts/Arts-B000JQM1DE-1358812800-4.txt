review/summary: Great for a beginnerreview/text: I love this sewing machine! I am a beginner sewer, but decided on this machine after reading the great reviews it received. So glad I did. I took to an introduction to sewing class last week (and took this machine with me) and even the instructor (a long-time seamstress) commented on how nice it is for the money and how well the machine runs. Originally, I went to a craft store and purchased a $120 model from another big-name brand, but quickly returned it after reading the poor reviews it got online. Good thing I did--another person in my sewing class was using a machine just like the one I returned and it jammed on her about five times during our two-hour class. That would be so frustrating for a beginner sewer. Trust me, it's worth the money to spent just a bit more to get a nice model like this one from a trusted name.
