review/summary: Lovereview/text: I'm 50+ yr old woman that has never own a sewing machine before. I read a lot of reviews on several machines before I decided on this one. Comes with instructions on the basic set up ( bobbins, tension and threading needle). I had no problem with setting up this sewing machine. I have made 3 sets of curtains ( basic) and hemmed a pair of jeans for my husband . Working on a quilt now.
