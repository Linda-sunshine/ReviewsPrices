review/summary: Great for beginner with enough extras to grow with.review/text: I have been using this for about 2 months. I am a beginner sewer in every sense of the word. I wanted to learn to sew and eventually quilt. I didn't have enough money for the big name sewers quilters...(you know who they are..lol) so my choices were limited...so it was a search for the most bang for my buck...and this one mostly got great reviews and came with more accessories than most and price is unbeatable with free shipping. Now that being said...I'm not expecting this machine to hold up for decades like the 1000+ $$$$ machines...but so far I am more than thrilled with what I got for the price.It sews great, easy to use, easy to tread, has more than enough stitches...although an alphabetical stitch should have been included..but I'm nitpicking.Its a dream to take to quilting class its so light and great to learn the basics of sewing and quilting.I know there are several schools of thought on how much machine to purchase just starting out....some say to get best you can afford from a &lt;real> brand...and other say start with a lower priced beginner model and upgrade later....well all I can say is the &lt;real brand> sewer quilter I wanted was almost 8000 $$$ and there was no way I was going to spend that until I felt this was something I really enjoyed and really learned all I could about the craft...so the CS6000i fit my bill perfectly.I'm sure I will eventually out grow this machine as a Quilting machine...because the throat IS small as others have said.....but I plan on keeping it around for sewing projects and piecing squares as it works perfectly for....and in a few years I'll spring for the &lt;real> brand with a quilting frame...but for now it has been a great buy and an exciting journey learning to be creative and artistic.
