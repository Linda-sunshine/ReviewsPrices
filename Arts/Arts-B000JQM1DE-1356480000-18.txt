review/summary: Great machine!review/text: I used my new Brother CS6000i to make several quilts over the past couple of weeks. It worked like a charm! The settings are so easy to use, and my poor old eyes really appreciated the self-threader.My only complaint is the throat of the machine is really too narrow to do much quilting. I made crib sized quilts and it was a big struggle trying to pass the material through the narrowish throat. Other than that, I love the machine.For regular sewing it is perfect!
