review/summary: Read the manual first!review/text: After a long debate on whether i wanted to spend more money than I could perhaps really afford on a very nice sewing machine, or simply buy a less expensive one and hope it lasted, I ended up opting for the latter and choosing this option.The wide variety of stitches works very well, and the zig-zag stitch using two spools of thread is now my go-to stitch for hemming everything!As some people have mentioned, it does have a tendency to get jammed or tangled. But, this was never something that I couldn't fix without reading the manual carefully, and as often as not when I was fixing it, I realized that the problem had been created because I didn't read the manual carefully the first time.The other hesitation I have is that I'm not sure how heavy-duty it is - I've categorically refused to allow friends and roommates to attempt to use it to hem their jeans, but it's hemmed dress pants and gone through 4+ layers of cotton for dresses or quilts just fine.So, if you're looking for something super easy to use, this isn't the best machine for you. But, if you're technically inclined and have never hesitated to reference users' manuals, you'll do just fine with this!
