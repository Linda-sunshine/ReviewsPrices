review/summary: Great for a beginnerreview/text: I'm a beginner and just started sewing but wanted a machine that would last me a while before I upgrade in the future. The critical reviews seem to center around the weak light. I just purchased my machine two weeks ago and I think there may have been an improvement done to it because the light is really bright. My eyes don't work well under poor lighting but I had no problem working with it. This machine is easy to use. I don't like reading manuals but even the instruction manual was well-written and clear. I highly recommend it!
