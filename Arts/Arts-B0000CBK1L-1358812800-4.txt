review/summary: Great for a first timerreview/text: Shipped in record time. Arrived THREADED! I immediately broke something (user error) but was able to fix it in 5 minutes after looking it up in the manual's table of contents. No idea how involved I'll get with this but, straight out of the box I am serging with ease.
