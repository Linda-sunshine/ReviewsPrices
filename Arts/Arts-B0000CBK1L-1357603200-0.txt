review/summary: Love My Serger!review/text: I love this serger! This is my very first one and the cd/videos were very helpful! I can now thread my machine alone, thanks to colored guides on the machine. It seemed intimidating at first but it's a great one! I've had it over a year now and have never had any problems. I recommend it to everyone, beginners on up =)
