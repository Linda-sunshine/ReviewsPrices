review/summary: So easy for a beginner like mereview/text: I was so excited to get my sewing machine and see all the great goodies it comes with (so many different presser feet! One day when I get some more experience, maybe I get to use them all). I've never used a sewing machine before, so I was a bit nervous to use it. But the instructions couldn't be clearer, and it seems like the machine basically does everything for you. I'm especially happy that I didn't need to use a foot peddle, and I can set a steady speed without relying in my over-reactive foot. I just sewed my first dress this weekend, and it was so easy to do and turned out marvelously!
