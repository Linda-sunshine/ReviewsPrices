review/summary: Has special needsreview/text: The tension does bunch, but if you sew for a couple of inches then go back a few stitches and then continue sewing, that resolves it (I find). I bought it because the biggest complaint from others was that the needle threader did not work. Mine works, but it is nothing like the diagram in the instructions. You just kind of have to figure it out. I cannot explain it and here there is no way to draw a diagram.Another thing is, you have to carefully wind bobbins according to instructions. When a bobbin is more than half empty, this seems to jam the machine as well. Loading a freshly wound bobbin seems to prevent jams and bunching.Cheap thread shreds and breaks and may cause other problems. Use high quality thread and read the instructions very carefully. Will update when I have done more sewing.
