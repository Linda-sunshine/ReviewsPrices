review/summary: Brother 1034D Sergerreview/text: This product was delivered to me on time about 5 hours ago. I've watched the video and reviewed the instruction book. I put my serger cone threads on it and started some practice sewing. So far, the stitch is better than my fancy machine with all the coverlock and chain stitches that I never use. This is exactly what I wanted. I love it! And the price is great!
