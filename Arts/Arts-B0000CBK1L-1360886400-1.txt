review/summary: A Pleasurereview/text: I enjoy using this machine to put together the tops of quilts with. I am not an expert in sewing and this allows me to have some creativity with sewing knowing that the stitches sewn will not come apart.I found it easy to thread and I have had it for years without having to do any maintenance on it. I am very well pleased with the ease of use.
