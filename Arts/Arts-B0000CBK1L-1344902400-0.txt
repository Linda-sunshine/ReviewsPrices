review/summary: Brother, 4 thread sergerreview/text: This is an average machine, the threading is not "lay-in", but neither is it imposssible. Need to be sure to change to cone type thread for good thread feed, and to thread by "the number". Finished stitch is adequate and will serve for finishing seams.
