review/summary: A dream come truereview/text: I bought this machine to replace the one I had been using on and off for 20 years. I chose it based on the user reviews, the performance ratings, and the fact that the cost was more than reasonable. I was not disappointed in the least. This machine is awesome! SO easy to use. No need to read long winded manuals. It basically does everything for you. The stitching is beautiful. I LOVE the speed control dial, and the many different fancy stitches you can choose from. The LCD screen tells you exactly what foot you need to use for each stitch, and automatically sets the stitch length and width for you. My projects turned out absolutely beautiful, and I was so proud. The only cons about this machine are: the LCD screen is often difficult to see, the sewing area is not near as bright as claimed, and the plate that marks the width of the stitch you want to make is poorly marked, so I have learned to use the presser foot to determine the width for myself. I am happy with my purchase overall!
