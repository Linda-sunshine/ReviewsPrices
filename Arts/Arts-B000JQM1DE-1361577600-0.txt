review/summary: LOVE THIS MACHINEreview/text: I've had this machine for over 2 years and I still LOVE it! I was really concerned that It wasn't going to be good quality because the price was so low, but with all the accessories I couldn't resist trying it and I am so glad I did. I love the quilting table! I have used this machine for sewing dresses but I am mostly a quilter and love that it can handle sewing AND quilting my quilts. I have 2 pieces of advice for anyone buying this machine.1) It is picky about bobbins. Make sure you use ONLY the bobbins that come with the machine or order some from brother. I only use the plastic ones. I think metal is too heavy for the machine or doesn't have the appropriate curvature. Either way, do yourself a favor and only use brother bobbins.2) It does not come with a true 1/4" foot. I put a little mark on the foot that is slightly larger than the 1/4 and sew to that mark. If you really need a 1/4 then you would need to purchase that.My only frustration with the machine is that it doesn't wind bobbins as full as I would like. I wish I could get more thread on the bobbin so I didn't have to stop to change it as often, but that is something I am willing to work with. I really enjoy the three speeds since my sister sews on the machine at times and likes it at medium, and my niece sometimes likes to sew and I can put it on slow. Putting in a new bobbin is a breeze and threading is super simple. It is light weight and the handle makes it super easy to move off my sewing table when I need to use the space for something else. The cover is also great for when I need to take it with me. I have only used a few of the fancy stitches but they always come out beautifully with no missed stitches.My mom has a babylock that was over $1000 and the only feature her machine has that mine doesn't is a button to cut the thread. Her machine also requires more cleaning or it gets fussy, and mine never gets that kind of build up.
