review/summary: Not Worth Your Moneyreview/text: I received this machine as a gift and immediately started sewing. I've sewn purses and bags with this machine with hardly any trouble. I've recycled jeans and used denim over and over. While I was finishing a denim bag today, barely a month after receiving it, something on the inside of my machine snapped and started grinding. The needle no longer moves and the machine will barely turn on. I'm sorry for my mom, who purchased it for me for Christmas, as it isn't worth what she paid for it, never mind all of accessories and material that we both purchased. All of this after Amazon sent out the machine and it was stolen by UPS! Buyer Beware!!!
