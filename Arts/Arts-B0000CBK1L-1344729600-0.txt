review/summary: brother 1034d serger, great bargain, great machine!review/text: This is my very first serger and I was pleasantly surprised on how easy it was to thread! I was able to thread all four spools of thread the very first time I tried! I watched the helpful instruction video that came with the serger and was serging within one hour! this machine leaves beautiful stitches and it very user friendly! I highly recommend this serger, especially for first time users! you won't go wrong with brothers easily understood instructions and videos! I was able to make my project in half the time with my serger! I wish I bought this year's ago! it would have saved so much time! the brother 1034 d is a excellent product for a very affordable price! why pay more? everything you need is in this serger! I am a very happy customer!
