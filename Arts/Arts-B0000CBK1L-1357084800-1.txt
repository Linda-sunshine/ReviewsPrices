review/summary: Not as scary as I thought!!review/text: This is my first serger. I know there are all kinds of fancy things it's supposed to do but I just needed the over locker part so I can't speak on the rest. I will say that the threading was the most scary thing for me before I got this-it just looked so intimidating! This machine however is extremely easy to thread & I had no problems at all even though I've never even seen one of these on video, let alone in person! Just take your time & read thru the directions bc after that you'll never have to look at them again-it's that easy!! One caution is that you REALLY do HAVE TO thread it in the right order, they aren't just saying that bc it will rip a hole in time & space ;-) I found it a pain to have to unthread all the way to where you have to rethread & thread it all back again but they are all like that I think. The motor is quiet & it doesn't jump around all over the place. It's very smooth & gentle to your fabrics. My only issue is that I haven't found the thing you are supposed to use as a guide to line up your fabric properly but maybe that just comes with experience? Oh also the top cutting knife is great! Even on my delicate fabrics it never pulls or anything like that-also when you don't want it, it's super easy to turn off, just flip the switch! Over all I really love my machine-and would definitely (& actually have done) recommend it!
