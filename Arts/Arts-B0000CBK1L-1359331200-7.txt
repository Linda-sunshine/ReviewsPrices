review/summary: Works right out of the boxreview/text: I haven't had this machine very long. I gave it 5 stars because, right out of the box, I could use it. The DVD's are great. I have another (expensive) serger that has been a thorn in my side from day one. I purchased this serger because of the reviews I have read. I've done more on this machine in the two days I've spent learning it, than I did in the 7 years I owned the other one. This one is not fancy, it does not have all of the bells and whistles, but I am delighted with it. And, Amazon had the absolute best price around for this machine. I checked.
