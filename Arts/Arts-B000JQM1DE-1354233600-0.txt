review/summary: It is not a good productreview/text: I bught it for some christmas projects. First problem was thread knotting up around the bobbin. That was it! I spent hours trying to get the machine to sew right with no luck. It has been packed up and returned. I don't have time to spend trying to figure this kind of stuff out. It should work right out of the box. I will find something that is not made of plastic. Don't bother with this machine.
