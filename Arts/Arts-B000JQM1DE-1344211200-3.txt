review/summary: Not very nicereview/text: I would give this item a zero-stars. I've kept it packaged all this while (having purchased it in Nov 2011 with the black friday deals) and only now got into a stable housing situation. So I went to unpack it this morning and found the actual wall-plug is missing! The power cord! Am trying to figure out how to get one for it. Very frustrating to pay $154 for this item and not being able to use it.
