review/summary: Brother Serger & Missing itemsreview/text: I opened and set up my new Brother Serger and found most of the accessory package missing. I like the machine, but find it very hard to thread without the tweezers.I'm finding it difficult to contact Brother or Amazon to have the missing items replaced without sending the entire machine back for a refund and having to purchase another one.The Brother website states a response in one business day, however the email I just received said I can't expect a response for another week due to their large volume of emails after Thanksgiving. Amazon site says contact the manufacture for missing parts, or their return department. The return department doesn't have a tab for missing items, only a way to return an item. Just a little frustrating.I'm hoping this problem can be resolved quickly as is usually the case when purchasing through Amazon.UPDATE - After finally being able to contact the Brother Customer Service they required copies of my original receipt, not a problem, however the person on the phone was not very pleasant. This week I received a small box in the mail with several of the missing items, but not all of them. I've tried contacting Brother (again), sent another email letter with receipts and am hopeful that the rest of the missing parts will be mailed. If not, I plan on returning the machine and having Amazon replace it with a new one. This is the first time I've had problems dealing with items ordered through Amazon.
