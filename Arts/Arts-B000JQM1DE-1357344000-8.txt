review/summary: Great giftreview/text: I researched for a good quality machine for a beginner sewer and this model came up repeatedly. The price was GREAT and made it worth the risk to purchase for our 13-year old granddaughter. She absolutely LOVED it and grandma learned how to thread, fill bobbins, stitch the various stitches right along with her. It's a great little machine and up to many large projects. I was impressed with the simplicity and the quality stitching.
