review/summary: Mission Accomplishedreview/text: She hinted earlier in the year about replacing her old sewing machine, so I got her this one for Christmas. Since i know anything about them, I did a lot of homework, rolled the dice, and hope that she would be happy. She is very picky about gifts in general that this was a far reach for me. But, here it is, a day after Christmas and she is working this machine like no tomorrow. She is telling me with all of this sewing jargon jumping with joy.So, I'll call it, mission accomplished-job well done.
