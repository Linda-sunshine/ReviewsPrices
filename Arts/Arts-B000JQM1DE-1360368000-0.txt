review/summary: Sews like a dream!review/text: I absolutely love sewing since I got this machine. I've always liked sewing but also used to feel frustrated with it a lot. Not any more! :) Before I bought it I was a little worried since I've never had a computerized machine before. I also thought it had more stitches than I needed, but I actually love and use quite a few of them. But even if you use it for the basics, it works like a charm. Glides though fabric like butter, never causes any issues with the thread... I couldn't be happier! Well worth every penny!
