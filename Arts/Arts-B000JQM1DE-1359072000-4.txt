review/summary: new machinereview/text: My decades-old Singer finally died. I needed a quick replacement, but hated to go through the search process and read all the reviews. My husband quickly found this one online; I read the reviews and ordered it. I have to say that I'm very pleased with it! I still keep my manual close at hand, but am needing to use it less frequently, after a couple of weeks. The stitch choices are visible and easy to select. It was a little tricky to get used to the needle threader, but I am SO thankful for that feature! (Hint....it only takes the thread a fraction of an inch through the needle; use your seam ripper point to pull the loop farther out.) I like the cutting blade for sewing threads, on the side of the machine, which assures that the needle won't come unthreaded, since it cuts thread at length sufficient to keep that from happening. It's taken a little time to get used to the foot control (different shape and pressure than my previous one) and the presser foot lifter (on the side of the needle, instead of behind it), but I'm getting the hang of it. I really like the push button to raise and lower the needle. I wouldn't have expected that to be so helpful! I've only used four stitch choices, so far, but I've found them all to work well, and changing presser feet is easy (release button is good!) I've used this for both regular and lighter weight fabrics, and so far, I like it very much.
