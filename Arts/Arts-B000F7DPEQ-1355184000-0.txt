review/summary: Strongly recommend this sewing machine for first timersreview/text: I wanted to start sewing because I am a shorty and spend a lot of money on the taylor. I have barely got this sewing machine a couple a weeks ago and so far I cannot ask for anything more. I'm amazed on how uncomplicated this sewing machine is. It is basic and straight to the point which is perfect for a first timer like me. Although it looks inexpensive, it is a good quality. I so far made a pillowcase and since Christmas is around the corner I am going to sew more pillowcases for the family as presents. I have not yet been brave enough to hem my own pants but will do it eventually. Overall, best buy and a very good investment. I recommend this sewing machine for first timers or for experienced seamstress that want a good quality basic sewing machine that wont break your bank.
