review/summary: Nice machine for the pricereview/text: My wife and daughter like the Brother CS6000i. It's been easy to use and not given them much trouble. There have been tension issues - but this is a first machine and some of the problems are likely more due to being new to sewing. We are very pleased with this Brother. It's been an excellent starter machine.
