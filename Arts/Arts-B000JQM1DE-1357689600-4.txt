review/summary: Love it! Easy to use does everything I want it to do.review/text: I love this sewing machine. It is well worth the cost. It does so much more than other sewing machines at the same price point. It is easy to use and the instruction manual is well written and very helpful. There are an incredible amount of stitches and features. I have been sewing on it for 6 months now, making a wide variety of items from clothing, to quilts, to dolls, and home decode. I have yet to run into a pattern this machine can not handle. I love it!
