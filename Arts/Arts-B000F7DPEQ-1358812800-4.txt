review/summary: Nice machine for the money.review/text: I chose this rating based on my adult daughter's experience with it. She received it from me for Christmas. This is her first machine and she loves it! The set up was easy. Winding the 1st bobbin, threading the macine, all went smoothly. I chose this model because it has the capacity to grow with the beginning sewer as she gains experience and confidence.
