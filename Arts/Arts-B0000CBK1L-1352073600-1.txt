review/summary: This is a great machine.review/text: I'm a total newb when it comes to sewing, but this serger is fantastic. It's very powerful, goes through multiple layers of fabric, is easy (enough) to thread, and just works. So far, I've sewn a couple hundred yards of seams, every thing from fine cotton shirts to velour upholstery fabric without issues.A quick search on you tube found more than enough good instructions on threading the machine, much better than the included instructions. By the third time I've changed thread spools, I can now thread it without needing a reference. There's also good videos on proper tension adjustment. Once set, this machine shines.The cutting blade is very sharp. You need to watch that, a small mistake with fabric bunching under the foot will slice giant holes in your project, I'm so glad the blade has an easy way to turn the cutting feature off.I haven't used the differential feed much, other than testing to understand why it's there. The free arm feature is great for cuffs, and other small items.If I had any issues, it would be the lack of a proper cover stitch, but I like this machine so much, I'm considering purchasing a 2340cv to make up for that omission.Thank you Brother, this is a very solid machine, and it's available at a great price.
