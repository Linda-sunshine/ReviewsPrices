review/summary: Great machinereview/text: I used to sew a lot when I was younger, but just have not found the time. I gave my sewing machine away and finally decided to get one for the occasional time I need one. I looked at this one on-line and it got great reviews...and here is another one! This does everything you need for basic sewing...and beyond. I love mine!!!
