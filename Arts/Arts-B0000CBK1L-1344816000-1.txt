review/summary: Fantastic Machine!review/text: I took it out of the box and set it up. Read the instructions, so easy to thread! Started sewing immediately, and I have not had to adjust the tension once! I was using an old, old serger and spending more time adjusting tension than sewing, and after spazing out, we just ordered this one hoping it would be better. I LOVE it.I am not sure what that negative review was doing wrong, but if you don't thread the loopers in the correct order the threads break - which is true on any machine. I have not had this problem.I have had it for a couple of months now and a few projects, including a dress with 5 yards of material. This machine delivers! It is very simple to use, easy to thread, and fast.The only thing to know is the width of the stitches is not small, like on purchased clothing. Which is only important if you want to do fashion industry sewing.I think it is a great machine and I am very please with how easy it is to use and thread. It is a friendly machine!
