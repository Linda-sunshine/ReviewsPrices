review/summary: This Senior can now sew the fancy stitches!review/text: I like this machine a whole lot! It took me a little time to get the tension right. I had to do a second bobbin. Guess I didn't get it right the first time. But now it is purring like a kitty and sewing like a dream. I love the automatic features. Just made some napkins and sewed # 57 around the center panel. So pretty! Think this will be a great little machine.
