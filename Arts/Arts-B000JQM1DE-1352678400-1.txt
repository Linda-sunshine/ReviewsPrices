review/summary: So Pleased With It, Purchased Two!review/text: After much research (and thanks to everyone for their previous comments - it helped tremendously), I purchased this for my daughter last Christmas (2011). She is a beginner to sewing, so I helped her thread the machine and gave her some pointers to get started. I was very impressed by the ease of threading the machine, bobbin winding, drop in bobbin convenience, stitch settings, tension control, and option to use the stop/start by control on machine or foot pedal (I'm old school so like the foot pedal I'm used to - but my daughter likes the stop/start control on the machine). The needle up/needle down selection is a great feature. We did a first project together (tote bag) and this machine sews beautifully. When I needed to replace my old Kenmore that just bit the dust, I purchased this same model because of its many features and great performance. A great price for all that you get. This sewing machine is a winner!
