review/summary: What a nice sewing machine!review/text: The quick-start guide is great! You can literally start sewing right away because the tension is set just right. The accessories that come with the machine are great. Be sure to read your manual and change the foot according to what type of sewing you'll be doing. The blind hem-stitch attachment is wonderful! Never again will you have to struggle hemming a pair of pants. The feed dogs are amazing. You get a perfect straight stitch every time. I did hire a lady to give me sewing lessons and she showed me how to use the accessories; however, you'd be fine just reading the instruction booklet.
