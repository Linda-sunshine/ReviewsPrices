review/summary: Great experience for first time serger ownerreview/text: Since using my new serger, I have been sewing even more than I expected. The Brother 1034-D has been a great purchase. The price was appropriate. The directions were a little confusing at first, however, using the CD's that were included answered many questions. There are also tutorials on line if you need more assistance. Very pleased with my purchase. I would highly reccomend it to anyone.
