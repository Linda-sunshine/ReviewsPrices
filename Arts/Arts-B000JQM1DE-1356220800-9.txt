review/summary: Easy to use and many features!review/text: I haven't used a sewing machine for many, many years so it was a little intimidating first opening the box, but set up was a breeze (easy to follow instructions) and before I knew it I was sewing again! Machine runs beautifully and I love all the stitch options! I'm looking forward to using my machine for many years.
