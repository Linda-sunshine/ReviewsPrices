review/summary: So far so good!review/text: After reading all of the other reviews, I was a little worried by the "1 star" ratings. But then I read all the "5 star" ratings, which made me feel better about ordering this machine (basically, follow the directions). I am a beginner sewer, who is trading in my 1954 antique 2-function machine for this new Brother.I've had the Sew Advance for about 3 weeks now. The tension adjustments are easy (just always test on a fabric scrap). Buttonholes--I'm learning & practicing a lot :) And basically I am just following the instructions carefully to avoid the bobbin tangling issue (which -I believe- occurs when people put the bobbin in the wrong way. there is even a sticker on the machine next to the bobbin case which has arrows illustrating the threading directions).I didn't think that a fancy electronic machine would be good for a first-timer. So far, I am really happy with this machine, and am loving everything about it.
