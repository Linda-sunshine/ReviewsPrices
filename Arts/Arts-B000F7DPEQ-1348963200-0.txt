review/summary: what more can you ask for in a $75 sewing machine?review/text: Its a GREAT deal. it comes with a foot pedal, its easy to use. I have NEVER used a sewing machine before and I sewed my first pillow with this in less than a hour of opening the box. Instructions are very good also, especially if you are a first time sewer. The "automatic" needle threader is awsome. it dose not thread it "itself" however it has a arm that drops down and pulls the thread threw the needle with you manual moving the arm. either or way it makes threading the needle fast.
