review/summary: Died after 2 and a half baby quilts!review/text: My husband bought this sewing machine for me two years ago. It was all love at first, the way a newbie loves, not knowing any better. :). This machine is perfect for a beginner but as I gained my sewing legs it quickly showed me it couldn't keep up. I was recently working on making my first ever baby quilts. I got through two and a half and it died. There was much grinding and death throws. I cleaned and re-threaded but still got the same dying motions and sound effects.Bottom line: if you plan to actually make this machine do some work, it's not the machine for you. Invest in your sanity and get something that can get the job done.If you're just learning and need something for small projects and fun, it's perfect for that.
