review/summary: Excited to start!review/text: I haven't done much with this machine yet, but from what I can tell I love it! For a beginner, the Brother XL2600I is perfect. There is a large selection of stitches, automatic button-hole, needle threader, etc.The only complaint I have is the sheet diagraming how to thread the upper and lower threads is a bit confusing. The pictures didn't help that much, and even the instruction booklet seemed a bit scattered. I ran into a lot of &#34;If your machine has _____ go to page __.&#34; Since I JUST bought the machine, I wasn't 100% sure if it had some of these things, so I would have to search the box for some features. All and all I got it threaded and working and I am happy with it. With all things like this, it takes some time to figure out and get use to. I look forward to future sewing projects!
