review/summary: Best Christmas Present Ever!!review/text: Bought this for my ,mom for Christmas since her died on her a few weeks before Christmas. She hasn't had alot of time to mess with it. But the time she did spend with it she said it is an amazing sewing machine. The stitches work great. There were some bad reviews about the tension and the stitches not working right. My mom said that alls she had to do was read the instructions and she didn't have any trouble with it at all. My mom is an experienced sewer as she makes alot of quilts and other things on her machines.
