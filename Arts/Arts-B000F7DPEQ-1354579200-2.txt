review/summary: Great for beginnersreview/text: I have only done very minor sewing with a needle and thread so I am basically a baby trying to drive a car when it comes to sewing machines. This thing is awesome and really easy to use. The instructions on threading etc. is very detailed...awesome for basic/beginner sewing projects.
