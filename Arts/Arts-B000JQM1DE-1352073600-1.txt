review/summary: A very pleasant surprisereview/text: I wasn't expecting anything this great for such a low price. . . even lower now, I see. . . but this machine is head and shoulders above my previous, much, much more expensive machine whose brand I shall not mention. My old one was always difficult to use, and when it developed a big problem I found that it could cost me up to $150 to fix it. At that point, I thought what the heck (oh and seeing the Project Runway contestants using Brother brand machines encouraged me) I'll try this very inexpensive Brother. It looks complicated but the directions are clear. Sewing is fun again!
