review/summary: Like a Smart car ;) to my Humvee (Bernina)review/text: Go ahead, buy this machine! I've been quilting for over 10 years, short-arm and long-arm...and really needed a lightweight machine to take to classes (my 153QE will sew through anything and last through the next ice age, but is heavy), and as a backup machine when my Bernina is getting its annual checkup.This machine and all of its attendant parts is an amazing bargain...just treat it gently. I sewed on the binding to a small art quilt last night (so, a total of 4 layers of fabric and a thin bat)...no problem whatsoever. I love the start-stop function...was curious about the drop-in bobbin feature (am used to Bernina's bottom-loading bobbin)...so this was a great way to test these features.The machine has a very nice hum to it, and so far is very well-behaved. One criticism in these reviews is true: you will need a task light nearby as the built-in light is very weak. Otherwise, I like this machine very much, will be piecing on it all weekend...just don't expect a workhorse for big heavy projects.Attention quilters, don't forget to order the 1/4 inch pressed foot when you order the machine...EVERYTHING else does indeed come in the box!
