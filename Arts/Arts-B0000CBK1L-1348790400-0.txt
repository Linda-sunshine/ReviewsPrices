review/summary: Perfect... if you read directionsreview/text: I bought this serger because I was working a lot with knits. I am new to serging but as a beginner I think this is a great machine. If you read and refer back to the directions it is easy to use and quick to adjust. There are pictures of different stitch issues and ways to solve them. Even though I had never used a serger before I was comfortable using it within a couple of hours and have since used it for knits and wovens, for gathering, rolled edges, and finishing seams. So far I have had no problems with it that couldn't be solved by referring back to the directions and making the recommended adjustments.
