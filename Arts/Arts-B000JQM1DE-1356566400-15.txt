review/summary: Great product, horrible deliveryreview/text: One month in and my fiancee absolutely loves this machine. It does everything she could hope for and the instructions leave no questions about how to do different patterns. The downside is not with the machine but with the way amazon ships the item. They use UPS who just randomly leave the package on the doorstep if nobody is home. It ruined the Christmas surprise as my fiancee got home first but it could have been worse, what if it had been damaged by weather or stolen. This does not seem like a good way to run a business to me.
