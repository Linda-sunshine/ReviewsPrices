review/summary: Worked one time, then continued to jam and break needles.review/text: I was very excited to finally get a serger and was more excited about all the rave reviews. When I got my serger, I followed directions and was able to use it fine and it was amazing. The next time I took it out of the box, it jammed and also broke off one of the two needles. Everytime after that It continued to jam and break needles. I took it over to a friend who is an expert in these matters and she concluded that the needle was hitting the bottom part of the machine as it went down which was why the needle has continued to break off and not work at all. I will have to call brother and see what my options are, I might have just gotten a defective machine =(
