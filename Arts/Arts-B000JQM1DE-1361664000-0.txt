review/summary: Disappointed - Buyer Bewarereview/text: After checking many reviews I decided to purchase this machine April 2012. Per the reviews, I was very careful with making certain to properly wind and use the correct size bobbin, install the bobbin correctly in the case, and thread the machine properly as the Brother brand is finicky on those points. All was well for a few months until the needle started "hanging up" and the wheel was stiff. The 1st Brother Authorized repair shop I contacted was not very helpful. They said to send it in to Brother and Brother told me to take it to the shop. I called and eventually took it to a shop that is nearly an hour away from home. It turns out the shop was able to repair my machine, but they informed me that the machine is only meant to be used a few times a year on light-weight fabrics. The repair they made was 100% covered since it is warrantied at 100% parts and labor within the 1st year, but after my purchase date in April 2013 Brother will only pay for parts. I was told that the repair they made on the machine would have cost about $200.00 and that it WILL break again. The repair person said that Brother is a good brand, but the machines you buy at Wal-Mart and Amazon are their lower end models and do not hold up to much sewing. As an added note: I bought my daughter an XL-2600i as a beginner sewing machine at the same time I bought mine. She hardly used it, has had experience sewing, and only used it under supervision - it broke too, a different part than mine, but, IMO should not have happened. Hers has been repaired as well, but same story - only meant for use 2-3 times/year with lightweight fabrics. I knew that buying an "inexpensive" machine was a gamble. Disappointed and wish these machines would have worked out better.
