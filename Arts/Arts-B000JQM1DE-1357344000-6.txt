review/summary: Alas, I got a lemonreview/text: Well, I'm sorry to join the few people who didn't love this machine, I really wanted to enjoy it. Mine didn't work properly out of the box and after a full half day of tinkering it is going back. I should mention I am ordering a replacement to give it another try, we'll see what happens.The problem:-My machine WOULD NOT produce a decent-looking stitch no matter what I did right out of the gate. I wound and re-wound the bobbin, threaded and re-threaded, replaced the needle and thread (although I used good quality Gutterman both times), adjusted the top tension up and down. I tried more than half a dozen stitches and none of them looked good. I am not a total novice but I did ask my friend with many many years sewing experience to help figure out what the issue was. We agreed it had to do with bobbin tension but since it's not adjustable, there is nothing to do...-I didn't find the light to be "super bright" as description states but rather adequate. The self-threader while simple is not awesome and worked maybe half the time.-Despite all the features, it does feel cheap. If you are really serious about sewing and plan to do either a lot of it or do heavy-duty projects, I would steer clear of this one.Good parts:-My best friend has this very same one and hers works beautifully and produces nice, professional-looking seams.-For the money the features are impressive (if they work).-Machine is light and the learning curve is not steep at all.
