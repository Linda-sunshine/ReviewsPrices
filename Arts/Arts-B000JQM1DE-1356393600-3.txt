review/summary: Great Replacement Sewing Machine-Great for Beginning Sewerreview/text: I recently learned how to sew, and since the machine I learned on was very basic, and well, cheap, it was time for a new one. My sewing teacher, who normally in favor of manual machines, recommended this one to me with very high regard. I found it very easy to setup and use right out of the box. The start/stop feature and backstitch controls are extremely helpful. I love this machine.
