review/summary: perfect for first time sewers and anything morereview/text: Perfect for those starting out and those who are a little more advanced. It was hard to thread at first but with the help of my husband we got it and it is easy now. (The book dirctions are poorly written). We also youtubed to help. Ive already made lots of things for gifts and my little one. It was worth the buy. Very easy to sew on this machine
