review/summary: New To Sewing!review/text: I am completely new to sewing. I purchased this sewing machine for myself because Ive always wanted to learn to sew. This sewing machine seemed like a great machine for a very small price....and from what I can tell...IT IS!! The owner's manual is very user friendly and I've also gotten alot of help with tutorials on this machine from watching YouTube videos. I have a feeling the Brother CS6000i is the perfect sewing machine for me!!
