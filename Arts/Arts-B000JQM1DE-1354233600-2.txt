review/summary: Too difficult to thread, feed dogs chew up material , jams up with no apparent reason.review/text: I did not use the machine much after it arrived. We were traveling and I did not have time. I have spent the last week trying to get the darn thing to work properly. I find that if you have any trouble seeing small things threading the needle and other frequent activites, is just too hard. I thought following directions by picture should be easy, however the picture is often unclear in that it does not match what I am looking at. My husband has repeatedly stepped in to help. He is a handly fellow and he too had trouble with it. . Using the operating manual trouble shooter section does not seem to help me as each action requires that one follows the pictures. For example getting the bobbin thread looped around a small z shape around to the left side is not easily done. If you guide the thread around the hook (or shaped station) it comes off and you have to repeat all of those problems involved in getting it threaded. . I sewed on the machine for an hour and found that the thread gets tangled in one or more places after brief periods of sewing. This requires stopping, unjamming and re threading everything again, none of which is simple. After dong everything suggested Iand still have the problem of jammed thread or feed dogs seiving up material getting jammed. I wish I had the singer I grew up sewing on. Wish I had kept it but gave in to a family member. I continued to buy Singers over the years. Then I did not sew for years because the kids were gone and I did not need to sew much. Now I would like to sew again. However if I can not work with this one I guess I will give up. I do not wish to spend a great deal of money , I just want a simple to use and effective machine.
