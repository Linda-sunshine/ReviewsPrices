review/summary: Incredible machine. Love.review/text: This sewing machine exceeds my expectations. I read reviews saying that it doesn't handle heavy fabrics well. My first project was to reupholster my outdoor patio set, which meant using heavy treated thread, and going through as many as six layers of heavy canvas fabric. I had to go slowly at the thickest parts, but the machine was a champ. No needles broke and the tension was miraculously fine, without adjusting it at all. I LOVE this machine, and can't wait to see what else I can create with it.
