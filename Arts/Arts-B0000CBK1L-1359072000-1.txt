review/summary: Great Sergerreview/text: I have been sewing since I was a kid (now 78 years young) but had never used or owned a serger. What a great machine. Wish one would have been in my sewing room all those years I made knit and other clothes for my three kids. This machine sews great, instructions are very easy to follow for threading, and the price is fantastic. The two videos that came with the machine are a big help. Can't wait to come up with items to serge on my machine.
