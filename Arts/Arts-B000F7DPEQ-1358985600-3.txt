review/summary: love itreview/text: I had checked on consumer reports to see who had a good rating for a sewing machine, and this was number 1. I have to tell you I am so happy with it, I am still learning all of the neat little stuff it will do, but the needle threader is wonderful... especially if you have eyes that are getting a little older... (SMILE) It sews beautifully, and I was so suprised that even with the major snow storm the east coast got hit with at the beginning of the year.. it was hear on time.. so qudos to amazon... I am so pleased. Thanks
