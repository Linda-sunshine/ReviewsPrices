review/summary: Brother 1034Dreview/text: Received this yesterday and wife already is pleased with this product. We also have a 6 thread serger and she was never happy with it. Just too complicated and additional tweaks needed to be done on numerous ocasions.Opened the box, looked at the DVD and went to work. Excellent DVD. Walmart had this product on their shelves and then it was gone. Typical big box store, had it today, gone tomorrow. Not going to carry anymore. This unit had the best reviews of any of the sergers in this line. Amazon was great, with price a few dollars less and free shipping. Had to wait about a week, but now that we have it, very pleased.Thanks Amazon!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CBK1L/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
