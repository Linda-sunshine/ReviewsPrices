review/summary: Daughter's First Sewing Machinereview/text: I selected this for my daughter's 18th birthday. She has always been crafty, and has used my old 1940's Singer for a number of years. With her moving off to a college dorm soon, we wanted something inexpensive, but versatile for her to take to college.It is fancy enough that she has room to grow, and simple enough that she is not overwhelmed with the settings or choices. She has goofed around with it, making silly things - but has also sewn a dress for a friend who needed a costume for San Japan!That the girls could sew their own costume with it, pleased them immensely!What more could a Mom want?!
