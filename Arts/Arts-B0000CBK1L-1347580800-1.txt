review/summary: Didn't workreview/text: I bought this serger because I read the reviews from other buyers. However, when I took it out straight from the box and turned it on, the serger light came on but when I pressed the serger foot to serge, nothing happened. I called Brothers customer service and she told me I could get it serviced at one of their locations. It was new and it already needed to be serviced. I don't think so. I just return it and request for a full refund.
