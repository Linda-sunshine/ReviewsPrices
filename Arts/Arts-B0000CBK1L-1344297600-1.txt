review/summary: Don't Buy the Brother 1034 D serger iti s junkreview/text: Yes, I know that paying $200 or less for a brand-new serger is should have been a warning.But supposedly it is a $400+ machine being sold cheaply by Amazon.This machine is cheaply made, feels like a kid's toy.It took me hours to get it to sew. It just would not chain.When I finally got it working it did a mediocre jopb with uneven stitches and gaps.I have had it for less than two months. I hate it.I sew nearly everyday. I am accomplished and experienced with sergers.The instruction book is as poorly written as the machine is cheap. The instructional DVD is incomplete.I found a video on YouTube that explained how to thread it. The author was just as frustrated as the rest of us with the instructions.It will chain about 5 inches and then one or all of the threads break.I know that this machine is threaded correctly.I live in Mexico and shipped it to my daughter and she brought it to me the last week of June.Visiting a dealer or sending it back is not an option.I have used it successfully only TWICE.Most of the time I am screaming and crying in rage.It is a piece of garbage and Brother should be ashamed.Don't be duped by the Brother name, they obviously have no shame.
