review/summary: Wonderful, lightweight, perfect for any sewerreview/text: I'm an intermediate sewer and wanted a machine that is more portable (i.e., lighter) and has more stitch options than my 30 year old Bernina. This was the perfect choice! It is very lightweight because it is made of plastic, but I don't feel like it will fall apart on me. I haven't had too many problems with it, and I love that I can sew without using a pedal! It locked up on me the other day because I was sewing 6 layers together, but I just had to turn it off and on again to make it start. It comes with a lot of extra feet, an expandable quilting arm, a hard case cover (which is super bulky), and other things. I've loved working with this machine, and look forward to learning more and using it more! Definitely would recommend this to others. I'll update this review if anything comes up (since I've only had it for a month).
