review/summary: Love it!!!review/text: I love my Brother 1034D!! I was so worried about having to thread it. It wasn't difficult at all. It came with an instruction manual, AND DVD's to help with everything. I was so surprised how easy it all made it. I highly recommend this Serger for beginners. I'd never even touched a Serger, and I figured it out. LOL It comes with two DVD's, one with ideas on different stitches you can do with your new Serger. It's awesome!
