review/summary: I waited a long time...review/text: Both to order this machine and to review it. I was disturbed by some of the other reviews. If you actually read the instructions and take the time to do what they say, you should have no problems. I really wish the machine was heavier though...it's a bit on the lightweight side. That's all I would change. Oh and I was missing one of the feet listed in the parts list.
