review/summary: Great Productreview/text: Its been 2 months since I bought this and it hasn't broken on me yet. I sometimes have trouble winding the bobbin but it is not frequent enough to bother me or my stitching.I wish the manual was a bit more detailed like how to adjust the tension on the machine. Fortunately, this model is fairly popular so a quick search on the internet provides not only the details you need but even some youtube-specific videos on how to use the machine.Hence, while I wasn't completely satisfied with the support that came in the box, the model's popularity online more than makes up for that lack of support.
