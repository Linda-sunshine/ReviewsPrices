review/summary: Sticker came offreview/text: We purchased this sewing machine for our daughter for Christmas. It arrived promptly and was well-packaged. However, when she removed the cardboard protecting the dial the packing tape started to tear the sticker off the dial. She was very careful about removing the tape as soon as she noticed the problem. Tape removed another portion of sticker elsewhere on the machine. We contacted the seller and they immediately sent us a second machine, which we have not yet received. But we are concerned that we will have the same problem. Has anyone else noticed this? The damage to the sticker makes it difficult to read the settings and will eventually cause the entire sticker to wear away.
