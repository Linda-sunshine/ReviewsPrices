review/summary: LOVE IT!review/text: I ordered it not long ago and it got to me very fast. I tried it out almost immediately. After playing around for a bit one of the threads broke, so to put my own on, I had to take some time to figure it out, but it is all on the machine and in the book, so was able to get it back to work fast again. It is my first time to use and own serger, but I do love it!!! It makes everything look so much more professional and I can't wait to find more projects to have an excuse to use it again and again. :) And of course eventually I need to learn what else it can do other than the regular finish and cut the edges. :)))
