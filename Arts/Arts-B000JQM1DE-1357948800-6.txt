review/summary: New to sewingreview/text: I am new to sewing, but this has been a nice introductory machine for me. Very easy to use for first timer, with good instructions. I am still trying to figure out the tension, though, as I have had some frustrations with dropped stitches. But that is probably just a matter of my being a beginner and needing to learn what tension to use with which fabrics.Nice lightweight machine, although I wish it came with a case, not just a &#34;cover&#34;.
