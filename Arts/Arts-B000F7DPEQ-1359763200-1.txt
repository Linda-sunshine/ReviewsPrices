review/summary: Wonderful wonderful sewing machinereview/text: I love doing my fabric arts and crafts projects on this sewing machine. It is easy to carry and seems durable when it comes to heavy fabric. I sewed a couple of thick corduroy pieces on this and it churned it out nicely. The only thing that I would change about this or any other sewing machine is that the bobbin never seems to hold enough thread. I wish that there would be a full size spool where the bobbin is, so that I don't have to keep threading it.
