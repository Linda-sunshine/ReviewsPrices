review/summary: Great productreview/text: I bought this machine for my Mom 8 months ago.My Mom uses it every single day (with few exceptions), sometimes several hours per day and it works great.Very simple to use. No problems at all.It is not a heavy duty sewing machine, but it works like one, except for very thick fabrics like Jeans.My Mom is very happy with it. I bough a second one for myself.I highly recommend this product.
