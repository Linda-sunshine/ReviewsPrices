review/summary: great product for the pricereview/text: i've been wanting a serger for a while and i'm very happy with this model. it takes a while to learn how to use it, but that's pretty standard with any sewing machine, kind of like driving someone else's car. the video's it comes with were very helpful to get started. it comes threaded but one of the threads was broken which i discovered when i tried to use it, so i spent the first night learning how to re-thread the thing. the videos definitely helped my frustration as threading any kind of serger is complicated especially if you've never had one before.
