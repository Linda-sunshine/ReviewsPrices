review/summary: So far so good!review/text: I haven't had this machine for quite a week yet, but I love it. It came pre-threaded (with multi-colored test thread) and the tension adjusted. Didn't expect that, so it made it handy for just doing the knotted thread switch over to my standard white. Excited to try the different presser feet. This runs a good deal faster than my Singer serger (which also happens to be 20 years old!). My only complaint about this machhine is that unlike my Singer serger, the Brother doesn't have a handle. And as much as I have to move my machines around, a handle can be very handy. But other than that, I'm loving it!
