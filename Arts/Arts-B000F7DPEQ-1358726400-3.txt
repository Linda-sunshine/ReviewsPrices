review/summary: Nice little machinereview/text: I purchased this machine for small sewing projects, hems, repairs, etc. I am not an accomplished seamstress, and this machine fits the bill for what I need. Is easy to use and is lightweight and well made. The price is definitely worth it. Very happy with my purchase.
