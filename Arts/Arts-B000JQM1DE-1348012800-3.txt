review/summary: Great Quality! Great Value!review/text: I have owned this sewing machine for about a year now. I am beyond happy with it. I am not a professional sewer, but not a complete amateur. I have made many things with it so far, and continue to be amazed at what you can do with it, and what it can handle.As the description mentions, it has 60 different stitches, all which you simply select, and sew! The accesssories included are awesome! I have not had to buy one thing (other than thread) inorder to opperate my machine. It includes several different feet, needles, bobbins, a seam ripper, quilting arm, even tools, everything you need to get started. You simply open the box, thread your bobbin and machine, and sew! I literally was off and running with it the first day. The little accessory bag included can be stored in the actual machine, for convenience. It has a detailed owners manuel, that shows you step by step how to use all the many features... and it has a quick guide as well, so if its been a while since your last use, in a glance you're ready to go.I typically only write reviews on an item that is truly wonderful, or truly awful, just so the next buyer is aware. This item is obviously one of the truly wonderful finds! I am so pleased with the price, the machine, all the extras, and the ease of use. I would and have recommended this machine to so many people.
