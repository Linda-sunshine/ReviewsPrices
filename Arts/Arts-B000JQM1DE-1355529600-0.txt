review/summary: More Sew for Your Buck!review/text: Remember those one stitch sewing machines handed down to you by two generations of mothers that weighed 500 pounds and had their own gravitation pull? This is not that machine. Lightweight, lots of extras, lots of stitches and a handy book of 'how to's' are among the things included. A really well put together package for the beginner or seasoned veteran. And you cannot beat the price! Love it!!!
