review/summary: Works well until you need to clean it.review/text: I've had this machine for about 2 years now and absolutely LOVED IT... however every time I need to remove the needle plate to clean underneath it, get a tangled thread out, etc. it frustrates me to no end! The screws are in exactly the right spot that the screwdriver (that comes with the machine) will not fit up under the arm to get to the screws. I have tried every angle to no avail. I don't remember how I did it last time (because I have been able to take it off before to clean it), all I remember is that it was very frustrating. And today I needed to remove it so that I could untangle the thread and I can't for the life of me figure out how I did it last time. So anyway, I gave this machine 3 stars because it really is an excellent basic machine when you are actually using it and it does all the basic stitches plus a few cute/useful extras but cleaning it is a total hassle.
