review/summary: Changed my (crafting!) life.review/text: My whole life I've done crafts by hand because my experiences with sewing machines were that they were complicated and annoying to learn to use well, with all the stitches and so on (my family had an elaborate but utterly difficult to use machine from another brand, and it strongly discouraged me from bothering to learn to use it, as I grew up).That outlook on things limited the scope of my crafts projects to smaller items, because frankly, who wants to sew a huge thing by hand?Truth to be said, I bought the machine for my family to use but I didn't think I'd use it, it seemed complicated, what with the computerized thingie and the 60 stitches and all.I couldn't have been more wrong. This machine is wonderful, and SO easy to use!! And it sews beautifully, it's just perfect!The quick set-up sheet (for people lazy to read the book) is better if you are used to sewing machines already, but the user guide that also comes with it is extremely well-made, explains everything in detail and made things super easy. With the book, it took me mere instants to put the thread in and start sewing.If I'd known using a sewing machine was that easy, I'd have started much sooner. Now I'm sewing more and more things just because using the machine is so easy and fun. I've been making a variety of sewing projects and having ideas for what else I could make. It's so addictive! I'm so glad I bought this machine.
