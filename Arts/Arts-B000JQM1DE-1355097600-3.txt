review/summary: Love it!review/text: I've never owned a sewing machine, and haven't used one since Home Ec class when I was 14. I was able to use the instruction manual to learn to set it up and started sewing right away! I learned from reading reviews to use good thread, and haven't had any problems. I highly recommend this machine!
