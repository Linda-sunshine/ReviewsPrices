review/summary: AMAZING machine for the cost!review/text: This machine is so easy to use, the stitches are great, and the automatic needle threader saves so much time! I bought this as a beginning sewing machine, and I couldn't be happier! It has tons of stitches to choose from and even does button holes! Highly recommend!
