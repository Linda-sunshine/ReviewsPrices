review/summary: bad choicereview/text: I have had nothing but trouble with this machine since I purchased it. Due to a serious illness in the family, I was not able to try it when it was delivered. When I did start a project, the fabric would not feed and even seemed to go backwards. I wrote to Brother and they said to take it to the nearest Brother dealer. The closest dealer was over an hour away, but I took the machine there and the first thing that they said was that this was not really a Brother sewing machine. They finally agreed to have someone check out the machine and when I picked it up they said that it had a defective part from the factory. I have used it for about 6 hours since then and in the midst of a project, it's doing the same thing again. I do not recommend this model.
