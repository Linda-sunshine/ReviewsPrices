review/summary: Brother Sewing Machinereview/text: I'm very happy to have purchased this sewing machine. It auto threads. I got several presser feet. I don't have to use a pedal, it almost sews hands free--all I have to do is press a button. Very easy to use. I appreciate also receiving the free arm. The sewing machine doesn't come with a case, its a cover.
