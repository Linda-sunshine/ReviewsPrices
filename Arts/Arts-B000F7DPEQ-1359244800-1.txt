review/summary: Brother XL2600I sewing machinereview/text: This machine is just what I wanted. I am your basic sewer. I don't need all those fancy stitches that you might need an engineering degree to use. I have been sewing for many years. This i my third machine and the first time for a Brother. I am very satisfied with its ease of use and its compactness. Thanks Amazon for providing an excellent product for purchase. I will recommend this machine to others.
