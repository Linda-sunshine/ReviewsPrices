review/summary: Small yet mighty performance!review/text: This arrived in tact with all items wrapped securely. Read the manual and followed some tips. This product is durable and flexible with various stitches. Love that it fits snuggly in my closet for quick setup and removal. Have only had times of concern with the bobbin. Learning to use proper thread as the cheap stuff doesn't fair well. There are add on devices for quilting, the long table has saved me many a time when constructing pieces together. So far I am mediocre in my skills yet the results still amaze me! Just remember to clean it when needed and it will last longer. Would recommend for beginners and those needing a smaller machine for those quick projects! The price was also in my budget. It gets the task done and with raving results.
