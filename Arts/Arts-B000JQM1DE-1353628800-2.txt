review/summary: Very Weak Machine--Very Bad Purchasereview/text: I am very disappointed with this sewing machine.I can't even use it on medium weight fabric the machine,just vibrates and needle will not go to through.It has no power at all.Also there is a piece of metal underneath the feeder that the thread continuously hangs to it and it makes the thread tangles. Very bad purchase for me. Very frustrating to work with and it Finally quit working.
