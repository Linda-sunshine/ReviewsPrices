review/summary: brother sewing machinereview/text: I researched sewing machines for several months before I decided to go with this brother. I just started sewing with a friend, so this is my first machine. I have been using it pretty regularly and have had no issues with it. It seems a lot sturdier than other plastic machines too, which is great. Definitely beyond happy with my purchase!
