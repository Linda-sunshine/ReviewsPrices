review/summary: Great beginner's machinereview/text: I was really torn between buying this sewing machine and the more expensive name brand ones that are sold in sewing shops. I am very glad I purchased this one!I am a beginner sewer and this machine is perfect for me. It does everything I want/need it to do and even has a few little extras (the abiltiy to do sleves, the many stich designs). This machine has so far been wonderful for all of my projects. I have made a dress for my daughter, fixed a hamper bag, and made a spill matt for a high chair which required sweing through four layers of fabic. I love the eas of use and the ability to use the traditional foot pedal and also the modern sewing button.pros:-easily change out a needle-many, many stiches to choose from-buttom sewing stich - works amazingly!!-two ways to sew (foot pedal and button)-free arm to sew sleeves, etc.-easy threadingcons:-no embroidering ability-can be finiky with threads, need good quality and not the cheap stuff-is kind of heavy and the accompying case is not a carrying caseOverall, I think this is a great beginners machine (especially for the price) and one that will last me through years and many projects.
