review/summary: Superior Machine at GREAT Price - Beats My Expensive Machine Hands Down!review/text: I have owned this machine since 2006, and I have been thrilled with it since the first stitch was made! I had previously owned a Simplicity Celebrity that I replaced with a Viking Scandinavia 200. I rarely touch my Viking now. This Brother CS6000i does absolutely everything you need, and does it beautifully! I even free motion quilt with this machine and have gorgeous results. I owned a quilt shop for some time and this was my go-to machine for lessons, shop samples, and every project for the store. I make my kids' clothing, pajamas, and costumes with this; I stitch up quick crafts; I've even sewn heavy duty canvas covers for my patio furniture.It is very easy to thread, and the needle threader is a joy. The stitch selection is very nice. The cover is a nice bonus, but honestly I never use it - the machine is always in use! The feet included are more than enough, but I have found that my other feet from my Simplicity machine are interchangeable (which is a very nice surprise - it saved purchasing a couple extra that I thought I would need to.)The fact that it takes #15 bobbins is also handy. These are relatively cheap and can be purchased at Jo-Ann's, Walmart, K-Mart, etc... My Viking takes specialty bobbins manufactured by Husquavarna Viking and they cost quite a bit. I stay very stocked up on #15's and use a side winder to load them up to keep them ready to go at all times.After six years of heavy use (5-6 days per week, at least 2-3 hours per day), this machine still runs like new. If it ever bites the dust, I will gladly buy another!
