review/summary: Amazing sewing machinereview/text: I bought this for my fiancee for Christmas a year ago. She absolutely loves this machine. She said it works so much better than her mothers old clunker. I even tried it a few times and it is very smooth. It works great. I would highly recommend this sewing machine. Brother is great from printers to sewing machines! :)
