review/summary: Great Productreview/text: First off I understand that it's probably weird to see a guy writing a review on this. I was taught how to use a sewing machine by my mom and god mother. I needed to get curtains for my house but had an issue finding ones that would fit a 100+ year old houses odd sized windows. So I bought this to make my own from long store bought curtains. It was very easy to use and the instructions were extremely easy to understand. For a person that has not used a sewing machine for 10+ years that is very important. I'm very happy with the purchase, and would recommend it to anyone. I even purchased a second one as a christmas present for my mother.
