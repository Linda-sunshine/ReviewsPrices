review/summary: Brother 1034D Sergerreview/text: Had tried a Singer serger (approximately the same price). It was AWFUL!! Difficult to thread, noisy -- not a good product. On the advice of Consumer Reports I tried this one. It's great!!! Excellent instructional video! Easy to use. Very user friendly. Would definitely recommend it to anyone considering a plain vanilla serger!!
