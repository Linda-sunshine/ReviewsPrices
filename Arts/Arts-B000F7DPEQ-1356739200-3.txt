review/summary: Great for a beginnerreview/text: This machine was great for me. I haven't sewn since junior high 15 years ago. I was able to get it threaded and get started sewing using only the provided manual. I even got it jammed up pretty good once (my own fault) and was able to trouble shoot the problem myself. That's saying a lot considering my lack of experience and mechanical skills.
