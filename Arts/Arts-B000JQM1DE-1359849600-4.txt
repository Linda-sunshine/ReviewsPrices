review/summary: Brother CS6000i Sewing Machinereview/text: After reviewing many home sewing machine articles, I finally chose the Brother CS600i. Some of the reviews suggested difficulties with the automatic needle threader and/ or the bobbin tension settings. It is true that you have to look very carefully at the final thread retaining bail just above the needle to see which side to hook the thread on, but I finally got it figured out. The automatic needle threader is a bit tricky, but when I saw that the thread must be pulled up rather than down to catch onto the tiny hook,, bingo!The machine has the ability to automatically set the recommended stitch length and width dimensions and to tell you what foot to put on it. Unfortunately I had to use a small flash light to see the numbers and letters on the small screen. No big deal.So far the bobbin and thread tensions have not been a problem. What was confusing was the direction to &#34;baste&#34;titch without telling me how to do that. I found a clue in the frequently asked question in the Brother web site. All you do is set the tension wheel to 3 and the stitch length to 4. Again, Bingo!The machine has a narrower throat that my Viking, but this can be worked around with a bit of innovating.All-in-all I have have a lot of enjoyment just trying out all of the stitches described in the very complete instruction manual.Nice work, Brother..
