review/summary: Easy to use, easy to learnreview/text: I just received this serger last weekend for my birthday. I've been sewing consistently for the last three years, and felt like I was ready for a serger, but they scare me. I wanted a beginner's serger - not something super expensive and complicated. After reading the reviews, I hinted (with a link) of this serger and low and behold - it was wrapped up for my birthday! I watched the very outdated (and yet humorous) CD-Rom that came with the serger. It was super helpful in learning how to thread the serger, start sewing with it, and different ways to use it. I think that tutorial was SUPER helpful if you take the time to watch the whole thing. I feel VERY comfortable using the machine and have even made a few things since I got it. I've had no problems or issues with it at all. I think for someone starting out serging, it is the PERFECT machine at a GREAT price. It flows easily, and serges beautifully. I paid 2x's the amount for a great sewing machine that I constantly use, and I'm glad to finally have my serger!
