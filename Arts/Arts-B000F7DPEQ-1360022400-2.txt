review/summary: Perfect for beginners at affordable pricereview/text: the machine runs very smoothly, and it is easy to set up; although, the way the manual was constructed was not good enough and need to be re-written - for example, instructed in English, then followed by Spanish should not had been like that. I recommend writing half pages of the manual in English first, and the rest half pages in Spanish.
