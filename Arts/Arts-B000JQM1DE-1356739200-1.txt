review/summary: Everything I wantedreview/text: The perfect machine for all sewers. I am an advanced sewer, and already have an embroidery machine, so wanted a machine that would handle everything else. This is the one. The buttonholer is perfect and it sews like a dream. It has just the right amount of computerized decorative stitching. Easy to thread both needle and bobbin and it is so lightweight I can take it anywhere be it room to room or traveling. Couldn't ask for a better machine. I have had many machines during my lifetime and this one far exceeds all others.
