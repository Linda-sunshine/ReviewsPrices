review/summary: Instructions could be betterreview/text: After struggling trying to understand the self threader instructions, finally got it, but would love for the people who write these things to do a better job. Even having a better illustration would have helped. I have some experience with sewing and that was definitely a plus. I wanted just a basic machine to do simple stitching for repairs and home decor projects. I might attempt to actually sew some clothing, but that remains to be seen. This machine works fine for what I want, and the price was excellent. Don't know if it would hold up to heavy use, but if you need a machine for occasional use and nothing too fancy, this should do the job.
