review/summary: happiness is a new machinereview/text: My old machine literally stopped in the middle of a project. I had looked at new machines for some time, but kept putting off a purchase until it became urgent. Thought this one would see me through until old one was repaired. I haven't even attempted to get repairs on old one. So far this machine is great. Just select stitch and size, set speed and push button to sew. Easy bobbin loading. Seam allowances are marked on the plate-no more masking tape.I have done samples of some of the stitches and am looking forward to my next project with this machine. AND it has a very reasonable price.
