review/summary: Machine is great for a while but then nothing but problemsreview/text: I want to start off by saying I LOVE this machine. That being said, I can't deal with the problems anymore.After using the machine for a while, the bobbin starts "knotting up". I've called Brother with no satisfaction other than "bring it to a repair shop". Really???? $50 minimum to repair on a machine costing under $80??? I've been through the manual and have gone through all the fixes plus a few of my own.Oh and I forgot to add that this has happened to FIVE of these identical machines!!! At first I thought it was me, but not after reading review on these machines from people who have owned them for a while. No, I didn't pay for all of them. I was real good at persuading the stores to exchange as each time the machine did not last a full 12 months! I kept on exchanging because I really do love the machine, but I'm getting sick of it lasting 6 months or so and then having these problems!I've searched the web time and again for a fix. Replacing the bobbin holder and needle plate would cost a minimum of $50 so that's not worth the while. If the parts were less expensive in relation to the cost of the machine I would not mind replacing these parts all the time, but not at their current replacement costs.
