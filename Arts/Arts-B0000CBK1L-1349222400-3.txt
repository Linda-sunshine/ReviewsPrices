review/summary: Easy functionalityreview/text: I did a lot of research prior to purchasing my Brother 1034D serger, and I wholeheartedly agree with the many positive reviews this machine has received. I think most folks are intimidated by the prospect of selecting and learning to use their first serger, and I certainly fit that description. However, the included manual and software made it easy peasy to get started on this machine. Brother has truly constructed an idiot-proof serger, and I mean that as a very sincere compliment. It arrives all set up with color-coded thread, which is threaded through the corresponding color-coded loopers/needles, and each step in the threading process is numbered and marked with a detailed diagram that makes what you are supposed to do crystal-clear. A monkey could thread this machine. In addition, there are plenty of spiffy features like free-arm capability, differential feed, and a retractable knife. I have only used this machine to do basic four-thread overlock stitching, and have not delved into the more elaborate types of stitching it is capable of, but it comes with a CD-ROM devoted solely to the plethora of techniques you can use with this serger. As for performance, the stitches are consistent, the noise level is very reasonable, and it's pretty compact. All things considered, the only complaint or criticism I have is that the included software is designed to be PC-compatible only, however, if you have a Mac (like me), you can still access the all-important how-to videos contained on the CD-ROMS. I'm extremely pleased with this serger. Well worth every penny.
