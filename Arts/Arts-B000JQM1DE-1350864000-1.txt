review/summary: Works with a 110-220 converter!review/text: I took a risk buying this sewing machine, because the voltage is 220v-50Hz where I live. I bought a voltage step-down converter and tested it, and yes it works! Without any problems at all.I felt it was great value at the price, and I haven't been disappointed.So, if you want to buy this machine for use in a country with 220V-50Hz power supply, don't let that deter you. It will work with a step-down converter. Just take all necessary precautions to prevent accidentally plugging it ino the mains directly.Caveat: I guess your warranty would be voided, I personally didn't mind that.
