review/summary: Eh Okreview/text: Had this machine for a couple years. Worked alright. Loved the button hole options. The problem I had was with the lower tension. All of the correct bobbin placement and cleaning couldn't fix it like so many reviewers. Took it to get repaired and after he messed with it awhile and took it apart and put it back together he told me the lower tension was completely off and it could be fixed but he wanted to charge me more than what I paid for it! I threw it away and bought a better machine without plastic parts.
