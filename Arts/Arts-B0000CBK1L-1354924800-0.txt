review/summary: This machine is wonderful!review/text: I was so intimidated when I received this, I let it sit for a whole weekend before I tried it. I didn't need to be worried. It is easy to operate and I am thrilled with the two &#34;infinity dresses&#34; I made. These infinity dresses were made without a pattern, and I am just a beginner at sewing. The four thread stitch still allows plenty of stretch to my spandex fabrics and made these two dresses total successes.I was really worried about threading the machine. The good news is there are lots of good instructional videos on YouTube. (The videos that come with the machine are old, out-dated, and only run on Windows computers. They are worth a quick look, but the YouTube videos are much better.) Even better, it comes with four reels of thread already in place. This was enough to make both dresses. The best tip: when you almost run out of one thread, tie a new thread onto the end and let it run right through the machine. Works right up until you get to the two needles. The other two threads have no needle eyes or problems.If you are a beginner, like me, I think this machine will help you with those stretchy fabrics.
