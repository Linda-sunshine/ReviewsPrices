review/summary: Great for a beginner like me!review/text: I recently started taking sewing classes and after doing a lot of research, I ended up purchasing this machine. It seemed like the best value with all the different presser feet that came with it. This is my second attempt at learning how to sew (got distracted by life the first time), and my second machine. The first machine I had was an older brother with a side bobbin system. I love that this one has a drop in bobbin!I also love the simplicity of using this machine. I am the type of person who will read all the instructions (twice) and then watch videos to make sure I have a concept, so by the time I got around to using the machine, it was a breeze. So far I have completed 7 projects with it and I absolutely love it. I'm not a professional so I don't have much to compare this machine to, however I use it for sewing clothes for myself and my daughter and it works quite well for that purpose. I would recommend this highly for a beginner like me, and also to someone who is upgrading from an older machine.
