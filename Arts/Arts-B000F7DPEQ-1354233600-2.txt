review/summary: More than expected!!!review/text: This little machine can do so much more than I ever expected. I have never sewed a thing before getting the sewing machine and wanted it to just do the hem of my pants. My reasoning was spending the money for the machine compared to my cleaners wanting $5.00 a leg; I had nine pants which needed hemming. After just ten minutes I was sewing away making my pants look as though a professional had done it. This machine has already paid for itself. I could not be happier, and I like working with it so much I will be doing other projects around the house.
