review/summary: A good entry-level tool for the occasional seamstressreview/text: This was a gift for my wife and she is very pleased with this sewing machine. She's commented a number of times how this is much easier to use than the old sewing machine passed down to her from my grandmother.She's a self-admitted amateur seamstress and still learning how to sew, but this sewing machine has allowed her to successfully complete curtains for our entry windows, a superhero cape for our child's Halloween outfit and a number of other small projects.I doubt this thing would be sturdy enough or have the stamina to keep up with someone who sews for a living, but for the "occasional seamstress", this is the perfect tool to have around.
