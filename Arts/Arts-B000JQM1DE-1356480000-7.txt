review/summary: Sews well; not as heavy duty as I would have hopedreview/text: It is so lightweight. I guess that's good for transportability, but then I don't really need to do that. I haven't had any problems with it sewing though. The stitches all seem fine so far, but only did quilting. Just afraid this thing will break soon. I wanted something that would stand the test of time.
