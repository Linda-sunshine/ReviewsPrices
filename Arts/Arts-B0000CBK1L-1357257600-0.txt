review/summary: First sergerreview/text: I looked at a lot of reviews before purchasing this and also did not want to spend a lot of money. This is my first serger and I am an intermediate sewer. I have to say it was easy to thread. It comes with CD rom tutorials, however all tutorials are available on you tube, which is easier for me. My only wish is that it made a more ruffled gather. I am very pleased with my purchase I made about a year ago. I have made several skirts, doll clothes, fixed seams, made baby bibs, dog beds, and mended many other clothes for our family of 6. I have not used any other serger, but I love this one and would purchase again.
