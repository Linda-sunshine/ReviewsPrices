review/summary: I've been waiting for you...review/text: Been dreaming of a serger for years. Found this one at a great price and could not be more thrilled. I've used it on a variety of different weight fabrics; works just as well on thicker fabric as on sheers. Instruction charts and manual are very helpful, clearly written and well laid-out. Easy to thread, runs like a dream.
