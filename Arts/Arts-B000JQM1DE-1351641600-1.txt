review/summary: Love it!review/text: This sewing machine is awesome!! I had another lower end Brother machine and it worked fine, but I constantly had to re-thread the bobbins due to tension issues. Since using this machine I have had no issues, and I sew A LOT!! And through thick, unfriendly fabric, and I haven't had any issues! Very easy to figure out even without a manual (my sister lost the manual before giving it to me) and I think I had to go online to look up one thing, and had no problems finding that out. I am a fairly new sew-er, and I LOVE this machine!!
