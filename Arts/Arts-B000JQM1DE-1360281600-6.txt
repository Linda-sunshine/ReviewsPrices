review/summary: Why did I wait so long...............review/text: After 30 years with the same Singer sewing machine, I took the plunge & purchased this machine because the price was so unbelievable. It has so many more functions than my old machine & the instructions are easily understandable.I recommend this machine from beginners to experienced level stitchers.
