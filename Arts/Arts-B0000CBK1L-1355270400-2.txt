review/summary: Super Disappointedreview/text: I took it out of the box and the hand wheel was stuck. Google &#34;Brother 1034D hand wheel stuck&#34; and you will see it is a common problem. I took it to the authorized service center in my area and the lady there said that this machine is a &#34;piece of crap&#34;. She said that people bring them in regularly for some reason or another and that several times the owner just has to throw it out because nothing can be done.It will be weeks before mine is fixed or replaced. Luckily it was still under warranty, but too late to return to Amazon. Huge bummer, spend a little more money for a better machine.
