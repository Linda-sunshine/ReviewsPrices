review/summary: happyreview/text: Had many fears in using and purchasing a serger, but all fears subsided once I received it and got my hands dirty. Very easy to thread and runs very smoothly. BUT the how to video is horrible. Not very detailed and goes to fast in my opinion. When I ran out of my right bobbin thread I struggled to get the machine sewing again. Went back to the video and realized that if that thread breaks then the two needle threads need to be threaded again. In the video she doesn't, in my opinion emphasises that enough. I don't know I'd that is common knowledge, but for a first time user I feel that is very important. Beyond the video, this is an excellent machine. Did everything I needed and I like the option to do cuffs.Great machine, user friendly, and nothing like the nightmares I had read about before purchase.
