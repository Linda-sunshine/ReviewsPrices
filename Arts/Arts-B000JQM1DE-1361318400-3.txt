review/summary: Good bang for the buckreview/text: I needed some stuff sewn by machine and having it done by someone else would be too expensive. I asked my wife and she told me that she didn't have the skill level required. So, I bought this machine, followed the directions in the printed manual and now I'm sewing all kinds of fabric together. (Some of it is even usable when I'm done.) For a first machine this is wonderful. It won't do thick multiple layers (I've done 4 layers of fleece, but it didn't like it.) and I wouldn't try leather unless it was really thin, but it will do the basics and then some.Cautions: Use good thread or you will have problems with your thread breaking or tangling on the bottom. Don't sew too fast for the fabric you are working on or your thread will break. (Fleece requires a medium speed at the most.) Don't try to start too close the the edge of your fabric or the feet won't feed. (At least with fleece.)Tip: When sewing fleece use masking tape to stabilize the fabric and keep it from stretching and bunching. Just don't sew through the tape; sew next to it. After testing several stitches I've been using the triple stitch (02) at the lowest settings for fleece with good results. (Yes, I've been sewing a lot of fleece. It's one of the major reasons I bought the machine.)
