review/summary: E6 problemsreview/text: I have had more problems with this machine, the E6 message keeping coming on, indication of thread tangled in the machine, however, I can find no thread in the machine, even after taking the machine apart as much as possible, this is happened so far several times, a few times I cleaned it and it was fine, twice it was a major problem but after a few days , it cleared out itself, but now after two weeks I still can not get the machine to work, tomorrow I wil bring it to the shop, and it's only a few months old. I have never had this much problem with a machine and I have been sewing for ver 30 years. I have a very inexpensive Shark machine, I have to keep going back to.
