review/summary: machine works great!!review/text: I really am just an average person who loves to work on projects. I enjoy doing crafty things and this machine is working great. I love the automatic threader, it takes some patience to learn how to use it, but once I figured it out, I love it. I have made several items with it and even used some of the wonderful stitches offered. they have all worked great and I found the directions easy to understand. Very happy with my purchase and trying to come up with more projects to work on!!
