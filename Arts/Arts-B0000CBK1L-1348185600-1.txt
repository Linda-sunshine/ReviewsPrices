review/summary: Oh my, this is a wonderful serger!!!review/text: I bought this serger after reading the reviews (I mean, really, what item is actually 4.5 stars out of 5?!). And I say, this item is definitely somewhere between a 4 and a 5. The threading instructions are almost fool-proof (I say, almost, because I thought the "blue" thread was threaded through something, but instead it's threaded against something, and threading the thread through causes the thread to break every seam), and it's so easy to thread. The one drawback is that the cutting knife isn't as strong as my other serger (which, is a pain to thread, so there's the trade-off) - I sewed into 1 straight pin and the knife broke. It would be nice if Brother would throw in a replacement knife, because things that break usually break at inopportune moments (4:30AM, in the middle of a seam)...
