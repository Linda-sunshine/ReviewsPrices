review/summary: Kind of wish I didn't get computerizedreview/text: I don't sew regularly, so I have to get out the instructions every time I use this. Even a plain straight stitch or zigzag requires the manual to figure out the settings. THE LED LIGHT IS A JOKE. There may as well be no light at all.
