review/summary: Purchased as a GIFTreview/text: This was purchased as a gift and I've reviewed the product as it's an upgrade from the one my friend would 'borrow'. She began to teach me how to sew and this is a great machine that is easy and still provides stitch options. It came VERY fast and was well packed/protected!
