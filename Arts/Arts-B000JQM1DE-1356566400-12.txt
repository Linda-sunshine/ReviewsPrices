review/summary: so far it's great!review/text: this machine has features I never expected to have at this price! so far everything I've tried works wonderfully. it's my first electronic machine and is very different from my old one, so there was a bit of a learning curve at first, but the manual was very helpful. I love the drop-in bobbin that I can SEE while I'm sewing, and the needle-down feature is great! I recommend this one!
