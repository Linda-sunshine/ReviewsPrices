review/summary: So Excited!!review/text: I was so excited to receive my new sewing machine. I have not had a new one since the 1970's. It took me a few minutes to set everything up and become familiar with the machine. The first thing I did was hem some jeans. I was so happy that it sewed over the seams like they were butter! It's also is very quiet and extremely light. I was expecting it be be heavy and was very pleasantly surprised at how light it is. I'm not too crazy about the hard case but at least it will protect if from dust, etc. So far I am very pleased with this machine and the discounted price was the best because I was able to get more machine for less money. I would recommend this machine to anyone that is currently looking to replace an old one.
