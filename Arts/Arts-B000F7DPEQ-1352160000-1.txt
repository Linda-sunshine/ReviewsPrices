review/summary: Easy to use for a Beginnerreview/text: I use to borrow my mom's machine for the rare times I had a need for a sewing machine - then I moved 400 miles away. I am strictly a novice when it comes to sewing, but wanted something that would be easy to use when I needed it. I had 11 curtain panels I wanted to make for a porch and this looked like it would do the job. It arrived very well packaged in the original manufacturers packaging. All of the needed parts were included to begin sewing. The directions are a little fuzzy - but I attribute that to my lack of knowledge about sewing in general. I knocked out the curtains in no time flat. There are a lot of things this machine can do if I, the operator, take the time to learn how to do them. All in all I am quite pleased with the machine and the quality and performance. Great price. Hope to try and broaden my horizons with a bit of knowledge and see what else I can manage. I would recommend without question.
