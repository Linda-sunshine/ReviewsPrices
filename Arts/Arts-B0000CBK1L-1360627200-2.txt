review/summary: A GOOD PURCHASEreview/text: Don't be afraid to purchase this serger. I purchased it and it is my first serger. I wanted to try a good serger that did a good job and did not want to invest a lot of money in the first one. I can truly say that it does a beautiful job, it's fairly quite and feels very sturdy. I love it. I have not tried to rethread it. I will use the tread that came with it because I'm sewing darker colors and the stitches are beautiful for what I'm doing. I will definitely rethread so that I'm comfortable doing so (as opposed to just tying and pulling the threads through). There is a very good you-tube video on threading so I've just GOT to try it. I think it is a great machine and I'm very happy with it. Take the plunge!
