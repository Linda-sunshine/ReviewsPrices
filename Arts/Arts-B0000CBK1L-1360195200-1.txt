review/summary: Buy It!review/text: I read through hundreds of reviews before I purchased this serger. I wanted a serger but was afraid that I wouldn't be able to thread it properly or set the tensions properly. I am so glad that I took the plunge! It comes pre-threaded and pre-set to regular serging stitches. I've already threaded it myself several times and it isn't that hard to do. Simply follow the color coded thread guides. The handbook and included dvds give good instructions for threading.I've only had this serger for a few weeks now but I'm very pleased with it. It is user-friendly and not too difficult for a beginning serger to learn to use.I only gave it 4 stars because I think that the guidebook is a little confusing. On the bright side, there are lots of serging tutorials to be found online and they are very informative.The machine is 5 stars for those that are already accustomed to using a serger. The price and quality of the serger make it a great buy for those of us who are beginners. I'm enjoying my machine and I'm looking forward to becoming more proficient with it.
