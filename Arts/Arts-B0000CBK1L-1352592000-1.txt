review/summary: Great machine for the pricereview/text: After reading many of the reviews about the different sergers on the market - I decided on this one. Yes, it doesn't thread itself like the $1300 Babylock that the dealer tried to sell me because &#34;threading sergers is really hard&#34;. Well, I'm a beginner and frankly I have a husband that spoils me and would have bought that machine for me - but why? Read the manual, watch the video, do as I did and label the parts and thread the machine. I threaded it while holding a conversation with both my husband and son. This machine performs well and I have enjoyed learning using it. It may not thread itself but it gets the job done.
