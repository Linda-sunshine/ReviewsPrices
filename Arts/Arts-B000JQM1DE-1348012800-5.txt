review/summary: Sweet Machinereview/text: For the price this machine can't be topped. Has all the features of something costing ten times the price. My 35 year old Bernina was a work horse but this is a different animal. If you've never used a computerized machine it will take some getting used to. Take your time- go slow and READ everything twice. Play with it before starting any projects. I have had none of the problems many people are talking about but am paying attention to the comments. I have a small embroidery business and use a large Brother 6 needle embroidery machine every day and believe Brother puts out a quality machine and so far this one has proved me right. Thanks!
