review/summary: Brother Serger is greatreview/text: I researched different sergers when I decided to finally purchase one and chose the Brother mainly because of the price and what it could do. The serger came with additional feet that I didn't know about and the instruction videos were great. I have now used my serger to make my first pair of slacks and couldn't believe how fast I was able to complete the project using this serger.
