review/summary: Trying to get back into sewing - Great starter machinereview/text: I didn't want a complicated expensive machine... just something basic that I could sew some pillows, curtains, etc... with and so far am very pleased with this machine. It was really easy to get started, I haven't sewed in about 15 years but figured out how to wind the bobbin and thread the machine within minutes. It's small enough to store in the closet as well. I'm happy!!
