review/summary: For the beginner or more advanced sewerreview/text: After having a Singer machine for years, I did a lot of research and ended up with this Brother model. I am very happy with the machine. I am an advanced beginner and find this extremely easy to operate. I appreciate the lighter weight of the machine which facilitates set up. Once it is ready to go, though, the machine stays in place and sews like a dream. There are three speed settings which I have found to be most useful. I haven't yet explored all of the stitch options, but changing the foot to accommodate them is an easy process. My only criticism concerns the illustrations provided to show you how to set up the machine. I still can't figure out the self-threading option. The machine comes with a hard shell carrying case. All accessories are stored conveniently on the machine. A very good value for the money.
