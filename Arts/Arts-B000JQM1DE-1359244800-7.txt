review/summary: This beginner loves it!!review/text: I've always wanted to learn how to use a sewing machine, and I was at first hesitant to buy the CS6000i...I thought maybe I should start with a less expensive machine. But with all these functions and accessories included at such a great sale price (amazon had a sale on brother machines), I went ahead and bought one, and I am so glad that I did! It is so easy to use (or learn how to use), and anything the instructions weren't clear on, I found tutorial videos on youtube to answer any other questions. Having all the different computerized embroidery options are fantastic. My first quilt is coming along beautifully!
