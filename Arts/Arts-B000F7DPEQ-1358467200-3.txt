review/summary: Perfectreview/text: I bought this for my daughter as her first sewing machine and it is so user friendly. I also bought one for myself, and I have been sewing for 30 years! It is all the machine you need for basic sewing. I love it! If you're a beginner or a lifelong sewer you will love it too!
