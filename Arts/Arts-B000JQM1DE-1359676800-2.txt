review/summary: Great machine - Definitely Recommend Itreview/text: I'm loving this machine. I was a little intimidated by all the features and can't believe how easy this is to use. I'm also pleasantly surprised how smooth it runs. The only thing I could ask for would be a better light but it's a minor detail when compared to all the wonderful stitches and options of width and length of same. Threading the needle is so much easier. Arrows/directions right on the machine make it easy to thread, and create bobbins. It is lightweight making it so easy to take out and put away without much thought. Although it is light, it seems the parts are still well made and the important ones are metal.
