review/summary: Brother Sewing Machinereview/text: I have always used another brand of sewing machine, until I noticed several of the ladies in my Quilt Club had purchased the Brother Sewing Machine. I asked several of the members if they liked this machine and all of the ladies said they would recommend it to anyone . I purchased it and found that it is a great machine for quilting and sewing. I use the great seliction of stitches when I am quilting and also I am thrilled to have a special attachmet that will do free motion quilting. It also lets me do stipple quilting. Great machine for the price.
