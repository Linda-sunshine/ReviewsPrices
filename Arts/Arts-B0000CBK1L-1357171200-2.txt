review/summary: Bought One for Myself & One as a Gift!review/text: Over six months ago, my older serger finally died. I replaced it with this model and was very surprised by how easy it was to use and by the great price on it. While my older serger was all metal and a true workhorse, I was limited by many factors - the greatest being the impossibility of finding needles for it. This model uses all sizes of needles that a regular sewing machine uses. The new machine has exceeded my expectations and I was so pleased with it that I gave a second one as a Christmas gift.There are also numerous videos on the web which demonstrate many of the things that can be constructed using this serger. It does so much more than just seam finishing!
