review/summary: Christmas gift a big hit!!review/text: This sewing machine was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She was so excited to get it and now has the sewing bug!! She is expecting her 2nd child and can't wait to make accessories and bedding once she knows if it will be a girl or boy. The machine has been very easy to learn on, and has so many options! One minor problem with the self threader, but all in all, a very good purchase!
