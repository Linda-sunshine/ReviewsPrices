review/summary: Easy to usereview/text: I purchased this strictly for its features of push button sewing, needle up/down, and the accompanying enlarged sewing area using the table that comes with the machine. The price was excellent. I did experience a catch 22 with the bobbin thread. It will repeatedly catch up under the sewn fabric resulting in a ball of thread. However, I have been able to overcome this by positioning the sewing threads neatly to the side while using just slight pressure over them until a couple of stitches have been sewn. The grey plastic plate around the bobbin area seams to 'float' and not be firmly attached but it has remained in position and causes no issues. I was forced to unscrew the plate over the feed dogs to remove the first thread jam caused by bobbin thread but that has not been necessary since then. The amount of light shown on the sewing area is sufficient and the computerized stitch choices are very easy to adjust. I also like the ability to adjust needle placement to ensure the 1/4" seam I use for quilting. I will add that the tension needed to be adjusted to 7 ensure good stitches. I paid such a fantastic price for this machine that I cannot complain about it's quality. Value is there. This is my 2nd Brother as I also own their embroidery/sewing machine.
