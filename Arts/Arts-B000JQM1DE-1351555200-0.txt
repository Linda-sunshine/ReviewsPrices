review/summary: I think I'll love it.review/text: I haven't sewn since 8th grade home-ec class, about 30 yrs ago. This machine looks simple to use and does more things than I'll ever need. It shipped very fast. I ordered it on Friday, and got it on Tuesday. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I haven't used it yet. I would definitely recommend this machine, or give as a gift.
