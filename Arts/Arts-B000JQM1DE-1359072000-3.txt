review/summary: My first new machine in over 40 yearsreview/text: I inherited my mom's old singer when I was in college (she got a new one) and I used for years! It was made to last. I purchsed 2 new singers for my daughter and neither one lasted more than 4 or 5 years, I was very disappointed with singer. So when I decided to finally update my antique, I read the reviews and decided to go with this Brother.The price was so good I got one for my daughter too.While it took over 10 days to get mine (not sure why it took so long) when it arrived I was instantaly amazed.It works beautifully, and so quite! I especially like the speed adjustments and the self threading needle.Changing stich styles is a breeze, and every stitch seems perfect.I can't speak for how long it lasts yet, but it appears to be solid purchase - one of the best in the past few years!
