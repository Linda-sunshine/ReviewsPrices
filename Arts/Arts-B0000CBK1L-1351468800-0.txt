review/summary: brother sergerreview/text: I bought this machine to replace an old one. Threading with the lay in type is pretty easy. The machine worked well tension wise from the start. Directions are easy to follow. I think this machine is a good alternative to the more expensive ones. It does what I want and much more. I am a happy customer of Brother products.
