review/summary: Amazing!review/text: I bought this to replace my super basic starter machine that had gone off gear. It would have cost more to repair the machine then buy a new one, so I started to find a replacement. This machined sounded great and was just a little bit more expensive. I figured with all the extras it was worth it. I am so happy with my discussion.As my first project, I made throw pillows for my mother-in-law. WOW! At full speed, the machine didn't even shake. It sewed through two layers of fabric and fringe with ease.Things that I love:- 3 speeds- digital display tells you the required foot for each stitch- ease of use- all the free extras (I would never have spent the money, but they are being used)
