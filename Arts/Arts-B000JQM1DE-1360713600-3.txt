review/summary: Great little machine.review/text: This was a gift for my sister and her 13 year old daughter who wants to learn to sew. This was on deep discount at a great price. I had to try it out of course, and put through its paces. All of the stitches worked well, all knobs and buttons did too. Nice collection of accessories including a walking foot! And storage in the front removable free arm section is handy. Even stitches on quilt piecing work and with special stitches. Fairly lightweight to use on a table and put away.
