review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: I've had my machine for several months now and have absolutely LOVE it! I love that, despite the low price, it comes with so many feet as well as a hard travel case. It's easy enough for a beginner to use, but the huge stitch selection means it'd be good for an experienced sewist, too. So far I've sewn with cotton, linen, and denim and I haven't had any trouble at all with thread tension, needle threading, or any other common sewing machine issues. Overall, I'm really happy with my machine. It's a lot easier to use than my mom's machine (fewer thread tension issues), which is a step or two down from this one.(FYI: I live in Australia and am using mine with a 120W 240 - 115V Isolated Stepdown Transformer I picked up at Jaycar for $99. Works like a charm and doesn't overheat the machine or make weird noises. :) This is a much better machine than any I could afford in Australia, even with the added cost of the transformer! My machine arrived in Sydney less than two weeks after ordering it. It was shipped in its original box and is very obviously a sewing machine, so you might want to make arrangements if you're not going to be at at home when it's delivered so it's not on your front verandah all day long.)Go for it! You'll love it.
