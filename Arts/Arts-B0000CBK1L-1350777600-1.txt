review/summary: Love this machine.review/text: I got this serger as a birthday gift and it is Amazing. I have had this machine for over 6 years and I have only taken it to get serviced onces :/ which is terrible on my part. But nothing ever went wrong with it. I am a costume designer and constructor and I have had huge projects that this machine has gotten me through. It out lasted my brother sewing machine and it is so easy to thread. I have dealt with home and industrial sergers that are a nightmare to thread but no this one. I also like that you can turn the blade on and off instead of having to remove it like others.
