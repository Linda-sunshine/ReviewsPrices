review/summary: One year later: I love this machine!review/text: I have a 1974 Pfaff (classic) and a 1980s Janome. Both are supposed to be superior machines, but I didn't sew for years because, frankly, they are clunky and hard to get out and put away because they are so heavy. And they need a lot of oiling and fiddling. The lady at the fabric store makes fun of Brother machines. But I have had this machine for one year, and I like it better than any machine I've ever had. No oiling, no fiddling, no broken needles, and so lightweight I can easily move it to the sunniest spot in the house. My neighbor bought at Janome Magnolia 7318 at the same time I bought my Brother CS6000i. She paid twice as much and doesn't have some of the great features I love about this machine: one-step, perfect button holes, a foot that makes edge-stitching a breeze, bobbin thread that gets drawn up automatically. The embroidery stitches are lovely and no-fail. I just can't complain about anything. Brother makes a good machine. Don't listen to the sewing snobs at your local fabric store.
