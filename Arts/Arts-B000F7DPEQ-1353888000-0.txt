review/summary: Recommended!review/text: Use this machine ALL the time! works wonderful and simple to use at that. I LOVE the threading system. Makes it so much easier to threat the eye of the needle compared to my mother's very old sewing machine where you had to spend hours trying to thread the needle by hand.
