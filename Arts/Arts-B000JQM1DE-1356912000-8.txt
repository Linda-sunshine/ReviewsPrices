review/summary: I think my favorite feature is that I don't HAVE to use the foot pedalreview/text: I've only had it a couple of weeks, so only time will tell, BUT - wow. For the price, this is a spectacular machine so far. I absolutely love the fact that I can just push a button for it to sew and adjust the speed from slow to too fast. I haven't used any of the extra feet yet, so I have only tried about 10 of the stitches so far. I haven't had a problem at all with dropped stitches (a common problem with my 20-year-old machine), even with &#34;thick&#34; sewing (two layers of batting, 2 laters of fabric, and bias tape). I'm looking forward to using it more and exploring more of its options so that I can update this review with more information.
