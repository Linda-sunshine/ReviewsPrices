review/summary: Perfect for beginners.review/text: I was a little leery of buying this machine because of all the negative reviews. But the positive far outnumbered them so I bought it. After reading one review about the bobbin tension spring, I knew what to expect and have had no issues at all. I haven't tried any of the advanced features yet, but it runs perfectly. Money well spent.
