review/summary: Really impressed after 1st projectreview/text: After 38 years of sewing on a regular machine (both Viking & Brother), I finally took the plunge and bought my first serger machine. I chose this one after reading all of the reviews and was not disappointed. After getting over the serger "fear-factor" by reading the manual and The Complete Serger Handbook by Chris James (also very good!), I was easily able to thread the machine and complete my first project with no issues. The book really helped with photos & such, especially when learning about adjusting thread tension in all 4 threads, etc. Brother hits another homer! I also have two printers and a regular sewing machine from Brother and all are spectacular, easy to use work-horses. I highly recommend this machine to anyone looking for their first serger!
