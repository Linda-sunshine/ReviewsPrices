review/summary: Just be patientreview/text: This is my very first own sewing machine. I've played with my grandma's old school kind in the Philippines that's probably older than me and my brother combined, a mini, and hand held. So I have a few experiences but I still took my time to learn how to use this by skimming through the manual. Before changing things up and switching knobs here and there, make sure you know what you're doing because there's not default button to start over. It comes with decent accessories you'll need. There's plenty of various stitches for beginners and intermediate. I love this sewing machine! Now if only they have a better looking non bulky case/cover so it'll be more portable. But it does have a handle bevel to carry it with one hand.
