review/summary: Simple!!!review/text: I love this machine!! I have never ran one of these let alone owned one. The directions were easy and the numbers on the machine itself are wonderful. I know it was desinged for a person like me. Now I did have some problems with the thered tension and the bobin thred winding up under the faberic. But I followed the guidence of one of the other reviewers and it worked wonders. After that, I was good to go!! I made a pillow case for myself, messed up some,and then one for my kid. That one was better.Now I get to try and make one for the other kid and of course hubby wants one too!! But if you are a super Novice, like myself, I would recomend this Machine for you. I do plan on learning the art of making a quilt. But I'll start small for sure. It did come with extras also, like what was stated. Haven't messed with that part either. Just getting started and enjoying this little machine!
