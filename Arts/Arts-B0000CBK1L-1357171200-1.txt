review/summary: Use for hours a day!review/text: I sew for a living. I use this serger hours a day! LOVE the ruffling foot, easy to quickly change back and forth. I have another serger I use for rolled hems, so I don't have to remove needles... but I did try it out when I first got it and was beautiful as well. Such a great value! I suggest to everyone who asks me about a serger!
