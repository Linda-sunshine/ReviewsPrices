review/summary: Love my Brother 1034D sergerreview/text: Absolutely love it. It was an upgrade for me from a White serger of 1987. It is much, much easier to thread, and the knife can be moved without having to take it apart - there are a couple extra feet for it, the adjustments are easy to make, almost as easy as a sewing machine - the industry has definitely come a long way and this is a delightful improvement - and the price was quite agreeable as well.I chose to get it from Amazon because of their stand by the buyer policy in making sure the purchase went well, you got what it was you ordered, and that you are happy with it.
