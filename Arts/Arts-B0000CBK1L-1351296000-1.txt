review/summary: Easy sergerreview/text: This machine works as advertised. Inexpensive, easy to learn, and versatile. It is better than other entry level serger machines I've used. If you want more than entry level performance spend more. If you want a good basic machine with versatility don't spend any more time hunting around.
