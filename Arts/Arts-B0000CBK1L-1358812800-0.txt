review/summary: Love it!review/text: This serger is easy to thread and use and comes with optional feet (blind and gathering). It also uses regular thread and needles. i'm new to sewing/serging and appreciate the ease of having both machines for hemming, etc. The only con is that the instructional discs are CDs, not DVDs. I would buy this serger again!
