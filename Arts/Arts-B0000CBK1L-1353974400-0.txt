review/summary: got real fast but gift suprise blownreview/text: Well this review is not regarding the function of this product as I purchased this for a x mas gift for my wife. I got the thing extremely fast. No complaints. very amazed at how fast actually. Seems like it shipped from across the street or something.Now my complaint- When I ordered it asked if it was a gift and I specified it was. It asked if I wanted to submit a gift message. I did that also. So now today the thing is setting on my kitchen table when I wake up. My wife found the box outside on my steps and brought it in the house and set it on the table. So the way it shipped-usually when you get an item and you would think when it ships as a gift,it ships in a box which does not clearly specify what is in it. Well this came in no special brown shipping box or package . It shipped in a brother serger box with a big old photo of the serger right on the box along with detailed description of what is in it.So much for the suprise factor or the so called"ship as a gift option"
