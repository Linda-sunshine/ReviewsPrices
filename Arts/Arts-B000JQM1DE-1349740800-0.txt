review/summary: Works great - first day of usereview/text: I just bought this machine, I have never used a Brother sewing machine, but I have sewed on other types of machines way back before they became computerized. I was happy that I could set it up and get the thread all set up and start sewing within 25 minutes or so. I had to read the instruction book but it was clear to follow and everything went well. I tried a couple of different stitches and the machine works great, the pedal is easy to use (not too sensitive). I noticed that several layers of seams gave the machine some trouble and I had to move it forward myself off of the trouble spot, but it was a really thick mess so that's my fault. I was happy to be sewing so quickly in order to make a costume. If I encounter more issues I'll edit this entry. Thanks to the other reviewers who were helpful for me in making this choice.
