review/summary: Do not recommendreview/text: I purchased this product as gift for my mother for basic sewing but have been very unhappy with itAgree with the others who've had problems with jamming threads. I followed the helpful suggestions of others, yet it still jams just trying to do a simple straight stitch. It shouldn't be this hard.
