review/summary: Good machine but terrible instructions!review/text: I love having a serger! This is my first experience with one, so I'm still in a learning curve. There are a couple of things that stopped me from giving it a higher rating: First, the instructions provided aren't very good. They provide a DVD that is not at all helpful because the narrator blocks the view and it is in small screen mode and can't be made bigger. I had to search on youtube to find good instructions. It is pretty hard to figure out how to thread the loopers if you've never used one before! (I did call Brother, but the Customer Service Rep didn't help at all!) Second, it is pretty noisy! All in all it's a good machine for the money.
