review/summary: So easy to usereview/text: I picked this one after hearing how many problems people were having with their Singer Sergers. It comes pre-threaded with different colored string to easily show you how to thread it. There is also a dvd that shows how to do it, but I just followed the threads and was able to thread it on my first try in under 30 minutes. It works really well too. The only thing bad is the little trimming tray is hard to attach and too small. It has yet to yam on me or break thread since I re-threaded it.
