review/summary: Brother 1034d 3/4 sergerreview/text: Great serger for a great price. Just like what most of the reviews on this machine,,, wonderful.I was very cautious, because of all the threading combinations. But, Brother did something that was so useful in having the machine prethreaded and ready to go. It took all the scariness away. The videos were very helpful, The book was also helpful.I was up and running in minutes. I have had the machine for three weeks now. I completely rethreaded several times with different colored threads, no problems.Just serging away... having fun.
