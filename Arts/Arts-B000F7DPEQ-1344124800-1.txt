review/summary: Loving it!review/text: I am an amateur with sewing to say the least- this is the first sewing machine that I have ever owned/used. I really enjoy this machine- it is super easy to use! I had some difficulty when threading the needle but after studying the instruction booklet (which was very helpful) I figured out that I was more or less a complete moron and was doing it wrong. Now that I have it figured out, it is super easy to do. The only issues that I have had thus far were caused by operator error and lack of experience. I am excited to continue sewing with this machine especially now since i have a feel for it!Update: machine is still functioning wonderfully. Just a tip to others- be sure to use Brother bobbins as opposed to the generic ones. I had difficulty with the no-name ones despite them being the correct size, etc.
