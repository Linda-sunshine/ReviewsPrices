review/summary: Best little machine EVERreview/text: This was my first sewing machine. I have never sewed anything before. This machine is idiot proof for sure. Even though it is advanced and suppose to be an upgrade to one's first machine, it is really easy to use. I learned how to sew with it within the first couple of hours after it arrived. I have been sewing everyday since and this never gives me any problems. I love it!!! It can sew through dog collars of nylon or leather, as well as jeans,,,Heavy duty!
