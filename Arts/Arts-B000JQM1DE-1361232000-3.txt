review/summary: More than I expected for the pricereview/text: Since I was replacing a 30 year old machine, I was somewhat apprehensive about learning how to use a new machine, especially electronic but the instructions were fairly clear and easy to follow. Stitching was even and smooth, although I have only used the machine once.
