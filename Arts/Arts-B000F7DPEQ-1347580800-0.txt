review/summary: Great, beginner sewing machine!review/text: I wanted to begin sewing again after many, many, MANY years. After picking up the new IKEA sewing machine and returning it with a piece of fabric stuck in the works I decided to go with something more traditional. It was a decision between Singer and Brother and based on the reviews I read here I decided on this model; I liked that the main complaint was that the machine went either "slow or top speed". When I received this machine it was very easy to understand, yes the English and Spanish instructions follow each other (as opposed to having different pages) but after a very short time I got use to this format. The instructions are very user-friendly and threading the machine is so much easier than I remember when I last encountered my mother's machine (a Singer). I found NO problem controlling the speed of my machine and look forward to sewing up a storm in the future!
