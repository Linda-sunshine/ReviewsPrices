review/summary: Great beginner machine!review/text: The extent of my sewing experience is hemming tape and handsewing small projects. I have never owned or used a sewing machine. I bought this because it was inexpensive and I was going to learn to use it by the instruction book, online video, etc... I was up and running in 20 minutes, hemming pants in seconds. I am 5' tall so hemming is a necessity. I am kicking myself that I didn't buy a sewing machine years ago. I bought a beginner pattern for a skirt so I am going to tackle that next.Great value!!! Nice features, easy to use.
