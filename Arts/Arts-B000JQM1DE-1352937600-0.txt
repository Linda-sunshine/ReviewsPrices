review/summary: Very easy to use, LOVE the easy to load bobbin!!review/text: We bought this Brother CS6000i a year ago to replace a White Sewing machine we absolutely detested. The White was HORRIBLE to deal with loading the bobbin, the bobbin thread and sewing thread often broke, it was simply a nightmare and we stopped using it altogether. The White is so horrible no one wants that sewing machine; I've tried giving it away free a few times, NO ONE has picked it up, despite being FREE to a good home hence it's still sitting in my garage. Afterall we paid well over $200 for the pile of useless plastic so I hate to landfill the machine.In steps our new Brother CS6000i. A friend recently came over to help make new window treatments for our living room. Sight unseen, he unboxed the Brother CS6000i and within the evening our new window treatments were completely without any issues whatsoever. Pretty good for the first project on a previously unused machine.Since then we've used the Brother CS6000i for a number of other smaller projects, it's just such a breeze to use and so refreshing after the previous horrible experience. I've come to trust Brother for good quality products, it's amazing that quality extends into sewing machines. I grew up using a trusty old Singer which it too wasn't the easiest to load bobbins nor use and seemed rather temperamental. Brother has now become the name of quality for me.
