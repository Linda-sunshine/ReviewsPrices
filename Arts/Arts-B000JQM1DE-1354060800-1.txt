review/summary: Great machinereview/text: This Brother machine is everything that I'd hoped and more. The extra accessories that come with it including the wide quilt table made it easy to start quilting right out of the box. Ease of setup for the thread and bobbin are great time savers. I've had it for a couple months now and love it.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the needle change screw. It uses a flat head screwdriver in the throat area (very tight to get to) and tends to slip off the screw too much. Better design would make it perfect.
