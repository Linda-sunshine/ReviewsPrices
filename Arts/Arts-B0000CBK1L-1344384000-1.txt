review/summary: Everything We Expected ~review/text: Before purchasing this item, we shopped for Sergers at local sewing dealers and read many reviews online. I would say that 75% of the reviews were positive and people loved its usage and results. The other 25% had mentioned negativity toward the complexities in loading/stringing the thread paths. Well, we took a chance on this Brother model and found that it is the greatest machine. It performs exactly as we expected and operating it is very simple, if you only read the instructions and have a little patience, when learning the how-tos of operating this Brother 1034D Serger. :-)
