review/summary: Not recommendreview/text: This machine is no work horse. I have used for about a year now and have &#34;tossed&#34; it aside. It is too lightweight to handle any serious sewing. Might be good for a beginner just learning, but it didn't serve my purpose. Probably give it away since my local sewing repair shop says they see a lot of them and don't recommend them.
