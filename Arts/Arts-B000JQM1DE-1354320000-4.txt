review/summary: love this thing!!review/text: If you are looking for an affordable sewing machine that does alot this is the one! I recieved mine 3 days ago and have been sewing non stop... because it's so fun with this machine. I love the needle threader and the fact that it comes with so many different feet and accessories. The only thing is I wish the pedal cord was a little longer but you don't even need it with this if you don't want to use it. It has a start stop button. After using this I wish I had bought the 100 stitch machine!! Super light weight as compared to my old singer. Overall a great buy!!
