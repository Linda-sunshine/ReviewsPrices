review/summary: FANTASTIC machine for a semi-novice who'd used an old machinereview/text: I'm a purely novice sewer who's short so who needs to hem almost every trouser or pant that I buy, and aside from that - and making some basic 36" round dog beds - hasn't done much sewing. For many years, used a 1960s basic Singer inherited from an aunt. Would just (painstakingly) hand-finish any trouser hem. And would put up with the old Singer's tendency to cram and jam when crossing a double seam.Call me nave and stupid (coming from a 1960s machine), but this machine is MIRACULOUS. I wish there were 6 stars available. My favorite aspect is the needle-threader - What a joy! Second favorite aspect is the Speed selection - you can make it go soooooo slow, which is super-helpful if you are working a short piece of fabric or a stretchy fabric. There are many other Favorite aspects too - like the bobbin threader, etc.The best thing about this machine? The Owner's Manual -- It's terrific! It tells someone as novice as me how to set up & run the machine, then continues to explain some sewing basics.
