review/summary: Very rough and loud operation.review/text: The Brother 1034D Serger is very rough. Does not have a smooth flowing motor sound. Sounds like a loose belt or as if something is rubbing against other parts. It seems diffective. It almost seems as if I was issued a refurbished machine that was not completely repaired. I did not receive the bilingual operations manual nor the instructional CD. I would like to see if someone will get back to me on these items.I was out of the country for a few months and did not open the box until today. Returns expired at the end of July. Too bad because it would be on it's way back.This is the first time I have had a problem with an internet ordered item and I don't know exactly how to handle it.
