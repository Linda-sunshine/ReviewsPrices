review/summary: Sewing Machinereview/text: So easy to use. Love that you can set it to 3 different speeds for sewing. I tend to not sew straight and seem to sew straighter if I set my machine on slow. Love how easy it is to load the bobbin and that you can see when the bobbin is almost empty. Great sewing machine for beginners.
