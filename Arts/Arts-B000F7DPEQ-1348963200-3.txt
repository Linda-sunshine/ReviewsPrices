review/summary: still learningreview/text: I use for basic repairs and alterations- making seams hems etc. My only problem is I have to learn how to use on thick cloth. I have a friend who promised to show me the attachment to use for things like a double thickness of jeans at the bottom where the thickness then would be quadrupled. All in all works decently for the basics I use it for.
