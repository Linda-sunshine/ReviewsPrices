review/summary: I'm very satisfiedreview/text: I have been sowing for decades for my family. When my sowing machine finally broke after 30 yrs I purchased a cheap machine. It broke in 8 months! Then I bought this one and immediately felt the difference. I will say it is user-friendly, smooth, and quiet, and not too heavy to put away after each use.
