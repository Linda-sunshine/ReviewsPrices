review/summary: Don't waste your moneyreview/text: This serger was purchased as a Christmas gift in December of 2011. By August, it need repairs that were not covered under the "wonderful" warranty. When I took it to a reputable repair shop, I was told that it would be $200 to repair it. He explained how the machine is made so cheaply that it will have something else go wrong with it again. The machine does not handle any fabric thicker than 3 layers of cotton. Good luck making garments or anything with any type of bulk. When I spoke with the Brother Customer Service, worthless by the way, I was told I was out of luck. The nearest "certified" repair shop is over two hours away and the timing was not covered under the 5 year warranty. Be sure to read the fine print.
