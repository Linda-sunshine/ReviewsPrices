review/summary: Great dealreview/text: I bought this for my nine yr. old granddaughter. It was a great deal for the economical price. The instructions were easy to follow and the threading and drop-in bobbin system were easy enough for my granddaughter to accomplish on her own. As she becomes more comfortable with the basics of the machine, she can go on to more complicated stitches and sewing projects. Good investment!
