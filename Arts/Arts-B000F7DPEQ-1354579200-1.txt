review/summary: nice little sewing machinereview/text: this is a nice sewing machine,light enough to haul around when traveling .does little mend jobs quite well,has enough built in stitches to satisfy and do most jobs I want to do. Have a couple of "big expensive" machines that sometimes I would prefer not to use for some jobs(winding a lot of bobbins for my quilt machine) would recommend to anyone and if need be would purchase again as the price was more than reasonable ANSWER to tallgirls question.. set gray dial on orange "ss" for second row of stitch designs,there no size adjustment for these(that I can find)the numbers on the gray dial just adjust size of designs on first row.ALWAYS run a sample as you may want to reset tension
