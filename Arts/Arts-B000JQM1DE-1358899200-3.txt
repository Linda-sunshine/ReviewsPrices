review/summary: My Wife Loves Mereview/text: I bought this sewing machine as a gift for my wife's birthday and I think she called it "The best gift ever." I'm not sure since she was busying kissing up on me and being all happy.She's already used it several times and says it's very easy to set up and straight-forward. We haven't had any issues thus far. She'll even be using it to teach me how to sow soon and simple is very important for me since I'm sewing-impaired.Overall, a fantastic machine for a low cost.
