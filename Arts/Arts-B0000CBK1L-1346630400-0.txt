review/summary: Great Machine.review/text: Upon receiving my 1034D I was a bit reluctant to start using it as it looked rather complex. I have had it for about six months now and have enjoyed having it in my sewing area. It makes the finishing and seaming look flawless and is user friendly as far as I can tell. The fact that this machine came with three foot attachments was a huge plus for me. Due to the fact that it is priced so well, you can find quite a few blogs that use it and will tell you the settings for the machine depending on what the project is. Definitely a good purchase.
