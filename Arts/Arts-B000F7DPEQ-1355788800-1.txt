review/summary: I actually made stitches within an hourreview/text: I'm a 20 something year old female who had never before used a sewing machine. I decided I wanted to buy an organic blanket as a present for my mother, who has a &#34;furry person&#34; with server skin allergies. Organic blankets were so expensive, I thought I would make my own.So far I have only done a simple straight stitch on practice material. But, after some adjustments, I made a perfect stitch, just like I wanted. And it took less than an hour to set up, even though I have never even seen a machine being set up. Threading the machine was a bit complicated, but the instruction manual was clear, even if the Spanish instructions were mixed in with the English ones. And the instructions on the machine helped a lot.One drawback-- if I was older and had arthritis, bad vision, shaking hands, ect. this machine would have been impossible to thread. All in all, a great basic machine for a begging sewer planning to make basic use of it.
