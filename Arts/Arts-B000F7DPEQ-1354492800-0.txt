review/summary: Works as advertisedreview/text: Let me start by saying I do not sew... I have had need on a few occasion to sew. I grew up with a sewing machine in the house and it have missed having one around.I picked this unit because or price and brand. I am very satisfied with the choice. My 6 and 9 year old kids have been having fun making pillows for the holidays and I can finally hem those pants :)The unit is simple to use, easy to store, and seems very durable for my needs.
