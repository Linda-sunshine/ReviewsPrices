review/summary: I love itreview/text: Excellent machine. I've had 2 other Brother machines in the past and have always been pleased with them. This sews great and is a joy to use. Very good instruction manual so you can start sewing almost as soon as its out of the box. A lot of great things on the machine that you would find in a more expensive machine.
