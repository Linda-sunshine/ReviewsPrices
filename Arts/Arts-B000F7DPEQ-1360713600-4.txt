review/summary: Easy and Funreview/text: I did not know anything about sewing before I bought this machine. Between the manual and youtube videos about sewing, I have learned how to use my machine. I have had it for a year and have not had any problems at all with it. I would definitely recommend this machine to any sewing beginner. Just know that it cannot sew thick layers of material. You will need to buy the heavy and large needles. If you try to sew jean material or thick layers with the needles provided, they will break. You can find &#34;jean&#34; needles at walmart for only a few dollars.
