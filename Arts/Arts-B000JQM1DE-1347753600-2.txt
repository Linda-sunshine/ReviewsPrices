review/summary: Excellent Machinereview/text: I remember a few years ago buying a cheap, stripped-down Singer for about this price. It had no extra features and I never liked using it. For the past year I've just been sewing everything by hand, which can get pretty tedious. I finally decided I needed a better machine. I was very hesitant about buying a cheap one because of my experience with the Singer, but I saw all the good reviews so I bought this one. What a wonderful machine! Now I'm not afraid to sew buttons anymore!! :D I am really enjoying this--have yet to try the fancy stitches, but the buttonhole stitch alone is worth the price!The only problem I have is using the automatic threader. I am going to play around with it some more, but reading the instructions hasn't helped me get this feature to work correctly. The only reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five. If I get it to work, I'll feel bad about the four stars, but it is kind of hard to figure out.
