review/summary: Easy to use, right out of the box. I looooooovvveeee it.review/text: I've had several sewing machines and this one beats them hands down. Easy to use,easy to set up. The quick guide got me sewing almost immediately. The assortment of feet let me try all the features. The touch screen with showing what foot you needed for what stick was made for me.the variable speed button is excellently placed. The numbered system to thread and put the bobbin in, let my 11 year old daughter start to sew. Done several projects and very satisfied. Thinking of getting a fabric cutter just to keep up with my project ideas I have for this machine.
