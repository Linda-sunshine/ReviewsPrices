review/summary: Good machinereview/text: If you are a beginner, this is perfect because it is simple and easy to use. Having the correct tension is always important, and correct thread; each thread affects the stitch( PAY CLOSE ATTENTION). I waited to review because I wanted to present my flaws as well. I have non at this time.So far it is working beautifully and I have made jackets skirts and dresses from this machine on all type of fabric.This product is worth every penny.
