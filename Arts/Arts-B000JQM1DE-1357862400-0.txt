review/summary: Can't stop sewing!!!review/text: Now I see why I can never find this item in stock at the Wal-marts in my area. This sewing machine is absolute fun, easy to use. The instruction manual is easy to read and thorough. The machine is quiet, strong and sturdy, comes with many attachments and you are ready to sew as soon as you take it out of the box. I am a light sewer, I have sewn a few projects in my lifetime but sew about once or twice a year and didn't have any trouble getting started, however I can't seem to stop now.
