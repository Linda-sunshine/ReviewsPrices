review/summary: Very Hard To Lean How to Usereview/text: Because the videos are outdated and out of sequence, and the manual is difficult to follow (for example there are sometimes more steps illustrated then described in the written steps, and the illustrated and written steps are often on different pages), it is hard to get up and running, especially if you have to rethread the machine (I'm on my 5th try). I had to look online for more helpful information/videos and just ordered a book (The Complete Serger Handbook) so I hope that helps. I have been sewing for many years and have never been so frustrated with a machine.
