review/summary: Truly greatreview/text: OMG, this machine has completely changed my life. I can do everything faster and better. I heard it was tricky to thread but had no trouble at all, especially after watching a couple of tutorial videos on YT. Also, learning how to tie on thread so you don't have to rethread all the time has helped. I do with the DVD was watchable on a Mac....and the Brother videos I found on YT seem a bit dated. But, SO glad I purchased it!
