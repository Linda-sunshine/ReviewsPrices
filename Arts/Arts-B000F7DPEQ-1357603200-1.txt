review/summary: Doesn't sew heavy fabrics...pshhh, YEAH!!review/text: I am a guy and admit I don know ALOT about sewing machines but I grew up watching my great Grandmother sew EVERYTHING and my Home Economics class was one of my best grades in high school because I could use a machine and was always interested. I mean it IS a power tool right? Anyways I do all of the sewing around the house because my wife can't sew a stitch to save her life so I figured it was time for a machine. I had read all of the reviews about this little jem and it seemed that the one glaring negative was it's inability to sew heavy fabrics but I decided to pull the trigger regardless. Well let me say that this machine CAN and HAS sewn H E A V Y fabric and did so like a champ! I have a friend who recently shipped out for Afghanistan and needed a clip board that would strap to his leg for Medevac requests so he had it handy and a writing surface if he needed it in a pinch. I went to Joann's and decided on "Duck Canvas" which is fairly tough. I began sewing and was anxious to see the result. After doubling and tripling seams, sewing through 8 layers of thick canvas at times it never missed a beat!!! I even had velcro over some of those 8 layer canvas parts, NOT 1 HICCUP!! Just out of curiosity I tried my wifes Grandmothers 40 year old Singer (which I've heard are the "workhorses") and it didn't come close!! So if you're worried about thick fabric....DON'T BE!!! The ONLY problem I had was the presser foot being too low causing some hand turns of the wheel to help with feeding but I have not sat at a machine that was any better (including the singer) LOOOVE this machine!!! For the money I'd give it 20 stars if I could!!
