review/summary: Sewing like a &#34;Pro&#34;review/text: I love, love love my new machine!!! I thought something was wrong with the needle threader, becuz I was used to it raising up above the top of the machine; but when I was standing over the machine looking down at it, I saw it was just a different type of threader, threaded it in seconds,and didn't have to return the machine!! WOOHOO !!
