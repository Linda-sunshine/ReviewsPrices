review/summary: Love itreview/text: This machine is so easy to use and offers so much functionality i could not believe it when i started playing with it. It is great. Last time i have used a machine, i was 14 years old, now many years later i was somewhat intimidated to try (i was not that great to begin with and machine i used back then was a very old singer with a mechanical pedal and other unwieldy features) when i finally dared to try this Brother i was up and running in 15 minutes (most of the time spent reading through the manual).Easy, smooth, functional, price is awesome too.Love it.If there would be one thing i could change it would be the case. It is just a drop over cover, it does not really lock in place or covers the machine too well, there are open areas through which dust and such can get in, but it does the job of protecting the machine from nudges and prods. i would have preferred a case that was lockable and covered the machine entirely.Machine itself is beyond reproach for an amateur user like me.
