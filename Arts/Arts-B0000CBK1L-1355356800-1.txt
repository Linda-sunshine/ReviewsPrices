review/summary: Never buy from Amazonreview/text: I have intermediate sewing experience and have used several machines in the past. So my issues with this serger has got nothing to do with incorrect threading or tensions. This serger worked just fine for 2 -3 months and now i cant get to serge even 10 inches of length without having to re-thread.I am never going to buy machines from Amazon even if they are 10% cheaper on Amazon. In the last 2 years, my serger, sewing machine, 2 cameras and printer all have had problems although I bought them all &#34;new&#34; and had seen good product reviews. And if I need to get it fixed, there is additional amount involved with shipping etc. I so wish i had spent a little more and just bought from a local store.
