review/summary: Marvellous!review/text: I just took up sewing again after almost ten years. Needless to say, I am a bit rusty and have a lot to brush up on. I decided to purchase this machine because my old one always gave me a lot of trouble and I knew that if I started sewing with it again I would quickly give up. So far, I've successfully used this machine to sew cotton, polyester, denim, wool, and silk dupioni tops and skirts, as well as drapes.Pros- Easy to use- Very informative instruction manual- LCD tells you what presser foot to use when you select a stitch- Inexpensive- Many different stitch optionsCons- None so far...(NOTE: This is not really a con, but I did notice that the thread will bunch up if you use cheap thread, i.e., the ones you buy at the dollar store).I'm really hard pressed to find anything that I don't like about this machine. (However, I don't do any embroidery or quilting, so I don't know how it works for those types of work.) My dad, who does his own alterations on his suits, has used the machine and adores it as well.All in all, I think this is a great machine for beginners/novice and occasional sewers, as well I would recommend it for intermediate/advanced sewers who want to have another sewing machine on hand for when their more advanced one is being serviced.
