review/summary: all plastic innards do not provide work horse capability; for plastic machine, it is a great valuereview/text: update: i sewed on this machine for 7 months. at the end of seven months, the plastic makings of this machine simply could not hold up to my intense sessions of doing fiber art on it. we had to switch to a machine with metal innards that was just stronger straight across the board. it is an industrial machine and it only straight stitches. i found out i do not need all these extras on a machine but instead need a workhorse of a machine which does straight stitching hour after hour, day after day, etc., and holds up to the hard use. that is not this machine. however, this is not the intended use of the machine so it may well be still 4.5 or 5 stars for someone who does not need a work horse machine. i did learn on sewing forums online that sewers who want workhorse machines in general do not buy plastic machines.my original review is below:there are over a thousand reviews on this product and the amazon consumer reviewers have given it a 4.5+ rating collectively. I cannot add much to what they have said. However, I have just resumed sewing after many years of not sewing. This machine made it just like getting back on a bike after years of not riding. I've only owned it a few months and have already turned out lots of projects. make sure you register on the Brother website as it has online virtually all of the info you might need to solve minor problems with it. i don't really use all of these special features as i do fiber art projects. the main thing i need day in and day out is straight stitching which just keeps going and going through many layers of fabric without breaking down. this machine does that. if you are a fiber artist, it should meet your needs.
