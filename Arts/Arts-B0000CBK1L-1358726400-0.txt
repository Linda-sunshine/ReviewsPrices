review/summary: Awesome Sergerreview/text: This machine is wonderful. Don't let anyone fool, threading it is a breeze. it came threaded and before I started I tracked all the threads to see their layout. i even took a few pictures. The instructions are not that good so don't wait until you need them. Once i broke a thread or ran out, I was very confident in rethreading.For the money, this is a great buy!
