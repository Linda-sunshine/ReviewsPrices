review/summary: It is everything it is advertised.review/text: I received my machine in just a few days, exactly as advertised. I have not had a new machine since 1989 when i had a Singer that cost $1500. This machine so outperforms the Singer. The technology has come so far it is amazing. I am thrilled with it as it will do everything I need if I am mending a seam or making a new Santa Claus suit for the hubby. What a dream machine. I am so glad the old one broke and I purchased this one at 1/10 the cost.
