review/summary: Difficult Machine in Every Wayreview/text: I am a long-time sewer and have previously owned a Bernette serger, made by Juki, from the 90's. I sewed hundreds of hours, everything from upholstery to lingerie, on that serger and wore it out. A few years ago I purchased this machine, after reading so many positive reviews. My experience, in comparison to what I had been accustomed to with my Bernette, is that this machine is difficult in almost every way. It runs like a tractor, its tension is often in need of adjustment, threading can be a nightmare, it tends to "chew-up" light fabrics and I find that I rarely use it. I've gone back to zig-zagging most of my seams and will buy something else as soon as I can. If you are planning on purchasing a serger and are an entry-level purchaser, I would recommend a basic Babylock or Juki. If you are buying a second machine, as I did, I recommend that you save up for a machine that you can enjoy. It might be more money up front, but I've discovered the hard way that you do get what you pay for in a serger. The bottom line is that I wouldn't recommend this serger to anybody.
