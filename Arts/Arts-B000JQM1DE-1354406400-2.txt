review/summary: Should have gotten one soonerreview/text: I have used my Brother machine now for 2 months and very satisfied. A lot better than my old lotus sewing machine. I just wish I had gotten one sooner. It is an easy machine to use, such as bobbin winding and loading. Setting your stitches is simple, just read your manual. Easy to read directions and illustrations. The only negitive is maybe its a little to light. When I press the button for reverse, a few times I actually moved the machine. But compared to my heavy old lotus that always gave me grief, I'll take the lighter Brother any day. Don't mind sewing anymore!
