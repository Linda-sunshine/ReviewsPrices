review/summary: What a good little machinereview/text: I bought the for my newly married granddaughter. She asked to use mine but I have been having problems with it and thought she would get discouraged. When it came I figured out how to thread it and the general workings of it. I was very surprised by how well it worked. My machine cost a$1000.00 in1975 and was a very good machine. This Brother runs as well and the price was very affordable. My granddaughter is just learning to sew and I'm comfortable knowing that she has a machine that is so easy to use.
