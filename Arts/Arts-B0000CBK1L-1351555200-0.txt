review/summary: Don't Buy This Machine!review/text: ....unless, of course, you love to thread and re-thread your serger. I've had this machine for many months now and it has design flaws that are extremely annoying. First, if you're serging a narrow seam, the scrap fabric goes inside machine. So, it requires that you constantly open the door and clean out the scraps and debris left behind from the material. Second, the lower looper thread breaks OFTEN! The thread is inserted through a slide out mechanism that is supposed to make life easier, however, the thread gets stuck after a couple hours of serging and breaks off. SO, you have to stop, rip your partial seam and re-thread. It's very tricky to get the thread inserted properly so that it doesn't break again, and again, and again.By the way, the first of these sergers I received froze up after 20 minutes of use. I returned that and replaced it with this one. Should have purchased another brand. I have a Brother Disney embroidery machine that is also absolute junk. Will NEVER buy another Brother product.
