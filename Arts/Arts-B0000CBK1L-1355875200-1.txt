review/summary: SewingMachineAnniereview/text: I've been sewing for nearly 40 years. This is my first serger, and it was bought as a Christmas gift for me last year. I am very happy with this machine and would recommend it to anyone wanting to buy a serger. I have had little to no problems, and the problems that I've had have only been operator error ( i.e. the thread tree not being pulled all the way up!) I have waited this long to write a review, because I truly wanted to put this machine to the test. My current project is a set of eight patio cushions. These are made from a heavy cotton weave material and include cording around the edges of each cushion. Yes, I have serged through four to five layers of this thickness of fabric, with no problems.Threading this machine is idiot-proof because of the diagram on the inside of the machine, and it is color coded, they couldn't have made it any easier for us! But, I rarely need to thread it completely. I generally clip the threads up by the thread tree, change the thread cone, place the thread condom over the thread cone, thread the thread through the hole in the thread tree and then tie a square knot with the old thread. I do this for all four of the threads and then run the stitching out until the new color serges. The square knots do not effect the serging at all.I hope this review is helpful to anyone thinking about purchasing this product. I'm a happy customer!
