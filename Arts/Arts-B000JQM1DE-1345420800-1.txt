review/summary: UK CUSTOMERreview/text: its not that I hate this machine I never got chance to use it!!!!! I was very excited to receive my machine and read the manual as I knew it was from the states and that the power source was different. The manual is very vague about changing the plug and did not make it clear you need a TRANSFORMER to change from 220 to 240 in the UK. I took it to a hardware store that advised an adaptor of which I used and my machine blew up. SUPPLIERS I WANT TO BUY ANOTHER BUT PLEASE GIVE ME A DISCOUNTED PRICE AS YOU DID NOT MAKE IT CLEAR THAT A TRANSFORMER IS NEEDED TO OPERATE THIS MACHINE IN THE UK! I SHOULD GET IT FREE AS IT IS DANGEROUS TO SUPPLY THIS MACHINE TO THE UK WITHOUT ADVISING A TRANSFORMER IS NEEDED!
