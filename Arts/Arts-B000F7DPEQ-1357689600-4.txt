review/summary: Not bad for the pricereview/text: I didn't know if I wanted to get back into sewing, so I chose this inexpensive machine last spring. I got into quilting this fall, and even though the throat is too narrow for comfortable quilting, it does work. It took me a few tries to get the hang of catching the bobbin thread in the hidden spring. Hint: your bobbin thread will look like it is crossing the top of the bobbin when it is caught correctly, once you pull it up with the upper thread. If you decide to quilt, be sure to get the Brother walking foot. I was referred to a local shop, and while I like to support local stores when I can, they fitted my machine with a generic walking foot that caused me endless problems. Very frustrating! Finally just got on good old Amazon and got the correct foot, and it works like a dream. I hope to upgrade to a better machine someday for bigger quilting projects, but for the price, this is a good machine, and it's relatively portable for classes.
