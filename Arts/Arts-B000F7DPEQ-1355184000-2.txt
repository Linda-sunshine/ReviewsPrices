review/summary: The thought was there....review/text: I like this machine and all its functions but the thread was always getting snagged. Also the instructions do not explain that when threading the thread there is a location (the long slit on the picture running from the top to the bottom) where the thread has to be hooked onto a very small unnoticable hook. If you don't mind stopping and fixing these problems every couple of minutes than your fine.
