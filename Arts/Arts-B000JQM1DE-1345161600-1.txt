review/summary: WARNING!!! NOT GOOD FOR HEAVY FABRICS!!review/text: I bought this machine to replace a much heavier and larger machine that I gave away as I no longer have the space for it.This is an ok machine for the price. BUT!, if you are like me and a frequent use for your machine is hemming jeans then this is NOT a good choice. Even on light denims it chokes, badly.Even with a fresh, specifically denim needle, the right thread, etc. etc., it just jams almost every time. It simply does not have the force to go through layers of heavy fabric.If you are only doing light weight fabrics this machine does a lot for the price. For heavy, you simply need a much heavier machine.
