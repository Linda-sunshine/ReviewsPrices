review/summary: Sew WHAT?review/text: Being a rather simple person, I wanted an inexpensive sewing machine to do very simple things. Just the basics. I have not yet had the chance to experiment much with this ... but it comes with many more bells and whistles than I had even anticipated. A great machine for novices -- with simple to understand instructions.
