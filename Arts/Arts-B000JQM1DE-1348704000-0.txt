review/summary: GoodPutchasereview/text: Easy machine to operate. If you simply need a machine with not a lot of fancy extra stuff you are not likely use- this is the machine for you. The price was right and I have notopped sewing since I got it. One problem-the self threader-still trying to figure that one out
