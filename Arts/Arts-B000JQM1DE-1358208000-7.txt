review/summary: Great machinereview/text: I bought this machine for my daughter. She is a beginner. It has a very pretty stitch and is quiet. She is taking a sewing class and it is very easy for her to carry to class. My daughter has not complained about the performance and seems to be very happy with this machine. I have been sewing for over 40 years and have watched sewing machines go from heavy metal to light weight plastic. A little too much plastic, I think. This machine is very versatile for the money and easy to operate. I think it was a great choice.
