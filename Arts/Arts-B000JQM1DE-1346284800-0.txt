review/summary: Brother CS6000i Sewing Machinereview/text: This machine replaced an old Singer passed down from my mother. The Brother is a wonderful sewing machine and easy to use. I love the arm as it allows better control over large pieces of material. The different stitches are really easy to set up and use. Over all very happy with my purchase and look forward to many sewing projects.
