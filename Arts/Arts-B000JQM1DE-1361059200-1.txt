review/summary: Its a very lite machine.review/text: A few months ago I purchased the Singer anniversary machine. It is loud and I have not really enjoyed sewing with it. So when I saw this machine at such a reasonable price with so many extras I decided to try it. When I got it out of the box I was surprised by its weight, it seems very lite for its amount of functions. It offers several things my new singer does not have and it comes with all the extra feet I will ever need! I paid close to 450.00 for my singer and with delivery this machine is much less expensive.I have tried sewing jeans and it does 4 layers like butter. I really enjoyed the sewing so I am sure my new singer will be up for sale soon. Thank-you!
