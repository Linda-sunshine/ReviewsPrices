review/summary: My favorite sewing machinereview/text: I am a seamstress, sewing clothing and household items. This machine is a dream. Due to the light weight, I can take it with me if a project is large or better sewn on-sight.I love the touch button sewing which negates the need for foot control. When sewing huge curtains for our local community theater, I was able to sew them on the floor since I didn't need a table for the foot control...much easier. Simple to learn. The wide variety of stitches allows you to customize your project with creative designs if you chose.I've owned this machine many years and will purchase a new one once I wear out the current machine (not too far off I'm afraid).
