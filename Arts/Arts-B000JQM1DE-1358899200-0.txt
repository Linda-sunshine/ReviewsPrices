review/summary: Great value for the pricereview/text: For the money this sewing machine has lots of capabilities. I have not done a lot of experimenting yet but so far I like this machine. It is light-weight and easy to set up and to move. It seems to sew evenly. I'm not fond of the plastic bobbins which seem pretty thin, but so far have not had a problem with them.
