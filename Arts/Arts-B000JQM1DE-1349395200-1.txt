review/summary: Easy machine for light sewingreview/text: This is an affordable, easy to use, lightweight machine with many decorative stich options. However, I use a sewing machine almost every day for a variety of sewing projects, and have had to return/replace this machine 3 times already because it could not stand up to the regular use. It struggles when anything other than light weight fabric is used and is highly sensitive signaling errors often.For infrequent, light sewing, this should be a good choice, but for anything more, I recommend saving for something stronger.
