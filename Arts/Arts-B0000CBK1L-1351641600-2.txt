review/summary: Great for a first serger but annoyingly LOUDreview/text: It's easy to thread, use and is ready out of the box. The only downside is it squeals like a pig...a very loud pig. Even when you go slow. At first I thought that I'd forgotten to oil something but nope, it's just loud. I won't return it because other than the noise, it serges like a dream.
