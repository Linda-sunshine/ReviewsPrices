review/summary: WONDERFUL!review/text: I have sewn before... I had a Singer Sewing Machine that I could NOT figure out for the life of me (too Complicated, very hard to understand...and so very fast) This machine is great for when you are just starting out but It won't get boring once you know what you are doing. It has 3 settings for speed which really helps when you are trying to sew something tedious and complicated. I love having all of the different stitches even though I'm still learning what they are good for. I read a lot of complaints about the LED light... In my opinion that is just supposed to show where the needle hole is Not to give you actual light for sewing and it does about as much as you would expect a single bulb LED light would do. I have recommended this machine to MANY people and will continue to use it until it poops out on me.
