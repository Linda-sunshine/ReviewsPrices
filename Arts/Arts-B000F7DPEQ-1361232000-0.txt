review/summary: Good machine for the moneyreview/text: My wife had been struggling with an old clunker and I got tired of watching her fighting the machine more than she was sewing. She also doesn't like all the gadgets on those computerized models so I went with this and I'm glad I did.It's NOT for sewing through heavy material and even though it does do some neat stitches I found she doesn't need them, she does basic sewing.She still gets frustrated but not nearly as much and the machine is much quieter, lighter, and easier to use than her old one. Now she can actually sew more than fight a machine which is why I purchased it.
