review/summary: Great Machine For Beginner Sewersreview/text: I've had this machine for at least 6 months now and have used it to fix clothing, sew up dress-pant legs, make a purse for one of my friends, and created a period-correct dress for an SCA event. Hasn't given me any trouble so far.Easy to use and I especially love the automatic threading - keep in mind you still have to thread the needle, but it will gather both the bottom stitch and the top stitch together for you.The only things I can think of that you might want to know before you purchase it is that:1) The needle stays in the fabric once you quit sewing to help you if you need to turn a corner. You simply have to press a button to draw it up (no need to turn the wheel on the side, but you can do that if it makes you feel better :P)2) In order to back-stitch, it only lets you press a button once and the machine will back-stitch one stitch. You can't hold it down and press the pedal - it only goes one at a time. May be a draw back for some so I thought I'd mention it. What it does have is handy and precise.3) Three speeds - Yay! Love it. Some times you need a more precise stitch at a lower speed but you're still a lead foot...no troubles with the speed setter!So great that I recommended this exact machine to my mother and now she owns one as well and is in love with it!
