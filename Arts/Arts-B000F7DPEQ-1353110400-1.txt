review/summary: Great Little Machinereview/text: For my first sewing machine of my own, I was looking for something that was lightweight, userfriendly, and an overall decent machine for an affordable price. I got all of that with this machine. My only wish is that it handled heavier projects a little easier, but I'm going to purchase the quilting foot as I'm sure that will help a great deal.Great price, great item, no complaints here!
