review/summary: Brand new to sewing/quiltingreview/text: I didn't want to invest a lot of money into a brand new hobby. I saw good reviews on this machine, so I ordered it online. I absolutely love it. Super light...I can take it back and forth to quilting class and our cabin with no problem. I love the max speed control, I can just step on the pedal and it goes the same speed every time....one less thing to think about. I have used a couple other sewing machines at in the last couple months.....really like this one the best of those.
