review/summary: Lightweight Workhorse...fabulous!review/text: Don't let it's light frame mislead you...this machine is a steal for the price and how well it works. I was leery about getting a computerized machine, but I truly love it.I do approx. 2-3 hours sewing on it 3-4 days a week and somedays more. It keeps up, stitches SO straight. I sew mainly linen, tea towels, pillows, napkins etc.PROS...MY FAVSEASY BOBBIN LOADER, FOOLPROOF!ADJUSTABLE SPEED- love the slower speed for smaller pieces or detailed stitchingGREAT STITCHES TO CHOOSE FROM- didn't think I would use them, but I'm having a great time with them...love the overlock stitchCONS...minorNot as quiet as promised, when I'm running it one the highest speed, which is most always, I can't carry on a conversation. Slower is quieter.If you do not follow the directions to a T on how to thread the machine, you will have problems. READ YOUR MANUAL. I've been sewing since I was a young girl, and I still learned something new.Needle threader worked great at first but now, it's really hit and miss. Seems a bit rickety.Overall, I felt like I got way more for my money. This is my second Brother machine.
