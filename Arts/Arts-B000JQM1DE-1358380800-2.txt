review/summary: I love this machine!review/text: This is the first time I've been able to use this machine since I purchased it, and I love it. It sews like a dream and the stitch length, speed of sewing, and stitch type are so easy to set. It comes equipped with an automatic needle threader, which is a lifesaver- or should I say sightsaver- for these old eyes. Once the bobbin is installed, you don't have to pull the bobbin thread up to the top as with many older machines; although you have the option to do so if desired. The light is an LED type, so there is plenty of light right on your work, as well as a convenient thread cutter right on the machine- no searching for the elusive pair of scissors which seem to disappear just when needed. The manual is very straight-forward, well illustrated and concise, very easy to understand even for a beginning sewer. The bobbin installation guide as well as the guide to the threading of the machine and winding of the bobbin are printed right on the machine itself; so, if the manual is not available at the moment these instructions come in handy. I wouldn't think of going back to my old sewing machine after using this one!
