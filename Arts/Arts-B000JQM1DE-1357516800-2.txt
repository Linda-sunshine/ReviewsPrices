review/summary: Great Machine! Does exactly what I need it to and then some.review/text: I purchased the machine because it had great ratings. The machine came with an adequate amount of accessories. The machine is very easy to use and does exactly what I need it to. The machine is easy to trouble shoot when it gets stuck. The # of stitches that are possible is quit impressive. The machine was a bargain. I would definitely recommend this machine for anyone doing quick and simple DIY sewing projects. I will add more comments as I continue to explore the machine's possibilities.
