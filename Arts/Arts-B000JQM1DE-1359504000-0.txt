review/summary: Works Great for Daily Usereview/text: When I first got married, I had my mom's old Kenmore sewing machine, that hadn't been that nice 30 years earlier and definitely wasn't then. It jammed constantly and had a lot of other issues and was so frustrating to use. I was starting to have babies and had taken up sewing cloth diapers, blankets, and other things for them and I needed a reliable sewing machine that was easy to use, worked without jamming, had a three-step zig-zag (important for diaper making), and was reasonably priced. My MIL, who quilts, tried to sell me on her $2000 Bernina but that was just out of my price range and too complicated. After much research, I settled on this machine.That was four years or so ago. It has worked great. I have sewn literally dozens of diapers and they have held up beautifully because they are well-sewn. It has very rarely jammed and was easily fixed if it did. It threads easily. It has dealt with my kids (now a bit older) pounding on it and playing with it at times and still works great. I use PUL in my diapers, which is slippery to sew, but this machine does great with it. I sewed a gigantic denim and fleece blanket and the machine handled that too. There really hasn't been a project yet that it hasn't done. Not to mention it's very affordable!If you want to start sewing and need a basic workhorse machine, this is it.
