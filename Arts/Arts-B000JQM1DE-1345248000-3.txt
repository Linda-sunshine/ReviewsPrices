review/summary: It's a shame, really ....review/text: I, like many others, had high hopes for this machine. It worked for one day, and for that day it worked beautifully. Then I kept getting a warning that the thread was tangled, when the thread was not in fact tangled. I ended up returning it for another Brother model at a comparable price (I think it's the 7500 or something) and it has been working perfectly for months.
