review/summary: Second Machinereview/text: This is my second serger. 3 years ago when I received my serger it was threaded correctly and I started useing it immediately. This machine came with the thread tangled and knotted. I could not get it to thread properly and working. I took it to a Brothers dealer and had it checked out. It was just missed threaded, but if the machine was not threaded right when it was at the factory shouldn't the inspector had noticed the problem and fixed it? When running the first machine it sounds like a quality running machine but this machine sounds tinney when it is running. I have only had it for 2 months so I hope it works as well as the other machine. I use both machine all the time.
