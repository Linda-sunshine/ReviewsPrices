review/summary: Just what I needed and expected!review/text: I'm totally new to sewing and especially using a serger. Even though it was the first time I was seeing a serger in front of me, I was completely at ease and was able to use it right away. Of course, the machine came already threaded, but still I was amazed at how easy it was to use it. I definitely recommend it to anyone considering buying one for home use. It does the job, it looks nice, and it is very light to carry around. Two thumbs up!
