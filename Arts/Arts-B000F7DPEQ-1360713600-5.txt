review/summary: Perfect entry level for quilting.review/text: The girlfriend wanted to start quilting so I picked this up for her. She loves it and has yet to let her down. It has various functions and abilities that allow her to keep going with her first ever quilt. The only negative I have heard her say is that sometimes the bobbin gets wound to tight or to loose.
