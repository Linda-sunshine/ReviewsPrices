review/summary: LOVE it so far!review/text: i must apologize for my other review on this machine this actually IS the model i bought and have, it was a different one that i returned. OPPS! anyway the other day i took out the machine and manual and set it up to use for the first time, this is the first time i have ever had a computerized machine ( i was a bit hesitant, used to the "old" ways!) i am AMAZED... the one i got has the table that attaches and i also ordered another case (didnt need to but for travel its good) this comes with a very nive cover that will do just fine while its out at home, its pretty light (machine) but doesnt seem to move aorund much which i like alot.so far so good , im excited to have a nice machine like this that has so many cool features! this is the first time iever SAW a needle threader, and it actually WORKS! (blew my mind really!) everything about the machine seems to be solid and in perfect working order right out of the box. im very VERY happy with this purcahse and the price was just fine for my budget.
