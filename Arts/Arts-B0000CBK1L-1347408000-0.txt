review/summary: LOVE my sergerreview/text: This is my first serger and I love it. It was a little tricky to thread but I found some great videos on Youtube that helped alot. It has worked great ever since and I can't believe I have been sewing so long without a serger. I am a big fan of Brother. I have a Brother sewing machine (HE-120) and a printer (MFC 490CW) and both work great and I have had them for 5 and 6 years respectively. Whenever I have a problem I can email brother and they get right back to me with help. My problem is usually solved with one email but sometimes it takes more but it is always solved.This serger was ordered as a replacement for one I purchased the week before from an independent seller. The first machine was not functional and Amazon helped me order a new one (from them) and upgraded me to one day shipping. The replacement has worked like a dream since I unpacked it. I am still learning all about it.
