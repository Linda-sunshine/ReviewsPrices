review/summary: PRACTICAL, NICE MACHINE - Easy to thread & sew withreview/text: I owned my previous Brother sewing machine for over twenty years (purchased the month before I was married - at my mother's suggestion) and just recently realized that it would be more cost effective to buy a new one than have the timing belt in my "old" machine repaired.This machine is very straight forward and practical. I sewed several medium weight fabrics and several patches on a scout shirt (that is fairly "heavy duty" - just short of a denim weight with both shirt and patches combined) today, and it did great.I had no difficulty threading the top or bobbin. In fact, there is a "quick start" instructional page that gets you rolling along in five minutes.One other note about Brother, that I found with my previous machine and greatly influenced my decision to buy this one: They have very helpful customer service and sell replacement parts for a fair price. This is (unfortunately) becoming a rarity with so many companies.Happy Sewing! :)
