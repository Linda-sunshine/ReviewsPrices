review/summary: product reviewreview/text: It's another Brother for my sewing room.....still learning what it can do......have figured out how to use the gather function and have used that for a Christmas gift....really came out well......will continue to work with manual and machine until I know it better......had no problem learning how to thread it, which I feared......Brother took care of that with their design....piece of cake.....even for an older person......
