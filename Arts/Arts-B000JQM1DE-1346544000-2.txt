review/summary: Nice machine, but not for mereview/text: I'm new to sewing and bought this machine after my first series of classes. I was torn between Singer and Brother, but all of my research said Brother was the way to go, and the reviews for this machine were terrific. The only issue that I saw consistently mentioned was with tension.The CS6000i has a lot of nifty features, and I was super excited when it arrived. I used it for about a week, hemming some projects from class and trying to sew a little over-the-shoulder bag to travel with. Things were fine at first, and then I started having the aforementioned tension issue. I followed the instructions in the troubleshooting guide, but wasn't able to correct the problem, so I returned the machine (with no hassle!). I'm sure someone with more experience could have fixed the problem, but I thought, with my inexperience, that I should have a machine that I didn't have to fix.
