review/summary: This is good machine by Brothers for the price.review/text: This is a good machine by Brothers for the price. It came with a few attachments which, I have found most useful. I do like the machine it has many features that are helpful to many projects. The manual is helpful and quite detailed.My previous machine (Singer) did not have these issues. I had it for over 30 years, as with anything time, wear and tear take a toll on it and could not get the simplest of parts for it any longer. Hence the need for a new machine. It was also better constructed with metal casing and parts. Not the cost cutting plastic that things are made of these days.However, I have encountered a few drawbacks to this machine. I have not figured out why the tension on this model will not work correctly. It keeps loosing it strength no matter how, I adjust the tension. I have rest all dials, remove the bobbin and re-thread over and over again to get it back to where it was. This is most annoying and inconvenient especially when your trying to complete my projects. I have had an experienced sewing machine mechanic look at it and he stated there is nothing he can do to fix the problem. In addition the secondary spool spindle will not stay in its hole. I put the spool of thread on it, as soon as I start sewing it pops off the machine. The only option, I can see to fix that would be gluing the spindle to the machine. It also make a thumping sound when sewing at higher speed. Overall if your budget is tight and you need a machine this is a good one for its price.
