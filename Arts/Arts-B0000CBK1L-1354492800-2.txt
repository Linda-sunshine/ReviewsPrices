review/summary: Great price for this machinereview/text: I am very pleased with the brother 1034D. I have never used a serger before so it will take me a little while to get used to it..I am not a big time sew person, so this will fit into my sewing program perfectly for the small projects that I want to do. Sure beats hand hemming the edges!! Your price was much better than several different stores that were offering this same machine as a holiday special.. Thanks you so much.
