review/summary: Affordable and efficient basic machinereview/text: I purchased an XL2600i to do basic sewing tasks and so far, it fills the bill perfectly. It is straightforward and I had no problems with the user's manual's directions. The traditional bobbin winding (on the top of the machine, not in the bobbin case) was something I really wanted. I haven't had any problems with &#34;birds' nests&#34; of thread. To be fair I have not put it to any really severe tests (such as multiple layers of very thick fabric) but it handled the alteration of the waistband on a pair of men's suit pants with no problem (which did involve several layers of material). I also assembled a Christmas stocking using heavy velveteen for the backing. This involved making bias cording and sewing those layers plus the linen stocking front plus 4 layers of velveteen for a turned &#34;loop&#34; for hanging the stocking up -- and it managed to do all that. You just need to take it slow.The machine comes with all the basic accessory feet -- the only one I will probably add is a clear foot, which I got used to using on my now-deceased Elna Supermatic that I've had for decades. (The Elna is repairable but it would have cost 2.5 times what this machine cost to get it running again, and I'd still have to be switching cams. And buttonholes -- forget it.)The one comment someone made about being careful taking the tape off the green on the front of the machine is very true. I was (I thought) careful, but at two places, the green separated a little bit. I think heating the green &#34;label&#34; with a hairdryer might make it possible to fix this small problem.
