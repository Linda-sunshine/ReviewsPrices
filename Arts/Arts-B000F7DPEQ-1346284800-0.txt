review/summary: brother sewing machine 25 stitchreview/text: Machine instructions are extremely confusing because the manufacture refers to different models in the same manual. So this machine is not for begineers. Even the simplified guide is confusing. The only successful thing I was able to do was thread the bobin and the needle. After sucessfully threading the bobin, you have to move this switch back into the position for sewing. When I did so and pressed on the foot pedal, the needle would no longer move. The motor would run but the needle would not budge. Had to return it. So disappointed.
