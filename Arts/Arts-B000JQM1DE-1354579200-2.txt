review/summary: Easy to learn and usereview/text: We have had the Brother CS6000i for more than six months. We are infrequent sewing machine users for now but intend to do more sewing in the future.I found the instructions easy to understand and the machine easy to use. The machine is also lightweight and easy to pick up and store. The machine appears to have come with all of the accessories (feet and needles) that an average user would need. Sixty stiches should allow even a frequent user a lot of flexibility.My wife has had previous experience on other sewing machines and says that this one is easy to thread and set the bobbin. The foot pedal responds perfectly. We purchased this machine because of all the little niceties, i.e., the easily accessible and number of controls (buttons) on the front as well as the large number of stitches (our very old Sears had about eight stitches).The only minor improvements that I recommend would be a brighter sewing light and a slightly easier ability to change the foot - both very minor considerations.
