review/summary: Wonderfulreview/text: I am so pleased with my new Brother machine. It has greatly exceeded my expectations. The thing I lovethe most is the foot free ability to sew. I can take it anywhere and just plug it in and use the on/off button to sew, no foot pedal needed. I have tried out a number of stitches and materials and it works beautifully. thank you Brother for a wonderful machine. Light too, I can carry it with two fingers!
