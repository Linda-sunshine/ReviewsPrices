review/summary: Amazed so far at the value and performance, will updatereview/text: I have to start off by saying that I am a long time sewing machine snob. This is my first "plastic" machine. I learned to sew on a Pfaff and I still use the Pfaff machine I took to college 30-odd years ago. I have 2 vintage Necchi machines as well(they are workhorses) and a Pfaff serger which is 20+ years old. At the time the Necchi's were made, they were the Cadillac of sewing machines with Sophia Loren as their spokesperson. They are ALL metal and weigh a ton. They require frequent oiling but run smoothly and very quietly. (There is a very large and active online community using vintage Necchi machines.)My last 3 machine servicings were expensive - at least $60. My last serger tune up/repair was $169 but I went ahead because they told me that a comparable (all metal)serger would be over $1,200 used. It has gotten to the point where there are so few sewing machine repair shops (only 2!) around - I live just outside a metro area of 450,000. I mentioned this to the shop owner the last time I had a machine worked on and he told me that almost the people who used to do this are retired or dead and that the plastic machines of today are "disposable". I needed another machine serving and I did some research and decided to try this machine.I am really impressed with the perfect stitches (I have tried over 40 so far) the buttonholes and the incredible value offered by this product. I also like the automatic needle threading (my Necchi's have this) and the ease not having to pull up the bobbin thread - just thread and sew! The threading is foolproof as there are easy-to-follow diagrams on the machine. It is going to take me some time to get used to the pushbutton operation. I did some applique and the stitch is perfect. The machine is a little louder than my Necchi's, but they are whisper-quiet.I will follow up with an update after I have finished a few projects.
