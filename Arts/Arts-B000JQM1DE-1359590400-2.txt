review/summary: Gift for grand daughterreview/text: I bought this machine for my grand daughter for Christmas. She is 13 and has been sewing for nearly 5 years. She loves the machine and has not had one problem with it. She hauled it over to my house last weekend and she made a table runner. she is a very good little seamstress. No it does not sew as good as my $3000.00 machine, but it sews very well. She especially likes the push button variable speed and automatic threader. It is easier for a new sewer than using the foot pedal. I have also sewn on it and was quite impressed with the way it sews. For the price, you couldn't do any better.
