review/summary: Great first sewing machine!review/text: I am absolutely in LOVE with my new sewing machine. I have not sewn in 18 years (since home ec, in middle school) and I was able to take this out of the box and start sewing immediately. Great helpful manual, super easy set up, etc. I thought the threading tool was silly at first, but I use it all the time. Saves my eyes, for sure.I have not had any troubles with this machine yet, which is shocking because I really have no training. In the 2 months of owning it, I have sewn scarves, pants, pjs, a dress, stuffed animals, all on a variety of fabrics ranging from faux fur to knits.
