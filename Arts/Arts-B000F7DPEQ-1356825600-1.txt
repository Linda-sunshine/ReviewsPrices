review/summary: Brother xl2600i meets all my expectationsreview/text: I was looking for a lightweight machine to take with me to quilting classes. I didn't need anything fancy and the price was right. It too me a little while to figure out the dials (my other machine is computerized), It is a good basic machine and I am pleased with my purchase.
