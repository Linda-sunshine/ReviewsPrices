review/summary: Great Buy!review/text: I bought this for my mom and she had nothing but great things to say about this sewing machine. It is easy to use, it runs smoothly, she loves the computer component, the bobbin is easy to use and it has a clear window so you can see when it is running low. Great buy!!!!
