review/summary: I bought this 5 years ago and it still works great!review/text: I bought this machine 5 years ago, and have used it probably over 100 hours, and it's still going strong! I don't know if it still comes with the DVD, but that was very helpful, and the instruction book was good also. It didn't take me long to learn how to use this serger (it is my first serger). I haven't had any trouble with it so far. I use the differential feed quite a bit, which saves me loads of time easing and gathering. There is a learning curve on this serger, which is probably true of any serger, but it came all set up with multicolor thread, and that was very helpful in learning how to balance stitches. If you have poor mechanical and troubleshooting skills, maybe it's better to get it at a sewing store so you can get help, but I didn't need any help at all, since the DVD was crystal clear. I use fancy threads through the loopers and all that. Sometimes I do wish I had purchased a fancier serger with the cover stitch, so I could do some special effects that are in some advanced books. I don't know if I would have used those features or not, and don't know how much complexity that would have added to the learning process. If you sew knits or slippery fabrics like satin, a serger will eliminate so many headaches for you. I am very glad I took the plunge and got one, and this was a great first serger for me.
