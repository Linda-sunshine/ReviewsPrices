review/summary: An inexpensive machine that keeps on ticking!review/text: I bought my Brother CS6000i about 3 years ago from a different retailer. The main reason I am writing this review is to testify that the machine will last. You get a good little machine for a small price tag. Even though I should, I have not had it professionally cleaned and it is still ticking. Overall I am happy with it. I have done a lot of sewing on it...mostly making purses. I have also made lap quilts and baby blankets.The Good: The machine is light weight and easy to pack up and travel with (which I do every week). I love the extension table. A new must for me! The speed adjusment is also a must as is the needle up/down postion. I like my needle stopping in my fabric so my thread doesn't shift when I need to turn corners. But should I decide I want it to stop in the up position, I can set it to do that. The control buttons are conveniently located. It is nice to have the foot free function, but I don't use it. I prefer using the presser foot. I imagine for someone with foot problems that would be a great addition.The Bad:-The quilting table (even though I love it) doesn't fully attach to the machine, leaving gaps for the fabric to sometimes get caught on.-Altough this is minor, the storage compartment located in the free arm is a pain. When you put your sewing machine tools in it, and take it off, the stuff can easily fall out. I don't store anyting in there.-The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the needle threader does not work. In my three years of owning it, I have not been able to get it to work. And I wish it did. If the machine is going ot have the function, it shoud work.in the end If all I had was $150 to spend on a machine, I'd buy this one again in a heartbeat!
