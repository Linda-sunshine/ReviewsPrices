review/summary: Great little beginner machinereview/text: I bought this machine for my wife, as she said that she was intersted in beginning to sew. After it arrived, I found myself using the machine. It was easy to learn on and the set-up is very simple. Not sure when I/we will begin to use all the sewing features and options, but it has been enjoyable thus far.
