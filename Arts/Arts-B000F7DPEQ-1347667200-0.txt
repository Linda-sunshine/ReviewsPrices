review/summary: Aside from the bobbin looping "problem", it's a GREAT BUY!!review/text: I would definitely recommend this sewing machine for the "new to sewing" or beginner (I am new to it as of 2 days ago). It is a simple machine that is not at all intimidating. I only gave it 4 stars because the manual is SO confusing. Little details that you may miss are not highlighted clearly enough. I had to rely on YouTube for help on filling the bobbin, threading and picking up the bobbin thread, before I could go on to my first project. The Amazon reviewer "SBP" (the top most helpful review) was also a life-saver, since I did end up having a bobbin looping "problem". Even after watching the awesome tutorials from YouTuber "hbnole". I am now sewing perfectly with no other problems. First timers...BUY this machine! You won't regret it!
