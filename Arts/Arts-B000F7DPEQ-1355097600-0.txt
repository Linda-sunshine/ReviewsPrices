review/summary: Like machine, don't like customer servicereview/text: Bought this machine as my first. Love the drop in bobbin and ease of set up. Runs smoothly too. However my foot pedal broke on my second use. I was a little disappointed but happy that it seemed like an easy fix and there is an authorized repair place close to me. Well my machine has been there for almost two months! The repair shop says Brother has to send them the new foot pedal since it is under warranty. But there is apparently 8 different ones and they keep sending the wrong one! After contacting Brother online, I received a short response from them stating to call them and they can call the dealer to see what's happening. I already know what's happening so this isn't a great resolution for me. I still haven't received my machine back fixed and now have missed my opportunity to make a the Christmas sewing projects I had to make. Very disappointed.
