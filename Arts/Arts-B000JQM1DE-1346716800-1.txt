review/summary: Do NOT buy thisreview/text: This model did not work for me. I was looking for a middle of the road machine since i do not sew as much as i use to. It is very lightweight, has the feel of a toy machine. It "travels" on the table when i sew.There is not much space between the needle and the arm of the machine so larger projects are out of the picture. Due to an error on my part (I did not change the setting for a stitch) the needle arm jammed into the throat plate. There was no way to correct it. I have sewn for over 40 years on an old singer model with no problem.I brought it to a local repair shop and the cost of repair was not worth throwing good money after bad.So i upgraded to a much better Brother model.Buyer beware. I should have researched this better before buying.
