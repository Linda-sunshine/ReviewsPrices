review/summary: I love my new Brother sergerreview/text: I love my new serger. After using an old serger for years I bought the Brother 1034D. The stitches are so much nicer, it is easy to thread and set the tensions. I also went online and found lots of blogs the show you how to do sewing project I didn't even know you could do with a serger. Many of the bloggers have the Brother 1034d sever and list the settings for each project. If you are thinking about getting this serger DO IT. You will not regret your decision.
