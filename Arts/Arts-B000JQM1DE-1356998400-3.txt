review/summary: use it all the timereview/text: I use this all the time. Kind of lightweight though compared to my old one but I got used to it. The auto needle threading is great. Don't really like having to reset the stitch each time I turn it on though. I wish there was a way it would stay on what I selected, but can't figure how to do that. But overall good sewing machine.
