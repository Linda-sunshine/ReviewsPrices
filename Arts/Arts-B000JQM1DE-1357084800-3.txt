review/summary: Wonderful Produt!review/text: I bought this product in 2010 as my first sewing machine since I was a small girl. I purchased this machine because it came with the protective case, and has the 60-Stich Arm at a great price. It was a great machine, and lived up to all the promises in the advert. However, when I moved across the country in 2012 something happened. There is a possibility that it&#8217;s the shippers fault, so take it with a grain of salt, but suddenly all the internal mechanisms started to break! There was no outward damage to the box or the machine when I collected it at my destination. At one point a quilt I was working on was sucked into the machine, and effectively tearing a huge hole right in the middle of my topper, which was my only indication that there was something wrong. There was no error code, or any sort of warning, so the machine wasn&#8217;t able to catch the potential error as it can/had in other programming instances.The reason I gave it this rating is because it&#8217;s MORE EXPENSIVE to repair this machine than to purchase a new one. I had this itemed shipped and packed professionally separate from other items during my move. I am of the opinion that the machine works great, it&#8217;s just not built to sustain ANY rough handling. If you have little ones, or even pets, watch that they don&#8217;t knock it off the table, otherwise you might be out of a machine and a bit of money. Otherwise, I made all our Halloween costumes, Christmas gifts, and a good number of quilts with no problems, that is until there was one.
