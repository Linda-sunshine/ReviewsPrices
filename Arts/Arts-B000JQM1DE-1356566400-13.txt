review/summary: Abuse from beginners and still working!review/text: I teach a costume and makeup class at my high school. I needed to replace my Singers and Elna's I was using, since the repair bills on them were the cost of new machines. After much research we ordered the cs6000i and I do not regret my decision. I love how it beeps when there is an operator error or a set up error. Easy to learn on. My students picked up threading it, the bobbin, and basic sewing very quickly. I am able to teach more intermediate techniques, since I have less break downs. My students love the machine. When I pull out one of the old one's to use if we need more machines, they will typically wait for the brother. It is true that it struggles with really thick material, but that is not what this machine is intended for. Problems occur when you use cheap or thick thread and when the bobbin is wound incorrectly. Other than that, awesome machine, and they have taken abuse from high school beginners! Sometimes when I am at home sewing on my more expensive machine, I wish I had one of these. (That may still happen). If you are looking to buy a machine for a beginner, a hobbyist, or for those occasional repairs, this is definitely a good buy. If you are sewing heavier materials on a regular basis, that is not this machines' purpose. I highly recommend it.
