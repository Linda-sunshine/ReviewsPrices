review/summary: Loved mine so much, I bought my mother one, too...review/text: I have been sewing for years. I love this machine. There is nothing bad I can say about it... My mother loves hers also. She likes that it is light enough that she can move it around herself. She was using an older Kenmore machine and it weighed at least 35-40 pounds...
