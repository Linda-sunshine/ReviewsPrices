review/summary: bogus price?.review/text: I've been looking at different sewing machines for 2 months now and I keep coming back to this one. The price for this machine has ALWAYS been in the $150 price range. So I was excited to see the "year end deals" for brother sewing machines. To my surprise not only did this particular machine I've been eye balling show up on the list BUT it showed up with it's "original" price of $449 with 68% off making the $144 its sale price! I was quite disappointed to see this on amazon being that I've been very pleased with all that amazon has to offer...up until this point. Makes me wonder if it's some kind if type o or if ALL the products on amazon show a faulty price making the consumer believe that they are indeed getting a great deal..???!Update:Although bothered by the price inflation of the original cost..I knew that this is the sewing machine 4 me. After having it for 2wks now I am very pleased with knowing that this is a great buy for a qood quality sewing machine that definitly lives up 2 its name! I was amazed how simple it was for this rookie 2 get started sewing so quickly & effortlessly. Big huge plus is ALL the bells & whistles it comes with!I love this sewing machine!! My frequent sewing combined with my newly found sewing skills may have gotten 2 my head. Personally not only do i think this machine is well worth what u pay for..i now feel that its also worth the original price listed that i had griped about early on & said it 2 be "bogus".
