review/summary: Brotherreview/text: This is so easy to use, and I learned to thread in about 1 hour. It delivers a professional look to my garments. Besides the video they give you you can go on You Tube for instructions from other happy users. There is so much more to learn what this does, but in my class I'm just serging seams right now. Great price for a very good product. I only wish it would self-thread.
