review/summary: Sew Much Fun!!review/text: I am having so much fun with this machine! I am the envy of everyone that has older machines. I am so thankful to have the drop in bobbin and the auto needle threader. These two functions alone are worth getting this machine. I have had it now for about 3 months. I free motion quilted a quilt together with the machine and it just trooped along wonderfully! I also made two other quilt tops with it for Xmas. I have used heavy home dec fabric, jean and bound my quilts in the machine and it does a great job. I have experemented with the decorative stiches and they are beautiful.
