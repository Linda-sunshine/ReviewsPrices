review/summary: Easy to use & a great price too!review/text: I bought this as a started machine, I've never used a sewing machine in my life but decided I wanted to start. I LOVE this sewing machine, it's so easy to use & if I have a problem I can either look at the instruction booklet or go to their website & find whatever I need. I recommend this to anyone looking for a new sewing machine! It's a good quality machine for a awesome price, I love it!
