review/summary: Everything I expected and more!review/text: I've been wanting a serger for a long time and finally decided to splurge on myself and use Christmas money for a serger this year. :) I did my research and finally settled on this one after reading several good reviews. This is the perfect serger for anyone wanting to take the next step with their sewing. I was intimidated at first, but the instruction manual and dvd were very clear and easy to follow and I was serging like a pro in no time. I absolutely love the color coded threading guide and makes threading extremely easy. I definitely recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a first time serger!
