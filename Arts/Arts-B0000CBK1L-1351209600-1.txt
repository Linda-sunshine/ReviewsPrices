review/summary: Brother Serger 1034Dreview/text: I tried a Singer serger but it was awful. Getting this Brother machine was a complete joy. The cd is SO useful. I was able to start serging right away. One of the threads broke unexpectedly but the cd tutorial showed me the ease of threading. I will use this machine to finish all of my projects. I like the fact that I can use multiple colored thread to create something unique. When my machine arrived it had color coordinated thread to each of the tension and threaded lines. Brother really figured out a great way to teach the novice how to serge. I'm not an expert yet but I feel that I can be.
