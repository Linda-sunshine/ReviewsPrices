review/summary: Pretty Decent Machinereview/text: I purchased this machine to teach my granddaughter (age 7) and grandson (age 5) to sew. The machine was very easy to set up, the manual is easy to read and the machine is easy to use. There are ample stitch selections and the machine sews a decent stitch. The dials sound like the gears are plastic, and I'm sure they are. Something we need to be careful of because the kids like to play with the dials. After the second sewing session, my granddaughter was sewing like she had been doing it for years. My grandson needed more hands on from me. Overall, I am very pleased with this machine at this point in time. We have only used it three times. For what I paid for it I think it was a sweet deal.
