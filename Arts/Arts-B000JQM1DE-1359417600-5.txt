review/summary: So far great!review/text: I started using my machine as soon as I got it!! Overall the machine has a great rating but I made sure to look at the negative ratings as well.... And yes the machine is made mostly of plastic as most things are now.. But it doesn't neccessarily feel like cheap plastic atleast. And this is a great deal since it includes the extended sewing table and hard case (not a complete carrying case but protects it well and has hole where machine handle is so you can pick the whole thing up which is nice). When I went into my local Jo Ann Fabrics store their selection was poor (6 machines) and prices were ridiculous. But again for the money this is a great machine that you can grow into. I myself am a beginner and plan on sewing cotton fabric or felt material mostly.. But as I get more experienced I probably will start to hem my jeans and stuff.. And I'm sure it will do just fine. But for those more experienced sewers who will be using a machine heavily with heavy fabrics.. You may want something more heavy duty.. But overall this machine is set up to do it all. But of course if any issues arise I will be sure to update my review!! Happy sewing to all!! :)
