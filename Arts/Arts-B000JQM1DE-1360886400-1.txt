review/summary: Missing Piecesreview/text: Got the machine 2 days early couldnt wait to get it out of the box. Any way I went through the feet that was suppose to go with the machine and I am missing the 1/4 inch sewing foot! and that is the foot that I use the most! rather upset it is not there..... I know, I know its a small thing but when that is a foot that you use the most it really is a bummer. Can you send me 1? please or do I need to spend more money on 1?Also just for a heads up, was missing a bobbin, but thats not a big deal. bobbins are cheaper then dirt!
