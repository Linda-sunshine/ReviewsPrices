review/summary: Fabulous machine!!!!review/text: My husband bought this machine for me about a year and a half ago (it was on my wish list). Anyway it is exactly what I needed. I'm a long time seamstress and have used dozens of sergers over the years, and this little honey does it all. It worked perfectly right out of the box, granted I know what I'm doing, still that does not guarantee a sewing machine will be cooperative.One huge surprise has been that this machine is easy for my daughters to use as well, they are ages 11, 9 and 6. Granted they aren't threading it, but they don't hesitate to sit down and finish the edges of their 4-H projects at all. The first couple of times they were nervous about the blade, but the last time my middle daughter cut a pattern out, she had a little excess fabric hanging off of one piece and I told her to get the scissors, and she told me not to worry the serger would snip it right off "finger snap". So there you go, out of the mouths of babes.Threading any serger is a real pain in the fanny, this one is no different. But the directions in the manual are very good, just follow them to the letter. So if you buy this serger (or any serger for that matter) put the instruction manual in a safe place and where you can grab it quickly.
