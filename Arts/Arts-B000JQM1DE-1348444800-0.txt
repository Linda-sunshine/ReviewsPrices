review/summary: Pleasantly surprisedreview/text: I must say I was ready to dislike this machine. I was replacing the Singer machine I got for college graduation 46 years ago, a machine I once had 3 of when I was teaching quilting classes. I could wind bobbins and thread that machine with my eyes closed. I am still getting used to bobbin winding on this machine but threading is easy. I have not taken the time to learn how to use the needle threader but will play with it when I have more time. The presser foot changes are a bit wonky and I am still getting used to presser foot lift on the right instead of the back. My greatest surprise came from the perfect stitch from the get go. I was prepared for tension problems and as yet have had none. The feature that I am loving is the push button sewing. Always an even speed with no foot pedal...it's like "look Ma, no foot!" I have not tried any of the fancy stitches yet but intend to play with those in the future. My main reason for buying this machine was to do some free motion quilting which I will do soon. My first project on this machine is a sweet little doll quilt for my granddaughter who is turning 2...used the 1/4 inch guide foot and the walking foot and it turned out pretty stinking cute! The price on the machine was just right for a "Medicare Moocher" (had to get political there) and I would recommend it to anyone who cannot afford one of the current big names in free arm machines. I am very pleased with this purchase.
