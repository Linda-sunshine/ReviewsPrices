review/summary: Easy to use, but no good way to carryreview/text: I bought this machine since it was cheap and I am just learning to sew. It was VERY easy to set up and start sewing and I have experimented with a few stiches already. (straight, zig zag etc)The only thing I dont like about it is that there is no easy way to lift the machine to take to class. Right now I lift it awkwardly and place it in a large heavy cloth bag, (will probably need to buy a case). I wish they had designed a handle on this one on the top..
