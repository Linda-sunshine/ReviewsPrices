review/summary: Impressive Machine CS6000ireview/text: I'm new to the world of sewing, so I wanted a machine that took most of the guess work out of the process of learning to sew. This unit does that and more. I plan on making decorative two sided applique outdoor flags. I needed a zig zag stitch, but I find that after I have the flag done, I'm adding fancy decorative stitches, in contrasting colors, aroung the edges. This easy, and fun to do detail really sets off my flags from other ones I've seen.The zig zag stitch is really cool. You can easily change the size and width of the stitch with just a push of a button, and you can see what your new settings are in the led screen. Very easy to repeat stitches you like. It even shows you which presser foot to use for any stitch you select. Very cool feature for a beginner. I gave the manual a quick read, and I was sewing almost like I knew what I was doing. Even my first flag came out pretty impressive.The machine is so easy to thread. Even the bobbin couldn't be easier. You just have to fill it, and drop it in. The top thread is just as easy. I love the self threading feature.I had some presser foot questions, so I called Brother. They were very helpful. They not only answered my questions, but also gave me some helpful advice to make my learning process even more enoyable.Bottom line is that if a beginner can sew with this machine, anyone can start a new hobby with impressive results. I'm sure this machine is even more impressive if you know what you are doing. I'm very happy with my purchase, and the results of my new hobby. You can't beat the price for everything this machine can do.
