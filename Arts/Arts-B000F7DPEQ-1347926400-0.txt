review/summary: Wow! Got more than advertised!review/text: So wonderfully surprised by the accessory pack! I knew about the buttonhole foot, but this kit also included a Narrow Hemmer foot that was not advertised! Nice! This foot is great for lightweight scarves and rolled dress edges. The kit also has a button sewing foot, a zipper foot, a blind stitch foot and three bobbins and a needle pack. Great package for a fabulous price!!
