review/summary: Not like the good old Pfaffreview/text: My 1954 Pfaff zigzag machine needed work, so I bought this Brother. It has a rather tricky learning curve in comparison. I find that in most cases, the &#34;under-stich&#34; is loose, in spite of my adjustments. I'm a bit disappointed, since my dau has the same machine and has had no problems.
