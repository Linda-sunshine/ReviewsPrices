review/summary: Awsome for the pricereview/text: For the price, you cannot get a better sewing machine. I'm not a seamstress, I'm a tug boat captain. The ease of use allows even a ham handed man like me to mend my clothes, and I have even been able to make button holes, and sew on buttons. Thanks. Captain Tim
