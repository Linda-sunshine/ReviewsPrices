review/summary: Perfect for use in the field or at homereview/text: I am not a chef, machinist, or any of the other skilled folks who have reviewed this so far. I am just a guy who needed a way to sharpen my skinning knife in the field. Turns out, this knife if great for this and quite handy at home as well.Contrary to the packaging where it said just a few strokes may be necessary to produce a sharp edge, I found that it took a lot more, more like 15 or so to bring back my skinning knife's dulled edge (dulled from skinning a feral hog). The process took less than a minute with me stopping every few strokes to see how sharp the knife had gotten.I have since sharpened several knifes, all smooth bladed knifes. It has performed very well. Given the portability, lack of complexity, ease of use, and results, this sharpener seems to be a very good value for the money. I would not say that it puts a professional edge on knives, at least I have not accomplished this, but it will quickly put an edge on knives that is quite sharp for a fraction of the cost.
