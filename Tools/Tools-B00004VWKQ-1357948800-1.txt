review/summary: Pretty goodreview/text: I have a knife block set that I purchased back in my college days. All the knives have been dull for years because it never occurred to me to buy a sharpener. Using this tool was easy but some of my duller knives needed more than the 12 recommended strokes before they passed the paper test. Some of my knives also have nicks in the blade and this tool does not get rid of those. For the price you can't ask for a better tool though.
