review/summary: black and decker air compressorreview/text: Received air compressor from Amazon and tried it out.Bicycle tires. Compressor comes with standard schrader tire filler and also although you couldn't tell from the manufacturer's data, adapters for sports balls and guessing bicycle presta valves. I say guessing for the presta valves as it works so poorly it is hard to imagine it was designed for such, but looking at it, hard to imagine it was meant for anything else. With effort, managed to fill one bike tire using it but decided that would be it. Ended up cutting off the manufacturer supplied filler and installing my own presta filler.Unit is fairly noisy, not such a big deal but not pleasant to listen to either. Taking a 700C tire from 60 lbs to 105 lbs took about 1 minute. Using my own filler, once in place, was a hands free operation.As others have noted, both the AC power cord and the air hose are pretty short. There is a DC power cord that is substantially longer, probably long enough to where you could plug it into the 12VDC accessory in your car and use it to inflate tires on same.Switch is hidden on the back of the unit. I would rather it was on top.Also took the opportunity to fill car tires. Smallish tires, low profile for Infinity sedan, going from 36 lbs to 42 lbs took on the order of 5 minutes. Ok for a tire, if you had many to do, probably quicker to drive to the gas station.Unit is ok for the price. Giving it only 3 stars out of five for the short cord and hose and the lack of a decent presta valve adapter.PS. Unit died 1 week after Amazon return ended. Still functions in DC, but the AC no longer does.
