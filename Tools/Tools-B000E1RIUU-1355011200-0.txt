review/summary: Fails to kill mice. Simple as that.review/text: I bought this product because of the positive reviews but it has absolutely failed to kill mice for me. They get into the trap and eat all the bait and get out again without any ill effects. Meanwhile, my $1 conventional mousetrap did the job and caught the mice that this machine failed to do. This is NOT a better mousetrap, stick with conventional ones.
