review/summary: Quiet... Perhaps TOO quietreview/text: I put this in to replace an existing but older ISE disposer (the 444, if it makes a difference), and the installation was a snap. Once I hooked everything up and tested it out, I was a little concerned because I didn't hear the disposer making the same amount of sound that the old one made. That is a very nice feature in general, but could be somewhat dangerous if you're not expecting it -- how would you know if the thing was ON??So far, after a month, it eats food waste as well as the old one and hasn't leaked even a little. For me, that's a win. Just be aware that the thing is awfully quiet -- like, &#34;there's something stuck in it and it isn't moving,&#34; quiet -- but it is actually spinning and working.
