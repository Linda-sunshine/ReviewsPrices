review/summary: Way better than Britareview/text: A great and simple product. I had the brita faucet filter mount but after about a month the plastic lever broke off. (The entire product was made of chrome metal/aluminum or whatever it was- EXCEPT for the one thing you would be turning multiple times daily???This filter is so much easier to attach to your faucet and like the other options on the market it comes with multiple attachment sizes to adhere to your type of faucet.Best of all, it has a simple tiny (Metal) lever that you pull to switch to filtered water and once the water is turned off it automatically goes back to tap water! Plus, the water comes out smoothly and silently in one stream( yes it's a little slow but what do you expect? the water is going through multiple layers of filter!) and it still is faster than it's competitors. It even tastes better. This is by far the best Faucet mount filter on the market. No reason to get the chrome version I hear unless you just like the look of it.
