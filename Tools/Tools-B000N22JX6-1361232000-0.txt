review/summary: Compact, Stylish, Heats up a room very quickly.review/text: A great option to keep me from turning on my heat in FL winters. Yes it does get kinda cold. Stylish look and compact size allow you to put it anywhere. It's feature packed but the best feature is the remote. You can control it without getting up. The base is VERY stable so you don't have to worry about knocking it over. The casing doesn't get terribly hot. Very attractive tan wrinkle finish. This will heat up a 15x15 room in under 30 minutes to comfortable temp. Keep it running all night if you prefer the sauna effect. Get this heater, keep the heat off for a season and watch it pay for itself 5 times over. Great little piece.
