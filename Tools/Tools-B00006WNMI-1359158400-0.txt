review/summary: Easy to Install and my Water tastes just finereview/text: I can install one of these in under 5 minutes. They last about 3 months and my water tastes just fine. Definitely the way to go unless you want to keep buying plastic water jugs. The only recommendation I have is to NOT by a replacement filter. It's very hard to get off the old filter. Just pay a few dollars more and buy another whole faucet filter like this one every 3 months. When the water goes through the filter, it does slow down the flow, but to me it's just a small inconvenience. Great product for the price.
