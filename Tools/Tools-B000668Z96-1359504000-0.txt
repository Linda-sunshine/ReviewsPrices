review/summary: Bugs + light + sticky paper = dead bugsreview/text: It's simple and it works. Is it going to completely rid your home of fleas without using any other products? I doubt it. Is it going to gather a bunch of fleas that you'd much rather have dead in the trap than alive or dead elsewhere? Yep! It's definitely a cheap and simple addition to your arsenal. Your pets probably still need to be treated, but this sure helps!
