review/summary: Fantastic for the pricereview/text: I love these traps. We have 3 dogs and with the weather this year we have had an ongoing flea problem. I cannot exterminate because I also have parrots. I have purchased 4 of these traps and have set them up in the rooms where the dogs spend their time. I cannot believe how well this works. The replacement bulb is just a night light bulb and they can be purchased in bulk cheap. I have purchased the refill pads on Amazon and they arrive quickly as well. I will continue to use these traps and recommend them to others who are in similar situations as ours. It is a small plastic trap so it sets up nicely in the corner of any room. Nice price for an item that works extremely well.
