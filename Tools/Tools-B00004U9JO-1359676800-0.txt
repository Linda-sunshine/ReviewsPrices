review/summary: "Designed for years of trouble-free service!" Two, to be exact, give or take a few weeksreview/text: After just over two years of light usage (most of my food waste goes into the compost pile,) this thing started leaking badly from the housing. Purely by coincidence, I'm sure, the two year warranty had just expired. Insinkerator assures me that I cannot repair the problem myself and that I will have to place a service call.I'll be replacing it with aWaste King, which is 1 HP (instead of 1/2) and has a lifetime warranty. I don't know if it will be better, but at least I won't be hearing those magic words "I'm sorry, it's JUST out of warranty."
