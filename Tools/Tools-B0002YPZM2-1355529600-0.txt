review/summary: So far I am really happy with these.review/text: They fit nice and snug and allow for a lot of manual dexterity. Cleaned out an an area with a lot of prickly bushes and nothing came through the glove surface. That was a first. Looking forward to the spring when I can give them a real workout. No regrets. Would purchase again!
