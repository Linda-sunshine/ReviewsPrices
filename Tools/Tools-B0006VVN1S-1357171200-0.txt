review/summary: This thing actually works!review/text: Installed easily once I got my old corroded showerhead off the pipe. I didn't think this thing worked all that well...until I couldn't use it anymore. I purchased a replacement filter and when I installed it, I realized one of the white plastic o-rings was broken and causing leaks all over the place. Culligan customer service is TOP NOTCH! FIVE YEAR WARRANTY!!! That's unheard of nowadays! I called the 800 number and the guy I spoke to had me email him a photo of what was broken and they sent a new part via UPS within a week! While I was waiting for the part to arrive, I had to install my old shower head. I was so itchy and dry from the chlorine. When I got my part and took a filtered shower again, no itching. I deducted a star because it's made of plastic and it does have a tendency to droop downwards and I find myself crammed into a corner of the shower until I move it upwards again.Unfortunately this filter does nothing for hard water (but I knew that going in) and my water is still as hard as nails. It's so awful. I'm looking into getting a showerstick softener. (I rent an apartment.)
