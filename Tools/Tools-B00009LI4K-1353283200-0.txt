review/summary: These fit my big headreview/text: These are great, especially if you have a large head. My head is big and egg shaped. I tried the Howard Leightns, but they do not fit my head well. Although people with smaller heads have no problem. I like the 3m Peltor, fits, comofortable, and blocks out the loud noise..
