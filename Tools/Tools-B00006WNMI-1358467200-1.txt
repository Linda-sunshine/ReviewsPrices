review/summary: Great filterreview/text: This is a great filter. I lived in an apartment for a year in a half that had water that tasted so bad, I seriously wonder if the complex's management was criminally negligent. During that time, I used this filter in both the kitchen and master bath.I probably went 4-5 filters in the kitchen, which is nothing, considering that two people in the apartment worked from home, and we often used the filtered water in cooking.This filter made that terrible water taste better than the normal bottled water you can buy in the grocery store. If it made it safer, I don't know...
