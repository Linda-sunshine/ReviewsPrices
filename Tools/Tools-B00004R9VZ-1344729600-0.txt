review/summary: Bug Light, Mosquito Lightreview/text: These are nice to have. I wanted it for indoor use but the indoor ones really don't do the job. The difference in the indoor units and the out door units is that the zapped bugs will fall on the floor instead of collecting in a pan. Also be sure not to keep it in the kitchen as some bug do explode and scatter germs within 5 feet radius. I keep mine in a large entertainment area and use it only when its just the two of us around. Do not keep it indoors if you have small children or in any area where you cannot be at least 10 feet away.The mosquito attraction packs are nice to have but I have seen biting flies and mosquito dead without its use. So thats up to you if you want to spend the extra dough to get those packs.I could not research any other reason for not using these units indoors.Hope that helps.
