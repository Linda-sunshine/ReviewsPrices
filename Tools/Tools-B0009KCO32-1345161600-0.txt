review/summary: fraudulent junkreview/text: I have spent numerous hours over a period of several days(not minutes as advertised) in an effort to make this garbage product work. Specifically, the hook and loop at the bottom of the left Bug Off screen does not hold the screen in place and the tension rod slides withiin a few uses. In desperation, I consulted the package insert which states: "If you have any problems with the product call 1-888-342-5270." I called the number given and asked for assistance. I explained that I did not want to return the product and was not requesting a refund. The manufacturer's representative (Wolf & Moon, LLC)refused even to listen to any questions and told me that I would have to call Amazon for assistance with the product. I tried to explain that Amazon representatives would not know the product and would like assistance from the manufacturer. All to no avail. Ths is FRAUD - pure and simple. Obviously, Wof & Moon does not stand behind its BUG Off product and has the WORST customer service I have ever encountered shopping on Amazon. (I make an average of at least 2 purchases per week from Amazon and have done so for years.) So, my comment to Wolf & Moon is "Bug Off!"
