review/summary: It is a toy that worksreview/text: This all plastic electric compressor unit does the job of slowly inflating your tires. The power cord and the air hose to the tires, both very short, are stored in a compartment with a hatch door on the top of the unit. The On/Off switch is located in the same compartment in the back of the unit where the cigarette lighter adaptor and cord is stored. This adaptor comes with a very long cord that needs to be removed from the compartment in order to gain access to the On/Off switch. When done, one would need to folded it and restore it in its very tight compartment. it In my opinion, this is the worst part of this unit. The switch should not have been some place else. Its current location adds two extra steps to the inflation process, if one wants to use the 120 Volt plug. I would cautiously recommended it since there are not that many other choices in that category.
