review/summary: Probably best deal on complete set of screwdriver heads for the occasional userreview/text: The main complaint about this set, that the handle fails, hasn't happened to me. My use of this set is minimal and general. I've used several different heads and without the slightest problem.For people that actually use precision screwdrivers everyday, I'd recommend one with a steel handle for durability. But for only occasional use, this is clearly an excellent deal and has all the types of heads you're likely to ever use.
