review/summary: Works as advertisedreview/text: We had two old remotes for our Liftmaster garage door opener. Until recently our garage was full of junk so we hadn't used them in years. After clearing the garage I tried using the old fobs and found neither would now work, (despite them lighting up when a button was pressed). Neither would re-program to the opener either, (using the opener's learn function), and I tried fresh batteries and everything else I could think of to get them to operate the opener - even resetting the opener and trying from scratch.I was starting to suspect that the opener's logic board had developed a fault and wasn't allowing remote access, (the wall mounted cabled switch still worked fine though.) As a new logic board is quite expensive, I thought I'd explore the possibility that BOTH our remotes had gone faulty somehow. I'm glad I bought this item as it worked immediately upon programming to the opener using the opener's learn function.I would definitely recommend this remote to others. It takes 5 seconds to set-up and works as it should.
