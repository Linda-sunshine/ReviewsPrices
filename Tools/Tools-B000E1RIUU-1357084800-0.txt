review/summary: It's a killerreview/text: What can I say, I got a mouse that had been chewing up stuff in my garage within hours of setting the trap up. The only downside is like other reviewers have mentioned, the lamp only blinks for the first 24 hours after a kill, so if you forget to check you won't have any visual indication of a kill. It's for this reason I ended up buying a multi-kill trap also so I don't have to worry about checking every day.
