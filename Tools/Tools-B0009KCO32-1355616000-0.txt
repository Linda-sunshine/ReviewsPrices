review/summary: great for my rentalreview/text: this item is perfect for my rental......it looks and feels strong and gives the impression that I have the customers concerns about bugs in mind....But because of design flaws the bottom section of the screen will truly never be able to keep bugs totally out of the room...But it is still worth the money and great for temporary fixes
