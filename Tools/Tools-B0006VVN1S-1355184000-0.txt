review/summary: So far so good....time will tellreview/text: It's only been a week - and 10 showers later so it's still too early to tell but I honestly think my hair and skin feel softer with this shower head. It's mid-December and the my skin is dryer than usual anyway but after a shower with this head it doesn't feel as dry. Our usually strong water pressure doesn't feel as strong with it, but I guess that's because it filters so much of the water. It was easy to install and I will keep tabs on when the filter needs to be changed (it came with a sticker for ease of monitoring and recommends a change every six months)
