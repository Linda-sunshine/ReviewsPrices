review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: I purchased this in order to slow down my faucet. Having a filter is a nice extra (We don't really need to filter Oregon water).It was easy to install but required a couple of re-tightenings. Best fit was using channel locks. I do have to remove the unit to use my sink-attached dishwasher, but it is not difficult, especially with the channel locks.I would recommend this. At about $15, it is a no brainer.
