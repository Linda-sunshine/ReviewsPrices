review/summary: What a great product!!review/text: I purchased the Lux WIN100 programmable outlet thermostat because our small space heater did not have a built in thermostat and did not turn off automatically. I didn't know that a product like this existed! This was very cost effective (cheaper than keeping the heater running) Very easy to program and turns the heater on and off at the times and tempreture that you specify when programming it. Great product!
