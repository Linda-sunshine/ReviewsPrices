review/summary: Works but not accuratelyreview/text: I've tested it turning on a light in a machine shed. It has been turning the light on/off but I've seen it go as high as 40 in the building before shutting the lamp off. This isn't a big deal for what I'm using it for but if it really needed to go on/off as a specific temp, it might not be a good choice.
