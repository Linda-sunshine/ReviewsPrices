review/summary: Easy to installreview/text: Very easy to install and you cannot beat the price. The only area that slowed me down was that the unit comes with an attached power cord. Since I did not have an outlet under the sink, I just opened the cover plate, clipped the wires, pulled the power cord out of the unit and did a normal wire attachment. Really, anyone should be able to install this. The instructions are really good.
