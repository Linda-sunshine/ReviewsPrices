review/summary: Belkin 12 Outlet Home/Office Surge Protectorreview/text: I purchased 4 of these for my computer, stero and TV systems. There is plenty room for everything including ac adapters. Onlyproblem is finding a screw head small enough for the wall mount slots. The head of standard sheet metal or wood screwsare too large for fit mounting slot. What I ended up doing was to carfully enlarge the mounting holes a little larger so the screws would fit.
