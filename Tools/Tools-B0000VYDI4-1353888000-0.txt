review/summary: A little ungainly at first, but really versatile once you get the hang of it.review/text: This ladder replaces everything you have in your garage, except maybe a two-four rung stepladder. I've used it to change out air conditioner filters in cathedral ceilings, put up Christmas lights, and do some tree trimming, and I've found it to be very stable. I have the Werner D7124-2LV 24' Fiberglass D-Rung Leveling Extension Ladder, and that has it's purposes, but you can't use that inside the house without pissing off the spouse. This ladder fits the bill anywhere that you need stability, I've had it extended in the folded position all the way out, and it remains stable. I haven't tried it extended straight up like a regular extension ladder, but I can't imagine that it will disappoint.
