review/summary: Simple energy saver.review/text: We've used these on the outdoor heated dishes and beds for small animals for years. It turns the warmers on and off as needed to keep the critters warm when it counts. Most importantly, I DON'T HAVE TO KEEP RUNNING IN AND OUT TO DO THE WORK MANUALLY.
