review/summary: Great replacement for our old Badger!review/text: This was a replacement for what I suspect was a 15-20 year old 1/3 HP InSinkErator that still ran, but had developed numerous holes around the circumference due to corrosion. Once the old one was removed, this one fit right into place. Using the old cord saved some time and expense, and we're sure the little extra HP will be welcome. (Incidentally, I got a laugh when I remembered an old &#34;Mr. Obvious&#34; radio routine where a caller complains that under his kitchen sink there is a badger residing, but he can't see to be sure because every time he turns on the under-sink light, it begins growling. Mr. Obvious explains that the &#34;badger&#34; is probably his garbage disposer. I had not realized that InSinkErator had named their disposer &#34;Badgers&#34;.)
