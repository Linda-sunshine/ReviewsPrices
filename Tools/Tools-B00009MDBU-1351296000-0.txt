review/summary: Performs excactly as expected (with extras)review/text: I purchased this thing to keep a handle of amperage flow and calculate watts on appliances around the house to try to save on the bill and was suprised to find it came with more features then expected. It's pretty cool, you can view amps, watts, VA, volts, and even calculate your monthly cost per month with that little red button pictured on the right. The instructions were really easy to understand and the packaging was nice as well.
