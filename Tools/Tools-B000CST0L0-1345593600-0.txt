review/summary: Works great!review/text: Works great! I needed a replacement since my old clicker didn't work at all or only worked when I banged it on the steering wheel about 5 times. I placed the order on Monday evening and received my garage door remote in the mail on Wednesday by 11 am. I followed the simple instructions provided on how to program the remote control and it now works great! No more banging the old clicker or having to do the walk thru the garage-close garage door- go out the front door- walk around!
