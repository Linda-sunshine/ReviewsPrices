review/summary: a must buyreview/text: I bought 20 of those and gave it as a gift to my friends... They all love it. it's so light and fits perfectly in your key chain. the other swiss-tech products are bulky but this one is fantastic. knife is sharp enough to do any job while the bottle opener is the most used for me. screw drivers are durable.
