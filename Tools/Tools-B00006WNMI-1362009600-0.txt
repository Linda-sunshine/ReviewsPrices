review/summary: Better than Britareview/text: Brita has been making defective products and not caring that they are defective. The entire line of Brita chrome faucet filters have broken indicator lights. So if you're not going to have the use of them anyway then why not purchase something that costs half and works just as well. It has a metal connector to the faucet instead of a the plastic Brita version and has a better overall construction.It would be better if there was an indicator light but, that's alright just keep track of when you need to replace the filter.
