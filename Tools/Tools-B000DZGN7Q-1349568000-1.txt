review/summary: Better than Badger 5review/text: Found this thanks to other reviewers. This unit comes ready to install/replace our Badger 5 (they have different types of mounting). So glad we got this as it is less noisy, more powerful, and does not get 'backed-up' like our Badger 5 did from day one. (We needed to run the Badger more often or it will feel like it was backing-up). A little more expensive, but completely worth it!
