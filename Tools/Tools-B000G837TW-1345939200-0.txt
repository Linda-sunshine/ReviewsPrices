review/summary: Like it so farreview/text: I installed this disposer several months ago in my last home.I liked it so much that I purchased and installed one in the new home I have since moved into. Installation was easy relative to other brands I have had. The unit is VERY quiet and has no trouble handling heavy throughput. Based on my early experience, I believe the 3/4 HP is sufficient for a residential application although I know that InSinkerator makes heavier units (why, I'm not sure). Highly recommend.
