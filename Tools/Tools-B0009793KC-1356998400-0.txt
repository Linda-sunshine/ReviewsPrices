review/summary: Great filter at a reasonable pricereview/text: These genuine Whirlpool filters work like a charm -- I have been buying them from Amazon and using them for years. My refrigerator water and ice both taste good, thanks to these filters. The only thing I dread is that they are a little difficult to remove and replace (this is due to my refrigerator design, not the filters' fault). I will continue to purchase these for as long as I need this type of filter.P.S. -- do the math. More is not always better. During the time of this writing, the 2-pack was a better deal than the 1-pack, but the 3-pack was NOT as good a deal as the 2-pack.P.P.S. -- the light on your refrigerator that tells you it is time to change the filter is almost always a timer -- not a sensor. Depending on your usage, a water filter could last you a lot longer, or a lot shorter, than when the light changes.
