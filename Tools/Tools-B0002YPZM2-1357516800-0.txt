review/summary: Good value, but might not be tough enough for some types of workreview/text: I bought a couple pairs of the Leathercraft 125L's - 1 to keep around the house, and one to keep in my truck toolbox. These gloves fit very well and are comfortable. The velcro strap on the wrists is a nice touch to keep stuff from falling into your gloves while working.I've used these gloves for a variety of tasks, and for most things, they work well enough. One thing they're not good for is clearing your typical south-central Texas brush. When clearing some mesquite and huisache, I quickly had several tears and holes in these gloves due to thorns.Overall, the Leathercraft 125L provides a good value for the price. I'd anticipate they would hold up well for most types of work, but if you're going to be using these for any kind of work involving thorns or other sharp objects, you might want to consider a thicker glove.
