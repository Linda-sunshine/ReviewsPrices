review/summary: Wonderful setreview/text: I've had this set from Boxer for 4 years now, purchased from a retailer in Austin, TX as an impulse buy. I am very glad I had, this is probably the most convenient set I've purchased to this day. In the 4 years I've had them, I've only misplaced 1 bit and chipped a small flathead bit from trying to remove a seized micro screw (completely my fault, wrong tool for the job). The flathead bit still hasn't given up though, I'm still able to use it daily as only a small piece is missing. All of my other bits are in terrific condition with only a slight amount of wear, no stripping or dulling on any of them.I've taken apart countless things with this set including hard drives, stereos, car interiors, optical drives, network equipment, keyboards and mice, tons more. This is a perfect set for most jobs I run into.
