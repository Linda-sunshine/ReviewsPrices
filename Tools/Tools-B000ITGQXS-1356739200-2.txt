review/summary: Wow! Book Lamp Shines Like a Flood Light~review/text: I am a voracious reader, and have reading spot all over the house, but I wanted the convenience of reading in small niches, or outdoors in the summer so I bought this little clip-on light. Holy cow! It's light is way bright and its span is over two pages of a book. It's lightweight, and the clip function has padding so it won't scratch a laptop or book jacket. I love it~
