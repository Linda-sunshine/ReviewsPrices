review/summary: Simple,efficient,sturdy, and reliablereview/text: Its crafted with great standards. Stands up to everything its supposed to be used for (far as hatchets and mini axes go). Can easily chop through 6 inches of wood in a matter of no time. Keeps a wonderful edge.Pros - The handle is solid for the material it is made of. The multi uses of the head of the tool is very study and efficient. Appears that the head will never "come off" by mistake, regardless of the abuse. It holds a great edge and can with stand abuse very well. The hammering ability is handy (by using the hammer like sides of the tomahawk). The "pick" on the end works well and THOUGHT out barriers very well. The sheathe is simple and great. All around, you get MORE than what you pay for, considering the price.Cons - Nothing that I can think of right off. For the price its simply amazing.
