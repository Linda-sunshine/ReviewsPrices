review/summary: Nifty innovative bug trapperreview/text: This REALLY catches bugs. Rather amazing when you don't realize what is lurking in your house and you see them stuck in the trap. My dog and cats did not bother the trap, and I left them ON for a month. Caught mosquito, carpenter ants, gnats, a cricket or two, and some house flies, as well as some tiny thripe type stuff. I was glad to not see any fleas! I really recommend this product.
