review/summary: Welder Husband Loves This Ladderreview/text: I gave this to my husband (a welder and fabricator who owns his own business) as a surprise gift and he has done nothing but said good things about this ladder. He says its easy to adjust, very sturdy, and the variations in positions is stellar. The only somewhat complaint is that it is a bit heavy, but he always qualifies this with &#34;its made well and not easily stolen off my truck&#34;
