review/summary: Finally the brooms are off the floorreview/text: My husband is convinced we need 80 brooms. And finally i have gotten him to admit that 6 is enough! This works great but you do want to use the mollies to secure it to the wall. I store my Swiffer, a mop, 2 brooms, and a fan duster. Works great and holds everything securely.
