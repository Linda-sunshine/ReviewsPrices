review/summary: Doesn't not workreview/text: Not really a fault of the product, but this won't really help if you have a flea problem. I caught tens of dozens of fleas with this, but when they number in the thousands, it's ineffective. Vectra (non-poisonous, unlike Frontline/Advantage) is what you really need.
