review/summary: OK Productreview/text: I will not repeat what has already been said here. You can make a qualified decision based on all the reviews... and you know what? almost all have something to say that is right on, both good and bad. The only I can say is that this product is NOT meant for serious, continuos use. More of an 'emergency' type device when you absolutely need it. The design is poor. The lighter cable is an awkward place and even a little weird trying to put it back in after use. The compressor (if this is what you want to call it), is slooow to inflate. It took almost 15 minutes to inflate a tire... which, I suppose is better than pumping a manual pump or driving your vehicle to the nearest station that has air. So I guess this is a better alternative. The instructions (if you really need them) are lacking, but then again, this is a pretty simple device to use. The electric connection, if you have electricity available when you need it will require an extention cord. The electric cable it comes with is, oh, all of 1 foot! The plastice is cheap and bends very easily... which means, you are going to have a crack or two after a few uses if not careful. Overall, the unit is poorly designed, awkward to use, cheap plastic and loud but easy to use, will inflate tires, does come with ball needles to inflate all sorts of athletic balls. For the price, it is worth it just to have as an emergency compressor but that is all it should be used for, not continuous use. Not a bad device for the price but that is about it.
