review/summary: Smart mice or ineffective product?review/text: I bought this mouse trap because of the high ratings, but I am not completely satisfied with it. I returned one because it was defective, the other one has yet to prove its use. I don't know if it is because our population of mice is incredibly smart and knows to avoid traps, or if this trap is ineffective. We followed the suggestions and placed a small amount of peanut butter at the end of this contraption but we have yet to trap anything.
