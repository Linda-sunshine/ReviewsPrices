review/summary: Backup System Onlyreview/text: Neat little product to add to your key ring for EDC purposes. However this is a back up to other EDC equipment only in my opinion. While it is nice and compact on a key ring it can be a little tricky to open until it loosens up over time. It will not however come lose on you by accident. It is simply not practical to use every day though in the functions it has. If you loss your knife and leatherman though this little key ring addition could be a life saver. The blade is quit sharp and care must be taken in the use of the various functions. It has a solid construction and works well as a back up or double redundancy.
