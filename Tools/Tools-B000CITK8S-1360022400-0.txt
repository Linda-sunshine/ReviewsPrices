review/summary: Battery saverreview/text: If this products holds the test of time then it will more than pay for itself,I just replaced a $200 dollar deep cycle battery because of poor charging practices so if this smart charge does its job then this new battery should hold up quite well it seems to be doing great so far but time will tell but I do believe this will be a great product and I would recommend it
