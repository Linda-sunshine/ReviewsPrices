review/summary: Flea Trapsreview/text: GREAT, AWESOME!!!! Because of the hot weather this year, I have had an awful infestation of fleas!!! I hate any sort of insect that gets near me & fleas are one of the worst!!!!!!!!! I use these after bombing the house & leave them lit (24/7)...they make an excellent ''nightlight'' as well!! :) I only ordered 2 to use downstairs but am ordering 2 or more for upstairs as well!!! :)
