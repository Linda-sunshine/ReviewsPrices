review/summary: This unit began leaking from the inside less than a year after I bought it.review/text: There is a guy downstairs right now installing a 3/4 Hp KitchenAid.I will concede that the Waste King device was powerful, easy to install, and quieter than the Emerson it replaced.However it quietly leaked for a month, damaging the cabinet floor underneath and creating an unsanitary mess.The installation guy states, and I can visually confirm that the leak is independent of any installation variables.The water goes in through the top and trickles out of the bottom where the electrical terminals connect.I am out $355 for the replacement unit with installation, and now I will need to replace the cabinet floor.Caveat emptor!
