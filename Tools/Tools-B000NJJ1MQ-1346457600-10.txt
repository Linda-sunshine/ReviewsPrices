review/summary: love this deadboltreview/text: I've wanted one of these for a long time. Finally, bought one when Amazon offered it on a good sale. I installed easily by myself. I had one question about screws and called Schlage directly for the answer. I got a human being on the phone immediately who spoke English, listened to my question, and answered it. Done.No problems with the install. No problems setting up the code. No problems operating the lock. I love it and I'm planning to buy another one as soon as there is another sale.
