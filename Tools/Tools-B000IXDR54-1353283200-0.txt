review/summary: Burned by customer service!review/text: I had been a long time user of Maglites and bought over 25 since they were introduced. During that time I had several fail but never used the "Lifetime Warranty". Recently I bought two that failed with the same problem. One was returned for service but never received back. When I complained I was told that I had waited too long to place a claim. I placed repeated calls to the service department & even wrote the CEO to no avail. All This all happened at the run up and distruction of Hurricane Sandy here on the East Coast.Although I prefer to buy American at this point I can no longer support a company that will not support lifelong customers with legitimate complaints. I now buy small, inexpensive focusable chinese LED lights from Amazon. They have worked better than I could have wished & I have placed orders to replace my remaining Disaster Recovery supplies. I gave away my 8 remaining Maglights to First Responders as I helped in the Sandy response in South Jersey where I live.I'm sorry but I can't recommend Mag any more.Their products are now outdated. The workmanship although superb, seems to suffer from some bad parts, and the customer service is insulting.
