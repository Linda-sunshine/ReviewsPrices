review/summary: Menacing looks, limited durabilityreview/text: The hawk looks great, feels solid in the hand and can be sharpened to a razors edge. That said, the ability to hold that edge is fairly limited, as the soft steel of the axe, hammer face and spike are very much susceptible to nicks and dents. The kraton handle can take a beating, with practice the hawk can be thrown (though you will likely do significant damage to the head while you learn) and the head weight is sufficient to deal significant damage to an assailant. Overall, I feel the hawk is a good value. That said, understand that this is first and foremost a weapon, and much of that value comes from being replaceable when the head is tore up to the point of no longer being useful. If you're looking for a do-it-all utility tool that doubles as a weapon, a stanly fubar may be better suited for your needs. If you're looking for a camping axe, there are dozens of better chopping tools suited for that task, both in utility and durability. The actual cutting face of the hawk is only a couple inches, not suitable for much of any real wood cutting, particularly when for the weight you could carry a proper camping axe, like a gransfors bruks. If you're looking for a SHTF handheld weapon that doesn't run out of ammo, now you're getting closer, though the durability may not meet your needs if you're hoping for something that lasts for years of heavy use. Still, a good value overall, satisfying to hold in the hand and quite a bit of fun can be had with the hawk.
