review/summary: Couple points to make about why its only 4 starsreview/text: First off, and this might be common knowledge to some, the first time you use this make sure you use it on a junk knife. I used it on one of my set and it made 3 knicks in the blade on the first swipe :/ After you swipe a few times on the throwaway, its easy enough to use and doesnt seem to cause any problems after that.Also, whilethe knives did seem to be sharper, they didnt seem as sharp as I wouldve thought. For table/steak knives, this is more than sufficient but for a prep knife that Im going to be using on meat or something, I would really like a bit sharper.
