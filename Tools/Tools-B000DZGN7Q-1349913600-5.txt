review/summary: A Good Value: A Waste King L-8000 Legend Series 1.0 Horsepower Continuous Feed Garbage Disposal Reviewreview/text: Length:: 0:11 MinsThe old InSinkErator BADger 5 plus had to go. I was tired of our dysfunctional noisy grinder, and constant drain clogs from the most basic vegetable scraps. I researched reviews, consulted the consumer reports website, and decided to purchase the economical and highly rated Waste King L-8000 Legend Series 1hp Continuous Feed Waste Disposer. The Waste King L-8000 was a big improvement which eliminated the drain clogs and worked efficiently well. However it was still noisy, but was much quieter than the old BADger 5 plus.Even though I was satisfied with the efficiency and effectiveness of the Waste King L-8000, made in China, I wanted a quieter disposal. When I was offered theKitchenEater KE1PC 1 HP Garbage Disposerwhich offers quieter sound technology and includes a stylish metal drain cover, I accepted the opportunity.The Waste King L-8000 claims to be the most environmentaly responsible unit on the market today, and includes a removable splash guard. Both disposals offer 1 HP - 2800 rmp continuous feed magnetic motors, stainless steel grinding components, integrated power cord, sound insulation, online animated installation guides, fast and easy installation, safe for properly sized septic tanks, a lifetime in-home warranty, and are manufactured by Anaheim Manufacturing Company. It seems as though the functioning components are identical in both models.Installation of the Waste King L-8000 required no additional purchases, and the most difficult part was removing the old BADger 5 which had probably been in place for decades. Alternately the KitchenEater KE1PC at close to double the price required purchasing plumbers putty to seal the drain.When compared side by side, both the Waste King L-8000 and the KitchenEater KE1PC perform very well. The only real difference is the KitchenEater KE1PC is much quieter. At first it was difficult to tell if the KitchenEater disposal was quieter due to the time lapsed in between. After reviewing the short videos I shot of each disposal turned on, the difference is amazingly clear. The lowered sound level comes at a cost of an increased unit circumference (approximately 7.5 inches) and a higher price. If you're looking for a quiet disposal consider the KitchenEater KE1PC instead of the Waste King L-8000. However, if you're limited in under-counter space, and looking for good value, the Waste King L-8000 will be the better choice.PROS:Quieter than less expensive modelsHigh powered continuous feedSimple installationCONS:Too noisy for me
