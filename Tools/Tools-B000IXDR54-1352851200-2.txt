review/summary: Amazing flashlightreview/text: Used this for 12 days during Hurricane Sandy in the North East. I used it on a daily basis everyday during the hurricane and this light is amazing. The great light output, good weight (even for personal protection) and battery life from this flashlight is amazing. I used Duracell standard batteries and they worked great with this flashlight. Highly recommended if you need a sturdy and heavy duty flashlight.
