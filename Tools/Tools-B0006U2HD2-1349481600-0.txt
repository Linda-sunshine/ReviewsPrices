review/summary: Works Great, Warm Chickensreview/text: I got this cube for my chicken's radiant heat coop heater and heated water dispenser. I loved that it had two outlets, as this was exactly what I needed. It works great, comes on as the temperature drops, and goes off as designed. Great energy saver and no worries for keeping my chickens warm!
