review/summary: InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposerreview/text: I installed the insinkerator and I am not a plumber... The biggest challange is to push the disposer up and turn and hold the top down inside the sink. I just had a neighbor hold it down for me. Alot better than paying a plumber $70.00 to do it. It has been installed over 2 months now with no issues. Works great!!!!!!!!!!!
