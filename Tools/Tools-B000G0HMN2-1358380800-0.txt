review/summary: Not like the 3-D Cell MagLite I had 20 years ago!review/text: LED technology is amazing overall but for this MagLite it is a revelation! I have owned a SureFire Dominator 10X rechargeable for over 7 years now. On the box, Surefire says that it is &#34;The Most Powerful Flashlight in the Universe&#34; a bit of hyperbole but with a claimed 500 Lumens you have to see it to believe it! It cost over $500.00 at the time and that was a deal! Nothing I've ever seen has come close until now. This Maglite blows my mind. There is a stop sign at the end of my street that is exactly 300 yards from my front porch. I used to demonstrate the Power of the SureFire by &#34;lighting&#34; that stop sign up. The new LED Flashlight from MagLite might not &#34;light up&#34; as large an area around that stop sign but everyone that sees it says it as least comparable with the $500.00+ Surefire. The Maglite that I had 20 years ago wouldn't even make those reflectors glow warm.For a little over $30.00 you have a very powerful Flashlight that is extremely well made and very solid and heavy in your hand. Now when you need to check out what &#34;that sound&#34; was late in the night you won't second guess grabbing for the big 3-D Cell LED MagLite!
