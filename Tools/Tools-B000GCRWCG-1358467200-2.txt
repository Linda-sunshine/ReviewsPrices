review/summary: they work great,and are toughreview/text: I bought several sets of these and have given many as stocking-stuffers this year. The grown kids were appreciative to have them in their first aid kits and vehicles, especially in light of the harsh winter weather this year. Hubby and I opened one and stretched it over a single paned window and it significantly controlled the temp in that room.
