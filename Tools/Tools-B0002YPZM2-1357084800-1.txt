review/summary: Great Work Glovesreview/text: I've been using Mecanix gloves and have had trouble with wearing through the fingers. These gloves cost less, but fit better and appear to be made of stronger material. They have some padding in the right places but are very comfortable and flexible. They're made in China, just like most other things, but the quality seams to be top notch. Highly recommended.
