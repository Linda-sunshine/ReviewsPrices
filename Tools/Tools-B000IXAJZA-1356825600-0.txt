review/summary: new led not so bad!review/text: the 3 cell is still beefy enough for that familiar heavy feel you get from the mag lites, and directly compare against a 4 cell &#34;old school maglite bought same time....led is visibly brighter.unsure on how long lasting it will be, but so far so good.
