review/summary: Farm Innovators Thermo Cube - hopeless piece of junk...review/text: I ordered this in November, checked it and it appeared to be working but on subsequent tests it was intermittent -it is VERY cheaply made and therein lies the problem. I wanted to test it with another item and it was all I could do to unplug the light I was using to test it from the Thermocube; when it finally came unplugged it was clear that the grounding prong had broken inside.. I had just tested in on a night where the temperature (in St. Louis) had dropped to 14 degrees. I had a drop light plugged into the Thermocube -the light never came on even though it was supposed to activate at 35 degree, confirming my suspicions that it did not work.I waited too long to return it, while it is not expensive, it is annoying. I decided to take a chance on it, wish I hadn't.
