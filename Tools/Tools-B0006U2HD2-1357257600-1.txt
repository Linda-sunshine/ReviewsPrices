review/summary: Worry remover!review/text: This is truly a life saver in the sense that it protects you from low temperatures. Plug in a heat light for baby pigs, a pipe heater, a stock tank heater, or anything else and at a preset, fixed temperature the cube powers up! No more worry if it's going to get too cold tonight, this little dandy is on guard, so to speak. I love it. The cube comes with 3 or 4 fixed temp. ranges so pick the one for your needs and sleep better knowing it's there.
