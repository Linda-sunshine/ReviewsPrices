review/summary: Works as advertised, great productreview/text: This product is great. When left on in a dark flea infested area it works very well. I had a flea problem in my basement and on the first night it trapped 90+ adult fleas. Please note, IT WILL NOT ELIMINATE YOUR FLEA PROBLEM BY ITSELF. It isn't designed to. I've had great success fighting my problem by keeping the flea trap on and spraying permethrin and an insect growth regulator once a week. Be sure to vacuum your problem area a few hours after spraying to get up any eggs and throw your vacuum bag away afterwards. It has taken about 6 weeks to get rid of my problem so ignore the bad reviews of this product from users who are upset that it didn't work over night.
