review/summary: 12 outlet surge protectorreview/text: Love it. Priced right, good surge specs. Lots of outlets spaced nicely, I was able to plug in all of my adapters, non-adapter items and still have a couple of extra outlets. Can wall mount or lay flat. Definitely one of the best items in the home. If you have an entertainment center or in m cases aquariums with pumps, heaters, timers, etc., this fits the bill. With a UPS, the pumps do not restart when the power comes back on due to too much induction so these are preferable. Would absolutely love to have a couple of USB ports on board too, are you listening Belkin?
