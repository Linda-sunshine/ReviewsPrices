review/summary: works great n looks goodreview/text: I have three tiny poodles n one boxer, I bought one and I was amazed of how many it caught in two to three days. I vaccum everyday but some stay behind and this trap gets them all. I bought 2 more and they do their job and at nite it looks like a nite lite while still doing its job. No more nasty sprays on my carpet. I recommand this product to everyone, even if u dont have pets. Fleas still come inside ur home.Sandie-Houston TX
