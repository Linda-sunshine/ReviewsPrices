review/summary: Not as good as the competitionreview/text: I purchased this one and the BioCare flea trap at the same time. the light bulb has already blown out of this and it has not been one week. Additionally, there is no cover, so to speak over the sticky pad thereby allowing cat hair to stick as well as the fleas. I am not sure the sticky will last as long as the other one as there is a &#34;hair catcher&#34; over the sticky pad. both are catching fleas in a space that has had the carpet treated and has been bombed. If you are going to purchase a flea trap, I would recommend the other brand.
