review/summary: Returned it.review/text: I am stunned at the number of positive reviews for this product. We have very high water pressure (our outside lawn hose nozzles never last through the summer, they always explode) and found this shower head greatly decreased the pressure. Yes, both stickers were removed from the filter, tried repositioning the filter, no help. Also found that due to the low pressure, the different water patterns didn't work...dribbled straight down. Returned it, but out shipping and return shipping charges. Have decided to save up for a water softener.
