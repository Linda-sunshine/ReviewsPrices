review/summary: Good Book Lightreview/text: I bought the Fulcrum light in silver. It clips onto hard cover and paperback books easily. The wire "arm" adjusts easily now. I am concerned (after some time passes and with light use) that the arm will not be able to hold its place and will swing wherever. I've only used the light a few times, but it is bright and working well so far. I am very happy that it takes AAA batteries.
