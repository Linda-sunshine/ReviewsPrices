review/summary: Sturdy Ladder $140 Cheaperreview/text: I wanted wide stance ladder that had more versatility than an extension ladder and I got it. This is not a light weight ladder, so be prepared for some heft. The wide stance bottoms provide a good deal of stability and I have been very happy using this ladder on some slightly irregular ground. I've only had it for a few weeks but I've already had the chance to slide it apart and use a scaffold plank between the two step ladders, as well as fully extended and partially extended.The big pluses for me are:1. 300 pound rating2. can slide apart into two steps and hold scaffolding at 10' high3. It's about $140 cheaper than the Little Giant equivalent
