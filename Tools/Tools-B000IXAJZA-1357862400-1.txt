review/summary: Nice Flashlight; Not Perfectreview/text: The flashlight produces a powerful bright light. I also like the optional feature of not having to click it on but just pressing/holding the button for light if you just need a quick beam.One minor complaint I have it that it's pretty heavy, and is very long--it doesn't fit in my cabinets upright. My biggest gripe is that there is a huge dark spot on the beam when you rotate the head into floodlight mode. This is apparently common and normal with this light, but I think it's a design flaw--it's very annoying. Also, instructions were vague on how to open the end cap and replace the bulb. I wanted to open the top so I could dust off the inside of the lens cover, but even though the diagram shows this should unscrew, I couldn't get it open and didn't want to force it. I guess I'll wait until I really need to open it to replace the bulb, and then I'll try to figure it out.
