review/summary: Works OK Butreview/text: As far as the filter goes, it seems to work fine, but I am on my third one due to the fact that after a month or so, the pull valve which is supposed to release when the water is turned off starts to stick. No a big deal as you can push it back in, but it would be nice if the folks at Culligan would fix that
