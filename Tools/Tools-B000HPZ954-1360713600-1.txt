review/summary: Great power strip for the pricereview/text: I bought this power strip because I needed a solution of my HTPC setup. It needed to have enough outlets to support all of my device and any addition in the future, and it also needed to be a dark color and have a decently long cord. The power strip is the thinnest I have ever owned and it seems well built. I would definitely purchase another if I needed another strip.
