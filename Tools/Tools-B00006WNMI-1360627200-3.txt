review/summary: From brita to culligan and no looking backreview/text: This is the best faucet filter ever on a budget! Living in NYC in an old building, I do get some murky water from time to time, but this filters out great and water taste great. I also feel safe knowing that my family is drinking safer water. It was so easy to set up, within couple minutes I was good to go.Filters are also reasonably priced.
