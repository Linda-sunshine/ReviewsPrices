review/summary: Best knife sharpener I've ever hadreview/text: I bought this based on the good reviews already posted. What a great product! I was even able to sharpen a razor blade that was getting dull in my tool box that I use as a scraper. Just about every knife can be made almost razor sharp. I like this product so much that I've since bought one for my in-laws, and one for my mother. Anyone can use it - no skill or experience required.
