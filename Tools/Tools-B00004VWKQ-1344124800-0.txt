review/summary: Sharp Knifereview/text: My grandfather taught me how to sharpen a knife on a stone, which I did for years. As an avid hunter, fisherman, with a family I found I was overwhelmed with knifes to sharpen. A buddy swore by this sharpener so I tried it. Fast, easy, and sharp. Will roll an edge a bit so a little steel work after finishes the knife nicely. Only issue is that it does take a fair amount of blade so knife won't last forever. Really helpful if you have had a great day in the field or on the water so you can keep your knife sharp real time.
