review/summary: Awesome Shower Head at a Great Pricereview/text: I read most of the reviews on here before purchasing and I have to say I am very happy with my purchase. I haven't noticed less dry skin like some claim but it has great pressure and the filter is a nice addition considering all of the chlorine in today's water. Overall great product!
