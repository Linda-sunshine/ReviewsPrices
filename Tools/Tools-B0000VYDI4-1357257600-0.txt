review/summary: Surprisingly tallreview/text: I wanted to get a 24 foot extension ladder, but couldn't pass up the price tag on this ladder. I was terrified that it wouldn't reach my 2nd story gutters, but it made it and the ladder wasn't even fully extended. I was pleasantly surprised, and extremely happy.And of course, I don't have to take up backyard space storing it, as it folds nicely for storage!
