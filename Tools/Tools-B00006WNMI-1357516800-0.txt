review/summary: Really good water qualityreview/text: Good substitute if you don't have filtered water from the refrigerator..Have been using for 4 months without any difficulties although it was tricky to install. Had to have a handyman to do it for me since the adapters were difficult to adjust to get it to set up on my faucet.
