review/summary: It worksreview/text: I thought my 1 year old battery in my 2002 ML500 was about to be used as a door stopper. Long story short, I was left stranded after work twice, but lucky enough to get a jump start. This happened twice before I started using the battery tender junior to see if the battery would fully charge and hold it. I found out that I wasn't using the car enough or driving far enough to get a good re-charge. Now I leave the clips attached to the terminals when not in use and i never have to worry about carrying around jumper cables. I installed the quick attach cable to another vehicle that I rarely use so I can switch between the two cars. I like that the cord is long enough and not chunky either so I can close the hood of my vehicles while its charging.
