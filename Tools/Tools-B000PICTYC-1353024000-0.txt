review/summary: great hawkreview/text: Great tool, it comes razor sharp as in shave hair. It's strong enough for out in the woods yet light enough to be fast and easy to fight with. I have already choped one tree down and cut into firewood with it. I highly recomend the kedex sheath SOG offers it is a much better carry system than the one that comes with it. The ones it has is not bad just not as easy to carry or mount to other gear.
