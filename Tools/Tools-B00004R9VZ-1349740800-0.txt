review/summary: bug zapperreview/text: Had looked at several online and read other reviews before purchasing this one. It has performed flawlessly. Have had to blow it off once due to so many larger bugs like moths getting zapped by it. Also found out why they suggested putting it out in the yard away from the house. It killed so many in the first week that they littered the corner of the porch and I must have had every neighborhood frog/toad sitting there eating all the fresh fried bugs that it was zapping. Kinda fun to watch them to. Man they are quick.
