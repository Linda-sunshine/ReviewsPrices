review/summary: Factory Repleacement NOT alternative. Both ANSI Standard 42 & 53review/text: This filter came as described, Part # 4396508 for Whirlpool, Kithenaid and Maytag with lower grill style Ice and Water Filters. Apparently manufactured by PUR in Taiwan. Plugged it in, truned off ice maker and ran 4 qts of water until clear, then turned the ice maker back on.Some people may have claimed it was only ANSI 42 but I can read, it clearly states ANSI Standard 42 (Chlorine taste, odor and particle reduction) and ANSI Standard 53 (Lead, Mercury, Benzene, p-Dichlorobenzene, Toxaphene and Carbofuran).
