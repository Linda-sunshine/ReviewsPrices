review/summary: Great Dealreview/text: Liked this product both for installation and performance. Didn't provide the fifth star owing to the large size and the somewhat unsatisfying sound of operation, both of which are minor in comparison to the fact that under a load test the Waste King was able to grind up cantaloupe rinds and didn't jam!
