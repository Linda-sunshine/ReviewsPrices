review/summary: Great tall ladder, for those high reachesreview/text: Since the ladder reaches waaay up there, it is heavy. When the ladder is fully stretched, standing on its just two legs and resting against the wall, it does get scary. Maybe because I don't climb such heights on ladders everyday, I was uncomfortable and did not have a solid sense of safety. I felt that it was a bit wobbly. If I had to do it again, I would buy an extension ladder, not the folding type.
