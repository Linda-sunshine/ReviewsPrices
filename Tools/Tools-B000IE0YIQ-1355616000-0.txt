review/summary: Sturdy and inexpensive peace of mind! Only issue is accuracy of pressure gauge.review/text: This model is great- is compact and light, and has both 12v and wall plug-in capability, which is rare. IS more than sufficient for any bike, motorcycle, inner tube or car applications. For the price it is hard to beat! I will say that the gauge is not terrifically accurate, but none are for these types of things- spring the extra $5 for a legit gauge and you'll be great!
