review/summary: Kills bugs, but surrounding plants too!review/text: This product is very effective for getting rid of bugs, but after using it for about 4 weeks I noticed that my plants that were about 6 feet away from it started wilting - almost as if they have been scorched under the sun ! For now I have turned this off, I have to find another spot to hang this lantern - away from my plants !On the positive side - I have very few bugs.
