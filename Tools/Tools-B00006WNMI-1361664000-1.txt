review/summary: Works, but very slow, with less-than stellar instructionsreview/text: The filter went on the faucet in my new apartment without requiring anything extra, and it did get the water tasting better and I felt like it was doing a good job of purifying.However, the filter is incredibly slow, and reduced the water pressure even when you're not filtering and just passing through. I found the little stopper that automatically turned it off when the water stopped worked well, but again, it's so very slow.When I moved, I had the instructions and a different faucet, but it was very unclear how to use the attachments to get it on properly. It wouldn't seal and did not work with the second faucet so now it's just sitting in a box. It worked well for me at first so take that for what it's worth.
