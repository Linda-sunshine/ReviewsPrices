review/summary: Best ladder ever builtreview/text: I have the MT-17 ladder by Werner. Working in the air conditioning and electrical profession I am willing to trade weight for stability. I was shocked at how light and still stable this thing is. It is by no means light, I just expected it to be even heavier. I have to say there are so many times I have been thankful for this ladder,be it 12 feet off the ground changing ballasts or, lugging 30 pound jugs of freon to a rooftop air conditioner that I feel this is the best stepladder ever built. On some of the other reviews I have seen complaints on pinching and stuff of that nature. I guess I should say they are not child proof.
