review/summary: It worksreview/text: I actually purchased this Bk 80D from Walmart. This price was about $66. I have had it sitting on top of the bar beneath my deck on the bottom patio. So far so good. I have had it running continuously for 2 nights. I have seen lots of dead moths. Unfortunately a few lightning bugs as well :-( however it works. I actually purchased this more so to kill mosquitoes. I can't tell if there are any mosquitoes in there or not but the moths are more obvious to identify being that they are bigger. I have not mounted it yet for the simple fact I wanted to see approximately how many bugs it was killing. It appears to be at least around 50 in 2 nights. To be honest I haven't seen any mosquitoes period since I bought this....perhaps they knew what was coming!
