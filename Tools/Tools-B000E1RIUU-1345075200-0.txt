review/summary: any below 5 stars did something wrongreview/text: ok i just got mine today(8/16/12) i tried to but used batteries in it like some reviews say but the light kept flashing for me to replace to battery's. so i put 4 brand new AA in it and set it out at 5pm went out and when i got back at 7pm one dead mouse. this thing is perfect i have glue traps out but the mouse kept walking over them and we could hear it walk over them. the was the best investment
