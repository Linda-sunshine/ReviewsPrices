review/summary: FABULOUS!review/text: Easy-peasy installation (took 3 minutes, tops). Give it a day to get the creases out, but after that, the screen rests flush with the door jam and fits perfectly. My only -nit- is that the velco fastener that they use to attach the screen to the door jam is black on one side, and white on the other. They should have used black velcro for both sides, to diminish the visibility of the screen attachments... but this can be easily remedied by switching out the white for black, either by the purchaser or the vendor.
