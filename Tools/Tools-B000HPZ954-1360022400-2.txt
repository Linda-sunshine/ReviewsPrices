review/summary: great for nowreview/text: Hope nothing goes wrong to prove anything. I do not need a power surge just to prove that this thing is working. I bought it because of the widely spaced sockets. I have a number of adapters that are so big that they can't fit into most multi-plugs in the market due to their sockets being so closely located to each other. This is just perfect. Never have the chance to utilize the telephone and coaxial surge protection via this thing. Hope it does what it says it does if a surge is to come.
