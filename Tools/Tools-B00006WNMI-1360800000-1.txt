review/summary: Only good for a few monthsreview/text: I've had this faucet filter for half a year now. It was good for the first few months. About month 3 or 4 the button that activated the filter started sticking. Also, replacing the filter cartridges is a LOT more difficult that the directions say. I had to disconnect the filter and bring it to work and it still took 2 guys to get the filter out. I would not recommend this product.
