review/summary: Must have!review/text: I have a bunch of these and they are a must have item if you have any kind of a vehicle battery around your home. They will extend the life of the battery, you can connect this and forget about it until you are ready to use the vehicle. I have the extension cables and they are nice to have and make the unit reach further. I buy these in multiples and my friends all want to buy them or if I work on someones vehicle, they usually buy one as well. They definately work and are a must have. They include ring terminal harness to permanantly connect to a battery so you can easily plug into the cord if your battery is hard to reach. Also includes alligator clips.
