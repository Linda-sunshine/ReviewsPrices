review/summary: Convenient, easy to usereview/text: Got this to replace one that had stopped working. We have gotten used to keyless entries because they are so convenient and easy to use, both on our house and garages. No more fumbling for keys when needing to enter. When needing entrance to the garage for yard tools, no need to go to the house for keys. Work smart, not hard, LOL.
