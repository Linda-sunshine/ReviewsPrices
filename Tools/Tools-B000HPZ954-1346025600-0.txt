review/summary: Powerstrip Extraordinairereview/text: Our office was having powerstrip overload, using the older model not designed for transformers. Too many workers were wasting powerstrip plug in slots when transformers overhung the adjacent outlet. Now with this model powerstrip we have six wide transformer size slots and six regular size slots. 12 plugs is more than enough for anyworker.
