review/summary: Wow is all we can sayreview/text: Really love this new disposal. We replaced an Insinkerator Badger that we thought was good but this disposal showed us how wrong we were. It's so much quieter that sometimes it's hard to know it's really on. And while the other had trouble with thin peels (onion, carrot and potato), this one grinds them without problem. The Badger also had water backups while the Waste King hasn't shown any signs of a backup. Something we really like about this disposal is the removable rubber piece at the top of the disposal. With the Badger we weren't able to tell if the bottom was clear of food particles because the rubber covering was part of the disposal so all you could do was try to move pieces of it to see if the bottom was empty. Being able to remove the rubber piece of the Waste King allows you to see that the disposal is clear of debris.
