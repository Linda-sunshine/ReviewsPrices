review/summary: Nice attactive little heaterreview/text: Nice little heater, it looks good and matches the tans and browns in my room. Much more attractive than every other heater I have seen. It works great for a 30x30 foot room if you dont have very high ceilings. I have had ceiling fans that were louder than this little guy, as far as I can tell, the only noise coming out of it is the woosh from the wind. It would be nice if that red LED on the front wasn't on 24/7 though.For the people who don't like how it stays on Max when you set it to low, the manual states that it does this for &#34;efficiency&#34;. Probably because it wouldn't put out enough heat for it to be useful and would just run all of the time and waste power. I am happy with it!Also, the metal stand has little rubber feet to prevent it from scratching or sliding, so don't be deterred from this one if you have a particular spot in mind that has a sensitive surface.
