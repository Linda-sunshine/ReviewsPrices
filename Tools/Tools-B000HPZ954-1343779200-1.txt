review/summary: Works. Looks good.review/text: I use it for my entertainment center. Use it for surge protector for my cable and from my modem for Ethernet surge as well. Don't know if it works - would rather never find out. But it has a big warranty which makes me feel better. Easily fits under the entertainment center - it's very slim. Good spacing between outlets so everything fits well.
