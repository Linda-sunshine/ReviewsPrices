review/summary: Culligan FM-15A Faucet Filterreview/text: I had similar Culligan filter when I lived in an apartment years ago and loved it very much. Recently I had to move another apartment temporarily and the water there tasted awful. I remembered Culligan and purchased it through Amazon, and fixed the problem immediately. The installation was easy without any tool. I just wish I can change the filter from the top instead of the bottom of the fixture as I used to do with the older model. Since I have weak hands, it is a bit hard to unscrew the bottom part. otherwise, it is a good product with reasonable price.
