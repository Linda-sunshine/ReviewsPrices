review/summary: Works greatreview/text: This unit replaced an Insinkerator 777SS model that was about 7 years old. The old model would not shred the food fine enough so the sink drain would always get plugged. I kept a plunger under the sink just for that reason.The Waste King does not do that. I have run various foods, especially onion peels, without the sink plugging. You can tell by the sound that this operates at a higher RPM that my old unit. Other people have complained about it being noiser than an Insinkerator, which it is, but not objectionally. It is actually noiser if the water goes directly in the center of the drain, probably due to the higher speed. Move the water out of the center and the unit is only slightly louder than the Insinkerator. I can put up with a little louder noise rather than the sink plugging all the time.
