review/summary: So pleased with this filterreview/text: This is the third type of water filter I've gotten for my kitchen sink. I've had two Purs and a Brita and they all broke. I've had this Culligan, which was the least expensive of the bunch, for quite awhile now and it's still working very well. It's affordable, replacement filters are affordable, and it holds up over time. I'll never buy the more expensive ones again!
