review/summary: Super quiet!review/text: I replaced my garbage disposal when I installed a new sink. This thing is super quiet, it's hard to tell it's on. I couldn't be happier. One thing I can't figure out is why they don't put the power cord on at the factory. Instead, you will need to buy this separately for the install.
