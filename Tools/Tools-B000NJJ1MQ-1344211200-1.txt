review/summary: Works Great!review/text: We went on vacation last month and the Condo where we stayed had one of these on the front door...it was so handy, I thought I would check into getting one of these for our house. Had forgotten about it until Amazon had it on their Daily Deal and was so glad I had forgotten about it as I saved a lot of money over what it would cost at some of the big box stores! Anyway, it was very easy to install...everything fit in the existing deadbolt hole and then it worked great. My 6 and 8 year old kids can easily use it....if they can remember the code. My main use for this is it will be handy to lock the door when I walk the dog early in the morning without having to go find my keys and take them along.
