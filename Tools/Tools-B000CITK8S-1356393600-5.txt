review/summary: Excellent trickle charger.review/text: This is the 2nd battery tender I have owned, used them both for my Harley-Davidson motorcycles. I highly recommend this device as small batteries do go dead in a very short time unless they are kept charged up. I plug it in every time I return from riding and my battery gives many years of service. That's a good thing considering a motorcycle battery can run between $85-$110........
