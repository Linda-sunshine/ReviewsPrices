review/summary: Great Productreview/text: Just wanted to say this product is great. I was getting tired of spending money on glue traps and snap traps that rarely caught the mice. The mice would somehow get off the glue traps and never managed to spring the spring traps. So, I decided to spend the few extra dollars for this product. I got one mouse in less than 24 hrs and set it again awaiting the next one. Easy to use with no mess! I am so glad I purchased this cause it actually WORKS!
