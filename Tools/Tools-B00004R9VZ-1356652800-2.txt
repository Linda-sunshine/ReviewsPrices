review/summary: Works greatreview/text: I have this outside of my house which is situated on a 1 acre lot and this does a terrific job of keeping the mosquitoes away. The only downside I've found, which isn't really directly related to the product itself, is that one of my dogs is absolutely terrified of the zapping noise.
