review/summary: Handy Homeowner's Ladderreview/text: This is a great and very versatile ladder at a reasonable price. Our old wooden ladder finally disintegrated, so I shopped around looking for a better replacement. The only criticism I have is that it's a bit heavy. Shortly after arrival, my husband cleaned out the gutters.
