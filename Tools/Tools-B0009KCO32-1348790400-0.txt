review/summary: Quick and Easy, A reasonable Optionreview/text: This screen installed easily, and does work pretty good for its intended purpose. The magnets don't always close, sometimes they need to be 'encouraged' to close completely. Also, some crawling bugs will still creep in under the screen. Another word of caution: this screen is advertised to let your dog/cat/kids out, but will also let random neightborhood cats in as well... just be forewarned!
