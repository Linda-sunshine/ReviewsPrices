review/summary: Excellent option for those on electric resistive or baseboard heat.review/text: This thermostat is an excellent option for people living with expensive and difficult to control resistive baseboard heaters. The Lux WIN100 programmable thermostat allows you to use a simple electric space heater to heat your apartment or house. Most resistive baseboard heaters have a simple on-off thermostat with no fan or forced air circulation. This results in either roasting with a high electric bill or freezing to save money.The thermostat comes with lithium batteries for battery backup to maintain the time and the program. The program is a 5day/2 day with weekday and weekend settings. There are 4 periods over which the temperature can be set and the times can be set arbitrarily. For example, I use the weekday program to set the temperature to 78f from 6am to 9am and then at 9am turn it down to 62F. At 5pm then it turns up to 68F until 11pm, at which point it turns down to 62F until the next day at 6am.The temperature can be overridden just like a regular thermostat. A master override switch is located on the side to turn off the controlled appliance.I recommend using the device with an analog (dial controlled, no fixed temperature number) controlled space heater with it's own safety mechanisms- tip over protection, overheat protection,etc, as the thermostat has no builtin safety mechanisms, according to the manual.Overall, its a great device to inexpensively modernize a basic apartment with comfortable forced air heat, and save money on your electric bill.
