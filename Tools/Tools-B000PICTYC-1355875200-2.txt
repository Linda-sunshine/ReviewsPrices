review/summary: Best camping tomahawkreview/text: Very strong construction good for making fire and protecting it too very well balanced and was shocked at the quality versus what I paid. I read a few of the reviews that where negative and realize there are a lot of negative people and it is a Sog so I went with my feelings and bought it anyway and I'm so glad I did. This hatchet is not made to cut down trees just good for splitting kenneling and is very well balance for throwing
