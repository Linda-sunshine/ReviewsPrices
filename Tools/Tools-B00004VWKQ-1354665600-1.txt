review/summary: It really does sharpen knivesreview/text: I can't use a rod like the professionals do, and I can't afford an expensive electric knife sharpener. Most of the low-cost mechanical sharpeners don't work for me, but this does. I can't say it worked 100% on my old, old, very dull knives, but they were improved. And it's keeping my new set of knives really sharp!
