review/summary: Great product ...just on thingreview/text: I decided on this product because the deadbolt turns by hand. the advantage is that you will not be changing batteries all the time. The other reason is that if the fit is snug, your hand is much stronger than a small motorized system. I know someone who has owned it for several years and cannot remember ever changing out the battery!The only con is that it sticks out from the face of the door approximately 2 inches and after I installed it and closed the door I realized that it was hitting the handle on our storm door. Still haven't quite figured out the permanent fix on the storm door handle.Another nice feature is that you can change the programming code to your own. This works well if you need to change the code and can't find the paperwork which has the original info.One last suggestion is to input an emergency code so that if you need someone to get in the house you can use that code and then delete it after if you want and then set up a new emergency code.
