review/summary: had it installed about a weekreview/text: Works great, adding and removing codes is pretty easy. It doesn't lock/unlock the bolt for you, which is the one thing I could complain about, but once you understand how you do it, it's dead easy. Still getting used to leaving the keys in the pocket.
