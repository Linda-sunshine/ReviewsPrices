review/summary: It works, but wait - there's more!review/text: I love when manufacturers build a product that simply works. They don't try to build something that &#34;sort of&#34; works and then pawn it off like it should. Many battery tenders say that they are automatic, but if you start reading all they do is shut themselves off when they reach a preset voltage, then back on full power when the battery drops again. This tender is much better than that. After the battery reaches full charge, the tender switches to float mode and keeps it there, never letting the battery drop down. So your battery doesn't take a hit all the time. It's always fresh and ready to go. But the best part? Deltran gives you 2 different ways to connect this charger - either by alligator clips or by o-rings. Each cable is long enough to be mounted wherever you'd like so you can use it on a vehicle, riding mower, ATV, etc and move the &#34;brain&#34; around where needed. So you can use this kit with 2 batteries, although (of course) not at the same time. Great little unit, priced right, and works like a champ!
