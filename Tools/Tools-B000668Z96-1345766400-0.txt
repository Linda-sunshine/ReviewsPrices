review/summary: Satisfiedreview/text: I had fleas, and the problem was "dying out", because i had sprayed all sorts of other flea products (mostly Raid in the purple can), and was vacuuming like crazy everyday, and throwing out the bag - but I got this product and placed it near the entry door because the fleas were coming onto me by a feral cat outside. Not only did it catch some fleas, but it caught random other bugs like house centipedes, flies and beetles. It's very bright, so don't sleep near it, but I leave it on because now it's a comfort knowing that there's something "at work" while I'm sleeping. It came with two sticky pads, but I bought a spare pack as well.
