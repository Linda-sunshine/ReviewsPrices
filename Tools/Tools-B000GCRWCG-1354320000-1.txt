review/summary: Bought these but have not used them yet.review/text: I bought these for a Troop Wilderness survival camp out. We wanted to be sure that if the weather turned bad, the scouts would be okay. The package of blankets reside in the Troop trailer for emergencies or the next wilderness survival merit badge class.
