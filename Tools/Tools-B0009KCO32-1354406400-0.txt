review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: Mosquitoes have always sought me out in a crowd and I react to their bites so living in a screened area is a necessity for me. I live in Thailand half of each year, which has both the day and night feeding mosquitoes and I bought this for the small residence I have there. It fit my space perfectly. I read all the reviews so was prepared to make some modifications, which I did. I use a stretch cord, which seems to be common for hanging drapes in Thailand, across the top instead of the bar which came with it. (The bar is good quality.) It gives a snug fit. I also sewed velco the entire length of both sides and attached velco to the wood frame of my door opening, so the sides are also entirely sealed. The opening works fine with just one large magnet in the middle and at the bottom. Screens also act as a barrier to dust so my room is cleaner. I easily take it down about every 2 months and rinse out the accumulated dust, and when in place, it is almost invisible.
