review/summary: Tiny footprint, big impactreview/text: Let me start by saying that if I would have seen this item on a store shelf, I would have kept looking. When the box arrived I surely thought I made a mistake simply from the size of the box. It's TINY, but after all the great amazon reviews, this thing has to be awesome right? Well it is! It takes up such little space, but can heat an entire bedroom until it's a sauna! It runs very quiet, and the heat can be felt up to 10 feet away instantly. The plastic casing is cool to the touch while it's running, oscillation is silent and works well. Having a remote control is very handy for when the temp gets too hot and you need to turn it off without getting out of bed. It even looks nice, not the look you'd expect from a space heater. It looks more like a speaker/flower pot or something. Very happy with it!
