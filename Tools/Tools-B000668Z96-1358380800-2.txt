review/summary: Works like its supposed toreview/text: After reading the reviews and trying other methods to get rid of the fleas I decided to try this trap. The first night it did not work too well but after that it took only about 2 days for the trap to become filled with about 25 fleas. After a week I no longer was being bitten by fleas and after about a week and a half when used in conjunction with a basic defogger (from home depot, either raid or the other brand) the flea infestation was eliminated.
