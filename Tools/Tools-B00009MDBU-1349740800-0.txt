review/summary: Just as describedreview/text: Item works just as described. As other reviews noted, it would be better if this item had a short extension cord to the wall, so you could pick up the item to hold in a manner making it easier to read the LED readout screen (if you remove from the wall/plug, it loses all data, so must be read while inserted in power socket). You can accomplish the same by using your own short ext. cord. Otherwise, it is fine.
