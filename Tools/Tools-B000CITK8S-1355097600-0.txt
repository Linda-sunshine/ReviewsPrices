review/summary: Keeping things chargedreview/text: With a tractor and riding lawnmower that sit idle over the winter, and their batteries being so expensive, I hope this will keep both batteries from needing to be replaced next year. I alternate between charging one, then the other, and hope that with the batteries staying charged, I'll save big! I started the lawnmower this weekend, just to move it, and it started right up, even though the temps have been below freezing already. So far, all is good!
