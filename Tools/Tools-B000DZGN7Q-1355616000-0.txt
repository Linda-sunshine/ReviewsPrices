review/summary: Defective!review/text: Ordered this disposal for a kitchen remodel. Paid a plumber to install and after 45 minutes of trying to figure out why there was a leak under the sink determined that the disposal was leaking from the bottom. Back to the drawing board, had to purchase replacement through the plumber--more expensive, and then pay for more time$$$$$ to install the second disposal. Would not recommend this brand. Guess you get what you pay for. Very expensive proposition. Fortunately Amazon was great and took the disposal back even though past the 30 day normal return policy. Love Amazon!
