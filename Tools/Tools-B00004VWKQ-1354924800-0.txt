review/summary: Works Better Than I Expectedreview/text: I forget the price I paid, but it was only a few bucks. I really didn't anticipate much for it. But, after researching all of the knife sharpener options (most of which were very expensive and with only mixed reviews), I decided this was worth trying.It works well on my mid-range-to-high end kitchen knives. I haven't tried it on serrated knives. A tip: If your knives are quite dull, it helps to get a good edge quicker if you tilt the sharpener slightly to one side of the blade when drawing it down, and then doing the same with a reverse tilt. Do this few times and then finish with a few straight passes. Do follow the instructions and wash the knives after sharpening and before using. And, use a light touch...do not press down hard.
