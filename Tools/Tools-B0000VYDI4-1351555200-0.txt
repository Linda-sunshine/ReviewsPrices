review/summary: Works great, but is really heavyreview/text: I think I should have ordered the the 17' instead of the 22'. The 22' is just too heavy for me to lug around .. it's hard to maneuver and get up steps. I'm probably average size, and I'm guessing this is built for handymen or construction people with a bit more bulk. At the time the 17' and 22' were both $164, so I figured why not?When it's in standard configuration with both ladders combined, it provides a lot of support and I feel 'stable' standing on it. When they are separated, the steps are a little smaller but it still works. The picture shows scaffold mode, which makes it seem like it comes with the scaffold, but it doesn't. It's pretty easy to increase and decrease the height.
