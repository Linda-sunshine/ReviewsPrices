review/summary: Excellent results!review/text: We ordered this flea trap in a last ditch effort to try and control the flea infestation in our home, before resorting to using something more drastic such as a bug bomb. We were amazed at how well it worked! It trapped dozens of fleas in the first 2 weeks we used it. We saw far fewer fleas after only a few days, and now after 3 weeks of use we haven't seen one flea in more than a week. This trap saved us from having to use a harsh chemical bug bomb. With young children and pets in our home, this was a great relief. Based on our experience, I would definitely recommend this product.
