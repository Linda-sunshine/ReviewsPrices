review/summary: Good productreview/text: I use this product to control the temperature in a chest freezer that I use to ferment beer. Most products designed for this purpose retail for $50-$60 so I decided to try this out in hopes I could save a few dollars. There are limitations (the termometer is on a VERY short cord, so the unit needs to be in the same space as whatever you are cooling), but overall, I am pleased with the simple controls, digital readout, and the energy-saving differential (approx. 3 degrees), so that it is not constantly cycling the compressor on my freezer. If you don't mind running an extension cord into your freezer, this is a good way to save a little cash in your homebrew setup.
