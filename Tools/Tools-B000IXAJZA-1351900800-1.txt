review/summary: Proven...review/text: I bought this flashlight a year ago after a very unexpected minor earthquake in the NYC area. Very soon after we had a category one hurricane but it didn't arrive in time for that. So I didn't really get a chance to use it. This year we had -- are still in the aftermath of -- superstorm Sandy. I have been without power for a week but this flashlight has been my friend. It lights up the whole room and enables me to do a lot of things without too much difficulty. I take it everywhere with me just in case I get back late and it gets dark...no streetlights. It's a good solid weight. It feels durable and strong and I'm really glad I bought it. The only negative would be that the cover is a bit difficult to put on after installing the batteries but that's negligible. Overall a great buy and I think a good investment. It would be nicer not to ever need it but it's good to know I have it if I do.
