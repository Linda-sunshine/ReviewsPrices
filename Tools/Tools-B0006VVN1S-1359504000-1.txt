review/summary: Seems to work wellreview/text: We have well water and my wife was concerned her hair was turning brassy from the iron in the water. So after checking reviews we decided to go with this one. It was easy to install. She said the brassiness is still there, so it might not be the water afterall The flow was reduced from what we were using but not bad at all. Gives some peace of mind knowing it's cleaner water in the shower.
