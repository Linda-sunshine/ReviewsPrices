review/summary: My New Apple Grinderreview/text: I actually bought this not to use as a disposal, but to grind apples for making cider. The L-8000 was up to the task. I ground 80 lbs of apples no problem. I imagine it would go through food scraps like crazy. I'm really glad I paid a few extra dollars to step up to the 1 HP; it was well worth it!
