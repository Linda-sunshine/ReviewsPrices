review/summary: Hoping for 7 years of silence!review/text: Bought two of these and got them quick. Plugged them in and tested them. Now I hope to never hear them unless I push the test button. After owning the Kidde combo gas monoxide detectors I have one suggestion.......get yourself a Sharpie and scribble the date you installed it on the back. I had my Kidde detectors 11 years without realizing it ! My how time flies. The CO615 has an end of life warning that should help, but the date will let you know if it goes off way too early, or even way too late. There is no manufacture date, and the packaging copyright is 2010 (which I know doesn't mean much). The manual says the end of life timer starts upon &#34;installation&#34;, so we'll see. Time will tell I guess. Anyway, everything works like the manual described. I'm happy.
