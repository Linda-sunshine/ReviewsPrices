review/summary: Get itreview/text: I was kinda sick of fishing out my keys every time I got home so I decided to spring for this electronic deadbolt, and man am I glad I did. Heavy duty, simple to program, super smooth action, it's great all around. Took about 10 minutes to glance over the directions and then install. No gripes whatsoever.
