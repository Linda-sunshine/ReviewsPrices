review/summary: Really Impressedreview/text: This is a really good precession bit set. Exchangeable bit drivers will never be as good as one piece tools because of the shank diameter when in tight area's but they cost a lot less. I choose these since I won't use them much and cost, and I am very happy I did. The smaller size bits means they still fit tight spots and they seem well constructed.
