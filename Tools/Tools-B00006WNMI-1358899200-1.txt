review/summary: Simple to install and greatly improved taste of waterreview/text: The Culligan FM-15A Level 3 Faucet Filter did everything it was said it would. I haven't yet changed the filter, so depending on that experience, my rating might change. Everything has been great so far though. The water tastes a lot better! I use it for drinking at work and for making coffee. The coffee tastes a lot better too. Great purchase!
