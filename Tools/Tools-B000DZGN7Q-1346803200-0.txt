review/summary: Excellentreview/text: Replaced a Badger garbage disposer with the Waste King L-8000. Consumer Reports rated the Waste King highest and I now see why. Waste King quieter than Badger by far. Also, I have not been able to plug the Waste King yet. Made a pot roast last week and I put a large amount of potato and carrot skins in the sink to go down the disposal. I have had this type of waste plug the Badger disposal many times before, what a mess. However, the Waste King took the potato and carrot waste away without any problems. Excellent!
