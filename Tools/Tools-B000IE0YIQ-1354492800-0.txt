review/summary: Great for Occasional Usereview/text: I bought this to use for my golf cart. There are no gas stations near our lake house for air supply, so I wanted something that would do the job as needed. The Air Station works fine for my use and is light to put into operation. I like the ability to preset the desired psi and have the unit turn off when it reaches the desired level. The time it takes to put 5-8 lbs of pressure in a tire is reasonable. My only issue is the placement of the on/off switch. It is hard to see with the cables all around it. Also storing the cable and air hose is a little tight in the space provided.
