review/summary: Does the trick but not my preferencereview/text: Overall a good quality product. My main purpose in buying this is to use the knife feature for opening up boxes. I need to do this on a couple of times a week but I don't want to carry a utility knife or something--want it there when I need it and out of the way when I don't. What I don't like about this product is that 1) it doesn't quite have the level of ease but requires a bit of effort to open it--have to get your finger nails in the grooves and 2) it comes off the key ring when you open it. I prefer it to be a little more of a quicker process of opening, cutting & clipping my key ring back on my belt loop.
