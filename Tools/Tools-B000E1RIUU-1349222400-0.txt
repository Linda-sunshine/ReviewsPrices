review/summary: Yay! A non-snap kill trap!review/text: I ordered 2 of these and just got them today. I set them up maybe 2 hours ago. I put one in my den and one in my kitchen. Shortly after setting them up, I was sitting on my couch and saw a little mouse investigate the trap. It even stepped inside for a second, then backed out and left. For a minute I thought the trap had failed, but decided the mouse probably just decided not to mess with it then because if it had failed the mouse probably would have stayed in there longer eating the peanut butter.Then just about 10 minutes ago, the mouse (or one of his friends) was back. The mouse went around to the back of the trap to try to get the peanut butter through the holes. Here is where these traps lose a star from me. In the picture, there are only 2 holes and they are pretty high up. Mine has more than that and they are difficult to avoid with the peanut butter. Just as I suspected they would, the mouse went around to the back to try to get the peanut butter through the holes instead of going inside and going through the maze. HOWEVER when I set the trap up, I used a lego to block the holes and made it so a mouse couldn't move the lego. I heard the mouse scratching at/nibbling on the lego for a second, then it went back around to the door, went in, and I could hear the buzzing for several seconds. The little green light is blinking and no mouse has emerged. (I haven't opened the door yet because I really want to make sure the mouse is DEAD and not just unconscious... It's been awhile now though.)I hate snap traps. They terrify me. I'm always afraid they are going to snap on my finger. Plus I have pets and a toddler. Glue traps are gross because they don't kill the mice and you have to either leave them to die a slow death or kill them yourself. ICK.
