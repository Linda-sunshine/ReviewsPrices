review/summary: Love it!review/text: This lock is wonderful. It holds multiple combinations, is easy to install, and easy to use. I love being able to go for a jog, walk the dog to the park, run to the gas station, etc and not have to bring my keys! Guys might not care that much, but ladies often have extremely small or nonexistent pockets, making bulky, noisy key rings an annoying requirement on these quick outings.My husband also went on a long spiel about how nice this lock is compared to other keyless deadbolts because of the way the locking mechanism works. It saves lots of battery power and doesn't have a small motor in it. Which means not only does the battery last longer, but there aren't any motors to degenerate over time. I won't say anything more to try to mitigate the risk of talking from the top of Mount Stupid.Bottom line: I really REALLY like this lock. I felt it was well worth the money.
