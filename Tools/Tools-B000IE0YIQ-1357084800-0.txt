review/summary: Works reasonably wellreview/text: I have been using the Air Station inflator on my car tires. The unit will inflate the tires but it takes some time, several minutes.My two complaints are:-the pressure gauge is extremely inaccurate. You will need a separate tire pressure gauge to check the pressures.-the storage compartment at the back of the unit is poorly designed thereby making the access to the power switch awkward.
