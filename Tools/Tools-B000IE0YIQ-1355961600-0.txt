review/summary: Does a good job, wish it was faster and less noisy.review/text: Purchased this item for my minivan. It took about 10 minutes to go from 20PSI to 35PSI. While it was busy working, it made a lot of noise. The 120-volt cord I found to be very short, I guess it's because &#34;Black and Decker&#34; assumes you'll use an extension if you have to use it. The 12-volt cord is very long so it is possible to use it even on vans. Overall, this is a good product and I recommend it.
