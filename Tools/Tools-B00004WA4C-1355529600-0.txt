review/summary: Highly recommend this dual detectorreview/text: Very easy set up...Tested out & I love the fact this detects smoke & monoxide.I don't no for sure if monoxide works other than voice activating tests,I did physically tested smoke, and this picks up great. I love the fact thiscan distinguish between them both.... & also lets you know. I highly recommend this.
