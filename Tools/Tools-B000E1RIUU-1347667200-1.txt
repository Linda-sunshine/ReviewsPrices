review/summary: Very good, but one annoying flawreview/text: I've been using these traps for a while, and at first I really liked them. I've caught many mice with them. They are certainly effective and convenient. They have a light that blinks when they have caught a mouse, which means that you can put them in dark corners and it's easy to tell if they need to be emptied. I've learned to look at them for a good 30 seconds, because the light flashes briefly with several seconds between, and you can miss it if you just glance at the trap.The problem is that the blinking green light isn't reliable. So, I set the traps, and check them every day. Then I notice a bad smell, so I double check the traps - no blinking light. I check everything else that might smell, and eventually triple check the traps - no blinking light.Finally I open the trap and look inside. It's not pretty. By that time the dead mouse doesn't just drop out of the trap when you turn it over and open the lid. And these traps are too expensive (and have electronics) so I don't want to just throw them out. So I'm stuck trying to clean out the nooks and crannies. Yuck.Considering traps may not get checked over a holiday weekend, they really need to blink for a week, or preferably just keep blinking until the batteries die.If it wasn't for that, I'd give these traps five stars. I've found them to be very effective at catching mice. But, I'm considering going back to snap traps. At least with snap traps you can tell by looking at them when they've caught something. With these you can't be sure unless you open them up and look inside.
