review/summary: Serious duty for dollars spent.review/text: Just going to cut to the heart of it - this is VERY closely modeled after the Vietnam Tomahawk, that was issued to and used by soldiers, and the originals were designed by a Indian (Native American to you pale faces). Tomahawks have been deployed since the days of the civil war, and there are yet still forces deploying them. They are multipurpose tools, that also are pretty effective for CQC use. It has been storried that one serviceman, being relived of his rifle fought and overcame four members of the oposition with his tomahawk. They had the guns, he had the sharp object on a stick, and he overcame.If you want something stronger, "better designed", more "hard core" - those products are out there. Be prepared to part with no less than $200 US Dollars to get something that surpases this tool. Certainly over $150.Buy. Be Safe. Enjoy.
