review/summary: Culligan FM-15A Faucet Filterreview/text: It was easily installed. The water taste good and the shut-off valve works great. I am very satisfied with it. It sure beats the water I have been boiling (the water taste bad and smelled) since living in a development with their own water treatment plant separate from the City.
