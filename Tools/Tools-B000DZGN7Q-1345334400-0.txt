review/summary: Fast shipping, easy installation, quiet operationreview/text: I doubt anyone replaces a functional disposal, even if it is loud, slow, or both. We wouldn't have replaced our Ace Hardware model, if it hadn't started leaking. But now I'm glad it did! We got this one in 2 days as promised, it was easy to install, and is really quiet!
