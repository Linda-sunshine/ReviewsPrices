review/summary: Boxer Screwdriver Setreview/text: Needed a tool set to replace a HDD with a SSD in my Toshiba Netbook N205.The drive cover requires a T-4 torx bit. All other screws are small phillips bits.Toshiba could have used a small phillips screw, but they didn't, which caused me to purchase this 30-piece set.The screwdriver handle is sturdy enough to get the job done, and the bits appear to be good quality hard metal.Since this set includes the tiny T-3 torx bit, I should be able to get into any device such as an iPad, etc.Overall, I am very pleased with this tool set.
