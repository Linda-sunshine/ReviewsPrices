review/summary: Good for less expensive knivesreview/text: This workd far better than the other knife sharpening gizmos I've collected over the years. I bought it specifically to salvage some old dull knives. It does a fine job.I would hesitate to use it on my better blades because as others have pointed out, it shaves a lot of metal off the edge.
