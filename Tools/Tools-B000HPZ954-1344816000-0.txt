review/summary: Good Productreview/text: I've had three of these Belkin surge protectors in my home for several years protecting various electrical and electronic equipment. We have experienced severe storms, power losses, and power fluctuations during that time and I've never had a problem with equipment damage or failure of the surge protector to work properly. I like the units have 12 outlets.
