review/summary: Great Northwoods Toolreview/text: I wanted something to compliment my Ka-Bar knife, and my choice narrowed down to between a kukri machete or a tomahawk. I chose this. The reach was the deciding factor. If I want to cut a sapling down at the base, I don't have to bend over too much. If a rabid animal attacks me on one of my sojourns into the woods, I can push them back with this while I keep my knife ready in case it gets in too close. This tomahawk has a nice heft to it. Great for chopping. The blade came sharp, but with a little extra sharpening with a stone, I got it to near razor sharp. The sheath holds it in well from my pistol belt and I barely even know it's there. Feels real solid, with a good grip. You can turn it sideways and use it as a hammer, or you could use the tapered point to dig up roots and cultivating. I do a lot of gardening and love having this at my side. It really is a quality, sturdy tool, and a deadly weapon if it ever comes to that. Very happy with this purchase.
