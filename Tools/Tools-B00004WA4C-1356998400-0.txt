review/summary: Nice alarm, though...review/text: This is the second alarm of the same kind I purchased for the same spot. The first one broke after five years. I didn't want to change the bracket on the ceiling, so I just bought a new unit and swapped them. When it fails, it beeps every so-many seconds. It's a different interval than when it needs a battery. Of course, it started beeping in the middle of the night. Woke me up. Assuming it was the battery (it takes three double-As), I changed them. But it kept beeping. Some very small print on the unit, requiring a magnifying glass, explained that the interval of beeping I heard resulted from a malfunction... All this hullabaloo in the middle of the night precluded any further sleep. But OK. The unit did very good service for five years. When it sniffs smoke, a stern, no-nonsense, female voice warns &#34;Fire! Fire!&#34; and it beeps like all get-out. It does the equivalent for carbon monoxide. It's nice to know that neither the house heater nor the car in the garage is poisoning the family. I recommend this unit, even though I contend that the little woman inside got angry after too many years trapped in the ceiling and, as revenge, caused me a sleepless night.
