review/summary: Best Trap I Have Usedreview/text: I went through the usual array of mechanical and glue traps and had some success, but often the cleanup was messy. Not with this device. I just put a small dab of peanut butter against the back wall and caught two mice in the first 24 hours that had evaded me for days.Don't over-bait the trap. You don't want the peanut butter to fall onto the plates. Mice have an acute sense of smell, so only a small amount is required.Once the mouse is electrocuted, simply open the door and dump the carcass out. It couldn't be easier.
