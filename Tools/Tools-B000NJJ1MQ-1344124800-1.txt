review/summary: Should have purchased tworeview/text: This is the perfect deadbolt for our house. Easy to install, easy to use - the kids love being able to get in and out of the house without having to worry about keys. The product is all metal, no plastic and looks great. I really like that you manually move the deadbolt so there are no internal motors to wear out. I wish I had purchased a second unit. They were featured as one of the daily special sales and that made it an even better deal.
