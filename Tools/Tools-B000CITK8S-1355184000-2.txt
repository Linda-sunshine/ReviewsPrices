review/summary: Battery Tender Jr. Great Productreview/text: Did a lot of information searching for a maintainer for my Optima Yellow Top battery. Floats are advertised to work on Optima batteries but once the package is cracked the instructions say not to use them. Well, Battery Tender Jr. is the bomb! Had lots of the less than $10 knock offs over the past few years for my classics. I was amazed at the quality of Deltrain and what I got for $28. The others don't compare. I got a charger and floater with two types of connecters that are of outstanding quality. Lesson learned for me that Deltrain is the way to go and the extra cost is well worth it. The knock offs won't work if the battery doesn't maintain a certain voltage, they are of much poorer quality, and they break when dropped. Now, I have a compact automatic charger and maintainer in one that can be used for wench and classic cars. I was so impressed that I purchased more of them to replace the knock offs.
