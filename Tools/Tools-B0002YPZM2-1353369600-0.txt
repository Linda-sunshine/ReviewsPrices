review/summary: good for fixing my bike and for ridingreview/text: Please note that these are mechanic-style gloves, not heavy duty work gloves, so do not expect them to be super durable. The trade-off is that they are GREAT at what they are designed for. I can pick up small screws and ball-bearings when working on bicycle no problem. The palm and knuckle pads provide very good protection and make gloves comfortable when you have to put your weight on your hands. Material is flexible and allows good fit around fingers, especially fingertips which are often a problem area with this kind of glove. Just thick enough to block most of the wind when I wear them out riding. 5 star quality for 2 star price, already bought a second pair to have as spare.
