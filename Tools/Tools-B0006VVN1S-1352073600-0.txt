review/summary: Great shower filterreview/text: A very worthwhile shower head with a decent filter and suited for very basic showering needs. The filter will last depending on how much it's used, you will be able to tell the filter is going raw when you start to feel the difference in the coarseness of the water coming out, or perhaps even a foul sulfur odor or residue. As said before, it's worth the price range to actually enjoy yourself while bathing.
