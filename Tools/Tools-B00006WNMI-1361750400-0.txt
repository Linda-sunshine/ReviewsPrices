review/summary: Culligan Faucet Filterreview/text: It seems to be a nice filter. Works great with my well water. Had a few problems attaching it to my faucet, but after a trip to the hardware store, it is up and working. Wish it filtered water a little faster. So far I like the Culligan faucet filter. I would recommend it to my friends.
