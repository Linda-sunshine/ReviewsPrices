review/summary: Best Electronic Lockreview/text: We were impressed at how long the batteries last because they are not turning the deadbolt, just unlocking it so you can turn it by hand. This is a much better design and small, less bulky than our old electronic lock. We first used this on the entrance to our fire station's emergency entrance door where the firemen enter when responding to an emergency run. It never let us down, so we have installed it at home too.
