review/summary: Great tasting water but the quality is what you pay forreview/text: I guess I am use to Pur and Brita quality filters. I did not want to pay $50 for clean water so i went with this based on the reviews. I really can not complain. It provides great tasting water. The switch on the side that allows you to choose clean/tap water will take some getting use to but it is nice that when you turn off the water, it automaticly goes back to tap.
