review/summary: Smoking dealreview/text: Cheaper than Lowes by a lot, and shipped to my door without the hassle of strapping it to the roof rack or fitting it inside the car. Very sturdy locking mechanism and easy to manipulate. It is heavy and thick (about 8-10&#34; deep), so keep that in mind if frequent moving is needed.
