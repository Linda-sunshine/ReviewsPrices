review/summary: Does a great job, but it might take a while.review/text: I used this to sharpen a sword. Maybe it's a bit of stronger steel than what people normally sharpen but for me I had to use a good bit of force/pressure pushing this down while going along the blade to actually sharpen it. However it does take very little force on knives and works pretty well!
