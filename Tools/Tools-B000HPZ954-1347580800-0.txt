review/summary: Fits everythingreview/text: I have to say, I have more than enough things to plug in behind my tv that do not fit anything else around. I found this on amazon and read some reviews, and decided to take the plunge. This thing fits all size plugs that I have for my entertainment needs in my living room. I have the tv, receiver, cable box, dvd player, xbox, wireless router, cordless phone... and i'm sure that's already too much. But this surge protector holds it all, and has room for more.
