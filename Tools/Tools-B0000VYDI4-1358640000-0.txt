review/summary: awesome ladderreview/text: This ladder is great. Doesn't take up much room to store, and it is like having 4 or more ladders in one. It made painting the outside of my house easy and is useful for cleaning gutters and for my wife to change light bulbs when I am not around. It is easy for her to use as well. My only negative is that I wish I bought one that gets taller/longer than this one.
