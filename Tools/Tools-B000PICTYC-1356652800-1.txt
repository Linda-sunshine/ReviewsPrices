review/summary: Great tomahawk.review/text: I usually buy cold steel products, and was looking for a solid tomahawk. I own their Trench Hawk which I am satisfied with but all of their other models have wooden handles which I am not crazy about. So after reading alot of mixed reviews I decided to purchase this SOG hawk. Perfect size, sharp out of the box. I have thrown it at the huge treen in my backyard and can sink it in 2 out of 3 times with the hawk side and 1 out of 3 times with the spike/breaching side. It hasn't broken, just some scuffs and scraped. Though the spike side has a small chip in the tip now. Not bad SOG.
