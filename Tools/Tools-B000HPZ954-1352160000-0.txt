review/summary: Connected equipment warranty not honoredreview/text: I have to agree with the earlier reviewer that Belkin does not honor the warranty for connected equipment. They are obviously in a difficult situation where one warranty claim on a $10 product could wipe out the profit on 10K units. BUT, that's what they are advertising. My opinion is that it's purely a gimmick. If you have a repair technician saying that your product has power surge damage but they can't detect a failure in their product, you get nothing. Seems like a little bit of a conflict of interest.Anyway, these products are good extension cords. Don't count on them working as surge protectors or on Belkin to honor their warranty. That said, I suspect this is the case for all of their competitors as well.This rating is not specific to this product.
