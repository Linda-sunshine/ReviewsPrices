review/summary: YES!!!review/text: finally something that allows me to enjoy my outdoor space...and leave the flys out!!! I love keeping my back door open, and now with this screen it is perfect! THe magnets stay close...it fits my door like a glove! the side adhesives are very strong!!! my 3 year old twins run in and out of this all day and it stays perfectly placed!
