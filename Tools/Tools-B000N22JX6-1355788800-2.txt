review/summary: Great designreview/text: Heats up almost instantly, love the oscillating feature. The setting are a little complex and I haven't read the complete instructions yet. I just turn it on and let it heat but I am sure you could program this little guy to be on a schedule. The design is cute, it is plastic but looks like it could be pottery. Shipped quickly....love that Prime membership.
