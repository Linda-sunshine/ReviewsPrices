review/summary: Perfectreview/text: Excellent purchase. Can't beat the price, and the light spreads out over a pretty wide area (easily covers both pages of an open book, so you don't have to move it around when you finish one page and start the next). It's easy to read by but isn't so bright it hurts your eyes as I worried it might. Plus, it's very easy to move the twisty arm part of it and it actually stays where you put it. Bought one for myself and just ordered another for my mom, as she likes mine so much better than the one she had (which was at least double the price).
