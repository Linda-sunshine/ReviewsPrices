review/summary: Keeps bugs out and fresh air inreview/text: This is our 2nd screen. Last one lasted over 10 years. We use it in the garage and it allows us a screen door without having a big door frame to get in the way. Works good with our dog, she just walks right through it. Amazon had the best price and the free shipping.
