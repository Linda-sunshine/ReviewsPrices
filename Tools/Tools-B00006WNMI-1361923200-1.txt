review/summary: Clear Waterreview/text: Brand new apt, unfiltered water runs cloudy. This cleared it right up. Due to the excessive cloudiness when unfiltered, Ill replace with another one before recommended time frame. The product gets 5 stars, friend showed me consumer reports rating as the best one. The filter replacement gets zero stars for costing more than the product.
