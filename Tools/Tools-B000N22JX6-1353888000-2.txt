review/summary: Best heater we've ever had!review/text: We needed supplemental heat for a room that is about 25' x 13' and has a high ceiling. Was amazed that after about 20 minutes of running this heater the room was toasty and comfortable. Actually had to turn the temperature down a little on it so the room didn't get too warm. The heater is also very quiet as opposed to most other heaters we've tried. Another reviewer commented on a plastic smell from the heater when it was running. While it's true that there was a plastic smell (the thing is new plastic afterall) it does dissipate after a couple uses. We liked the heater so much that we ordered another one for our son and his wife. We highly recommend this heater to anyone who needs that warm and toasty feeling!
