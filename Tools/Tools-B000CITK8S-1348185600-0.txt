review/summary: A necessity for WInter Storagereview/text: If you have vehicles that you only run half the year- a motorcycle, or a snowmobile, or a large outboard- it's important to keep the battery charged during the rest of the year, or it'll self-discharge and eventually self-destruct. The best way to keep that battery fresh is to bring it indoors and connect an intelligent trickle charger that'll keep it topped off without overcharging. I have a constantly changing collection of small motorcycles and scooters in my garage and a marine battery that gets used occasionally to run a trolling motor, and to go with them, a small collection of these battery tenders in both 6 and 12 volt models. They're not terribly expensive, and they work. You can also buy multi-charge models like theBattery Tender 021-0128 Battery Tender Plus 12V Battery Chargerthat will handle from two to as many as ten batteries at once, and if you do have more than one battery to maintain, they'e a better deal, and the higher end models are also regulated and temperature controlled. If I was starting from zero that's the way I'd go, but I started with just one, and they're all still working, so I have no need to upgrade.
