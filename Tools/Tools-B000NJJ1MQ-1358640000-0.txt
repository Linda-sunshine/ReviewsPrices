review/summary: Very difficult to install.review/text: If the holes drilled out for the deadbolt on your door are not perfectly level then you will not be able to install these and will acquire a great deal of frustration. The tolerances in how the screw lines up are maybe 1 mm. The return process wasn't the most stress free either. I have installed a lot of locks while re-keying foreclosure properties so I have an above average experience level with locks and the company treated me like I was a piss idiot. I only got one of two installed and when I did use it the lock was very sporadic in its operation and actually locked me out of house once.
