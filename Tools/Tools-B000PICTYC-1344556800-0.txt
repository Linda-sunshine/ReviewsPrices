review/summary: SOG Tomahawkreview/text: I purchased this tomahawk last month. It is well built and as stated in other reviews has a very sharp edge! I use mine for yard work and find that it performs well. The handle has a hole so I added a lanyard for added safety. So far I am very happy with this tool.
