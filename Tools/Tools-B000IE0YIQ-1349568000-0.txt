review/summary: work in a pinchreview/text: Main negative is that it is basically a 12V pump. The 120 plug in just feeds a 12V transformer [like a cell phone charger] and the pump is DC and the output is really low. Ok for a lawn mower or bike tire, but go have a sandwich and a nap if you're trying to pump up a car tire. Had a B&D; Air Station many years ago that was 120 only and while it does not have the pressure of a big pump, it got the job done much faster than this one. Anyway the 120 side went bad [after warranty] so can only use it with a battery.For $50 you can find a better air pump.
