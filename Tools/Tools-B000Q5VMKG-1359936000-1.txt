review/summary: Saved our lives.review/text: I had recently moved into a house that i had purchased and our old Carbon Monoxide detetector kept going off at night but because it wasnt digital i didnt know if it was just a bad battery so we slept with all the windows cracked in the bedrooms so i bought this first alert digital and again the 1st night i had it plugged it in, it went off and gave a reading over 100 i was scared so i called a technician and sure enough the heater had a hole in the heat exchange and the technician said we were lucky we got it fixed before someone died.
