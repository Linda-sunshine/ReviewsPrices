review/summary: Excellent work/workout golvesreview/text: I bought two pair of these - the first was size L, which proved to be too small for me. I have rather large hands, but generally, a size L works for me with golf gloves. They are still usable, but clearly smaller than I need. The second pair I bought is size XL. Better fit, but still not quite perfect. What I like about these is that you can wash them and they come out like new! Nothing like I'd expected, having gone through many pairs of work gloves that ultimately met their end after a good soaking. I use the second pair almost exclusively for working out with the weight system in my home gym. They provide an excellent grip, some decent padding and are effective at preventing calluses. I will buy these again when (if) these wear out.
