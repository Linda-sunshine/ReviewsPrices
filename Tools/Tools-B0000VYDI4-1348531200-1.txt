review/summary: works great but is heavyreview/text: The ladder is great. It telescopes to heights I couldn't reach before with a standard 8 foot ladder. The best part is it folds up for easy storage when finished. However, this ladder was much heavier than I realized which makes it more difficult to move and my wife wife cannot use it on her own. In addition, there isn't an easy way to carry the ladder because of how the steps are made and positioned.
