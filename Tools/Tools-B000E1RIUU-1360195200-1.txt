review/summary: Amazingly Effective!review/text: These traps are the best option possible. I was doubtful as most probably are. After just a few days I discovered how simple, clean and effective the system really is. I'm currently using one unit, but may expand to two if I'm away from home more often because that's when the mice seem to get out of control. The fool-proof design combines with features such as a blinking light that indicates there has been a kill, it is the perfect solution. Especially if you have a Deer Mouse problem (poison does not work on those pests).
