review/summary: So far so goodreview/text: I've tried several different faucet attached filters. They all seem to suffer from the same problem. The filter works fine but the fixture is so cheap and poorly designed they don't last or are clumsy to use. This is the simplest design. It will depend on how long it lasts. If one of these filter companies would offer a fixture built to last and easy to use it would be worth some extra money.
