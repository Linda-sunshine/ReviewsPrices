review/summary: Good for what I need, but does not seem very durable.review/text: I swear, I nearly broke the thing just opening the hatch to put in the batteries. I actually feared I had because it took a bit of force and then it snapped off and went flying. After that and a slight fear of the cleap plastic meaning this may not have a long life... I can at least say that it does really well for what I was planning to use it for. I have a little DJ lighting controller with some DJ lights and when I needed to use the controller with only dj lighting on it was always hard to see. This sheds a nice little light that is neither too dull nor too bright and fills the area I needed (about 6&#34; by 12&#34;). It is easy to position the light as needed with the bendable neck. The clip itself works fine for my needs as well since the controler is built to be rack mountable and basically has some metal ears on it for mounting that this clips on just right. As long as it lasts, it seems to be what I needed... and, again, be careful with the battery loading...
