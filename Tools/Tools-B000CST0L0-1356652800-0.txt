review/summary: Didn't workreview/text: We followed the simple universal instructions. My Brother tried first, no good. My Mother then tried to set the garage door opener, no luck. Then I cam from inside the house, not seeing what they had previously done, checked the battery, opened closed the garage door, started from the beginning of the instructions. Still nothing happened.We tried with an existing remote that was working, followed the new remote's instructions. It worked perfectly for our old remote. #EpicFail
