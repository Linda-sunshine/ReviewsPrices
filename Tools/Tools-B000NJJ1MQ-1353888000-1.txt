review/summary: Love it!review/text: I bought this lock for my side door so that my kids could open the door without having to have a key, only because I knew that key would get lost. It's extremely easy to install if you take the time to read the instructions. It took me about 30 min's to install and setup and I'm not that handy. If you press the Schlage button the keypad lights up blue so that you can see the numbers. This is perfect if it is dark and the light isn't on outside. Also, I love the fact that this set doesn't show any wear on the number pad, which is important because if the numbers start to wear off, then people will know what your code is.We all have our own codes in the house so that if by chance my kids tell someone the code, I can just change theirs and be done. This is an awesome lock!
