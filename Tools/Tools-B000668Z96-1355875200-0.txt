review/summary: It worksreview/text: We have tried pesticide sprays, powder and fog. They didn't get rid of all the fleas. Well, we didn't fog the kitchen area for fear of the pesticide getting onto the food. This flea trap really works! It is safe and environmentally friendly. No pesticides are involved. It takes time though. It took a few weeks to completely get rid of all the fleas. I'm soooo happy!
