review/summary: Best buy for the buckreview/text: To start with the directions are easy to read and uncomplecated to perform. The new easy coupling design (new to me anyway), was a breeze to work with. The unit itself is powerfull and extreamly quiet. Your design team and engineers have outdone themselves with this item.
