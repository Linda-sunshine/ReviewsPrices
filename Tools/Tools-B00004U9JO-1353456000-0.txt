review/summary: Badger 5review/text: The Badger 5 came with the condo. At around 2 years I started to notice a few drops of brown liquid on the cabinet floor. I let it go for a while because it just wasn't that bad at the time. Well, it is now. The housing is cracked badly. run the sink, turn on the disposal and watch the waterworks. Not fun.
