review/summary: 3M Peltor Optime 105 Earmuff, 105 dBA (H10A)review/text: When putting on these earmuffs the peltor optime I couldn't hear anything I literally went deaf or that what it seems like. I use these for doing homework for school at home a lot of sounds that are blocked out with these earmuffs. Very comfortable earmuffs and I also plan on with conjunction of headphones plan on using ear plugs as well for added protection but the earmuffs alone are a 5 star rating. You can still hear external sounds but so faintly barely noticeable like you can hear your heartbeat the ringing noise in your ear it feels a little weird at first but you get used to it very quiet.
