review/summary: no leaks!review/text: I had an Instapure water faucet filter that was made of plastic connections so it leaked and sprayed water all over the place no matter what adjustments I made. At first I thought the filter was not screwed on tightly but noticed that the water was also leaking from the filter itself not just the connection. I looked around for another to replace it and almost bought a pur or brita but noticed that it was also made of plastic. I didn't want to go down that route again. What sold me on the Culligan filter is that the part that connects to the faucet is metal. It attached to my faucet head perfectly without any leaks. Another feature of this filter that I really like is that the water automatically switches back to tap when you turn off the faucet. The flow of the water coming out of the filter is not exactly a gush but I think the flow of all the water filters of this kind are going to be about the same. And water tastes great. I'd definitely recommend this filter. At at about $12, it's a value!
