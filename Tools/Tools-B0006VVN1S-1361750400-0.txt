review/summary: Nice!review/text: Good shower head. After reading the reviews, I installed it without the water regulator. Awesome pressure. Then, after the 11 year old complained all the how water was gone, I put it back in. Still better water pressure than the old shower head and better coverage. No more chlorine smell too. I got this to help protect the girlfriends hair color and skin.
