review/summary: Great Compressorreview/text: I purchased this product about a month ago and have been very pleased with it so far.. My favorite feature is the automatic cut-off which allows you to set the pressure, attach the house, turn it on and then it automatically shuts off when it achieves the preset pressure. I work midnights and when the days are warm, and then the temp drops during the night, I lose air pressure in my car tires. It is very convenient having this compressor in my trunk. Today, I am buying three more for my kid's cars.
