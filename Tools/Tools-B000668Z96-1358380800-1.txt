review/summary: Works Great in Pet Free Homes!review/text: This Victor Flea Trap was a life saver for me when I moved into a new apartment. The previous tenant had a dog who left behind his fleas. My land lord used flea bombs, but I put out the flea traps just in case -- and the traps proved that the flea bombs did not fully eradicate the problem. This gave me the leverage to insist the landlord call an exterminator.I do not have pets, so the flea traps prove very attractive to the fleas, especially since I'm not spending much time in the house while eradicating the problem. Also, you should put them on the floor and not up on a surface (so says my exterminator).The traps on their own will not eradicate fleas - you must treat your homes (and pets) with something that will kill the eggs or juvenile fleas before they can grow into adults and lay a fresh batch of eggs. But they are great at killing the live fleas, and every dead flea is one less that will bite me, so I'm very happy I purchased these.You can make home made flea traps, but I did that and they didn't work. This did, and it's very convenient. Replacement bulbs are cheap too (I managed to drop both of mine).And yes, the glue is very strong so you have to be careful when handling the disc and/or if you have pets that might get into the trap, but again -- I don't have pets so that's not been a problem for me.All in all, I'm REALLY happy I got these and find them very effective when used in combination with the exterminator.
