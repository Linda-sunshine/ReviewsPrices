review/summary: It's a Mag...review/text: Not much to say about it, it's like every other mag-light I have spent money on. QUALITY, HEAVY DUTY, BAD ASS flashlight.November/December I work outside at night at a Christmas light show. My job is to turn off all the Christmas Lights around this public park. It is pitch black when the lights go out and kinds scary. I bring this big ass heavy light with me for 3 reasons. The first is so I can see, not just sorta see or kinda see, but I can SEE everything. The LED light is brighter that hell, and can shine out a great distance. Secondly, I know from my history of carrying flashlights, that the mag-lights are the MOST dependable. I know if I drop it or run it over, it will still work. These things can take a hell of a beating. The third reason is for safety. If put in a position where I have to defend myself, I know I can get a head cracked open with this thing.Vary happy with purchase.
