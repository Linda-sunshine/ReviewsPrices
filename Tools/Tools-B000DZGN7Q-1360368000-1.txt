review/summary: Simple install, short run timesreview/text: This is the EZ-mount system and I was able to install in less than 15 minutes. The run times of actually needing the garbage disposal on, to grind the food, is so much shorter than any garbage disposal I have ever used. This disposal is quiet to me, but it is not silent. I could have a conversation in the room while it ran, but it would be annoying after a minute or so. I have never needed to run it for a long period of time, as I have collected most of what I wanted to dispose of in the mouth and not constantly fed it for longer than 1 minute. I would recommend this disposal to anyone.
