review/summary: Leathercraft Work Glovesreview/text: I was cautious about this item when I saw the low price - I generally spend about $27 for a comparable pair of work gloves that I purchase at my lumberyard. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. They fit well, are flexible, and from what I see are of superior construction.Time will tell whether they hold up (although my "expensive" work gloves don't seem to hold up all that well), but for now I am very pleased.
