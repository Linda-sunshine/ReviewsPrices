review/summary: Never realized how much I needed thesereview/text: I replaced these over the original door handles in less than 15 minutes. Adding and changing the codes took another 20 minutes but that was because I gave each of my kids their own code. I never realized how handy they are and how nice they would look. I don't even carry my key any more, and when I accidently shut the door behind me... no problem, just type your code. The small button at the top is to light the keypad; very useful!
