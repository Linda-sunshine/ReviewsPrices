review/summary: Pleased with this product.review/text: I am an amateur chef and was looking for a product that is both affordable and easy to use. This product met both expectations. I was surprised that one of my newly sharpened knives cut right through an avocado pit. I find that with sharper knives my prepping skills have vastly improved and I have cut down my time on the more boring cooking tasks (although I do need to watch out for my fingers a little more carefully). I will be interested to see how the sharpener (and knives) hold up to frequent use. So far I am very pleased with this purchase.
