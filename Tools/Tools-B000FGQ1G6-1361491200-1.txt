review/summary: Cheap metal used in bitsreview/text: I purchased this product a few years ago when I needed to change out the hard drive in my Macbook. I needed the size 0 screw bit so I got this set.It worked alright for that initial hard drive swap, but the problem is the bits are too long so they don't get a good snug fit into the screw. What ends up happening is the bits end up getting stripped or your screws get stripped.I was also using the small standard bit and the tip twisted about 30 degrees when I was unscrewing something making it completely unusable.I went to use this set last night to take apart a small digital camera in an effort to clean the sensor. I ended up stripping 2 screws and twisting one of the bits in the process.Very cheaply made. Definitely look elsewhere if you plan on using this for electronics.
