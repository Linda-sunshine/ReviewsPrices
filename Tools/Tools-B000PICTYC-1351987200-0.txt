review/summary: Nice Smash-Up Bargain Multi-Toolreview/text: I didn't buy this to split wood, or throw, or use for overseas combat operations (I'm a civilian, btw).I bought it to stow away in a bug-out bag or to keep in the car for emergency purposes. Should I need to smash through, well, almost anything likely to confront me in an emergency situation, I will consider myself well armed. Doors. Windows. Zombies. All will easily succumb to the SOG Tomahawk.There are better ones, but they typically start at a price point equal to 7 - 10 times the price of this Tomahawk.
