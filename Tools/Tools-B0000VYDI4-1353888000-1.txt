review/summary: Solid, light, and endlessly usefulreview/text: I bought myself a Werner MT-22 as my Christmas present to myself and I've already gotten my money's worth.I'll be honest. I had a bit of trepidation about purchasing a Multi-ladder. My dad had one when I was younger and I remember it ranging from a nerve-shaking to terrifying experience when using it extended in non-A frame mode. I'm happy to say that you need not have that worry with this ladder.Stability:I've used this ladder now in both A-frame and full-extension modes and have felt very confident in both. There's little play when the ladder is fully extended, so the experience is similar to a traditional extending ladder. A-frame mode is also very stable, even when extended to the full 11 foot height. I could easily stand at the max safe height to balance a ceiling fan without any sway.Weight:22-foot ladders aren't light, but I didn't have much of a problem moving this one around. I've seen descriptions range from 38 lbs to lbs, which sounds about accurate. If you can carry that much weight, this ladder is compact enough that you can maneuver it, which can't be said for some.Adjust-ability:There are two main concerns in this category: the height adjustment features and the mode adjustment features.I'm happy to report that both are very straightforward and solid. Bolt-like pegs insert into the frame to lock either the height or ladder shape in. The result is pretty darn solid. The manufacturer says you can support 300 lbs on each side of the A-frame, and I'm a believer.I've only used this ladder for a few things around the house, but I have no complaints so far. If you're looking for a great ladder, I hope you'll consider this one.
