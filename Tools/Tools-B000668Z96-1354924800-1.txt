review/summary: while these do work....review/text: A fleas total life span is three months, while these do work to solve a flea infestation you will need to give them to your pet for three months straight. I used these on my two cats before they were to be fixed. I thought problem was gone because I no longer saw them crawling around their belly and legs. I took them to our local animal rescue which is amazing and found out they were still infested. With the cost of buying and giving to three cats it turned out cheaper to go to my local shelter and get rx drops for three months. I'm happy to say on second dose of rx drops and cats itch very lil and nobody in the house is being bit by fleas cause there are no more eggs are larvae to become full grown fleas in my home. They also taught me to make a flea trap by putting a shallow pan or bowl where my cats usually lay, the fleas that were left when my cats left went for the liquid and drown themselves. Wish I would have been well informed before I spent over two hundred of other products. I know three months is a long time but in the long run that's there life span and that's how long you will have them if ur pets are treated right. Think if they are not treated correctly how long you will have them. Oh and another trick put the flea collar in ur vacuum cleaner and vacuum daily, make sure its the one that kills eggs and larvae too. Hope this helps. These pills do work but will need to administer them along with the monthly ones for three months. I becomes expensive when u have multiple pets when u can go to ur local rescue or aspca and get a tube of drops a month for about twelve dollars a month. Hope this helps.
