review/summary: Use mine for security and night building checkreview/text: I have one of these, blue, that rides with me in the truck. When I check the church building a couple times a week, I blink at at the windows, to see if they are open. Go in, and amuse myself by shining in a dark gym, and light up the whole gym with one flash lights. One day the batteries were getting dim, so I took em out. I'd dated the batteries with a marker, and find they are nearly two years old. I'm astounded, and pleased. Never had to beat a burglar, they must have seen me coming, and run.
