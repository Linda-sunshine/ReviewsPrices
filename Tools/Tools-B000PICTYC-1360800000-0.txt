review/summary: Excellent quality, low price. This was the perfect gift!review/text: In all honesty, I am not very knowledgeable when it comes to tactical weapons. After doing lots of research, this ended up being a perfect gift for my boyfriend, a WSHTF prepper. I was very nervous that it would not be the best quality because of the price. Boy was I wrong!! Not only does it look awesome but this tomahawk is excellent quality..as per my boyfriend who is much more knowledgeable with this stuff. He loved it! I also purchased a Laserlyte Zombie Pistol Bayonet - he couldn't put these items down! Perfect presents for a prepper!!!
