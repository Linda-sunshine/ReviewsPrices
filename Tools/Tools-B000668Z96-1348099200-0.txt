review/summary: not really worth itreview/text: I followed the instructions, and it did catch about 20 fleas, but we really didn't use it after that. Did it work? yeah, kind of, but really not that necessary in my opinion. It was more effective to vacuum with a cheap flea collar in the bag and the other instructions for ridding your house of fleas. Nice idea though.
