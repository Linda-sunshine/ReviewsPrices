review/summary: Easy to install!review/text: I have never installed a garbage disposal before and this garbage disposal was very easy to install. I totally removed all old hardware from my prior garbage disposal and went with the easy install method so I did not have to use plumbers putty. The install went well. I had to cut down the black waste pipe that goes to the plumbing pipe trap as it was too long. The hole install only took me about 2 hours.I opted for the 1 HP model because I like to be able to throw anything in the garbage disposal and not have to worry about clogging it. This thing eats up everything. It is quieter then my older model disposal too.
