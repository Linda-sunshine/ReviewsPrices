review/summary: Pretty neatreview/text: It doesn't fully get rid of the fleas, but it definitely keeps them away from you. It starts working right away, and I find it best to plug it in and leave it there with the light off while you go out for a while. The only problem I had was the bulb it came with sort of wore out fast, but you can always buy a new one.A combination of this and flea spray has made it so there are no more fleas left, and it's been about a month or so. If you want a solution that doesn't make your room smell terrible and won't hurt your pets or kids, this is a great place to start.
