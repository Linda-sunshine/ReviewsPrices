review/summary: Great Flashlight, Until...review/text: Worked great with no problems until the battery leaked. This is more my fault probably, but when I check on the MagLite Web page, they had battery leakage listed under their "FAQs". That leads me to believe it is a recurring issue. My Mag Lite was purchased on December 18, 2007. I just opened it up and discovered the batteries had not only leaked, I could not get them out of the case to even attempt replacing them or identifying them to file a claim with the battery maker (as MagLite suggests in their FAQs). I will be pitching this in the trash.Here's my hint: Open your MagLite up every year or so and take the batteries out for a visual inspection. Probably a good idea for any flashlight. Do it when you're replacing your smoke alarm batteries...
