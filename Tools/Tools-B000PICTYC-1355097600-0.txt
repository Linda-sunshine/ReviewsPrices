review/summary: Great value for the $$$review/text: So I'm new to this whole tomahawk thing. I'm normally a gun guy, but had to order one of these, as I heard they are a lot of fun to throw, and also great for getting into or out of a tight jamb.Heck, even seeing someone coming at me with one of these weapons would make me run the other direction, kind of that old Cowboy and Indians thing I guess!Seems well made, and compared to the higher priced models, I'd say a very good value. The only other thing that would make it better, from what I know of knife manufacturing, is a full tang, but the one with full metal tangs are pretty pricy.So for my first 'hawk, I'll play with this one and see if I can at least avoid putting any holes in my and my loved ones before worrying about bigger or better (and more expensive).
