review/summary: Versatile and compact for storage but heavy (42 lbs) to usereview/text: I bought this ladder as my other 6-ft step ladder was not long enough for many uses. This ladder is very compact for storage and is very versatile in terms of various heights and angles. However, be cautioned that it is extremely heavy for a ladder. I am a healthy man in my 40's and I found it inconvenient to move it around and use it due to its weight. Unfortunately one has to deal with all the weight even if using as a step-ladder (about 8-9 feet). Overall, I bought it because I liked the concept but now don't really like to use it due to this concern. I wish they would come up with a better design to reduce the weight without any compromises.
