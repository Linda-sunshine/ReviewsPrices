review/summary: Don't freeze your pipesreview/text: I must have two dozen of these things all over a property here. In the pump house, in the out house (seriously), in several guest rooms, anywhere that has pipes or pumps that I don't want frozen I have a Thermo Cube. In winter they kick the heat on and save me from busted pipes and pumps. I leave 'em plugged in all summer long because they don't kick in until it's arse freezing weather.My only kvetch is that I'd like there to be an LED if the thing kicks in but there are two plugs so you can plug in a lamp if you're anal about this kind of stuff, which I am and which I did. This is money well spent.
