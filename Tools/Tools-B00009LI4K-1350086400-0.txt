review/summary: Excellent Earmuffreview/text: I bought these for multiple uses, and so far they have worked excellent for ever thing I have thrown at them. I use them mainly for playing the drums. Using these with some ear buds from the ipod means I can really turn down the ipod while playing, so I save my hearing. They easily fit over the ear buds and provide excellent noise reduction. No more ringing in my ears after I get don't playing the drums.At the gun range, they also provide excellent ear protection. I have used some ear plugs in the past, but these ear muffs are a more cost effective method of hearing protection, and are extremely comfortable. Again, no ringing in my ears after spending hours at the range.They are very comfortable, and they are fully adjustable. My kids also wear them when I am playing the drums (I bought a few more after trying them). They can be adjusted where the wires meet the ear muffs, which seems to throw some people off when they try to just pull them from the center wires (which doesn't work too well). This may be why some people don't think they are adjustable, but they are fully adjustable for kids and adults.For the price, you can't beat this products hearing protection. I would definitely recommend this for others. I will update this review in a few weeks if I experience any issues, but with kids using them, I am sure if they fall apart, they will do so at an accelerated rate.
