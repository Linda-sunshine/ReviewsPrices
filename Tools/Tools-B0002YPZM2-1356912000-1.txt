review/summary: Needed small size for moving boxes and heavy house workreview/text: These gloves work on small size female hands (size 5 1/2 ring finger). They are not snug around the fingertips, but for my use they are exactly what I need. There is a little extra padding around the tips of the thumb, index finger, and third finger. This makes it a little bulkier on those spots, but adds cushioning for the fingers which need more protection.
