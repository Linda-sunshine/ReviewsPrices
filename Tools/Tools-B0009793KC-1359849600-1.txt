review/summary: Great value for my KitchenAid fridgereview/text: While not top of the line, the city water that I have is pretty decent already. With filtration, the ice and water from the fridge tastes good, which means it doesn't have any funny tastes at all. I like to right the month I changed it on the end rather than using the fridge timer.
