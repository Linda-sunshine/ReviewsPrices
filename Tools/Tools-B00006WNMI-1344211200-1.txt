review/summary: Goodreview/text: Install was a little complicated none of the adapters worked on my sink. But after some hammering and messing with it I finally got it to stay on. Works great! Not looking forward to the expensive filter changes but, very happy with my purchase. would recommend. Might need to go to the hardware store but otherwise, item itself works well.
