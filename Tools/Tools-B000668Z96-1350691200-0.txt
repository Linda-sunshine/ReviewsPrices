review/summary: Ultimate Flea Trap.review/text: The discs included with the trap are incredibly difficult to use. They are made to be set in place, but they constantly curl up. After the trap arrived in the mail, I brought all three of our dogs [German Shepherd, Australian Shepherd, and Pomeranian] into the house and put them in their kennels. Despite the trap being placed right outside of the kennel doors, it has only ever caught one flea. I gave this product two stars instead of one because it caught at least one and there is always the possibility that there was only one flea between the three dogs.
