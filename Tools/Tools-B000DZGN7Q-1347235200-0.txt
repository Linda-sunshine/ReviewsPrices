review/summary: Was an easy installation, my first for a garbage disposer.review/text: I was a little concerned when reading several of the reviews as it seemed a number of folks were having trouble with installation. I had never installed a garbage disposer, and while I am relatively handy, I have never had a lot of luck when it comes to plumbing. The only challenge I had was when I skipped a step in the instructions, had I not done that it would have worked like a charm on the initial installation. As it was, I had to remove the unit and re-install (this time following every step) and the fit was fine. The unit seems to work well and is quieter than the builder grade unit it replaced - so far so good.
