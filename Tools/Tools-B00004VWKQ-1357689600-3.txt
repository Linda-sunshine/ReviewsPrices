review/summary: Best budget sharpener if you dont know how to handsharpenreview/text: I have had an Accusharp for just over 10 years and use it at least once a week. Hand sharpening using stones requires skill and time--both of which I lack. After the initial sharpening of a knife, which may take a 3-4 minutes at the most, touch-ups are a breeze. I use a range of cheap to midgrade knives and this works great on them all. I would not recommend this sharpener for expensive knives or for people who demand extremely fine edges. However, if you are on a budget and like fairly sharp knives, this is the sharpener to get. Just a few quick strokes and I am back to slicing those slightly squishy tomatoes with ease.A note of caution: do not use too much pressure when sharpening. You will wear off too much metal on the blade and the blade will stutter around while you are smashing it down and cause notches. I have found there is a certain 'sweet' spot when you have the right pressure that the knife glides smoothly.
