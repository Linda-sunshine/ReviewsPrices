review/summary: Great for bathroomreview/text: I installed this filter on a bathroom faucet, to eliminate the blast of sulphur odor in the morning. The filter installed easily. Directions that came with the unit are very clear. The next morning I tried it and hurrah! While the water from the tap smelled like sulphur, when the filter was engaged it did a good job clearing the smell. The taste was okay - not as good as the water filtered by my Clear20 pitcher, but still quite acceptable.The stream from the Culligan FM-12A filter is slow, so it's not something I'd use on my kitchen sink. Does the job for its intended use in the bathroom, and for that, it's a keeper.
