review/summary: Great Value!review/text: I waited 2 years to write the review on this disposer. Yes, it gets a little louder over time as some people have mentioned, but that's because the rubber throat guard that you feed the scraps through opens wider over time. If it were a problem, I could replace the gasket for a couple dollars and about 15 seconds. The motor may be a little noisier, but is not really noticeable.Overall it is a very reasonably priced, powerful disposer that works great.
