review/summary: FlowTron 80review/text: After reading extensively about the various types of bug/mosquito zappers, I settled on the Flowtron 80. The majority of the reviews I read indicated it worked. I was skeptical, but desparate, as we could not go outside on our unscreened patio (Florida) without getting eaten alive. Well, it took a couple of nights at work and magic. No more bugs/mosquitos! It works. I recommend the mosquito attractant. I haven't tried it without it, but why ruin a good thing.
