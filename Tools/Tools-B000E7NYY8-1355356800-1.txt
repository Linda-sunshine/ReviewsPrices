review/summary: Sweet Product!! No more freeze or fry.review/text: Pluged a small heater into this to hit a spot in my house where the central air didn't seem to be effective. Works great lets you program the heater just like your regular thermostat. The sensor is very reactive and seems to be accurate. Plus the battery back up for the screen means you don't have to reprogram it every time it is unplugged.
