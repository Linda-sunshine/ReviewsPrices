review/summary: perfect for my needsreview/text: Bought this to put under my son's bunk bed so he can read in bed. We clipped it to the actual wood slats that are under the upper bunk. It lights up the entire bottom bunk. The light is flexible but will stay in whatever position you choose. So far the batteries seem to last. Good purchase.
