review/summary: No Potato Peels!review/text: This garbage disposal unit works good enough. I've had mine now for many years. The only flaw I can find is that it cannot handle potato peels. It seems to pass them through okay, but it does not grind them up fine enough, and they always clog the drain. Keep a plunger handy if you insist on sending potato peels down there.
