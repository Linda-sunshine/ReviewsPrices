review/summary: Excellent tool for not a lot of moneyreview/text: This is my second purchase of this item. The first is now down in the Bahamas at a vacation home where electricity is 40 cents/kwhr. I used it to help me see why my bill had jumped. Turns out it was the dehumidifier I put in the garage. Wow, they use way more juice than I thought. I was able to estimate exactly what it was costing me per month to run. By moving the device from appliance to appliance you can pretty much map all of what's costing you money. This time I am interested in confirming LED light bulb power usage since I am going to start researching them. The performance and power consumption ratings are all over the place.
