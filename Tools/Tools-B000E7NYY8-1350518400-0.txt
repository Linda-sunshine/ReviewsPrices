review/summary: Programmable Outlet Thermostatreview/text: I originally choose this product for price. But only to find out that it is easy to program and use. It works wonderful. We purchased a wall heater for our garage but it did not have a thermostat so we needed a programmable thermostat to be able to turn itself on and off. We plugged our heater into this thermostat and to date it is keeping our garage the exact temperature that we programed it for. The garage is nice and warm now. The shipping and handling was super fast. Great service.
