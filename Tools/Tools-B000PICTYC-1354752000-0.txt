review/summary: Overall great Tomahawkreview/text: The ax came honed and sharp. Looks and feels very sturdy and easy to handle. Not too heavy, not lightweight either. I gave it four instead of five stars because I think the part of the handle where you grip it could've been improved a bit more in terms of positive contact and feel. It feels slippery. Plastic slippery.Easily remedied though by wrapping it in paracord or silicone tape.Overall I would recommend it to a friend.
