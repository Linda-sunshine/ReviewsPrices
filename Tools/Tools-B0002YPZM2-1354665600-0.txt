review/summary: Great glovesreview/text: I bought these as work gloves for my boyfriend who works in a stockroom and gets papercuts and scratches all the time. He loves these because they are thin enough to not affect his grip but thick enough to protect from hand cuts and scrapes. He has pretty small hands for a guy (actually smaller than mine) and the medium fits him well.
