review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: This is the best garbage disposal I ever had. It was pretty easy to install, and I can put anything in it. I needed to look at a YouTube video to figure out how to remove the old unit. There was a metal ring I had to pry off. I even put in bones and chicken skin. The only things not able to go in are metal and plastic.
