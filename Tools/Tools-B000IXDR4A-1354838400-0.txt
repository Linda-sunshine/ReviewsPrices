review/summary: MAG LEDreview/text: Hands down this is the brightest flashlight i've ever seen in my life. Conveiniently enough, this little bundle of joy arrived on the same day that Hurricane Sandy hit. Fate? maybe. But either way, it was meant to be. Instead of sitting in the dark or taking chances with candles, this bad boy lit up our entire living room and kitchen. Furthermore, my 4 year old continues to play the flashlight and constantly leaves it on. By nature of the LED technology, the battery's last a really long time in this thing (have yet had to change them). It made my father so jealous, I bought him one for xmas to replace his halogen maglite. Furthermore, it costs $25 less on amazon that walmart.
