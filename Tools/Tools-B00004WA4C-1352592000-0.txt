review/summary: Date Of Manufacture is VERY Important!!review/text: Amazon does not provide the date of manufacture for this (and similar) items. A CO detector is typically good for 7 years before it starts beeping as an indicator to be taken out of service. We just replaced a CO detector in our home recently and upon opening it found it was manufactured in Aug of 2007. This does not leave much operating life left in my home for the money. Buyer beware as these are important and expensive life savers in your home to keep replacing every few years. Worth buying in person to check the date of manufacture.
