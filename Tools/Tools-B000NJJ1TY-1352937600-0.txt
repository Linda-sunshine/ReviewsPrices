review/summary: Love itreview/text: I bought this for my parents and they absolutely love this lock. They told me that was one of the best gifts they have received. They no longer worry about working in the garden in the back of the house and have to remember to bring keys so they can lock the door. Now they shut the door and 10 seconds later the lock engages so all they have to do is just put in the code and they are in. They also have cleaners that come 2 a month and they no longer have to give out keys, they just put a code in for the cleaners. If there are any changes in the cleaning crew they can just change the code.
