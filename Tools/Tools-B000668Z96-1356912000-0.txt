review/summary: Flease are still jumping.review/text: I so wanted this flea trap to work. So many good things go into thepremise. It operates safely among animals and children, it is non toxic,and easy to use.However after setting up as instructed and waiting for over a week, no fleaswere trapped. I am disappointed as I bought three of them and needed helpcatching fleas.These traps will be returned.
