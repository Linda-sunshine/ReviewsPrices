review/summary: Immediate Improvement!review/text: This filter is easy to install (make sure to use the Teflon tape that comes with it). I had taken my old shower head down and installed this one in less than 10 minutes. Easy peasy! Living in Atlanta, chlorine and mineral levels in our water are high and the smell and drying effects prove it! This filter zaps the problem and the improvement was immediate - softer hair, truer hair color(yay!), smoother/less itchy skin. I'm so glad I bought this filter and wish I'd made the purchase years ago when I moved here. At time of purchase, I went ahead and bought a back-up filter to have on hand since they're reasonably priced. Love this shower head! No buyers remorse here!
