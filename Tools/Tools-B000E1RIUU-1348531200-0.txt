review/summary: Additional caveat for usereview/text: First time I used this trap I set it on my kitchen counter where I know mice travel. I put small amount of peanut butter at opposite end of trap from entrance. This end has holes which I suspect are there to improve the release of nice odors to attract the critters. When I got up in the morning I check the trap and find that a mouse had visited the end of the trap with the holes and had obviously licked at the holes to try to get the meal inside. I picked up the trap and looked inside the holes and could see the inside as if there was no peanut butter at all. When I opened the lid, there was still some peanut butter but not covering the holes. The mouse was actually able to lick the bait through the holes. Score. Mouse 1, me 0. It would appear that how you place the trap determines your success rate. Tonight I place back of trap against a wall. This game is not over.
