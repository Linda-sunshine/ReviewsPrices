review/summary: Quiet and Powerfulreview/text: This Waste King L-8000 Legend Series 1.0-Horsepower Continuous Feed Waste Disposer replaced a 1/2 HP unit (probably a builders' basic model) installed when my house was built. Replacement/installing the new one was fairly straight-forward but I'd recommend a helper to assist with the mounting. The L-8000 was delivered with an electric cord and plug to be used with a socket (presumably under the sink) which I don't have, so I had to wire it, adding a little uncertainty as to whether the appliance would work, was safe etc. Other than this minor inconvenience, I think this disposer is a great value.The Waste King L-8000 Legend Series 1.0-Horsepower Continuous Feed Waste Disposer started right up and is much quieter than its predecessor. When ever friends or relatives have come to dinner, they have remarked on how quiet and what a good job the new disposer did. Obviously, the Waste King L-8000 Legend Series 1.0-Horsepower Continuous Feed Waste Disposer has made a notable difference.
