review/summary: Works great, wish it came with more adapters.review/text: Purchased and used for the past month. Works as promised and water tastes clean and free of chlorine. Tested with a particulate meter (HM Digital TDS-EZ Water Quality TDS Tester, 0-9990 ppm Measurement Range , 1 ppm Resolution, +/- 3% Readout Accuracy available on Amazon as well).Only minor gripe was the it didn't include an adapter for my kitchen faucet which is recessed too far for the included adapters. When I went to local hardware store, I noticed about 30% of the kitchen faucets were also recessed. Culligan should've done more market research and included an adapter with a longer depth (the threads on the included ones were correct, they were just to short to fit my faucet).
