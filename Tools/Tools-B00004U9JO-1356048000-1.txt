review/summary: Perfectly Adequate Disposerreview/text: My mom's kitchen was remodeled in '98, and a new one of these was installed. It lasted about 14 years till the sides rusted through! Since she's 96, I'm pretty sure this new replacement disposer should still be in fine shape when we ultimately sell the house! (Sorry, Mom!) Not the quietest, obviously not the most durable, but for the price, not a bad choice, and as a (now retired) plumber, I've installed hundreds of them in tract homes.
