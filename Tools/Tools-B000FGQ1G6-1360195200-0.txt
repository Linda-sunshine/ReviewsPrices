review/summary: Exactly what I need for computer repairreview/text: Plenty of size choices for working on both Mac and PC's, desktops or laptops. Good price, too! I've only had a it for a little while, but I feel like the bits are of a good enough quality metal that I won't have to worry about shredding them anytime soon. I like the pommel grip, too, which makes screwing small screws in and out a breeze.
