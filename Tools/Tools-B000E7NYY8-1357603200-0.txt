review/summary: Works as expected. Just need a long enough cord for your heater.review/text: Have seven day timing with lots of options. Currently using to run some ceramic heaters. Just need to make sure the cords are long enough, or the heaters just turn off because the thermostat is too close. As for cooling, it will not work with A/C units that do not automatically come back on after a power cycle, as the thermostat cuts the power to the unit when the temp is reached.
