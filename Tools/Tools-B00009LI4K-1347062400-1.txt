review/summary: silence is goldenreview/text: After reading reviews on a number of different earmuff-style hearing protectors, I decided to order the Peltor Optime 105. I bought this for use at the shooting range, knowing that the decibel rating was somewhat less reliable for the sudden and sharp report of firearms. I've used them twice now and I am very pleased with their effectiveness. They're a reasonable weight and fit nice and snuggly. I have a longstanding tinnitus, so I'm rather concerned about the performance of this particular piece of equipment. I'm happy to say that a couple hours of shooting at the pistol range is quite tolerable. The only thing that has bothered me is that my ears have become somewhat sore from the pressure of the earmuffs after a couple of hours. The onset of this discomfort hasn't occurred until after I've been shooting for a couple of hours, so I guess that's really a good indicator that it's time to call it a day.
