review/summary: SHOULDA BOUGHT TWO!!!review/text: I ordered the Flowtron electronic zapper and a solar zapper at the same time. I should have bought two of the electronic ones---I AM going to order another one. This Flowtron zapper is well worth the money. The post top solar zapper----USELESS, USELESS, USELESS!!! I would recomend the Flowtron BK-15D Electronic bug zapper to everyone----Cause I love it when things work like they are supposed too!!!
