review/summary: works great, and very simple to set upreview/text: For decades I've used all sorts of water filter systems: I wore out 3 distillers, used reverse osmosis, and my latest was a filter with hoses going from the countertop unit to the sink. I got tired of dealing with all that and wanted something simple. This one works great. It may not do everything the more expensive ones do, but the water is great and if I have to replace the unit, it's not very expensive. Nice to be rid of all those hoses and countertop units! Thanks Culligan and Amazon!
