review/summary: SOG quality at the best pricereview/text: This SOG costs a lot more at the store. Amazon delivered it quick, inexpensive,and the product is good looking and I hope it is durable. I will use it camping , backpacking. The sheath works and the blade of the tomahawk is as sharp as a lot of knives I have owned. Seriously it is wicked sharp.
