review/summary: Almost a WINnerreview/text: The only reason I didn't give the Lux WIN 100 five stars is because of the programming feature. There is one setting for week days and one setting for weekends. Most thermostats allow for separate settings for each day of the week. I use mine in my RV, which means I move around a lot. The temperature range may be different on a Monday than it is on Thursday, so I end up doing a lot of reprogramming. Other than the programming feature, the thermostat works exactly as it is supposed to. I am very pleased with it and even more pleased that this contraption was even available. I have a mini heater/fireplace that is not thermostatically controlled. The Lux WIN 100 picks up where the heater left off.
