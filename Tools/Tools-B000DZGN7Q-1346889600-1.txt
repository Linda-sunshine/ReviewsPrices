review/summary: waste kingreview/text: after pricing garbage disposal units both in store and on line, i settled on the waste king 1hp, even though previous reviewers said it was noiser than most, the warranty and power attracted me, as well as the price, installation was simple in less than 1/2 hour, and the unit happens to be quiter than the name brand unit it replaced, all in all im very happy i decided on this unit, it performs as well if not better than advertised
