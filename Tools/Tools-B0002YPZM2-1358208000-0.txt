review/summary: Seems to be good qualityreview/text: This is the first pair of work gloves I have purchased. Definitely a step up from the boxed nitrite gloves you buy at the parts store. I like the fact that they can be washed. I read a good review from a military mechanic out east and figured these would be good enough or my garage.
