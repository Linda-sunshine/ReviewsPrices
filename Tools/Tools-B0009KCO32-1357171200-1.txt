review/summary: Buy thisreview/text: It's so convenient to walk in and out all day without having to slide a screen door. They never glide easily, often fall off, and are impossible when your hands are full. This screen is easy to install and use. If you're debating between two widths, get the wider one, so there is a little slack. If the screen is tight, it can be a little awkward to walk through.
