review/summary: Poor design, broke on first dayreview/text: 1. The valve adaptor (that mates to the tire valve stem) is made of plastic. My experience is that these are typically metal. It broke on the fifth tire I tried to fill up, without any particularly excessive force.2. The on/off button is located underneath where the 12V power cord is stored. So even if you are using the AC/plug, you still have to remove the unused 12V cord and have it lay next to the unit.3. The setting for pressure target is convenient, but not close to accurate. I set the target at 30 psi and filled car tires, per the gauge, and my tpms still reported low pressure. Measured with a couple of different pressure gauges, and they read back 26 to 27psi.2&3 I can work around, and I would otherwise have rated the unit maybe 3 stars. But with plastic where there should be metal, and that the unit has already broken and become unusable on the first day I tried to use it, I have to recommend DON'T BUY!I will try to get Black & Decker to replace the valve adaptor, and will see how their customer service goes. If they do replace it, I will have to unfortunately be &#34;extra gentle&#34; in using it.
