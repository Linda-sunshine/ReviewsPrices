review/summary: These Work AMAZINGLY WELL!!!review/text: I was hesistant when these arrived, as they don't seem like much - cheap plastic, with a little Christmas light, and a sticky paper. BUT OH MY GOODNESS do they work amazingly well! You may see little specks of dust on them but that is the baby fleas. It really helps while you do the things you need to to get rid of fleas! We had hardwood and tile floors, but were in the middle of a renovation when we had the problem! These helped us get a handle on them! It worked wonderfully!Not entirely inexpensive to get enough for every room in the house, but work amazingly well! The only improvement I could see would be battery operation!
