review/summary: terribly awkward but good for reaching hard areasreview/text: The ladder is good for reaching areas hard to paint by its multi-position functions. It's light enough to move about easily. It's compact enough to easily transport in the trunk of a car. The major drawback is when you have to extend it fully and move it into position, it is terribly awkward to manuever while fully extended. In such a use, an extension ladder is far more desireable, as it doesn't have to be stretched out until you have it in its needed location, and can extend it upwards wi thout moving the base point, unlike this ladder.
