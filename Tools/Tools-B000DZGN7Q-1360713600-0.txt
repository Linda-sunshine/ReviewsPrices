review/summary: So far, so great.review/text: i would give this product five stars but we've only had it about a month....The item shipped very (very) fast. It was exactly as advertised, intalled easily, is quiet, and grinds us everything we've put down there .... bones, uncooked chicken skin, celery, potato skins, whatever. In our last house we bought another brand from the home store, paid about 50 percent more and it was not as good as the waste king. This thing works great.
