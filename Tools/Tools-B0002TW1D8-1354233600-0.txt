review/summary: Excellent!review/text: Used the small one for driving the hex screws of a gas fitting back into the porch floor. We removed them to give us room for taping and painting the porch floor. By hand. Ugh. Got the Bosch 12-v impact driver, and this little gadget for my 1/4&#34; drive socket, and presto-magic! Love it. Not expensive, and makes life so much easier.
