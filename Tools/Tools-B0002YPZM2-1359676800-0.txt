review/summary: Good for ISP workreview/text: Being able to type with gloves on while still getting the protection I want out of a pair of gloves is an amazing combination when you're working with networking hardware. I can use 90%+ of my installation tookit without taking these off, and they do a great job of keeping sharper edges from digging into my palms when carrying or holding heavy equipment. Good grip and only a little bit of range of movement restriction.They breathe well, and stretch where they need to without compromising their effectiveness. The tactile material on the first two pads is fantastic for more precise work, and they're sturdy enough to still be going strong months later. I'll probably end up replacing them when they wear out with the same gloves. Great gloves.
