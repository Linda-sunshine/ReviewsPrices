review/summary: Kill a watt - excellent gadget for energy saving and disaster planning.review/text: I initially ordered it to better understand my energy use on household appliances, hoping to find savings and go greener. After hurricane Sandy I also used it to plan my power outage. Understanding you power consumption, how much and how long does it take to run an appliance, helps prioritize usage and plan scenarios for future. This device will also be essential when I will need to run my power inverter. Awesome tool.
