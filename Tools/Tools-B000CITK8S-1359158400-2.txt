review/summary: They work and are cheap.review/text: I use them on my street bikes, my cars and even the yard tractor if they are going to be sitting for any amount of time. They either work, or I am just extremely lucky with batteries because I get 4-6+ years out of my batteries and have had no issues with either the batteries or the chargers.If I leave for more than 2 weeks the battery in my Audi drains down because of the constant vampiric drain from the electronics. With this, it's a 2 min job to hook up and I never have any issues. I own 4 of them and I recommend them to anybody who's not using LiPo batteries.
