review/summary: lux win100review/text: I don't know what this thermostat was intended for but it was easy to take apart and extend the cord on probe. that was a plusi was disappointed that it only went to 90 degrees but nothing on amazon is fully described. when the read out say 90 my dairy thermometer says 95 i don't know is that is because i extended the cord or what but it is well made and seems reliable.
