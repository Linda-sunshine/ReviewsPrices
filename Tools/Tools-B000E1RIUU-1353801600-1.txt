review/summary: Drains battery and mice is too smart of this kind of trapreview/text: I gave this a try since there were so many high reviews. These kind of traps never work as mice never goes inside any type of hole with they are not familiar with, regardless of bait. The snap trap works the best. I chose this kind of trap as these traps need to go in an area next to children.Big battery drain and no catch. Nice idea. But, not for my application.
