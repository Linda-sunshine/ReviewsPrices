review/summary: It's not the original...review/text: I bought this utili-key to replace the one I had owned for about 4 years. I bought my original one from ThinkGeek.com, but purchased my replacement from here because it was cheaper. Little did I know...This utili-key is a rip-off. I have the original to compare it to. Refer to the item photo. That is NOT what it says on the one I received. Mine says: Swiss + Tech Utili-Xey. (I'm pretty sure that X and K are not the same letter.)The other bummer is that it sticks and is very difficult to open. I have bent and broken my nails trying to open it. Now that I know better, I have to find some sort of implement with which to pry it apart.Once I manage to open it, yes, it works and does what my old utili-key did, but even when opened it still requires a fair amount of force to open it to the desired angle.All-in-all, I am really bummed about my purchase. I do not recommend buying this product from here.
