review/summary: $ave your cash & your health at the same time.review/text: I spent so much money buying fancy organic soap & shampoo/conditioner during winter weather for my sensitive skin and natural hair. I never realized until recently that my unfiltered public shower water was the real problem.This shower filter was affordable, quick to install and makes my skin and hair feel so much better. The only downside is that I do not want to get out of the shower... it's like a spa now. Great investment for the whole family.
