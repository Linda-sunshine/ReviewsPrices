review/summary: Not just a ladder-a problem solver.review/text: I am a contractor/handyman and I have always wanted one of these but already had an 8 ft A fame and an 20 ft extension ladder. I needed to paint a staircase and descending walls where the ceiling was level while the steps went down. This required a new ladder that could handle the steps and walls and give me safe access to the ceiling. This ladder solved my problem. It also extends to 22 ft as an extension ladder. My only criticism is that it is a little heavy to carry around so I keep it home until I need its special qualities.
