review/summary: goodbye whet stonereview/text: I have used the whet stone, honing steel, a fancy manual knife sharpener. None of them compared to the accusharp. It's easy to use, and you can actually hear it working. My knives have never been sharper, dissecting a whole chicken has never been easier. I would recommend it to anyone. The blades are reversible so they should last long and they do have replaceable blades.
