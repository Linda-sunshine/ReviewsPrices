review/summary: Great Power Stripreview/text: Has a lot of features that I haven't really tried out. But for its core function, it works really well. The outlets are spaced out well and it's good for plugging a lot of things into. Word of caution, I know someone will short their outlet with this thing, using a power strip does not increase the amount of power you can draw at once from a single source. Also don't daisy chain.
