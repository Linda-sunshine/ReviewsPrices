review/summary: Easy nice trickle chargerreview/text: My Mom has a 2007 accord that fairly well has a motorcycle battery 51R. I got her one of these because she doesn't drive that car much.My wife makes short trips to work and I bought another for myself to top off her battery if the car sets all weekend which it does sometimes. It doesn't really need it as much since it has a real car battery but it's helpful. I have a full sized charger and this one is much easier because you can attach the bolt on accessory to the battery and just pop the hood and plug it in. You still get the alligator clip accessory to use on others cars while the bolt on accessory is on the first car. It's a handy tool and I have had no problems with it.Some people say the HF ones are cheaper as about as good. I don't know, I never had one, I know this one works.
