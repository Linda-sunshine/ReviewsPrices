review/summary: Finally! One that works!review/text: This is the second book light I have purchased and I've been looking for this one for months. Most of them are not bright enough to be able to read in a dark room but this one is absolutely wonderful. Another common problem on the competition is the short length of the bendable arm. This well-designed, well-executed light is perfect!
