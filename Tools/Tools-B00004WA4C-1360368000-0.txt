review/summary: Battery contacts are not reliablereview/text: I bought one of these a while back based on the overall good reviews here, but will be replacing it with something different. We had an incident with smoldering dryer lint filling the laundry room with smoke, and this detector, which was 6 feet away from the room, didn't do anything, despite a strong smoke smell throughout the house. If we had been asleep, this could have ended badly.When I took it down, touching the batteries made it chirp and say "Push test button", which is what it does when new batteries are installed, and takes it through the CO2 and Fire alarm sequences. I replaced the batteries, and it's still intermittent. Sometimes it goes through the entire test cycle, sometimes stops partway through and gives the "Push test button" message again, so it appears something's loose or failing inside.I probably just got a lemon, based on the many successful reviews here, but my trust in this device has been broken. Will a different model be any better? Only time will tell, but I'll be testing it much more often. Heck, I may mount two different models side by side, just to ease my mind.
