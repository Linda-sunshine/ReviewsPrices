review/summary: Great Productreview/text: This thing has great torque and is nice and quiet. I would highly recommend this disposer to anyone. I did a bunch of research and found this brand is the best in it's class (more torque for less $$). Given that it is also the cheapest, it's a win/win. I also read it was worth it to splurge for a 3/4HP or 1HP when buying. When this went on sale for the same price as a competing 3/4HP model, I snagged it immediately--and am quite thankful I did. This thing has serious power--yet is very quiet. Nice job Waste King, great product!-- A note to DIYers like myself --After the challenging task of removing my old one (a real pain in the backside!) I installed this one in a snap. Give yourself an hour or two when replacing an existing disposer (unless it is a waste king with the same mounting system). That's about 45 minute to remove the old one, 5 to bandage any wounds and then 10 to install this sucker.
