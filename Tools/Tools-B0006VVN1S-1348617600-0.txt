review/summary: Love it.review/text: I'm a college student and I moved in an apartment with a showerhead that had mildrew all around it and in the bathtub. At first I did not read the directions. I put it on the part you connected and it was leaking when I turned the water on. First, I didnt put in the filter in or the tape to prevent the leaking which provides a tighter grasp onto the part where the water comes from above.Its perfect.
