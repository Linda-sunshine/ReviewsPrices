review/summary: Easy to use, kids think its a toyreview/text: We are among the 70% of Americans who regularly use their automatic garage door opener to come in the house. However, when we are gone and have someone come over to feed our menagerie of animals, we wanted to have some way for them to enter the house without having to have a bunch of keys made. My husband installed this deadbolt quickly without any issues. It is super easy to use and we can't believe we waited this long to have one of these. We can give the pet sitter the 4 digit PIN and then we can change the number so we don't have to worry about security. We also don't have to worry about rekeying our house every time someone loses a key or we change pet sitters. The keys are backlit so that it is easy to see even in the dark. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who regularly has folks over to feed pets, contractors performing work, etc.
