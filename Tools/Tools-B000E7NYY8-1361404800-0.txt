review/summary: Great product that pay$ for itself!review/text: It saved MORE than its cost in only three weeks running a 1500 Watt space heater. It's simple and easy to use. It will do everything you need it to do, with no more than the push of a button or two. It's far better than the more complex (and more expensive) devices that require programming each day of the week, plus holiday and vacation schedules! It does not block the second outlet from use. The instructions are clear and comprehensive. The instruction sheet supplied with it has print too small for some of us to read easily, so download and print one from the manufacturer's website (the print is nice and BIG).
