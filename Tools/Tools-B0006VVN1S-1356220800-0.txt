review/summary: Worked like a charm - easy installreview/text: I've used the product now for I would say a week and noticed a difference in the smell - i no longer smell chorine. Some will say it doesn't eliminate all the chorine in the water, only a reduction by 20-30% but I noticed no smell of Chorine existent...only way to tell would be a chemical test. plan to buy that soon.I like it and will be purchasing the filter replacment soon to keep handy after 6 months as past.
