review/summary: Surprisingly cheapreview/text: I bought this pack of 10 blankets for what the local camping store charges for a single one. I was concerned about the quality, but they are great and exactly as advertised.It seems that a few other reviewers do not know what an emergency blanket it. It's not supposed to be fuzzy or to be used to snuggle on a cold day. It's a small and lightweight piece of material used to keep yourself from dying.The quality is good: I haven't had one rip under normal usage. Each comes in a plastic bag. I keep a few in each car during the winter. I've also used them in a makeshift greenhouse to reflect light and heat after spray-tacking them to some foam board.For less that one dollar per blanket, they can't be beat.
