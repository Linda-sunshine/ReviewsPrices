review/summary: Junk! Plain and Simplereview/text: Junk! It will dull or totally ruin any large blade that you run it across. For thinner blades, such as most kitchen knives, it works reasonably well. Terrible for thicker blades, such as hatchets, axes, machetes, as it will dull them to the point that the only way you will be able to reacquire an edge is to use a fine file or grinder with a relatively smoothe/fine wheel.Save your money! Invest in a set of quality whetstones that may take longer to get the desired results, yet don't destroy your blades' edges. As for me, this thing is going in the trash!
