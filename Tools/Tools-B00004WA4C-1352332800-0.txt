review/summary: No wiring requiredreview/text: I have replaced all the smoke alarms in my house with the combination alarms from Kidde but most of my alarms are wired and the battery serves as a back-up in case of a power outage. I bought this one for my utility room since it is adjacent to a bedroom, that has no detector, and no power source to which I can connect it like the kind I bought for the rest of the house. It works well -- loud; one can test it easily and reset it. Like all carbon monoxide detectors, it needs to be replaced after 7 years but it is worth the peace of mind to have this detector monitoring the furnace and water heater to ensure there is no danger.
