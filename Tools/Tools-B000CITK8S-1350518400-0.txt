review/summary: From Dead to Fully Charged.. A full featured Battery Tender that fits in the palm of your hand.review/text: I was about to purchase a new battery for my motorcycle to replace the original which was only two years old. The battery had been working okay but, after spending about two weeks in the shop (routine service and maintenance), the battery was too weak to start the engine and only made a clicking sound.The dreaded clicking sound is usually caused by a dead (dying) battery or a bad alternator (generator). The mechanic jump started my bike and told me not to worry because the battery should charge up when I drove the 15 miles back home. Well; it didn't.I went online to Amazon.com to check out battery prices and see what my options were. Unfortunately, 12 Volt motorcycle batteries (Japanese Models) are $$$ and are shipped dry (battery acid must be purchased and installed separately).When I first purchased my bike, I had a battery tender / 12V adapter installed for use with my GPS, cell phone, etc. I did a query for battery tenders / charges, for motorcycles, and added a few other filters to narrow the choices. After comparing several of the units (there's a great comparison chart), I chose the Battery Tender 021-0123 Battery Junior 12V Battery Charger. I also purchased a few accessories; 25' tender extension, an additional set of battery contact wires and a cigarette lighter (male) insert which can be used to jump start either vehicle (interchangeable).Battery Tender 021-0123 Battery Tender Junior 12V Battery Charger
