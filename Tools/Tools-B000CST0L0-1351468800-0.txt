review/summary: Easy to program but failed after 17 monthsreview/text: The product was easy to set up and use and is lightweight. However, just a few months after the one year warranty expired, it quit working reliably. The battery still holds a great charge, but the remote fails to transmit most times due to a failure of one of the circuits.
