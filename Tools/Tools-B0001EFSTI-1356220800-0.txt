review/summary: Neat and well-made, but not really useful.review/text: I have had this tool on my keychain for about six months. I carry a leatherman and often forget it, so I thought this would be a nice thing to have since I don't forget my keys.Once I got over the fact that it's a really neat, aesthetically-pleasing tool, I realized it's just not that useful, which is really what matters in a tool. The fact that you have to open the blade to use the other tools means that you're always in danger of cutting yourself when using anything other than the knife. Even when I want to use the knife, it's prohibitively difficult to open, to the point that I'll usually opt to go find an actual knife or box cutter rather than use it. The end result of this is that after I tried out all the tools when I first got it, I've used it a total of maybe five times in the last six months.I'm rating it two stars instead of one because there's nothing wrong with the manufacturing. Like I said, it's neat and aesthetically pleasing. But it's more of a novelty item than an actual tool.Get this if you think you'll be in situations where you're likely to have absolutely no other tools available, or if you get an adrenaline rush from sneaking a blade past TSA. But don't get it thinking that just because you'll have it on you at all times that you're going to use it a lot. It's just not that useful.
