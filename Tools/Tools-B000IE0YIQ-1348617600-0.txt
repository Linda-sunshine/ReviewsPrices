review/summary: Used it for three years then!!!!!review/text: Well I used it for three years off and on since 2009, mostly auto tire inflation and it worked great. The dial to PSI is close but I've always added a few more pounds.The auto cut off is a nice feature but do be careful connecting the nozzle to tire stem, it is kind of fragile. We went out this morning and saw that the front tire was flat due to a road hazard,(screw). We added a little flat fix it and attached the unit to inflate the tire. It inflated to about 20 psi, before cutting off and not starting again. It gave me enough pressure to get to a repair station. I guess this is exactly what this air compressor was intended to be used for. After reading a few reviews today stating "non usable-serviceable" fuse replacement, I will be buying another Blacker & Decker and disposing the old one. It comes with a couple of nozzles for various items to inflate which I will be removing before throwing unit out.Like I said, I had it for three years, with no issues and the four stars is for the fuse not being an easily to replace item. Hope the next one lasts just as long, if not longer.
