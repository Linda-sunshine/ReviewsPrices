review/summary: Schlage Keyless Entry Door Lockreview/text: Advertised at a great price, excellent company reputation. I bought it, it was shipped quicker than expected and well packed. Easy to understand instructions, installed in less than 20 minutes to the front door of our condo (inside hallway). Programmed combination easily and everything worked as it should have. Very solid construction with a feeling of quality. Everyone loves the convenience of just tapping in a combination and not having to fumble with keys. We'll see how the battery works out, not real worried about it though. We are glad we bought it and you can't beat the price. Schlage is as good a lock company as they come.
