review/summary: A good versitile ladderreview/text: I have had this for about a year and used it on several different types of jobs. It is very stable and the ability to fold into a small space makes it easy to move around. The construction is sturdy and it certainly does not feel cheap at all. The hinges take some effort to lock/unlock, but not too much. A good product and worth the money.
