review/summary: Hope I Don't Need Themreview/text: I received my package of (10) mylar blankets quickly. I purchased them for 3 B.O.Bs I am making so the packaging size is excellent - takes up hardly any room. I will also put one in my car. I have not needed to actually use them yet, but looking at the other reviews, these will be good in an emergency situation.
