review/summary: Very pleasedreview/text: I wanted an air compressor to keep my car tires inflated proper. This one does the job. You can set it and it will turn off when the tire has the proper PSI. I use an air gauge to check behind it. Yes, it has a short AC cable but most everybody has an extension cord in their garage and if the cord was longer the unit would not be compact. The DC cord is long enough. A good buy
