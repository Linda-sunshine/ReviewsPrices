review/summary: Great way to keep the baby room warmreview/text: We bought this to regulate a ceramic heater for the baby room. Before this, we used a timer that worked okay except the temperature fluctuated depending on ambient. This unit is easy to set, has weekday/weekend modes and keeps the room at the most comfortable temperature for our baby. It is also easy to move around with the heater in case the baby needs to sleep in our room for any reason.The rest of the house can be 68F during the night but the baby room is always 72F.
