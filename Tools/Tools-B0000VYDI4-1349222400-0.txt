review/summary: Versatilereview/text: I got this delivered on time and put it to use right away. It worked well. I had a strange spot to paint on my window by the stairs and this ladder folded up one long one short leg and stood firmly on that peculiar position and gave me the right footing to finish the job. It's sturdy and works great. I would recommend it to my friends.
