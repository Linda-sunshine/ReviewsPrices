review/summary: A Little Disappointedreview/text: This lock was designed to install in a wood door and my application was a metal clad door. This was not addressed in the online description. This necessitated removing some cast projections from the back face of keypad so that all the components would extend far enough to engage the mechanism on the inside. Works O.K. Instructions say to change the combination regularly because constant pressing of the same keys will result in obvious wear and telegraph the combination. I would suggest this is a design problem which should be remedied. When one considers all the other numbers one needs to memoriae adding a number that needs to be changed periodically can become a burden.
