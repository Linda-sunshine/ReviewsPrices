review/summary: Plug End Does not Swivelreview/text: This is a good light weight item. The real drawback is that the plug end does not swivel like some of the other Belkin plugs. If you need to get into a tight space where you don't want the plug to go out to the right side, you are out of luck. I had to get another Surge Protector because of this since I couldn't get the plug into the outlet.
