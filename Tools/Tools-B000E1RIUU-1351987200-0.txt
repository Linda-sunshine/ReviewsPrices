review/summary: Kills mice, eventuallyreview/text: There had been a mouse running around my kitchen for a while, so I finally decided to address the issue using this electronic mouse trap. I really like that it gets rid of mice humanely, but it took almost a month to trap the mouse. Not sure if I was dealing with an exceedingly cunning mouse, but I would have liked this trap to have gotten the job done a bit sooner.Getting rid of the mouse was cleaner and less cringe-worthy than using a glue trap, but it took a few hard shakes to get the mouse of the trap.All in all, I recommend this trap, but be wary of its swiftness.
