review/summary: Best price + Best quality. (MacBook Pro 2012)review/text: My project:- Taking apart my brand new MacBook Pro 2012 and putting in a SSD hard drive (Crucial) and 16GBs of RAM (Corsair).Conclusion:- This was the only tool set I needed for accomplishing this project. I will definitely have this case for the rest of my life.I would NOT suggest buying one of the silly kits that only comes with two screw options and the hilarious plastic prying tool. I made that mistake, and the cheap tools were worn to nubbins in one use. Get this Boxer 30 piece set instead!Pros:- Great quality.- Awesome price.- Fast shipping.- Tons of options and everything you'll need to open up your MacBook Pro (definitely the 2011 or 2012 models, and probably earlier models too but I can't be personally sure).- Even has the little weird guy that you'd use to take out the hard drive ("Torex-something?"). (The one that looks like a star almost)- The red part of the screw driver spins, so--when no one's looking--you can lean over and press with your chin on the back of the screw driver and use both hands to twist the bottom part. If someone walks in on you when you're in this position, I found that acting as if you dozed off is the most believable excuse. Be sure to slurp your saliva in and groggily ask what time it is.- Lightly magnetic bits allow you to keep a hold of screws.- Nice case displays everything clearly so it just takes a glance to find the one you need.Cons:- I told it to pet my cat, and it didn't. It did however make my bed, but Petri was still very disappointed.
