review/summary: 5-stars for ease of installationreview/text: This disposal has been running perfectly for... 12 hours, so I can really only review the installation process and that was 5-star easy. My Badger 1/3 HP contractor edition sprung a second leak, so it was time to replace it. I decided to spring for this model based on reviews and consider it a significant upgrade.First, the L-8000 is quite a bit taller than the Badger, but it fit under my sink just fine. It's only a little wider, but I'd recommend taking some measurements before ordering.Second, I read the instructions which are a little confusing not because any particular step is described poorly, but because of the order of the sections. For example, section 5 describes how to attach the unit to the now installed sink flange and then refers you back to section 2 which describes how to install the dishwasher drain hose. Odd.Third, my Badger was installed with the 3-bolt flange, but the L-8000 came with the EZ mount. I read another review pointing out a a conversion kit for $12 to adapt the EZ mount to the 3-bolt, but in my opinion that's money you don't need to spend. Instead, I just removed the entire sink flange from the Badger and installed the sink flange included with the L-8000. The instructions include steps for installing a 3-bolt setup, so I just reversed the process and removed the old one. Bonus, because my sink is stainless, the included rubber gasket is all that's needed, i.e. no plumbers putty. I'm sure someone will comment that you should always use putty, but until i see a leak, I'm all set.Finally, the connection of the L-8000 drain tube and the connector for the dishwasher drain hose where in almost identical locations to the Badger, so I didn't have to cut or lengthen any pipes or hoses. In the end, it took longer to remove the Badger than to install the L-8000. Total time: 25 minutes. Tools used: flat head screwdriver and pliers to loosen drain pipe fittings.
