review/summary: Beats paying money to have blades sharpened!review/text: I took it to just about every knife and scissors in my house after it arrived, nicely boxed. I could see a big difference in my blades after I was done sharpening them. Fits comfortably in hand. Requires manual precision to get a nice sharp edge.
