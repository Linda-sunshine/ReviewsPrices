review/summary: After 2 years this thing still amazes!review/text: Do you own some incredibly high-dollar cutlery? If so, then maybe you are a professional chef who sharpens knives with a whetstone, as are most of the one-star reviewers for this sharpener, it seems. Many of the bad reviews are based on the fact that this thing is so effective because it shaves off a good deal of metal from your blade, unlike sharpening stones. But unless you are a pro with a stone, it's hard to get a knife sharp that way.I'm no pro chef, but I cook for my family and I love (OK, I NEED) a sharp knife. If you are like me and you hate the idea of spending a lot for a decent knife then here is what I do:First, I buy cheap knives like the made-in-Spain/Mexico/China versions of Henckels, Wusthoff, etc. at discount stores like Ross, TJ Maxx, etc. After every 3-5 uses, I use this thing to keep them razor-sharp, which takes 2-3 passes over the blade. That's it. If it shaves off too much metal and wears your blade down too fast, then you replace your knife if it ever becomes unusable for this reason.Personally, I have not bought a new knife in several years and I have not noticed any significant wear from using this. But I tell myself that if that happens, then I guess I go to TJ Maxx and throw down fifteen bucks for a new knife. You don't need to use any muscle here, just a little bit of even pressure. This thing has put edges on knives that have been dull for DECADES!Lastly, not only have I had it for 2 years and it's still awesome, but when it starts to wear out, I can still reverse the sharpening blades and get another several years out of this awesome, AMERICAN MADE sharpener. This company deserves tons of credit for that feature alone. They actually designed this thing with FUNCTIONALITY in mind, not built in obsolescence so that we would have to replace it sooner. Not many do that anymore!
