review/summary: Kudos to Amazon Customer Support!review/text: I want to begin this review with an appreciative "thanks" to Amazon Customer Service. Best Customer service experience I've ever encountered online, or off!Contrary to some of the reviews here, this lock is one of the easiest installations I've ever done. I'm a homeowner and DIY'er and I've installed a few locks in my time - and if your door is pre-drilled, then this is a very easy install. However, my issue is with the lock itself. The auto-lock mechanism stopped working after about 1 week. (No, It was not the battery). We could continue to use it with the key option, but that defeats the purpose. After spending an evening troubleshooting and reviewing both the manual and online for troubleshooting tips, I contacted Schlage. Their so-called "Customer Support" was to contact the retailer. Amazon made the return process almost effortless, and as I expected to have to leap through hoops to have Amazon accept the return, that was not at all the case.The only reason I'm giving this product 3 stars is becasue of Amazon CS.Hope this helps.
