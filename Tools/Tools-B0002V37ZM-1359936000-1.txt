review/summary: Nice but not so nicereview/text: Rated as a three because the product arrived on time just after Christmas, however it was broken which was a big dissappointment. The holder had a big split or a long crack extending from the side corner right across one of the entry holes at one end so only four holes can be used.I notice now that one of the bulbs that holds the handle of the item, now slips from time to time. It cannot handle the weight of a mop as before as it slips. So I attach only smaller light things eg., a plastic handle gardening trowel as against a mop or broom.Despite this, it is a neat way of storing stuff
