review/summary: Iowa Winterreview/text: I ordered this for my motorcycle because I wasn't being consistent about starting my bike on a regular basis per my husband. Why of course, it's COLD in the garage! So with minimal 'direction' from my husband I ordered this based on previous reviewed. When I first got it he didn't think it was the correct one, etc., , but once he opened it HE LOVED IT(and ate his words!) and now he wants ME to order one for HIS bike and HIS lawn mower! humm....maybe for his birthday yet this winter.
