review/summary: battery tender jrreview/text: Does exactly as advertised. Extra long power cord for good reach. Would prefer the unit to have a cord thet plugs into an outlet rather than the unit itself as it is a little bulky and can obstruct the second plug of a standard two plug outlet. I've charged my lawnmower's dead battery with it and left my motorcycle hooked up tp it for 3 years straight and it kept the battery in good condition.
