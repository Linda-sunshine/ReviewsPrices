review/summary: Easy to readreview/text: I keep three carbon monoxide detectors in my home at any one time, one where the heat comes into the house (this one saved our lives when the heater had a rusted piece, letting carbon monoxide into the home), one in the bedroom above the garage, and one near (not in) the kitchen/garage. This is the first time with this particular unit. I like that it works on electricity, but has a battery backup, and hopefully it will last several years.
