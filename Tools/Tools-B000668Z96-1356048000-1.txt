review/summary: It works.. if you have fleas.. if you don't.. well it doesn't. Simple.review/text: I put it in the "problem room" and within mins there were fleas on it. After a day the thing was covered. (there were a ton of fleas in the room) I'm telling you if you have a problem this thing will detect it. The fleas will stick to it and die. Of course this alone will not solve your flea problem but it will give you a good idea of where they are living as to which area of your home or wherever you are using it. Enough said, IT WORKS.
