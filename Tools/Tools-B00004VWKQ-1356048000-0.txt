review/summary: Very Effectivereview/text: I used the AccuSharp sharpener on a dull generic knife that wasn't cut so well anymore. Running the sharpening following the instructions brought the cutting edge of the knife back. I was pleasantly surprised. It only took a few runs and was very easy to do. I find myself rummaging through my kitchen drawers to look for old knives to sharpen now.
