review/summary: Battery Life and Cold Weatherreview/text: I've owned on of these Schlage electronic locks for 4 years. It was purchased for a small professional office so we could do away with keys. The lock worked fine in the beginning, but the battery life became increasingly poor, and after a year or so required a battery change about every month. I'm using high quality 9v batteries, even tried expensive lithium batteries. Also the low battery warning got shorter, to the point that it just fails with no warning. Changing the battery is pretty cumbersome as you have to remove the back plate with a screwdriver and then hold on to the front with one hand so it doesn't fall off while you change the battery with your other hand. Could be an easier process, especially since it needs to be done so often.In very cold weather, the lock behaves erratically. On cold mornings, like we've had recently, the lock codes don't work, and you have to use a key to override the lock. I had to put a key lock box on the outside of the building for times when the lock doesn't work, which is now all too frequently.I really wanted to love this product. It's a great convenience when it works, but the shortcomings now outweigh the benefits and I am now looking for another product.
