review/summary: Seems like more of a gimmick than anything elsereview/text: I bought two of these because my dog picked up fleas when staying with some friends. While we have used numerous methods for our dogs, I wanted something that would help catch any fleas that were around in the house. I put one by the dogs bed downstairs and one by his crate and...nothing. After 2 weeks there was nothing on the traps but dust, despite the fact there were still fleas a foot away in his bedding.This is a normal light bulb that shines on a sticky pad. That's all. I was hoping for more based on the positive reviews, but I would recommend spending your money and efforts trying something else. Maybe the lightbulb and sticky pad will work for you, but it didn't for me.
