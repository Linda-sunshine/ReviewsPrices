review/summary: Does exactly what it's supposed toreview/text: Very easy to use and it only took about 30 seconds of sharpening. It sharpened my dull kitchen knives that haven't been sharpened in 4-5 years back to life, just like new. Highly recommended. I would imagine a normal household would probably use a sharpener maybe 4-8 times a year, at most, which isn't really that much, so spending a lot of money is not really necessary. This is all you'll need.
