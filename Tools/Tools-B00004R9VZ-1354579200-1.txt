review/summary: Die.....termites ....diereview/text: We live in sub-tropic weather up in the mountains so you can imagine the termite problems. I bought the first of these a few years back and it works very well in the evenings. I know this is meant to use outside but we have it in our home because of the termite problem. It's music to my ears when I hear them fry in the evenings.
