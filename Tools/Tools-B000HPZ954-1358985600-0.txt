review/summary: Not convinced you need to spend much more; I'm happyreview/text: I was looking for something a step up from the ubiquitous ten-dollar surge strips but I wasn't convinced I needed a dump a ton of money on a surge protector, let alone a power conditioner (you can make those calls yourself).That said, I'm real happy with this surge protector. Given the specs, I think it offers decent protection given the value of my home theater setup. I'm pretty confident it'll protect against any power spikes and I switch it off during thunderstorms and when we're out of town to be safe.I like the slim-profile, angled wall plug. The receptacles on the strip are nicely spaced out. I like that it's gray with a black cord and not white.
