review/summary: Wow! Simple solutionreview/text: Was having problems with my generator's battery not recharging. Got tired of hauling out my battery charger, unlocking the cabinet, and then cleaning up after the battery recharged. Plugged this in to an outlet in the garage, ran the cable to the generator and have not had to mess with the battery since. Will check the battery in a few months, but so far I am extremely satisfied with this battery tender.
