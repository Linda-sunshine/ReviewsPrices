review/summary: A little louder than my former onereview/text: Loudness aside, I went from a really expensive disposal that had lasted about 30 years to this equally powerful model. This one does the same amazing job grinding up things as difficult as banana peels. I've had it for 8 months now and I've never had a clogged pipe from debris being too large to go through my drainage system. I think it is a good value. My previous brand was no longer available and I think this one, too, may last me 30 years.
