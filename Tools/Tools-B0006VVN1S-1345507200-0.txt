review/summary: Fantastic showerheadreview/text: We love this showerhead. It has a nice spray pattern that doesn't cause the water to splash all of the place, but it's still a large enough diffuse pattern to get you wet without having to move your body around under the spray...if that makes sense. It's not pelting you with water either, it's a nice easy shower of water. The filter really does seem to make a difference, too. It was also very easy to install.I'm considering buying another one for the other bathroom, it has worked out so well.
