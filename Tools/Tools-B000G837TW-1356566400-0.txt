review/summary: InSinkErator Evolution Compact 3/4 HP Household Garbage Disposerreview/text: I had an older 1 HP Insinkerator in our kitchen which was noisy and the rubber seal had worn out making it noisier. What a difference this new one made. It is very quiet and efficient, capable of grinding just about everything. I installed it myself, and the hardest part was to get it to lock to the ring. Once locked finishing the installation was a snap.
