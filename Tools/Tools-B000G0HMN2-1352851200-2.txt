review/summary: Mag-Lite...Check!review/text: I ordered one of these recently for when the riots begin in the streets of our once great country after the economy collapses and BHO's constituents rebel over austerity measure and not getting their food, welfare payments, energy, cell phones and the like subsidized by the 49% of the sane population. This flashlight now moves to the top of the lineup in my "Apocalypse and Go" emergency bag. You think Im joking? Not quite. If youre smart you will stock up on one of these great lights and a ton of D batteries to power it for when youre scared to death but reaching for your 9mm to quell those fears. Im prepared...are you?
