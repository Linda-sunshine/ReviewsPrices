review/summary: Truly deserving as a highly rated productreview/text: Works we'll. Even grinds down egg shells and accidental chicken bones. I installed it myself without a problem .directions are straight forward. I used those flexible p trap from home depot and it made installation easier as product was definitely bigger and deeper than my ken more unit that died after only 4 years .
