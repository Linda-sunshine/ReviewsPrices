review/summary: Works great.review/text: It works really well, I have a dog that I put in the basement from outside while it's raining, it ended up getting fleas and brought them inside the house. The basement eventually got really bad with fleas, the product works well.ProsEasy to put together.Catches fleas really well.Small to where the dog doesn't notice it's there.ConsThe wire to plug in the wall is short, I would like it if it was longer.The light bulb only lasted like a week to a week and a half.
