review/summary: Instantly solved extreme skin issuereview/text: If you get dry skin & itchy red spots ect due to hard water - this will solve the problem. In a period of 5 months I changed soaps, detergents, clothes, food and nothing helped. I had to shower luke warm and as FAST as possible only 1-2 times a week to avoid this plague. Once I broke out with these devil itchy spots (just as bad as poison oak!) they would remain for 4-7 days.I can now take a hot long shower without feeling like a leper!
