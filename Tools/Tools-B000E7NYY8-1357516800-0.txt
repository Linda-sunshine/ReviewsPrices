review/summary: LUX WIN1000review/text: This is a great product. I use an electric heater that seems to keep the area too warm or not warm enough. This thermostat keeps the temperature within one or two degrees. I know I'm saving money by eliminating the temperature swings. The same thing at the local store was more than twice the price as on line. GREAT PRODUCT GREAT PRICE
