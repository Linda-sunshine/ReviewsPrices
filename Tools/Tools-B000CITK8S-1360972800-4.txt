review/summary: If you store anything that goes vroom and uses a battery. Buy this. Not a knock offreview/text: If you're looking at this I'll assume you already know the purpose of a trickle charger, but make sure you get this one (or it's big brother, whatever suits you). Those knock off chargers don't work as well and you'll lose those few dollars you saved pretty quick when you're replacing your battery years before you otherwise would have needed to.
