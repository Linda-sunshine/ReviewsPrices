review/summary: One major flawreview/text: Everything about this is good, except one flaw - the standard adapter (Schrader valve that is used on cars, motorcycles, some bikes, etc) is a weak plastic part that will inevitably break. Mine broke after about 30 uses. The compressor is fairly slow, so you're not going to want to hold the adapter on the valve while inflating.
