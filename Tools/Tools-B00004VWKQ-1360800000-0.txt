review/summary: DONT use this on super-expensive knives!!review/text: I use my best knife every day in the kitchen. The old trustyVictorinox Swiss Army 8-Inch Fibrox Straight Edge Chef's Knife, a 25 dollar knife. Thank God I don't own any Shun knives, because I would be REALLY angry if I had messed up one of those like I messed my Victorinox up.I bought this thing becuase of Amazon's "recommendation" (i.e. "Others who have bought this item have bought...") after buying my knife. It kept an edge for a few months, but finally started to get a little dull. I figured that with the rave reviews this thing got, it would work out great. WRONG. This thing did the same thing it did to so many other people, it literally CHEWED CHUNKS out of my blade. No amount of soft or hard pressure, or slow or fast strokes, made any difference. It left a rough, pitted edge on my most favorite knife. I was really angry. Sadly, at this cheap price, it's not cost effective to send it back to Amazon, so its headed straight for the trash bin. With extreme predjudice.Guess I'll have to buy another knife now...glad this is such a cheap knife (seriously...its the best...pick one up!)
