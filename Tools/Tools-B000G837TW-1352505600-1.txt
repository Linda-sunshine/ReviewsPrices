review/summary: The first time I used this disposal I thought it was brokenreview/text: because it was so quiet!!! Seriously, I could barely tell it was running. Other than that it appears to do what it is supposed to do which is grind up food.I first saw this disposal at a local home store. It was on display with a badger 500 and the top of the line InSinkErator so you could compare the noise level of all three. The badger was definitely the loudest and sounded like the disposal I was replacing. This one was quieter and the top of the line model quieter yet. I opted for the middle of the road based on pricing and am very happy with my decision. Our family room is just off the kitchen and in the past when watching TV my wife would give me a warning that she was turning on the disposal so I could increase the volume. That will no longer be necessary. If you want quiet buy this one and save your money over the top of the line model...unless you need the added HP it affords.
