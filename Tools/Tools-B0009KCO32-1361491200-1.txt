review/summary: pretty cheap.review/text: the spring in the bar that hold it up gave out pretty quickly, and the magnets overlap so it made it hard for our dogs to use this screen which is pretty much the only reason we needed it, it only got us through maybe 2 months of the summer, but it is one of the only ones we found in the size we needed for our 8' french doors (if only covered one side being open but still worked for a while) i'm going to have to try a different brand this year....
