review/summary: DOES NOT FIT a wide variety of common faucet fixtures . .review/text: My faucet takes a 3/4&#34; 27 female connection (VERY common). None of the supplied adapters fit. The instructions simply state to &#34;go to your local hardware store for the correct fittings&#34; if the supplied ones dont work. Well, good luck with that, nothing in my town.Decided (after an afternoon of running all over town, trying to make this thing work) to just give it to a relative/friend who has a compatible faucet. What a headache!!
