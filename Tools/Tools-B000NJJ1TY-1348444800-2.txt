review/summary: A digital lock that has passed the test of time.review/text: I've had this type of lock on an the door between my garage and my laundry room for several years.I would give it an A-It does not get an A+ for two reasons. They are:-- The "manual toggle" on the inside of the door that sets whether the exterior handle is LOCKED or UNLOCKED came loose after about a year. I can put the part into the hole on the lock and change the setting of the LOCK so I set it on the shelf next to the door and life goes on.-- The circuitry of the lock now does not light the buttons and beep in the same way it did "out of the box". Originally the lock beeped with each key press and the keypad lit up every time a key was pressed. Now the keypad only lights when I press the large button at the top.---- BATTERY LIFE ----This lock is still working on the original battery. I don't remember whether that was included in the box or supplied by me but it has been several years since I installed it and it is still doing its job. A low battery may be the cause of the 2nd issue shown above but since it is still working, I've not taken it apart to replace the battery.Best of luck.-- MMB
