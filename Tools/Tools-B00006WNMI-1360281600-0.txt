review/summary: Good productreview/text: There were recent stories about several people in the Southeastern United States dying from a rare form of amoebic encephalitis. Investigation showed the deaths linked to contamination of municipal water supplies with Naegleria fowleri a single celled organism common to warm, fresh water lakes and streams and the use of the tap water in nasal irrigation with a neti pot. This practice, often recommended by doctors for those with irritated nasal passages, involves mixing tap water with salt and introducing it into the sinus cavities through the nasal openings. Usually once from right to left and once from left to right. Merely drinking or bathing in water containing the amoeba is not harmful as it cannot penetrate the skin and the stomach acid kills it. However, if there are lesions in the sinuses, the amoeba may invade the brain cavity through the sinus lesion. Those enjoying the benefits of nasal irrigation can choose to accept this minimal risk or mitigate it by either using sterile water or filtering the water with a filter of small enough pore size to filter out any amoeba, which are rather large, at least as compared to bacteria. Because I like to adjust the temperature of the water for nasal irrigation, I chose to use a filter. This one works well. I can adjust the temperature at the bathroom faucet, engage the filter, wait a few seconds until the water coming out of the filter is the right temp, then fill up my neti pot. This is much easier and more economical than trying to heat sterile water to the right temperature.
