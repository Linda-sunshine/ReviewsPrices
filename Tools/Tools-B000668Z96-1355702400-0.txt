review/summary: non-toxicreview/text: We tried this flea trap as a non-toxic way to find out if the previous owner's dog had left us fleas in the carpet. The trap arrived with a broken light, so I set up the sticky traps under a flashlight. They attracted a few little flies, but no fleas. In the subsequent 8 months, we have never seen or felt a flea.
