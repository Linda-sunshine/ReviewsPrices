review/summary: Pleased with this first response...review/text: We just bought a place in Florida and were pestered by the mosquitos. No problem with this Flowtron from Amazon. It was shipped promptly and arrived a day before schedule. I put it up for just two days and it was crammed with the night air and what flies there. I am impressed that this light, without the insense sent with it, was so effective. I would advise starting with the 1/2 acre size unless you really have a large place that needs controlled. Otherwise, you are wasting energy and money...it is surprizingly effective..
