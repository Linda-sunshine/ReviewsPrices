review/summary: Best buy for the buck!review/text: The competitors at local hardware stores wanted Twice (I kid you not) as much for their brand that was only 3/4 horse and had a 7 yr guarantee. Waste King offered a full 1 horse and a lifetime warranty. This was rated best buy when it came out three years ago.
