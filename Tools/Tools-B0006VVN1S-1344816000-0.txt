review/summary: Beware of fake postings from marketersreview/text: I got this product elsewhere. It cannot do what needs to be done, which is to remove CHLORAMINES from your water. If you want real water filtration you have to use a whole house filter, combined with reverse osmosis, and it costs a lot more than this showerhead.I also want to call your attention to the many marketers who are posting reviews for products like this. You can see the ones who say amazingly glowing things about the products, but were not amazon verified purchasers. They actually are hired shills.
