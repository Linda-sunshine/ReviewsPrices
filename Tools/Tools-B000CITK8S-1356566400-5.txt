review/summary: Miracle Worker for Batteriesreview/text: Have earlier versions, but the newer desulfating/ sulfate prevention type are miracle workers, esp on low use vehicles, mowers, 4/wheelers/MCs/TTs, etc..I&#8217;ve these hard-wired in all battery-started equipment, including low-use 5th wheel and diesel tow vehicle and not 1 issue period.These lil chargers will maintain a health in a healthy battery, and, rejuvenate most in my experience.For ~$20 you cannot go wrong investing. Figure $20 vs a $100+ sulfated battery, enough said.
