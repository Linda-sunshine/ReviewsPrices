review/summary: Kill A Watt Monitorreview/text: Product delivered quickly and works as advertised. It provides the ability to check all we need for our home electrical power. There is a minor issue with the meter covering an outlet if used on a wall socket but since we use it on a surge protector strip, that hasn't been a problem. Very satisfied.
