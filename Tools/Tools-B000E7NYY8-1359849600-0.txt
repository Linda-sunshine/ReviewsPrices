review/summary: Servers a unique purpose for mereview/text: I have for many years purchased many models of portable heaters hoping o just heat my bedroom at night using electricity and save on the gas bill by not heating the entire house or apt. at night. The problem has always been the same for me, the heaters start working and as soon as the area around them reaches the temperature you set them to, they turn off. So you end up feeling cold accross the room. Then if you set the heaters thermostat much higher to hopefully heat the entire room, you end up in a sauna and with some heaters you are cold then hot and back and forth, it was never really comfortable for me until I found this device.What this external thermostat controller has allowed me to do was to rotate the plug in electric heaters heat setting to maximum so it will always turn on when plugged in (it's important your heater can do this, heaters with mechanical temp. settings work best for this) and plug the heater into this device. Then you can locate the heater away from the outlet so it has more of a chance to heat he room evenly before the thermostat located by the wall plug will turn the heater off and on again.Besides getting more even heating with a device like this, it can be programmed like a regular digital thermostat to only go on or off at the time settings you specify throughout the day or night. For me, I leave it set so it only turns on my heater at my bedtime, and goes off about an hour before I wake up because I have my home thermostat to have started heating the entire apt. by then so when I get up all the rooms are comfortable. I find I save a lot of energy using this device and am so happy to have found it for me use. I highly recommend it to everyone, Lux makes great thermostats and this model was exactly what I needed! I've had it for several heating seasons so far with no problems at all to its operation from year to year.
