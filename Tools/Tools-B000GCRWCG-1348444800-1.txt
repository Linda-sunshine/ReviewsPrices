review/summary: Should Work Wellreview/text: Products arrived quickly, and unlike some have complained, in the correct amount. While not as nice as the emergency blankets that cost $8+ for a single one, these should still work well and are made to be disposable. They are perfect for multiple emergency kits, GOOD bags, and to keep in the car, though mine will mostly be used for fall camping; placed on the floor of the tent to create insulation from the ground.
