Easy to use, compact design, put one in the pocket of your Hunting coat, Fishing Tackle Box, in your Camping supplies and Backpack for Hiking.If you have any kind of edge on a knife and require it to be sharper, run the blade through the Carbide blades of the AccuSharp and you will get a very sharp edge, Arm hair shaving sharp... Not a strong person and worried about not applying enough pressure? Don't worry AccuSharp requires only the slightest pressure of dragging a blade through the Carbide blades, run it several strokes and your done.
