review/summary: Works great, and simple to learnreview/text: We use this to power an electric heater for our garage. It was simple, and I understood how to use it in about 10 minutes. Can display in either F or C and clearly displays the temperature of the room, and what it is trying to hold the room at. No complaints. I really liked it. Worth the money.
