review/summary: it's a water filter.review/text: This is a good water filter-- it doesn't leak, keeps my water tasting fresh for 6 months, and is reasonably priced. With Amazon subscribe and save, I don't even have to remember to order it! Every 6 months, a new one shows up at my door, and for my fridge model, takes about a minute to install. No complaints.
