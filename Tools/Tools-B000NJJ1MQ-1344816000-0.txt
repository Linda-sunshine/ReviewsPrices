review/summary: Great Accessory for your doorreview/text: This is great in that it can hold 19 different 4 digit combonations. We have 2 kids and they each have their own code. This is great as they can get in the house with out needing to take our keys. It is also nice having 1 less key on the key chain (every little thing helps). This is a very solid unit and it comes with pieces to put in the door frame to make the deadbolt even more secure.
