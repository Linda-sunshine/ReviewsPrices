review/summary: Great Little Toolreview/text: The Utili-Key is a great little addition to any keychain. I can't even count the number of times I've thought to myself "Man I wish I had a knife" only to catch myself and realize I have one sufficient enough to tackle the job right on my keychain. The Phillips head screwdriver is a great size and the bottle opener has seen its fair share of uses at many a party where a proper bottle opener just isn't present for whatever reason.There are two things I've noticed that I don't like, however. The eyeglass flathead screwdriver is too big for any of the glasses I have. Also, the knob that holds the Utili-Key open at a 90 angle got worn down very quickly, so it doesn't really lock into this position anymore. This isn't a very big deal to me as it still will lock onto the keychain, and most of the tools I use while the key is completely opened up.
