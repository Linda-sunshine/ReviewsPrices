review/summary: Absolute junkreview/text: Never even able to inflate one tire. Valve stem locking mechanism broke on initial use! Purchased with cerdit card points - now in process of trying to get a refund. Unfortunately thought I could depend on the Black & Decker name for quality. Should have read the reviews. Sounds like a fuse would blow after a few times anyway. Guess I'll have to get another like the one I bought 20 yrs ago for $25, and still have, from K Mart for my 2nd car.
