review/summary: Great lock - ease of installation needs improvementreview/text: This is the 2nd Schlage BE365 keypad deadbolt I have purchased. The first was 3 years ago. I have had one problem in the 3 years of service - requiring that the lock be disassembled and reassembled. Problem went away. Never had to use the key backup. The installation instructions and process for these locks could be easier. Having multiple codes is beneficial as I use one code for me, one for the wife who wants here own code and one for another person who accesses the barn. This lock is for the house so I expect similar utility and service from this lock as the last one. Only reason I bought it was the performance of the first lock.
