review/summary: It works wellreview/text: You will be able to visually see how well this product works. I never turn it off. Not only has it done wonders for keeping down the flea population it has also handled mosquitoes that get in the house. The light is not overly bright so it works as a great night light and then attracts the mosquitoes to it. If you live in the south, it is also an effective roach trap.
