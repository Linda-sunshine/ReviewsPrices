review/summary: #powerpanicreview/text: There's a lot of fun in this product the first few days. You want to run around and hoooook up everything! Stuff eats power, it's crazy. This product is well known, and does as advertised. Review is on first impression, a follow up will happen if it takes a dive. So far, the screen is simple, easy to read. Comes with decent instructions, and super simple user interface. I'll take one, oh wait already got it.
