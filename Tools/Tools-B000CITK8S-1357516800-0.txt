review/summary: Finally got it!review/text: I knew this product would be just what I wanted. I needed a battery tender for the Optima battery in my Trans Am , which sits A LOT. I wanted a slow charge rate for this battery. It showed a red light for a day and has been green ever since. Actually I bought 2 - one for the other winter garage queen also..
