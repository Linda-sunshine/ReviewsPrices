review/summary: Very comfortable and useful for campingreview/text: I bought these gloves to use when I go camping. They work great for warmth, gathering firewood, swinging an axe, holding hot pokers over the fire, etc... They're very comfortable. They provide very good padding and protection, but they are also light and easy to use. I did manage to get a small burn mark on one of the fingers, but that's what happens when you drink and try moving hot logs around in the fire pit.
