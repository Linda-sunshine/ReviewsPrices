review/summary: Great product, great valuereview/text: I have installed several of these in the past on our house and garage, as well as the houses of family members. They have always functioned flawlessly and are a great convenience feature. They are also great for allowing service people to have access for a limited period of time without having to trust them with keys etc. the only drawback to these was they historically have been pricey, but Amazon had a special offer that brought the price down to a reasonable level. I was pleased to take advantage of this special promotion and the product was the same quality that I had purchased previously.
