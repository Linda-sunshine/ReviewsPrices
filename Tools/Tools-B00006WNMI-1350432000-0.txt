review/summary: What next?review/text: The water here in Dallas becomes very difficult to drink in the summer. Something about the algae in the lakes. After trying three pur filters I decided enough of these pieces of junk. Each lasted less than one summer. I purchased the Culligan FM-15A and promptly installed it. The water quality was very good. Then the bad things. About three weeks after I installed the unit, the auto-turnoff failed. It hasn't worked since. I've tried the recommend CLR treatment but no-go. And it has become increasingly difficult to turn off as time has gone by. This evening, the top of the housing cracked and started leaking. Net result, it lasted about as longas one of the pur filter units. So it's back to square one. Searching for a faucet based water filter that works and will last.Robert MegeePlano, Texas
