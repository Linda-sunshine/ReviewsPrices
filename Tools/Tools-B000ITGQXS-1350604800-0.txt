review/summary: Love it!review/text: I bought this product to use as a book light so I can read in the dark while my baby is asleep in his bassinet. If angled properly, it can be used to sufficiently light the room to get around and do things and it is easily angled so it can be a tiny spotlight on a book. I also use it as a flash light at night when I'm trying not to disturb my baby. I would recommend it for new moms, university students who share a room or people travelling on planes. I will definitely take it with me next time I fly. This product has by far exceeded my expectations for the price! I love it!
