review/summary: You need a couple more thingsreview/text: Yet another unit made in communist china by ninnies that never replaced a disposal in their lives. The wrench provided to detach the previous Badger won't survive the torque needed.MAKE SURE YOU GET PLUMBERS PUTTY. I assumed the unit came with what I needed, I am stoopid. It doesn't.MAKE SURE YOU GET PENETRATING OIL: If you are replacing a worn out unit, there'll be rust that formed on the attaching flange on the el cheapo steel used. Spray all the way around the attachment mechanism and then go to lunch or Lowes to buy a large hammer. Give it an hour for the oil to do it's deed. Then go at it with hammer and wrench. I found an extra person was needed with a crowbar to provide counter pressure on the Sink side of the flange. That finally allowed the two of us manly men to separate the old unit from the sink side of the attachment mechanism.
