review/summary: Works well!review/text: I work in the field a lot and use a lot of the Purple Nitrile Exam Gloves. I hate that I dispose so many exam gloves and the exam gloves don't protect against punctures. That's why I bought these gloves. It's reusable, I haven't gotten punctured...yet... One thing I don't like is that it's kind of difficult to use the gloves to hold a pen to write something, unlike the exam gloves which are thinner. But that's a minor problem and taking the gloves off solves that problem. I also like the velcro. Overall, I would recommend this product.
