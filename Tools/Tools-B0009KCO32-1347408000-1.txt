review/summary: Does not seal very wellreview/text: The durability of the screen and the attachment methods are great. It uses a decent quality expansion rod and good sticking velcro to adhere the screen to each side. However, there are only magnets in the middle and bottom of the screen. This creates a gap where bugs enter. I've seen other products where there are magnets placed every approx. 6" down the screen opening and they seal much tighter. I'm going to keep this since I threw away the packaging but I plan on buying another equivalent product that seals much better.
