review/summary: Great product at a good pricereview/text: A must have for every home. Our home is older (1936) and wiring in a protection device was just too difficult and expensive. This does the trick and works great. Kidde contiues to use the same mounting technique so in 7 years when the old one needs to be replaced (read the lables on all you detectors the detection device is only warrantied for so long) due to the age of the detection device it will just mount right in place.
