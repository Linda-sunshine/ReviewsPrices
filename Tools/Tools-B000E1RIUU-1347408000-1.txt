review/summary: It works!!!!!!review/text: Let me start out by saying I am incredibly frightened of mice. Must be a true phobia. My mouse problem started back in late March because I was leaving my dog's dry food and water bowls out overnight in the basement. I didn't realize this is a big no-no, but I know now!In all that time I've seen a total of 3 mice and caught one with a sticky trap I had forgotten an exterminator left out (disgusting sight), and last night I finally had the courage to set this mouse zapper after seeing a mouse in the kitchen yesterday morning. Lo and behold! There was a little mouse in the zapper this morning. I was afraid when I saw the light flashing, but made myself empty it and it was no big deal. For a big chicken like me that is amazing! I would recommend this to anyone. It works!
