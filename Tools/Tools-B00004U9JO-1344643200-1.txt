review/summary: Great Little Grinderreview/text: We recently remodeled our kitchen and needed a replacement disposer. We owned a Badger before and decided to go with one again. Everything you need for the installation is contained in the box with the exception of a cable clamp to protect the wires and a couple of wire nuts. It was very easy to install. You will need some plumbers putty for the sink drain so it won't leak. I am very pleased with how it works. I would recommend this product to others. It's a good medium duty disposer.
