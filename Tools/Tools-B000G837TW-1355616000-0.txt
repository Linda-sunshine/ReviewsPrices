review/summary: Super quiet but required &#34;break-in&#34; timereview/text: When we FIRST purchased this disposer- we thought it was broken because it wasn't as quiet as we expected. So we verified everything was installed properly and couldn't explain what was wrong. 3 weeks later after mild usage- the disposer is now SUPER quiet! Not sure if it had some sort of break-in period, but we now LOVE how quiet it is!
