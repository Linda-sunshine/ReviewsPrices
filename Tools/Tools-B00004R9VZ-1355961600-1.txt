review/summary: Box Elder bugs be gone!review/text: For 30 years our home has been invaded with Box Elder bugs each fall and winter. We have just had to live with the problem until I purchased the Flowtron bug zapper. It hangs in the corner of the living room and within two days our 30 year problem was solved. With a pie pan hung under the unit to catch zapped bugs we rarely even see a live one in the house anymore. God bless Flowtron!!
