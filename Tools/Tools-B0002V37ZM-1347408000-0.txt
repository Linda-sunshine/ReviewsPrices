review/summary: Great space saverreview/text: It took all of 2 minutes to mount this wall organizer, and now our utility room appears to have grown in size due to the fact that all of our brooks and mops are out of the way on the wall. It's a piece of cake to get stuff off the organizer and put it back, so this was a great buy for us. It comes with a variety of screws for different installation methods (stud only, drywall toggle bolts, and molly/screw), which is pretty handy.
