review/summary: Great practical giftreview/text: Ever wonder what to get for the man who has everything or the man who has virtually nothing? This is the perfect gift. I gave these gloves to an older man who has everything and to another, younder man who has very little in the way of material things. They both were really impressed and I understand have worn the gloves for multiple purposes. These gloves are sharp looking and very functional for several purposes, particularly for work gloves. I recommend them without reservation and think thery are perfect for any man on your list.
