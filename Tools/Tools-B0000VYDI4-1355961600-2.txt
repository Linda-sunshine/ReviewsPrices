review/summary: Stable quality ladderreview/text: This ladder is very stable and feels to be of very good quality. I had a Little Giant before that I thought was pretty good. My son took it and I needed another. This ladder is a bit heavier so if you are on the weaker side, it may be challenging in the extended mode. If you can possibly manage it, this is a better ladder . I got the 22 foot version and I am certain it will work for any application I may have. I recently used it to install my Christmas lights. I do need to gain some strength to manage it without my neighbor's help, though.
