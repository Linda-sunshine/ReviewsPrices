review/summary: Tired of the mice getting away without setting off your trap.. Well here is the answer.review/text: I have nothing but good things to say about this trap. First things first, mice are disgusting and no one wants these guys running around your house. We've had mice problems in the past. Used regular snap traps and they seemed to work. But this winter was a different story. I decided to make the move on purchasing these mouse traps because of the reviews (thank you). I didn't want to spend the money on these traps but when you want the little critters to be gone because you see droppings in all the wrong places you wouldn't want to see them in. Then this is probably a good move for you! No more disposal of splattered mice just a simple open the lid dump them out use a q-tip to clean it up and you're done. Awesome product!
