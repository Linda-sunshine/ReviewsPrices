review/summary: Great Balls o' Fire!review/text: Okay. So maybe great balls o' fire is an exaggeration. But this lit'l light packs a mighty punch. It's great for late-nite reading when I don't want to disturb my sleeping wife. The light clips securely to any book, making it unnecessary to move it for page turns. Plus, its beam is so broad it covers two pages at once; only the need for an occasional adjustment. After buying cheaper brands, this light was worth the small extra cost for one that will last and last and last.
