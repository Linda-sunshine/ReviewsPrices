review/summary: Works great! for the first 4 mice.review/text: There are quite a few reviews that reflect a limited number of kills before the trap stops working. In our case it was four. We did not use it for more than a month after we bought it, because we were working on the apartment and there was no food for the mice to eat. Started using it three weeks ago and when it died, I figured that I was covered by Amazon's A-to-Z guarantee. It should be called the A-to-D, as the guarantee only covers if you did not get the item, if you did not get what you ordered, if you contact the seller within 14 days of receipt to report the issue or return the item within 30 days of shipment. I found out the hard way by not using it for 30 days. Thanks Amazon! NOT.Follow up: I looked this trap over very carefully to see if there was anything I overlooked, and I figured out that the trap was not turning on. When the cover gets put on, there is a little projection that pushes on a switch that allows the trap to be armed (and prevents you from shocking yourself if you turn it on with the cover off). That switch was somehow stuck, and after working the switch with a small insulated screwdriver 2 or 3 times, tried it, and it now works.I'm still not happy with Amazon's "guarantee".
