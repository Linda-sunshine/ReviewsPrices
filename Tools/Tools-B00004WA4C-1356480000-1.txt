review/summary: Finally, 2 detectors in 1review/text: What a great idea to combine smoke and carbon monoxide in one detector. The voice alert tells you whether it is a CO or smoke alarm. The one bit of advice I can give is to make sure you mount the detector in a place that will be helpful for both types of detection.
