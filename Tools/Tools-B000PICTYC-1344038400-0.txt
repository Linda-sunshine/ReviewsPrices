review/summary: nice hatchet with multiple uses.. great case!review/text: Don't be fooled by cheap alternatives.. this SOG is the real deal.I purchased for camping and a b.o.b (bug out bag) and I am very pleased with the value this hatchet offers. Its got a thick metal top and heavy duty handle and it comes with a good edge.The case is designed right for security and fast dismount, much better than others I've used.At local gun shows I see similar tomahawks go for 5-10x more.
