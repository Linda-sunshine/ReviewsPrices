review/summary: Works Greatreview/text: Old InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP disposal worked for over 9 years and was in my "custom built" home. Could have purchased more expensive, feature laden model, decided for installation simplicity to stick with this same unit. Best price was found on Amazon. My son (a handyman) was able to install in less than 30 minutes. No leaks, problems or issues. Love it!InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposer
