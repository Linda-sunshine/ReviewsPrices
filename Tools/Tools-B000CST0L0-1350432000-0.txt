review/summary: Aweful!!!review/text: This company and product is awful! Did not find out it only works with PURPLE learn codes until arrival, on the work order in very small font says "Works with PURPLE learn code BUTTON ONLY !!"This means if your garage door motor does not have a PURPLE button, this will NOT work.Now there is a $5 ship back fee and another $5 restocking fee per remote. Save yourself the hassle, Do not buy!
