review/summary: Not sure it worksreview/text: I've been having work done on my house. The contractors have been leaving the back door open, which the mice seem to think is an invitation to come in and make themselves comfortable. When I found "evidence" of them in my silverware drawer, I freaked out, and purchased 5 different kinds of traps. I've discovered I have ninja mice--they eat the bait and don't snap the trap. In the 11 traps over the course of a week, I've caught 2 mice, but neither of them have been in this trap. It's easy to set up and use, but seems cheap (one of the notches that holds the cover in place was broken and the plastic is very flimsy) and given that I haven't caught anything, doesn't seem worth the price. I'll update if I ever catch one of the mice in this thing. But, you're probably just as well off with one of the cheaper snap traps unless you have a major infestation. (The D-Con No Touch No View traps seem to work pretty well.)
