review/summary: Amazing product for the pricereview/text: For $20, this thing has 6 wall-wart jacks and 6 regular jacks. It's rated at 3780 joules, which is higher than many of the competing products. The port layout is perfect. It has a little plastic clip area for holding down cables, a flat wall plug, coaxial and phone surge protection. The build is solid. I also find it pretty attractive.A newer version is available, but it is unnecessarily curvy and awkward looking, in my opinion. That, and being intense white, make it stand out too much. However, this black rectangular one blends in very well with all of my other cables and stuff.
