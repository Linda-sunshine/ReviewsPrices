review/summary: Great quality setreview/text: This was a great quality set of screwdrivers. The only two problems I've run into with it is while disassembling a iMac, there was a situation were I need a just barely bigger bit than the biggest size in this set, and a longer driver would have been useful. The red handle part covers 75% of of the screwdriver, so it doesn't have as much reach as some precision screwdrivers do.Regardless, I can't complain for the price, variety of bits, and quality.
