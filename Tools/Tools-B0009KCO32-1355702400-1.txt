review/summary: Horriblereview/text: I thought this was going to be great for my kids who go in and out all the time in the summer. It would shut automatically and they wouldn't slam my screen door. This did not work at all fell down, required you tape it to the frame of the doorway. If your door way is not set perfect for this to work it will not work.
