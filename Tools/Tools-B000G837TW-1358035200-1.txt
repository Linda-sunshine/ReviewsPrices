review/summary: Best for the moneyreview/text: Very quiet and powerful. Some plumbing skills to install but be adventurous. So quiet when running without water or ready to be disposed items inside it the hard of hearing may not realize the disposal is operating. If you are hard of hearing try out the disposal and if you cannot hear it when it is running purcase a lighted on/off switch for the wall switch. One unrelated observation - if you go to the hardware store for plumbing fittings know your fractions and inches since I found few employees who could find the correct fitting sizes. Be patient.
