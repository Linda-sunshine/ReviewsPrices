review/summary: Very good hearing protection at a reasonable pricereview/text: I use these while operating power tools and equipment around my home. The ear cups fit well and form a tight seal without excessive clamping pressure. The adjustable headband is easy to adjust and holds its position. If I'm going to operate the tools/equipment for longer than 15 minutes, I will also use a pair of disposable foam ear plugs to double the noise reduction.The ear cups are large enough that it is not practical to hang these around your neck. I also suspect they might interfere with shooting a rifle but have no experience in this. More importantly for me, they are comfortable and completely cover my rather large ears. They are perfect for my application around the home.
