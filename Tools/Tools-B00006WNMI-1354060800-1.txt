review/summary: Will buy another.review/text: Works great, price was right. Have had it on the sink for nearly two years and have been switching out the filters every few months. Makes the water much fresher than the old copper pipe taste it had before. It has started to leak out the side that attaches to the faucet but that is to be expected. Two years, three kids, my wife, and myself who has banged and beaten the heck out of this thing. Im surprised it didn't break sooner but we will see if I can get two more years out of the next one.
