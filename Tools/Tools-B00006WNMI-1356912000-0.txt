review/summary: Great product!review/text: I was looking for an affordable water filter for our new place and stumbled upon this faucet filter. Shipping from Amazon via Amazon Prime was fast and installation was super easy. It came with 2 adapters for my faucet. The water still tastes like tap water to me. I mainly use the filter more for cooking.
