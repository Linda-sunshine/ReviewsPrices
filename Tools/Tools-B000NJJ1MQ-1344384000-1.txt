review/summary: Exactly as promised!review/text: This lock was easy to install and program. We used it to replace an existing deadbolt lock. No additional drilling or sawing was required. Total installation time was about 25 minutes including the programming of the new code. I would recommend this lock for anyone who is interested in a keypad lock - but is leery of a battery-operated lockset. The combination of the deadbolt knob and the electronic keypad was the right one for me. If the battery ever fails, I still have a backup key that can be used with the mechanical portion of this lock. Thanks, Schlage for a great solution!
