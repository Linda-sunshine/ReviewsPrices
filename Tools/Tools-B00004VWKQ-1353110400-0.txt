review/summary: AccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpenerreview/text: Shipping was very fast, it arrived almost a week ahead of the estimated shipping time. I've tried it my kitchen knives and even my pocket knife. It does the job, the knives I used it on are sharp and no problems were encountered. I do see were there is a real need to follow the directions and use light pressure. I'm very happy with the sharpener, the price and the shipping. I also like that it's small enough to easily fit in my kitchen drawer with all my other utensils.
