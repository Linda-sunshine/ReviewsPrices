review/summary: Easy to installreview/text: I really like this disposer. It was easy to install had everything I needed to replace a 1/4 hp broken 17 year old InSinkErator. It is very quite, grinds just about anything you put in it, it is Made in America a big plus to me. All in all I would recommend this to anyone needing a very good disposer for a fair price.
