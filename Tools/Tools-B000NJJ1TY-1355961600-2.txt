review/summary: Not For Outside Use.review/text: Buyer Beware. This product works great for indoor applications. This lock was installed on an exterior front door and the first time itrained the lock quit working. I had to re-install the old lock. After this Schlage unit sat on the workbench for 3 days and dried out it now works again. The pictures on the box and the Schlage website show it installed on an exterior front door. How misleading can you get ?Schlage and Amazon should note that this lock is NOT suitable for exterior applications. After reading, re-reading and re-reading you will note that nowhere in the product description does it say &#34;suitable for outdoor applications&#34; or &#34;weather proof&#34; or &#34; water proof&#34;.Unless you have a storm door to keep the rain/moisture out, ... this lock is not for you.
