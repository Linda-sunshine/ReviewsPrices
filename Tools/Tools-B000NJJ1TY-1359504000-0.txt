review/summary: Great for Garages and Backdoors when kids a re coming in and outreview/text: We have 9 nieces and nephews and this is a great product for feeling secure that your door is always locked. The only thing I wish it did differently was allow you to customize the 30 second autolock feature. That's sometimes not enough time when you have multiple bags of garbage to take out.
