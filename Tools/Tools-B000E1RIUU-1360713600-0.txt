review/summary: mouse doesn't go in trapreview/text: I have a bad mouse problem in my garage. I have tried numerous things including this trap. Nothing has worked until I bought two Have-a-Heart live traps. I set the two Have A Heart right next to the Victor. Caught mice in both Have-A-Hart, nothing in the Victor. Then I take the mice off and release them.
