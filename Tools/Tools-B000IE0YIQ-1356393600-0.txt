review/summary: is kind of pricy but easy to usereview/text: bought this one so i my family no need to go to the gas station to pump up. It's little bit big for me but i think stills ok. It's easy to use. Just need to set the lbs you need, turn it on and it will run. You don't have to worry you have over pump. Except the price it is good products
