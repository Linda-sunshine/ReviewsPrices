review/summary: As fast as the Texas Court Systemreview/text: If you have no tolerance for mice and you wanted them out of your home before even considering this product--look no further. This neat and tidy electrocution chamber sends your mouse to mouse heaven in a humane time frame of 5 seconds (noted by the mfg).The trap uses 4 AA batteries and I believe that they last 3 to 4 months or approximately 100 mouse zaps (whichever comes first).In our case, we were lucky in that our infestation was rather small as a few mice managed to get into our kitchen via a large bag designed to hold leaves and twigs.Our zapper, prosecuted and sentenced 7 invaders in roughly one week. Apparently that did the trick as we have not captured any mice or found any droppings in over one month now. Unless we have mice with access to amazon (and they read reviews), we deem this product a great success.This product is designed to be reused over and over again. So, if you are going to have a panic attack every time you have to discard a zapped mouse then you might want to go with another type of trap. We paid $18 for the product which was a heck of a lot cheaper than hiring an exterminator!
