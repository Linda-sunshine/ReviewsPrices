review/summary: This works!review/text: I bought this mouse trap when a mouse decided to move from within the house walls to partying in the kitchen every night, leaving droppings everywhere. The first night I put too much peanut butter in, and it licked it up through the holes from the outside of the box. The next night there was just a little smudge - which is the perfect amount - and it went into the box and - zap.I love the fact that there is no mess and I don't have to look at it. I tip it out near the woods in my yard, where I know it will quickly become a healthy, nontoxic meal for another animal. No poison, no gore, no suffering, and that mouse is permanently gone makes this the perfect trap for me.I am now using the trap in the garage, where mice have lived for years. No more cleaning up droppings. It helps to place it along the wall where the mice run, with the hole right next to the wall.I can't imagine using any other trap. I'm surprised it's not available around here in bricks 'n' mortar shops. Shipping was quick, but with a mouse in the kitchen, I wanted it NOW! Highly recommended.
