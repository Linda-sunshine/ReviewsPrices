review/summary: Not THE answer but it does help.review/text: Once your home gets infested with fleas it takes a multi step process to get rid of them. I don't know how pet or kid friendly it is. As long as the kids or pets don't touch it then I guess it is kid/pet safe. It is basicly a glue trap with a light. I didn't want to treat everything with toxic flea powder so I bought this. I also treated the pet with frontline and started vacuuming everyday. The flea trap along with the other steps helped to get rid of the problem. Don't expect to set it up one night, go to bed and wake up the next day with the entire glue disc is covered with fleas. The first night is caught only 6 fleas and a spider. After a week in the same spot it had 50-60 fleas on it. So it does work but it takes time.
