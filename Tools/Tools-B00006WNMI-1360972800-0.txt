review/summary: Nice Filterreview/text: This filter works very well for the price. The water tastes great. The only concern I have is the build quality. I have been using it for about two months, and it now feels a little bit loose where the plastic filter part connects to the metal pieces that screw on to the faucet. Overall I am happy with the purchase, and if it does break I would probably buy another one.
