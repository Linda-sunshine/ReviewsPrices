review/summary: better methodreview/text: when viewing the description I realized that what I have been doing - that works, is a much better solution. at night before bed, i get a lamp about 2ft tall (too short the fleas will be able to reach the lamp and miss the pans - too tall the fleas will not have any heat to attract them)and put a couple pans (long cake pans) under them 3/4 full of water. before i put the water in i put a couple table spoons of DAWN dishwashing liquid in them so that they will suds up real good. use a 100w bulb if you have one - the brighter/warmer the better. when you get up in the morning there will be plenty of fleas in your home made and cheap trap!!!
