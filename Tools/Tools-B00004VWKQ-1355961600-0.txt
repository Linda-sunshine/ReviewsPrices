review/summary: Works wellreview/text: I was tired of my knives being dull all the time and just wanted something small and simple to get them sharpened. This seemed like a good solution though I was skeptical because it was really inexpensive and I thought it might not work. But it works very well and is easy for even a chicken like me to use (I'm always petrified of cutting my hands on the knives.) I think it's a good product and very good price.
