review/summary: The Perfect unitreview/text: After spending almost two weeks shopping around online and at local brick and mortar, I decided upon this unit.After getting the unit, I could have just attached it to the old sink set-up, but I wanted to install all the new parts. So, after getting it all ripped apart I realized I was missing plumbers putty. After a quick trip to the hardware store and $2 later, got the whole thing installed. The directions were pretty good. There were terms that the average person may or may not know. BUT, w/o issue I got it installed, checked for leaks and passed with flying colors.I purchased the garbage disposer in March, and have had it running for 6 months now. It is amazingly quite. If nothing is i in it and having water running, you can't even hear that it's on. I couldn't call this compact, as what I had wasn't a compact unit and was roughly the same size. But, that part I didn't do research on.I highly recommend you pick this product up, if you're in the market.
