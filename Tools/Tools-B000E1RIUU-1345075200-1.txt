review/summary: GREAT PRODUCTreview/text: This really works! The first night I caught one mouse, the next day 3. I was a fan of Victor spring tapes, but lately either the springs seem not sensitive enough - or the mice have been getting smarter:next day peanut butter is gone and trap has not sprung (did they start making these in China recently??) But this trap is great: no mess and instant death so the mouse does not suffer.Directions are pretty skimpy so I suggest everyone read the comprehensive directions in the November 2008 review at the start of the Amazon review section. It's a simple and cleaver design, but I too could have mistaken the ON switch for the OFF switch (also, like this reviewer, I had found mice only half dead in spring traps .. obviously suffering the whole night .. and relished this instant and clean kill). Note to Victor: please continue trying to get an effective release mouse trap - no one has one yet. This electronic trap is effective and humane if one has no choice but to kill, but I'd rather not kill them at all if possible.
