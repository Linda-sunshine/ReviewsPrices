review/summary: Great value for the pricereview/text: I just recently moved into a new house, and was previously using aBrita 10060258356189 On Tap Filtration System, Chrome/Chromeand it always leaked (even at my previous location), especially when I used the filtered setting. It would actually leak out of the un-filtered side as well as out of the faucet where the connection was made. I tried re-attaching it many times with the same results. I went ahead and purchased the Culligan FM-15A as it was around $15, which is a price point way below the competition, about half the price of the Brita system. I also knew Culligan was a very long-standing and well recognized company in the water industry, but I had never heard of them making personal tap filters.The package arrive and I installed it quite easily, the metal connector to the faucet seems much better quality than the cheap plastic connector used by the Brita system. I first turned it on and had a very small leak coming from it, but I tightened a small amount further and it stopped the leak entirely.I then went ahead and ran water through the filter for the recommended 10 minutes. This seems pretty common on most new filters, with varying times depending on the model. After this was done I gave the water a quick taste test, the water in my area tends to have a bit of an off taste to it, but this filter removed it entirely. I would say this filter cleans the water just as effectively, if not better than the Brita system. The replacement filters are also slightly cheaper and last twice as long. I have not yet had to change mine out so I cannot comment on the issues people have had there, but the instructions that come with it make it seem very easy.Overall, I would highly recommend this filter. It works great and can fit into anyone's budget.
