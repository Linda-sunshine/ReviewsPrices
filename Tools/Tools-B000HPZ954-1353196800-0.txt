review/summary: Still working after a year and a few power out'sreview/text: I own 4 of these, some of which I've purchased through Amazon. I have one for each TV and electronics and 2 in my home office. We've had a few power outages in our area over the past year and all my electronics are fine and the surge protectors are still running as normal. I have TV's, Xbox's, cable boxes, PC's, chargers, and just about any other electronic device plugged into them. The only thing stopping me from a 5 star review is that there are no USB ports.
