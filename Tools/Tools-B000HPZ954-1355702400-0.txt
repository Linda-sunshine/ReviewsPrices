review/summary: AWESOME!review/text: I know it's only as surge protector, but it really does a great job of cleaning up all the plugs behind my tv. It's thoughtfully laid out, and allowed me to get rid of a second power strip and everything seems to be functioning great. The 10 foot length is also great to have.
