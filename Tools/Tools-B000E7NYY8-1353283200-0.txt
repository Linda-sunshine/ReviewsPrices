review/summary: Reliable and Easy to Usereview/text: Nice product. I decided to buy four of these to use with portable space heaters. One of the four was defective (kept cycling the heater on and off) but Amazon promptly replaced. The devices themselves do what they are intended to do. Four stars (instead of five) because I don't know how accurate the thermostats are...I have independent (high quality) thermostat/thermometers that are usually 2-3 degrees off from this....I am prone to believe that the digital thermometers are correct. Overall a solid product. I don't regret purchasing.
