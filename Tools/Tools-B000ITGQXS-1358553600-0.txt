review/summary: Excellent Valuereview/text: I have purchased two of these lights. One I use for book-reading, working with small tools/crafts, etc. at home.The second, I clipped to my bicycle handlebars and use it with Amazon's VDO X1 Bicycle Computer. I ride at night and this is absolutely perfect to illuminate the computer in the dark.The batteries last a very long time and the neck is extremely flexible but sturdy (doesn't wobble on the bike). The light is very bright for such a tiny light. I would recommend this to anyone.
