review/summary: Disposal Bites, but not in a good way!review/text: Never knew a disposal could be this bad. It constantly backs up, has been reset numerous times, and backs up more than flood basins in Los Angeles.It has a hard time with......Lettuce. Ya, lettuce.My last two homes, my disposals worked for years, kind of like the string for opening our drapes. I was barely aware of their existance, astheir only job is chewing stuff up. This thing is like a lawnmower with no blades. The worst disposer I've ever owned, or experienced.Other than that, it's fine. :/
