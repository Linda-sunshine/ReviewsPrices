review/summary: Worked well for a yearreview/text: We have 5 people using this filter. It completely removes the taste of chlorine and sulphur from our water.One of the filter replacements did not thread in correctly and didn't work well. We still used it but the water pressure was low. Out of 7 cartridges it was the only one that had any problems.The filter produced excellent tasting water for over a year. Because of children pulling on it, the faucet attachment has become loose and leaks. For the price and the abuse it has taken I consider this good performance and I've already purchased another one. 4 stars because it did start to leak. I would have rated it 5 stars 3 months ago.
