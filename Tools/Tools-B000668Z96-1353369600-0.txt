review/summary: Would be a bargain if it actually caught fleasreview/text: Other reviews led me to believe this trap was the best way to catch the sneaky fleas that might be lingering around my house. After leaving it on and out for 1 week in my living room at night, not a single flea was caught by the "ultimate" flea trap. Either I don't have as bad of an infestation as I originally thought, or the fleas in my house are too smart for this little rinky dink contraption. I am quite disappointed with the item. The only thing it did manage to catch was a few house flies... which I am grateful for. So I gave the item 2 stars instead of just one.As for the materials, well, they are not so great. I think other reviewers did a pretty good job describing the item. It is not an astonishingly creative design, just a sticky pad and a light bulb to attract the fleas. You could probably McGyver something similar at home for a more reasonable price. And the light bulb that comes with the trap is a 60W! So many watts for one tiny bulb.. I think all of the lights in my kitchen are more energy efficient than that.Anyway. Bottom line is that I find this product to be a waste of money, even with the Super Saver Shipping offer. Don't be fooled like I was!
