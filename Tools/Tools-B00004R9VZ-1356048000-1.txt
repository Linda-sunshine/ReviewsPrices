review/summary: Makes a real difference on summer evenings in Southern CAreview/text: We have a place up in the hills near the Angeles Forest and enjoy sitting out and cooking on the BBQ on summer evenings. As the year passes, we get invaded by mosquitos since there is a stream and lots of vegetation around. We bought one of these this year and immediately noticed the difference as it has allowed us to enjoy the evenings outside for much longer.
