review/summary: Blades are great and the screwdrivers are convenient!review/text: Very useful. It is a quick-to-use blade that is always close by. I've used both the serrated and sharp edges multiple times and it still works perfectly. I've used the screwdriver ends for quick-fixes when I get too lazy to find the actual tool and it works fine. I've never tried the bottle opener end though.If you have trouble moving the parts, spray it with WD-40 and it'll be as good as new - if not, better.
