review/summary: THE WASTE KINGreview/text: Very quiet and powerful. We had a Badger with .3 horses (piece of junk). The waste king is great and very easy to install. If you are putting in a brand new sink with it, everything is included and you don't need to buy anything else. You need very few tools. I used a screwdriver, pliers and a tube of silicone. Really easy to install, it took maybe 30 minutes.
