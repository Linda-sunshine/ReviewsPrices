review/summary: Perform exactly as expected and advertisedreview/text: I bought this because I live in the midwest and recently built a 9x14 permanent greenhouse. We are expecting a sudden cold front to move though over the next few days so I was concerned about the internal temperature of the greenhouse. UPS delivered the box yesterday and this went into immediate use. Setting the controls was easy despite the instructions being a little intimidating. Total programming time was about 3 minutes. I tested the heat and cool function with a small fan adjusting the temperature threshold to trigger the controller using the ambient temperature in the house. Satisfied, I set the function to "heat", attached a kil-a-watt usage monitor, attached a small ceramic heater to the unit and headed outside. I have a temperature recorder running that captures both the internal and external greenhouse temperatures and boy was I amazed when I got up this morning. The external temperature dipped to as low as 38 overnight but the internal greenhouse temp never went below the 52 degree trigger point I set. Total usage was less than 1KW for the overnight setting the ceramic heater on the lower (1000 Watt) setting with a low fan. I am totally geeked out at this and am super excited to see how it performs over the winter.
