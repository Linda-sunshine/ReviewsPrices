review/summary: Best Garbage Disposer I ever ownedreview/text: I searched through a ton of consumer research and finally decided on this unit. The reports indicated that it was the best in terms of crushing food scraps and even bones. I rely on this information because I really can't prove it, but what I can say is that this unit is extremely quiet. The only negative I can think of is the size of the unit. But hey, if it needs to be that big to be effective, who cares ... it's underneath the sink.
