review/summary: Long Over Due.review/text: Yes, this is long over due. It's great not wondering whether or not you locked the doors and remembered to take your keys. It lights up at night so there is no problem punching in your combo. No problem at all installing and it really has a nice look to it. It is a well made lock and Ive had several compliments on it. I'm very pleased, along with my wife and family that I made this purchase. I ordered them on line from amazon.com because I know if there are any problems, they have a great reputation and that boosts my confidence in knowing I made a satisfactory purchase.Ken
