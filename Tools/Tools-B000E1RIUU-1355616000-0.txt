review/summary: Hands-down best mousetrapreview/text: Around here, the mice are super-intelligent mutant city mice who don't fall for any of the more traditional methods of extermination. After spending weeks and months trying everything else for my intermittent mouse troubles, I invested in this trap and it got the sucker in my kitchen within hours. Even better, I never had to look at or touch the body and it's totally safe around my pets. Best $20 I ever spent.
