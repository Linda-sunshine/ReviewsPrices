review/summary: Good General Duty Toolreview/text: I have used this set a few times and it does good until you really torque it. I drove 6-6in. Ledgerlock bolts and I could not remove the 3/8 bit from my 18 volt lithium-ion impact driver. I don't know if it's the quality of the set or my impact driver, but I wont use the bits for any medium to heavy duty work in the future.
