review/summary: A very powerful disposer.review/text: The positive reviews are mostly accurate. This is a very powerful disposal. It grinds quickly and effortlessly. There is definitely a moderate to loud "click" when the disposer is turned on. The noise comes from the pivoting blades due to the initial centrifugal force. I don't find the disposer exceptionally quiet as other reviewers have stated, but it is not overly noisy either. The installation was indeed simple. I opted to remove the old sink flange and install the included polished chrome flange included with the disposer. I like this approach as opposed to retrofitting the existing flange. Some reviewers complained of a short cord. For my installation, it was more than adequate. If more length is needed, a heavy duty 3' extension cord can be purchased at Lowes or HomeDepot. I was happy that the cord was included and wired to the disposal. Years ago, this was not the case with disposers. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase. I think the disposer is a good value.
