review/summary: A Must Have Setreview/text: I bought this set originally to take apart my MacBook Pro to replace the broken screen and it worked beautifully. The bits seemed to be made of a nice quality metal that doesn't just wear down every time you have a hard screw to get get out. It is truly a great value and perfect for all those things you wish you had a precision screwdriver set for. The only bit I wish it had was a torque small enough for the iphone 4 but it's still a great set.
