review/summary: Two and working greatreview/text: Got tired on stumbling around looking for a mop or a broom when they were just stacked on the floor against the wall. Bought two of these, reorganized everything, cleared up floor space and they work great. I would highly recommend this inexpensive way to store and organize all handled items.
