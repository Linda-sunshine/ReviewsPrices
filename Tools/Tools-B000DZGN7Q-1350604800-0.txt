review/summary: Amazing Disposal - Great Price & Great Productreview/text: Our old disposal died and I wanted to replace it with one that was at least 3/4 horsepower, since our old 1/2 horsepower (which was a Badger and only 5-years old) could barely handle scrap veggies. I did my research on Consumer Reports and found the Waste Kind L-8000 Legend to be the top recommended and this was the reason I selected this particular disposal. In the end, I love it, for how much you can "love" a disposal, and the man of the house was thrilled I ordered him a new project...not so much! :) I highly recommend it and it's a great deal! The only "poor" review consumers gave the Waste King L-8000 on Consumer Reports was the noise level. I was shocked by this review because the disposal is ultra-quite, especially for a 1 horsepower! Happy Disposal shopping and I hope this review helps! I generally don't write reviews, but when it comes to products for your home, you want to make sure you're getting the "best bang for your buck!" Cheers.
