review/summary: Does the job, and its cheap.review/text: I shopped around for a good price before buying this for my greenhouse. And this was one of the best prices I found, for something to activate an emergency heater when weather gets cold. I haven't had it long, but did test it in my freezer to make sure that it works, and it does. Right now, it has a heater plugged into it, protecting my greenhouse from frost.
