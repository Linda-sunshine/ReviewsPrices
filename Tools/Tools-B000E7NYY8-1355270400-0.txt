review/summary: Good productreview/text: It does what you'd expect. It's got a lot of features that I have not really used. Fairly easy to set up and does allow very complex tempurature selection for both heating and cooling. I use it to turn on a small heater to keep an area in my garage warmer so nothing freezes so I really only need a simple temperature setting. It does have a battery so it will not lose the settings if you unplug it and move it to another outlet.
