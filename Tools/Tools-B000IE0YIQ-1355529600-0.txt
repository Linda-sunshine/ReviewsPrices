review/summary: Junk!review/text: I ordered this and it was delivered on time and as stated. The original compressor lasted 3 months before failing on the AC input. It was replaced by B&D at no charge. The replacement compressor lasted 6 months and again the AC input failed. After talking with customer service at B&D, they requested the second one be returned and upon it's receipt a third replacement would be shipped at no charge. I was told by customer service the AC input circuit had been changed and would not fail as the first two had! The third compressor lasted 9 months before the AC input again failed. I have the original and the failed 3rd compressor that both work on DC power. The AC input failures all made a loud &#34;POP&#34; noise and never worked after this happened. None of these compressors were used for anything other than car tires, bikes and a wheel barrow. My original B&D Air Station lasted for over 10 years before it failed. This unit is made in China and I can't advise anyone to buy it.
