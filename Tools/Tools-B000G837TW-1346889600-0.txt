review/summary: Compact size is perfect!review/text: I went from a double sink with the drain on one side, to a single sink with the drain in the center. I was concerned about being able to fit my garbage can under the sink. The Evolution Compact allows it to slide in on the side opposite the pipes and I am very happy. I haven't used it much, so I can't comment on performance, except that when my husband came home and turned it on, he looked at me and said, "Doesn't it work?!!" Well, yes, it was on, but he couldn't hear it. It "is" very quiet!
