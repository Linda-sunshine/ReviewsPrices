review/summary: The Good and the Badreview/text: The Good:1. It's small & relatively easy to store2. It's safe & sturdy, I feel comfortable on the ladderThe Bad:1. It's heavy (I bought the 17'). It's not so heavy when you first pick it up but when it's extended it can be difficult to easily move around.2. It's hard to use in small places, if you need to extend it you need plenty of floor space in the same area, you can't easily move it when it's extended.3. The black end caps will mark up walls, put an old towel over the end caps but that can be a clumsy operation. If you do get marks on the wall use one of those stain erase sponges.My conclusion:A regular extension ladder is much easier to use but this ladder does have more functions. Don't be in a rush, think before you climb & have a helper if possible.
