review/summary: Just what I wantedreview/text: I bought two - one for me and another for my friend.Good things:1. Easy installation: I installed both the filters in under 3 minutes each2. Connects to any tap: Our taps were very different, but the installation was very smooth for both taps (product comes with several different tap connectors).3. Maintains tap height: It was important to me that the faucet height wouldn't be reduced by adding the filter. It wasn't!4. Automatic shut off: The filters I've used so far have had a knob that you've to turn both on and off. The Culligan comes with an automatic shut off mechanism that works based on water pressure. So I don't use the filter by accident when I turn on the hot water, for example. Great feature!Can be better:1. A &#34;change filter&#34; indicator would have been nice, but I guess I can tell when the taste changes.2. Sometimes the automatic filter gets stuck, but its not a very big deal. I just push the knob back in and that's that.
