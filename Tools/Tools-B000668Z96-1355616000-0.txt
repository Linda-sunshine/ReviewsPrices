review/summary: It is what it is.review/text: Honestly, I could have saved my money on this one had I rigged up something similar, but it would not have been as nice. .It is well made, and a good product, but honestly, I could have suspended a 4 watt bulb over some contact paper (sticky side up). The light emits warmth which attracts the fleas. The sticky paper holds them in place while they await their final fate.I give this 3-stars because of the nice workmanship, the ingenuity and the prompt delivery.
