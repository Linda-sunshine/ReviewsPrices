review/summary: Easy Install and runs great and is quietreview/text: Bought the compact 3/4 HP to replace an insinkerator compact 1/2 HP. The old one lasted nearly 8 years, out living the 5 year warranty. The install was really easy, much to my surprise. I could have used the old sink ring/mounting brackets and saved some additional effort and time, but the new model had a much nicer stainless steel drain ring so I decided to replace everything. I did solicit the help of my wife to help get the unit properly aligned with the mounting ring. The unit I replaced was shorter so I had to do some minor adjustments to the plumbing, but it was minimal. The new unit is extremely quiet too. I highly recommend this upgrade.
