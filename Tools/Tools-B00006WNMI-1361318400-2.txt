review/summary: Why all the negative reviews?review/text: I am delighted with this product. (If it fails shortly, I will revise this review.) I had a Pur which always leaked and needed so many attachments to fit (in)correctly that I couldn't even fill a water bottle since the kitchen faucet was so distended. This was easy to install, does not drop down too low, and the water tastes great. Also doesn't drip like a sieve. I am delighted that it reverts back to regular faucet after each use so friends who help me won't be washing up with filtered water. No, it doesn't have an indicator, but I have a smart phone and I have set reminders when I need to change the filter. One can also set up regular discounted filter deliveries through Amazon for their personal desired intervals. I wish I hadn't waited so long to replace the blasted Pur device. This is like a breath of fresh air!
