review/summary: great product , easy to usereview/text: I would highly reccomend to any one, It saves a ton of money when used on either a propane or kerosene blower heater, now my heater uses about 1 gal of kerosene a day to keep my shop from freezing , versus it use to use about 5 or more times that, just cuts on when when needed and runs for a few min and cuts back off just like a in home heating system, pretty cool product
