review/summary: WORKS-review/text: Price for Mylar blankets was good. I was at a marathon this weekend (didnt run it) and tons of people used mylar to help stay warm after long runs. I tried one out. It does keep decent amount of heat in. Especially on the shoulders.I wouldnt recommend this for kids, but I tried putting it on top of my head. Because you lose so much heat off your head, I thought Id get even warmer. Noticed a funny thing. You can see through this!Just remember this is still basically a plastic bag. Safety first! But for an emergency, this waterproof, small-footprint item is 100% worth the cost!
