review/summary: Exactly what I was looking forreview/text: I ordered this for a Coleman cooler/heater. I am trying my hand and &#34;Home-Brewing&#34; and needed some way to keep the concoction at a constant (room) temperature. With some minor modifications to allow for a power cord inside the box, this thing worked perfectly. I left a wireless thermometer inside to verify temperature and the temp was always between 71 and 73 (target = 72) despite the unit being outside in the sunroom where tempertures have dropped below freezing a few times this winter. I suspect it will work just as well during the heat of the summer.
