review/summary: Works as advertised!review/text: First, I was able to use it in 220volts. Second, it works pretty well as advertised. There was one time that the car was left running in the garage and the alarm sounded! We immediately ventilated the living room and the levels went down gradually. This device can save lives! I don't know though if it can detect gas leaks. Never tested and don't want to test it myself. lol
