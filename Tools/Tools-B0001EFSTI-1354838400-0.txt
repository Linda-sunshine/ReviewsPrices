review/summary: Everyone should have onereview/text: Pros:Great tool. Helpful everyday and easy to carry. The phillips head is tricky to use as the blade may cut you if you aren't careful but I've never cut myself. I lost my 1st one which I had for years. The flat head screw driver has no reach but still comes in handy. The best part is that it is camoflaged as a key on the key chain so you can bring it anywhere. I really like it.Cons:I would have given it 5 stars if the end of the blade was a flat head screw driver instead of the short &#34;nubby&#34; one on the key head side. If you get it, it will be used all the time.
