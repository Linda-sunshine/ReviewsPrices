review/summary: doesn't work nearly as easy as statedreview/text: The screen is too long for our door and there is not way to adjust it. It catches on the bottom door frame and, subsequently, does not close. Also, it has only one weak magnet in the middle and it does not close unless you actually put it together by hand. Still it is better that a regular screen door in the the dogs can come and go but there is always an opening left when they do.
