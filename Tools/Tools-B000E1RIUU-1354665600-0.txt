review/summary: Workedreview/text: It work the day I got it... 1 mouse right that night.... but that was the only mouse it has caught since then. Its been three weeks i think and that really isn't con (I should be happy). Its just a little weird not knowing if it still really works unlike manual traps I have to look at the bait regularly and check if its been touched. again not really a con. works as advertised.
