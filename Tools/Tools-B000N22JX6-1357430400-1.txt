review/summary: Arrived damaged and not safe.review/text: This arrived on my front porch in only the box you would purchase it in the store, no extra box or packaging. When I plugged the unit in it made a loud whirring noise...no one could use this as the noise was so distracting. Not sure if they all do that or it if was damage from shipping. It could have been packed much better. I also noticed that it did not turn off like most heaters do when tipped over. On a bright note, Amazon promptly refunded my money and I was able to find another model (Delonghi) with them that met my needs perfectly!
