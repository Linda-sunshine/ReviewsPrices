review/summary: F01T Tactical Tomahawkreview/text: Usually when you read description from manufacturer its all praise and then you open the box you start seeing bugs everywhere. There are NO bugs on this one, what the description says is what you get. I use it for camping mainly , learning to throw it (VERY slowly :D )and gave it some abuse breaking bricks and chopping some cans and plastic stuff to test the blade and spike - went through everything and stayed reasonably sharp, no dents in it. Fits in hand perfectly ( I added a piece of paracord to loop around wrist) , well balanced and sturdy. Very handy tool/weapon to have around, excellent price too, definitely recommended.
