review/summary: Great trap for the squeamish/kindhearted mouse killersreview/text: I am not one of those folks who scream and hop on the table at the sight of a mouse. In fact I think they're kinda cute with their little whiskers and big black eyes (cockroaches on the other hand... *shudder*). BUT, when it came to my attention that we had a pretty bad mouse problem (despite having two cats, one of whom did her part but simply couldn't keep up with the volume), I knew I needed to find a way to get rid of the little buggers. Those humane &#34;traps&#34; are useless and snap traps, when they work, can be messy (headless mice anyone?) or downright cruel when the poor mouse only gets partially caught. Glue traps--no way; those are just beyond cruel. And poison was a no-go with our other resident animals (and who wants a dead mouse decaying in the wall?). So, this trap seemed the best option, despite being a little pricey compared to more standard products.Two days in I was beginning to doubt my purchase: no joy. And then! Boom, two absolutely giant mice in two days. I mean these mice were so big their little back ends were hanging out the hole! Easy as pie to dump the trap and reset. Definitely performed as I'd hoped!Word of caution: Do follow a previous reviewer's recommendation to use a very small amount of peanut butter--a faint shmear, if you will. Too much will definitely clog the plates if it falls off the side of the trap.
