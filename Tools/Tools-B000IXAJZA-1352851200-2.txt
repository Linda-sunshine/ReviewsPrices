review/summary: Excellent light for the moneyreview/text: I know some will say that there are brighter LED lights out there and that they are smaller as well. They would be right too. HOWEVER, that wasn't my purpose for this light. Those smaller lights with higher output don't last long on a battery. I need something that will last longer than a couple of hours. This light has enough output to see my livestock at an 1/8 of a MILE or better. And with 3 D batteries it will run around 48 hours (specs say it should go longer but I haven't tried to). The light is well built (not quite as heavily built as our older maglites which we converted to LED but still well built). As long as being small is not your main criteria, this is probably some of the best bang for your buck on a good quality LED light.
