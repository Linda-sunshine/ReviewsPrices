review/summary: satisfiedreview/text: Fourth and hopefully last garbage disposal. Took out badger5 after holes began to spew nasty water all under our cabinets. Installation a breeze. Waste King much, much quieter than badger and because we went from 1/3 hp to 1 hp much stronger. Hopefully will never have to use lifetime warranty.
