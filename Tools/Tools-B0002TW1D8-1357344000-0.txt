review/summary: Heavy, and took the abuse!review/text: I got these today to use in my Makita LXDT04 Impact Driver. They all worked flawlessly. I even used the 1/2&#34; bit with my impact socket and took a couple of lug nuts off the car and put them back on and they worked no problem. no flexing or denting or rounding of the corners. They do what they're supposed to do.
