review/summary: Easiest installation ever! Great product so far....review/text: Probably the easiest installation of anything I've ever installed. I am handy with plumbing, tools and Do It Yourself.... Installed nicely and one key to keep in mind while installing the gaskets; Listed in the documentation is to NOT turn the drain itself when installing the fiber gasket and collar. I can see why and I made sure I didn't turn anything during the installation. So easy came with the EZ mount kit and its seamless, easy and so far works great! THanks!
