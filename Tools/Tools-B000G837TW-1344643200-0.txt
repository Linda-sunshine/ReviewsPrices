review/summary: Just buy it!!review/text: The disposal in our house finally gave its last a few months ago. Read a lot of reviews and settled on this model. Installation was really easy (this coming from a guy who's "Handy Man" skill set rates really, REALLY low on the scale!) and the operation is whisper quiet. Highly recommended, you won't be sorry. Take a deep breath, add it to your cart and relax. You're gonna love this thing!
