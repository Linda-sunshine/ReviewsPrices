review/summary: Does what it's supossed to do.review/text: Good quality fittings and gear. Solid. Stable. Sturdy. Heavy for lammer old me, but not too much. Very versatile: you can use it as a stepladder in several heights. It folds compact. The gear is nice. And the price is right. Don't expect wheels, holds, trays, bells, and whistles. It's just a great stepladder made of aluminum, and you can even turn it into an extension ladder to reach some 17 feet high. You can take it apart and re-assemble it as two A frames, although I haven tried this last function. Don't pay 500 dollars for a Little Giant. This is a much cheaper knock off. Don't bother reading the instructions. Just go to YouTube and watch Little Giant infomercials to know how to use it.
