review/summary: Seems good, but haven't had a CO leak to knowreview/text: The construction and features are good. Hope I never have a CO leak to see if they work, however. They are a little big and boxy for plugging into a receptacle so it may get in the way of furniture. But it shouldn't be too hard for people to find another receptacle with more clearance.
