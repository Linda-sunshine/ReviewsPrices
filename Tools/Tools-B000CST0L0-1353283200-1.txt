review/summary: works but lacks range.review/text: Make sure the color coding on the door opener matches with one in the instructions. I accidentally ordered the wrong one and had to get it replaced. Getting this to set up is quick and easy and was done in a minute. The only thing that i didn't really like about this garage door remote was the lack of range. The other ones i have that came with the chamberlain garage door opener, I could be a house away and it would be able to open the door with a press of a button. With this remote i literally have to be in front mail box in order for the remote to be detected.
