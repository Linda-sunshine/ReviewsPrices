review/summary: Does exactly what you'd want--but maybe too bright?review/text: Not difficult to keep two full pages brightly lit. Very flexible neck, and the quality of light is nice and white (not yellow). I do have trouble not disturbing my sleeping partner with it at times as it is so bright and it can be challenging to attach to slimmer volumes.
