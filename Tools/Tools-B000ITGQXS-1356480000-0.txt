review/summary: Use it as my Adult Night Lightreview/text: So, I sleep in a bedroom and don't have a lamp. I often get up, but don't want to waste lights for a nightlight. I also have a tablet and do regular work in bed and don't want to wake up my wife. This light is now clipped to my bookshelf. Batteries have been running four weeks now. Sometimes I accidentally leave it on.The twisty neck allows for a large number of configurations. The clip will hold onto the side of a bookshelf. I've bumped it and it does not come off.It takes 3 AAA batteries.
