review/summary: This Works !!!review/text: This year i've had to put out over $700 on my camping van because of rodents chewing wires and a vacuum line.So i have begun to fight back ... by buying some different things ...i bought two of these traps a few weeks ago and just went camping this weekend ...Friday i put one on my battery and one on the other side of the engine compartment a little lower ...i forgot to check Saturday ... but Sunday morning i checked ... two dead mice ...All i used as bait was one almond ... i'm buying a few more for over the generator, etc.
