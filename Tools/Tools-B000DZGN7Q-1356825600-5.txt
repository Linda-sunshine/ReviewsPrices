review/summary: Ordered one - buying morereview/text: For home applications this is the best unit there is. The install was easy and I am no expert. The main tool I needed was a screwdriver.A lifetime warranty by one of the biggest suppliers in the business should mean something. I simply placed the receipt and warranty info in an envelope and taped it to the side of the unit.Note: The disposal runs at a higher rpm and has a different sound and is quieter than other disposals which is to be expected for something so powerful. The quality is very obvious. For about $20 more than others of much lesser quality and considering the awkwardness of doing the job under the sink I would say this is a Great Deal.
