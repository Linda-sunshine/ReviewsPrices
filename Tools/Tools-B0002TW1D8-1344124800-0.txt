review/summary: Nice add-on tool productreview/text: I purchased this to use as a second set for my tool bag, I have only used them for low torque jobs but they do the job well. Mostly I am using them for driving the wall bolts for flat screen mounts, so far no problems. Love the price, thats what pushed me to buy them, and the add-on free shipping idea is great too. Would recommend for anyone needing a low torque set or back up set.
