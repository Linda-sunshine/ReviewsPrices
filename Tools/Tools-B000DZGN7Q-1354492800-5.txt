review/summary: Truly the King of garbage disposalsreview/text: I picked this up to replace the little 1/3 HP machine that was in my house.Pro: The instruction manual says "if you are going to dispose of bones, chop them up a little"--really? This thing could take a leather shoe and be OK (likely, but I wouldn't try it). I love this disposal--it takes any job I give it and comes back for more. No leaks, no clogs and it works like a dream. Also, for the price it is amazing.Con: Loud; at times we are talking about 747 loud. However, how long do you need to run this thing? Not long, so it is not an issue.Overall: Best home purchase so far... 5 stars.
