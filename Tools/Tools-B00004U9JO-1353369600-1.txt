review/summary: Great and Long Lastingreview/text: We purchased this as a replacement to the one we had put in when we built the house. That one lasted over 9 years and just recently started leaking. We figured, why not just get the same one -- so we found it on Amazon and at a great price. About 10 minutes of installation (just take the old one down and put the new one up), it was working great. We were glad that someone reminded us that the electric cord will need to be re-attached from the old one - but even that was no big deal. Great product for a low price.
