review/summary: For some reason, I like this one more than the other one.review/text: This is basically the same sharpener as the other one I bought when I put "knife sharpeners" in the Amazon search box, but that one did not work that well and I saw this one in the bottom section of recommended on an Amazon page when I was looking at something else.More than willing to try again as I saw where this product was going in the last one, and for a cheap price, I bought this one and I have loved it.A great and logical design (why not sharpen the knife where the knife is stable and the sharpener is in the hand?) that works. No more crappy stones, or blade elminating electric grinders.I would just say this, sometimes with a knife that has never been sharpened well, it will take awhile to get a blade shaped in a manner this sharpener wants. Do not drag very hard, just work it gently for awhile and it will pop out.A great product.
