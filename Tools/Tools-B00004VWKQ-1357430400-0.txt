review/summary: A Sharp Kitchen Toolreview/text: We have a set of Paula Deen knives that have never been impressively sharp. Then I decided to let the AccuSharp Sharpener work its magic on those knives. And magic it is. The difference between the sharpened and unsharpened steak knives is readily evident and impressive.The sharpener is easy to use as it glides smoothly over the knife blade. Once sharpened, the difference of the edge can be seen and felt immediately. The small expense of this sharpener was money well spent.
