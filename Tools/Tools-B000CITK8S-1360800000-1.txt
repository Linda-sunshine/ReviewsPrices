review/summary: Worked well at firstreview/text: I bought this one because I lost my first one. I used the Balck and decker model and decided to try this brand. MISTAKE.It worked well at first, but when I decided to use it a few months later to trickle charge my motorcycle battery, it wouldnt charge.I checked the fuse: GOODthe electrical power point: GOODI think the transformer inside the box some how burned out.Good: I like that it came with the different wiresBad: i used it 1x and it burned out some how.So, I bought another Black and Decker.
