review/summary: COLD WEATHER OUTLET WITH A THERMOSTATreview/text: This is a great project. I have purchased 3 last year and 1 this year to control the heat tapes and well shed heater that use to run all day and night. I have saved so much money that it paid for these items in one months time. This is highly recommended if you need to prevent pipes from freezing or need to heat a sensitive area. The built in thermostat kicks in when it gets to 35 degrees and turns off at +/-42 degrees.
