review/summary: Great Disposerreview/text: After our old Insinkerator failed several months ago, my husband shopped around for a replacement which included checking into Consumer Reports where the Waste King 8000 received its highest rating. We ordered it with free shipping from Amazon at the lowest price anywhere and it arrived a couple days sooner than expected. He installed it without much difficulty and was impressed that it had a three-prong AC cord already attached. It has a smooth sound when running and is fairly quiet &#8211; much more so than the old one. I would highly recommend the Waste King 8000 to anyone.Study the instructions before you install, see how it all the parts fit together before beginning. As with most any project of this sort, if you have no mechanical skills, get help.Finally, there are no other parts that you need to order. Everything needed is in the box.
