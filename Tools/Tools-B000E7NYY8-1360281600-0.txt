review/summary: Good but not quite perfect.review/text: The idea is great and they did a good job making it happen. You set the times and so-on like any &#34;real&#34; thermostat. But the thing that keeps the fifth star at bay is that while you can turn the heater off with a switch on the side, you can't easily override it to make the heater &#34;on&#34;. Now, you can open the window and change the temperature do do the same thing, but because it's mounted to the socket, you have to bend over to do all that (unless your socket is high). You're reading upside down, looking at small print and all. So my wife ends up unplugging it and plugging it into a live outlet. A five-star device would have a three-way switch where the third position allowed through-power IMHO.
