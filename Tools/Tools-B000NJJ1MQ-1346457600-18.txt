review/summary: Works and installs like advertisedreview/text: Had looked ar a variety of locks before deciding to try this one and am happy that I did. Instructions for operating and installing are well presented. Lock installed easily and programming was logical and simple. I have 5 different codes programmed in and they all work. Just fine. No longer necessary to hide keys outside or to give out keys to relatives and household employees. If I want to delete someone from entry, I will just change their code. This is a well designed product and I am pleased with my buying decision.
