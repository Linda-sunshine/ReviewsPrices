review/summary: LOVE THIS!!! Works great! Extremely glad I bought it!review/text: I've gone through dozens of hand pumps. I have 6 children, and am always needed to pump up a tire, or inflate a ball.How easy is it to set the compressor to the proper inflation and turn it on? It automatically stops when the correct pressure is reached.My neighbor had a flat tire on their riding mower, and couldn't find their pump. I was instantly the hero when I quickly inflated the tire to the correct pressure.I have not tried it on a car tire, but I'm glad I have this thing around.I definitely recommend this product.
