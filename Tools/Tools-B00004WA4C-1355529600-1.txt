review/summary: Infant mortality a real problemreview/text: I have had a huge problem with early failures of this unit. If they last the first couple of weeks they will work for years. I recently had to replace 3 at once due to an internal clock deciding they all had to be replaced. Since they were all installed on the same day, they all failed on the same day.I ordered replacements. Two are still working, one failed a week later. I replaced that one with another, it failed a week later. Third time may be the charm. We'll see.
