review/summary: Almost Perfectreview/text: I have used several of these with great effect venting out hot air during summer months.Pros--------------------1) Easy to use. Good solid construction. It is all plastic but extremely sturdy.2) Easy to setup and everything pretty much work as expected.3) This is the product for you if you have a multi-floor house where the top floor can get extremely toasty during summer months. Just pair this with a 16inch fan and you are set to save a few hundred bucks a year on AC costs.Cons--------------------1) Major: There is a bug in the firmware where it some times cannot correctly switch on/off the power when set temperature has been reached or not reached in override/manual mode on cool mode. Other reviewers have commented on this problem. Though I can say it's not a hardware issue but a software/firmware one. Resetting the device, unplugging it, plugging it back in, switching it to heat mode then back to cool mode, fixed this issue for me. For some reason, it can get "stuck" and become brain-dead under some situations. The company need to figure this out.2) Minor: Like most plastic items, the off-white beige shell will discolor to yellow over time. This item will be used by most in extremely hot/sun-shine prone areas. Wish the manufacture would use a better anti-aging plastic housing for their future products.Wishes--------------------1) A backlit display.2) Larger text for SET temperature. It's so small that when on the wall socket you have to bend over to read it accurately.
