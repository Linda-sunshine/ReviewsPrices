review/summary: Love this lock.review/text: I bought the kind without the knob you turn by hand and it didnt last long. I then bought this one and has lasted many years I love it. I just put in another one on back door. I see so many break ins on TV that I dont like leaving my doors unlocked even when mowing lawn because we have huge yard. I can lock door easily and dont have to worry about carrying a key. The code can be changed anytime you want and you dont have to go get new keys made.
