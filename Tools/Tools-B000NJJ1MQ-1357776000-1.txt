review/summary: Great lockreview/text: Bought this to replace a standard deadbolt that was getting harder and harder to use as it was &#34;sticky&#34; and key woundn't turn easily. I am single mom and never replaced a deadbolt before. This deadbolt is very substantial. I took my time and read the directions...also Schlage has some YouTube videos available that helped alot. I was able to install this in about 15 minutes. I found the programming to be easy and the lock works wonderfully. I really appreciate being able to run back in the house after starting the car...and not having to remove keys from the ignition. Living in FL, that helps as I can keep the AC blowing in the car especially if my dogs are with me, which they almost always are. So happy I bought this. So far my family loves it.
