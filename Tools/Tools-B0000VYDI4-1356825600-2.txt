review/summary: Outstanding ladder!review/text: This ladder sets up easily in multiple configurations. I purchased it to use for my motor-home and this ladder does not disappoint. It's compact, for what it is, and easily stores in the basement compartment. It will reach any area of the 12.5 ft tall coach. I should have purchased this ladder sooner!
