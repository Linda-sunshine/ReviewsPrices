review/summary: Fleas galorereview/text: I ordered the Victor flea traps for my elderly neighbor who has 4 cats - it was amazing to see how many fleas were trapped just in 24 hours. She has the traps upstairs and downstairs, when the sticky paper is full of those 'little beasts' she just puts in a new paper. They are well worth the money !!!
