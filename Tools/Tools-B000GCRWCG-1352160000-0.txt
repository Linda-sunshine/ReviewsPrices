review/summary: Space Blankets!review/text: Small, light, compact and useful!Comes in a pack of 10, each one is separately sealed in it's own ziplock like bag. The bags are perforated however for ventilation, or drainage if it gets soaked or whatever reason. Either way, it's very nice that they are each separately sealed so that they don't unfold and makes storage easy.
