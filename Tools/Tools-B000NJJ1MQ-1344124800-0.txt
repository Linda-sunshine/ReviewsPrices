review/summary: Love it, amazing Amazon dealreview/text: I recently purchased this because of the deal Amazon had on it. It was a gold deal last week, selling for only $80. Awesome product, I would have purchased it earlier if it was that cheap. I've locked myself out of the house many times, via my garage door being locked. It was to the point that we left a spare key in the garage. But with this keypad lock, I can always get in with out a fuss. This is also great since we have a dog, so we won't have to take keys when we go walking! I might even consider purchasing a similar lock for the garage, should my huband want it.install was easy and straight forward, took a 1/2 hr to an hour for me. my husband is out of town, so i was glad it was that eary.
