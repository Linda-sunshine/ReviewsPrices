review/summary: I waited my entire life for a flashlight like thisreview/text: IMHO, this is a near-perfect flashlight. Tough, waterproof, energy-efficient. This thing will throw a beam 100 yards, no problem. My only critique would be that it does create a "hole" in the middle of the beam if you try to spread it out wide. Other than that tiny flaw, it's spectacular.
