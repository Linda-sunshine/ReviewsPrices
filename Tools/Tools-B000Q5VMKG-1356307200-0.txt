review/summary: Fine for smaller placesreview/text: Purchased 2 new CO615 Carb Monox plug in alarms to pair with new Kidde PI2010 Dual (smoke) sensors. Works well in my 2 bdrm condo. CO level indicator is a nice feature. This combination of (2) sensors makes me feel that I'm well protected. Reco'd by Consumer Reports.
