review/summary: SOG Tactical Tomahawkreview/text: My package came today and I was thouroughly impressed with this hawk. It came razor sharp right out of the box and I immediately started to put it to the test. I have already thrown it dozens of times and I have used it to chop firewood for tonight and this hawk still is holding its edge . I don't understand the bad reviews about the handle on this hawk being bad or that the blade is dull because I have no problems so far. This is a great product for the price.
