review/summary: Love itreview/text: Just buy this one, it's fantastic. Don't just take my word, Consumer Reports listed it as a top model as well. It's cheaper than anything I could find at the local big box stores (I think there was a 1/3HP model that was priced just under this one)It was easy enough to install, it's not nearly as loud as I was expecting (Might have something to do with the fact the last one was really, really old...) and has had no issues the 2 months we've had it installed.
