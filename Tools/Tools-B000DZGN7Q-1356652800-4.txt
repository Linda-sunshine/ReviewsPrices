review/summary: Many positives, only one area that could be improvedreview/text: We always research these types of purchases and decided that this was the best available disposal for the price (really at any price). This disposal is powerful, quiet, and as stated above, much less expensive then many other of the highly rated disposals. I did the installation myself and it was straightforward. I used the old connector pipes, since this only came with an option that had an 90 degree elbow instead of a straight pipe. The old connector has worked just fine. The only issue I have with the disposal is that the mouth opening in the sink seems to be smaller than our previous disposal and the rubber guard in the opening is fairly stiff and has a narrow, so I find that I often have to force items into the disposal with a kitchen utensil. The disposal has been installed for several months with no issues and it comes with a lifetime, in-house, replacement warranty. Overall a great product.
