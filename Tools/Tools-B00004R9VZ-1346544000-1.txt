review/summary: good as expectedreview/text: We liked this flowtron. It is extremely bright but very effective. It illuminates the whole yard if you are sensitive to brightness think about getting a smaller unit. If our yard wasn't as big as what we have now we would have gone with the 40w. It kills a lot of mosquitos, so far so good we have had it for about a month now and we are satisfied.
