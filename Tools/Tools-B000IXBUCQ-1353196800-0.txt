review/summary: Great flashlight awesome edition to home toolsreview/text: It seems that maglites has fans and haters but I'm definetly a big fan. I have a family of six and in an effort to kep enough emergency flashlights for all of us a few years ago bought 6 small cheap 3 aaa flashlights and put them in a drawer for all to use when needed. Well due to the size of those lights 3 have been lost, 1 was washed in clothing and now just 2 remain.To me the best thing about these flashlights it that even in the dark they are an easy find. With a family of six and 3 kids younger than 11 they never just disappear. The durability and performance have been welcome bonuses.The 2d led light is extremely bright and if used after the incandescent light can be blindingly bright if in darkness for a while. It throws light great and can really light a whole room well.I have two 2-d led mags and two 2-d incandescent mags and find uses for both. The LEDs are great for area distant lighting such as scanning the back yard or finding thing outside. The incandescent lights are great indoors when you just need some light and need to read something without going blind. I love that maglites work without having to click the switch if my wife or kids are sleepingI own a maglite xl50 I keep bedside and other lights for edc and for our cars but it seems as great as the small tactical and pocket lights are they don't have that real tool feel the 2-d maglites have. You can find brighter lights with advanced features and modes but its worth having some lights that JUST work and you KNOW what you get every time.I recommend these for emergency and every day use. I personally keep these in the 'family' flaslight drawer since I know that if my kids or wife use them that they are too big to leave around when they are finished being used. Can't say the same about the small wonders that are easier to find these days.
