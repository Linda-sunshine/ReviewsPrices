review/summary: It's OEM and works great.review/text: As described. I Installed it in seconds. The package recommends to replace this every six months. I've had mine for approximately 18 months and it was starting to affect the water pressure wchich also affects the ice maker. I was shocked at the difference in weight when compared to the new one. The filter was obiviously doing it's job.
