review/summary: Easy to Usereview/text: I bought this Air Station inflator when it was on the daily deal so the price was good. I liked that you could either plug it in to an electrical outlet or plug it into the cigarette lighter. I've used it both ways and really couldn't tell a difference in the airflow. What I really like is that you turn a red dial to the air pressure you want and and then turn on the machine. The inflator then stops when it gets to the pre-programmed pressure. I am usually doing other things when I'm using this so it's great that I don't have to go back and forth to be sure I turn it off before it over inflates. My only complaints are that it is a bit big and I had trouble getting the cords back into place when I was done.
