review/summary: Easy to install, perfect for my needsreview/text: We got this because SOMEONE I live with is constantly forgetting their house keys. What is easier than climbing through an unlocked window wearing a floor length dress? Pushing four numbers on a keypad. We also find this very useful for dog sitters. I haven't tried to change the code, but the instructions were very easy. Great that the pad lights up. The satin nickel looks very nice on the door.
