review/summary: Good Buyreview/text: I ordered this disposer and installed it a couple of month ago, but haven't used it much. It works just fine for the small items I've put in it though. The install was easy in a sink that didn't have a disposer before. The unit is very quite compared with other disposers that I have owned. At the price I paid, I probably saved around $100, I'm happy.
