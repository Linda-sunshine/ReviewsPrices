review/summary: Perfect Little Book Lightreview/text: It's amazing how much time I can spend looking for a seemingly little thing like this book light, but I searched for days - In office supply stores, Target, even T.J. Maxx and Walgreen's. Lots of light, but nothing that would work with my first generation Kindle. I didn't really want to buy it online, because I knew it would get a lot of use and I wanted to see if it would work with my first generation Kindle. This one does. It's a little bigger than I expected it to be, but it's exactly what I needed. I love the flexible adjustment, and especially it's light weight. It gives out the perfect amount of light and works great on my Kindle, hardcover and paperback books.
