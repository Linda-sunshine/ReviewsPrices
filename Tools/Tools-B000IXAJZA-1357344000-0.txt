review/summary: It does not look Grayreview/text: Very bummed out on this purchase. My husband wanted a LED maglite for xmas. It looks nothing like the photo. The flashlight looks purple. It functions great with a bright light, but he keeps making fun of me that i bought him a &#34;purple&#34; flashlight. Dont choose this color.
