review/summary: Two great features!review/text: I want to be honest in saying I don't own this particular compressor. But I have had a lot of experience with several brands of these portable devices and I can tell you that this unit has two great features: 1. The ability to use both home AC wall plug-in and 12v car adapter. This makes the device much more useful in the home/garage. The second feature is the clamp style valve attachment vs a more common screw on type. This makes a huge difference in an emergency situation. That is reason enough to pass on units that don't have it. The last thing you want to be doing on the side of the road is trying to inflate your tire in the first place--but you certainly don't need the added frustration of trying to thread the inflation nozzle onto the valve stem (Murphy's Law--in the dark!).
