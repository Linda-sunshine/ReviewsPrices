review/summary: Cheap Cheap Cheapreview/text: Bought this for my father for Christmas. It looks like a heavy duty set in the picture. Should have read the desription better or something. Very plasticy and cheaply made tools. They get the job done but I had to go buy more christmas presents so it didn't look like I was insulting him by just getting this. Thought it was a steal because of the price but once I got it it wasn't even worth that price.
