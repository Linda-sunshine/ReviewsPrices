review/summary: Worth the price!review/text: Bought this to use with my books such as the Game of Thrones series. The LED light is bright and the flexible neck comes in handy. Isn't too heavy so any hardback book will work fine, or for paperbacks just attach it to a chapter or so worth of pages. What I've actually done is clip it to my headboard and use it as a sort of lamp. Definitely worth the money so far!
