review/summary: Great product, VERY enlighteningreview/text: This product made me feel like a kid again. After I got it I was running all over the house seeing how much electricity stuff was using. I am AMAZED at how much power some stuff pulls that you would never expect! I know most electronics consume power even when turned off (standby power) however I was quite surprise at how much! For example, my PC system pulls 30 watts even when it is completely shut down! I added a surge protector to it and now switch the power completely off when I'm not using it. My fairly small 7 foot pre-lit &#34;slim&#34; Christmas tree pulls 350 WATTS!!! Just from the mini white lights that came on it. I didn't even add extra lights. My Scentsy candle warmer/air freshener pulls 20 watts when plugged in and running. Consdering that a 60 watt equivalent CFL light bulb only pulls 11 watts, having my Christmas tree lights on is comparable to having 31 lamps on! I'll be switching to LED xmas lights next year. Overall just a great product and an essential tool to combat wasted energy. Couldn't be without one of these now.
