review/summary: Best Surge Protector in the World!review/text: I purchased two of these for the computer lab where I work. The extra-long cord keeps them flat on the floor (compared to others with short cords that end up suspended in the air). More importantly, with twelve outlets, I can plug in several machines at once--a must in a computer lab!
