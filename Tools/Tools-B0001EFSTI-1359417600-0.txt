review/summary: Very handyreview/text: I take this multi-tool with me everywhere on my key chain and everyone is always so intrigued when I pull it out to use it. I would say that on average I use it 2-3 times per week and for a $5-6 value, that is great. It is no bigger than any other key on my ring and it has many useful functions. The only downside is that it can be hard to handle at times when you need torque due to its slim nature and design. Outside of that though it works great and has never fallen off my keys. Just remember to take it off before going to the airport!
