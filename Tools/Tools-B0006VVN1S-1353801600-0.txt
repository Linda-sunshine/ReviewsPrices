review/summary: Must Have for Eczema/Allergy Sufferers!review/text: I live in NYC so the water here is pretty harsh and filled with chemicals. If you are prone to skin allergies/eczema like I am, you may have to consider the reality that it may be the water coming out of your shower that is causing the problem. I have been to allergist after allergist. They all tried to figure out what was the cause of my skin allergies but couldn't quite pinpoint it. I started to consider that maybe it was the water coming out of my tap. I decided to order this showerhead and let me tell you the difference! My rashes have completely disappeared. My skin and my hair is softer. Its a huge HUGE difference from before. This is honestly a MUST HAVE for anyone suffering any skin problems such as myself. It will improve your skin drastically.
