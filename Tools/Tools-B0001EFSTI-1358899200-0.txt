review/summary: Versatile, small size, durable.review/text: The small size of this tool is great. I have not seen any others this small and versatile. The tool clicks closed on a key ring and stays there - it will not open by itself and fall off. I use this pretty frequently to open packages with the knife, or to work the screws on a computer case or gadget.
