review/summary: So warm.review/text: I never realized how warm these things can get. The only down side to this product is that it is easily torn, but it does keep your body warm in those days. Well another downside is if you are afraid of how you look with it on, yeah.. not the best sight out there, but hey, staying warm is a lot better than looking good and being cold, or is it?
