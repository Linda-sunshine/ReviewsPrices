review/summary: This works - Less work, a smaller door than the Live 2-door trapreview/text: There is a great review for this product that helped me tremendously. It talked about why the trap may not work (there's cleaning you need to do after each &#34;trap&#34;) I used this product in conjuntion with the live trap (Havahart 1020). We caught more with the Havahart but that may be because:1. I didn't want to kill them at first2. The &#34;doors&#34; are more open and are easier to get into3. We had the Havahart for about 2 weeks (?) before we got this Victor M2524 trapHaving said that, I like the Victor M2524 Electronic Mouse Trap better. There's a finality to it. (I do like them all working together to get as many as possible!)I think that the &#34;trap and release&#34; is great, but I don't want the mice to come back. That was a worry of mine. We took the mice out to the edge of the woods, but I didn't trust that the mice couldn't find their way back to the warmth of our house. So we got this trap and killed them (sadly, because they're so cute ... but it's OUR house and OUR investment!)We still have the traps (two Victors and one Havahart) and we're leaving them out where we initially found the first field mouse. We went from trapping 5 a night to nothing in 2 weeks. I HOPE (knock wood) that we got all the mice and the mice babies.I trust myself more than a pest control expert. I'm still open to calling someone, but I think we're done a GREAT job with these two traps. I highly recommend. And with this one, read the long one on the cleaning. It's awesome! And there's nothing wrong with using more than one kind of trap.GOOD LUCK! :-)
