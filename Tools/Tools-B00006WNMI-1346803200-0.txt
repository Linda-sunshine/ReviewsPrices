review/summary: This thing is amazing. BUY IT.review/text: I have gone through them all. Brita, Pur, etc... and all their models. This one is BY FAR superior.I live in a town that literally has the nastiest water... i have to have a filter on my shower too because the water smells SO bad and it gives me red leopard-type spots for an hour or so after i take a shower. Gross water. Even my dishwasher makes my dishes smell like nasty fish, and i dont even eat seafood so how does that happen? Its an apartment, so im not investing any money on fixing anything here... good news is we will be moving come summer 2013.Anyways, i put this thing on today and i am AMAZED at how much it filters out. I can literally pour a cup of water and i smell NOTHING. NOT A THING. Brita or any of the others i cannot say the same for. They were good filters, but they dont even come close to comparing.I actually drank a glass of water from the sink, and i am 1. still alive and 2. i have not turned green... so this thing has to either be magic or it does EXACTLY what its supposed to do.I just got it and installed it today (which literally took me 17 seconds to do) so i cannot comment on the longevity, but i will update because i like this product so much.It does not leak, and the little spicket works perfectly. Turn the water on, pull the spicket out, get your filtered water, turn off the sink... little spicket goes back in on its own. Beautiful! And its not big... its smaller than the ugly brita or pur ones.BUY THIS THING!
