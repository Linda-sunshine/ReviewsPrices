review/summary: Was good until it wasn't - and then their warranty deserves no stars.review/text: For all I know, it probably was doing it's job, or it never was truly tested. And then it was tested, with pretty strong lightning storm.I was not able to disconnect my home theater system in time to protect it from any electrical surges, which is what I always advise folks to do. In this case, though I had the thought that the Belkin would protect it just in case.Well it didn't. It blew my Yamaha Receiver (a RX-V 661) and my PS3. The Yamaha cannot be repaired by even an authorized repair tech since Yamaha do not carry the spares any more for this 4 year old box, and the PS3 will be repaired by Sony for a price. A steep one, but still, they will take care of it.So now, I followed Belkin's Warranty Claims Return policy down to the letter, which is substantial with the receipts of all things involved, within two weeks, etc etc.Just got a letter from them saying, they checked it. Nothing wrong with their device (in more detail of course), so warranty claims are denied. Easy for them to do that, and the worst part is, now I am out of another item (my so called surge protector) that I paid for. No way to dispute them, now, can I?To them - if you are reading this - have some integrity. Why do you think my receiver and PS3 stopped working? Honor your warranty to some, if not the full extent. And yes, do send back the item I sent you, or send me the cash equivalent.To all others, avoid this stupid company. I know they are big and cheap. But there are a of nicer players in the market, and some of them stand behind their product and words, 100%. Like Tripp Lite, which is what I switched to, all of my surge protectors. Pay a bit more, and buy quality.
