review/summary: Pleasantly Surprisedreview/text: I had a 4 month reaction to high chlorine levels in our city water. I was breaking out like never before the day after every chlorination, from my forehead to my belly button. I tried everything from bottled water, other face washes, to medication from my doctor.Eventually, I purchased this to see if it would work. It did. Within two weeks, most of the reaction was gone and no new "breakouts" to be seen. I couldn't smell the chlorine in my water anymore, I wasn't dry when the cold weather hit and no more reactions.I don't normally post raving reviews, especially on skin related products since skin is different on everyone, but for me, it solved a serious problem.
