review/summary: Great Productreview/text: This was purchased for a friend as a gift. I do personally own a schlage link starter kit which I pay the yearly fee of $99.99 for online service. I own the lever lock but have operated his deadbolt lock and it is also nice design. Nexia Home Intelligence now owns the online services and always update devices, online page, and software to keep up with the changing electronic world. I would suggest this to anyone for your personal home but is definately nice for a vacation home with monitoring the HVAC system, locks, and motion sensors for guests or whoever else. No key to leave somewhere or hand off, just change the lock code for who is going to be there that week. These make life easy because I hate carrying around keys and this is one less I need to carry.
