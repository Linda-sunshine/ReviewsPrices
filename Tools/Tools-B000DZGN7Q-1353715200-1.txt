review/summary: Eats everythingreview/text: I adore this thing. It tears through anything that goes down it. I've had it over a year and have NEVER had it lock up on my. I used to have a badger brand that seemed to lock up on something at least once a week. I've ACCIDENTALLY fed it some bones and plastic silverware, it didn't even hiccup. lolMost of the complaints I've seen are about the installation aspect. I can't comment on that as I hired a handyman to install it for me. He didn't seem to have any problems though. Took about an hour to rip out the old one and put in the new one. It is considerably bigger than the old one. You'll definitely want to measure to make sure your cabinet space allows for the monster.Based on bad experiences with other brands, this thing is amazing. As I said earlier, it has never gotten stopped up on anything. I have a family of 5, so it gets quite a work out each day. I think it was about $100 shipped when I bought it. Well worth it.
