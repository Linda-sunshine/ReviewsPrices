review/summary: Death To The Fleas!review/text: Just like prior reviews, it's the afterlife for the fleas! My spouse & I notice the cats were scratching less and the flea comb is getting less. Soon as we set up four of the traps in our home, within an hour they were hopping right in. That was after carpet cleaning, and using Bleach and Soap on the bare floors. One cat parked herself next to the light, and it was like the &#34;Roach Motels&#34; they check in, but they don't leave. Don't care what anyone else says, the proof is in the traps! Good product and money well spent.
