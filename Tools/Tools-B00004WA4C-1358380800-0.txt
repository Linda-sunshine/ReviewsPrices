review/summary: Great smoke alarm, *very* sensitivereview/text: This thing is a great alarm...but its very very sensitive. It often goes off when I fire up the oven just from the small amount of smoke that the oven can sometimes generate.I am confident it would warn me in a real fire as early as possible.
