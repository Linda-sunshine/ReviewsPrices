review/summary: Well made. good fitreview/text: These may not be the best gloves for heavy outdoor work or dealing with prickly briars in the field because the fabric doesn't offer great protection in some areas. They are, though, well made with good seams, flexible cut, and extra padding over areas that get a lot of wear.
