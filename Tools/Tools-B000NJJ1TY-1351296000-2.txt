review/summary: Convenience and Stylereview/text: Schlage has done a good job with this product. Installed about a month ago and it works as advertised. Installation is quite simple, just be careful to route the wires to avoid pinching them. The device that is supposed to hold the lock to keep it from falling out of the door while you install it is weak. I would suggest a little blue masking tape to hold it securely because you wouldn't want to bounce test your expensive new lock. This is installed on the garage door. Now I don't have to remember to bring the key to get into the garage. I would leave it unlocked, the wife would lock it, etc. That problem is entirely solved with this very stylish lockset.
