review/summary: Black & Decker Air Station not so goodreview/text: I bought this being a fan of past Black & Decker products. They typically have very nice features and overall clean designs. This was no different so I bought it. It worked initially but after about a months use it died. I ended up returning it. First time I had issue with a new product from B&D. I then bought a differnt model AS1500 from Black & Decker which is not quite as intuitive to operate, but does work and works well. I would recommend that model instead of this one.
