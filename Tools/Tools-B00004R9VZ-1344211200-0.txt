review/summary: I can finally sit outside again!!review/text: We have 3 acres with a creek and woods - summer time is hard for me because when i go outside it is like ringing the dinner bell for any mosquito in the state!After putting this about 10 yards away from the back deck and plugging it in, it has been wonderful!! I can even walk around and not be bothered!!
