review/summary: Not as... awesome as it looks?review/text: IT's a white thing on the floor with a sticky pad and a lamp.I think any red neck with some duct tape and half a brain could have created this.It works... kind of... but collects more lint and dust than fleas.It's not the ultimate flea trap, it's like... The ghetto thing your friends ask you about, as to what you have on the floor there...I just say it's a night light for my dog.
