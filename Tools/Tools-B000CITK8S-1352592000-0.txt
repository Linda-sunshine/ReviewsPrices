review/summary: Love this charger.review/text: I have three of these chargers. I use one for my two motorcycles with pigtails installed on each one and alternate. I use one for my two cars that I leave in the garage and alternate and I bought this one to connect to my wife's van to keep her battery topped off, since she only uses it about once a week.
