review/summary: Nice flashlightreview/text: Well it's a Mag-lite so that speaks for it's self. I have a large lot and wanted to be able to see the back of the lot from my house. All I had before was the small Mag-lite that uses 2 AA batteries. So I bought this hoping it would throw out enough light to see the back fence. Well after I got it I went outside that night and WOW. I could have went with the 2 D battery one. This throws out a lot of light. Very nice. Plus I can always use it for protection. LOL It's heavy duty.
