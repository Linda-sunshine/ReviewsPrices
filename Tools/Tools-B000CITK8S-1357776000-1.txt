review/summary: Best charger on the marketreview/text: I have been using the Battery Tender Jr. For three years now, I leave one on my MC all winter and it keeps my battery charged and ready to go, that battery is 6 years of age now and still going strong, I also use one for the battery in my Ion Tailgater Speaker system, and this summer I bought a Honda PCX 150 Scooter and now using the Latest purchase of my 3rd Tender Jr on that..When you get yours, you will notice the high quality of this unit, you get two cables for different connections, and they are fused with the latest fuse technology..how great is that...Ozzy in Ohio
