review/summary: No more frozen pipesreview/text: I purchased this thermostat so I wouldn't have to keep my pump house light on all the time or run up when the temp was projected to go below freezing and cut it on. Put a small electric heater in the pump house and connected it through this device. Have had no more frozen pipes since.Farm Innovators TC-3 Cold Weather Thermo Cube Thermostatically Controlled Outlet - On at 35-Degrees/Off at 45-Degrees
