review/summary: Will make you feel as a modern day native American....review/text: Tomahawks were missing on my collection of all sorts of weapons, so I've decided to go with this SOG.Very pleased. Nice construction, sturdy, used it to throw, chop some wood, went thru a couple of car doors and hoods (no, they were not attached to the car!!!), and abused it for a while, and it survived flawlessly.I'm getting another, just for redundancy principle...:)
