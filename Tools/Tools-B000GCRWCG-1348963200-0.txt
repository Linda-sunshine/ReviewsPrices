review/summary: Decent Plan Breview/text: Grab a few or a bunch for the Jeep or overnight bag or the cellar for emergency.Being cold is needless in our days thanks to mummybags and marathon race silvery cellophane-y bags like this deal.A ten pack is perfect for 1, 2 or 3 folks max.Give one for each foot and one for the core temp, trunk of the body-- wrap in a mummy bag or parka.It will get you through the night or the ordeal on a temp basis.Worth the short money. For sure."Winter is coming," as the Number One Rated HBO series of All Time says.
