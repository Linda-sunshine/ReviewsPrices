review/summary: Great Plug Layout!review/text: I bought this surge protector for three features. (1) It was really low profile and (2) Belkin arranged the plugs to allow you to use both normal power cables and transformers into it very neatly. (3) Long cord for the protector itself. When I got it, I was very happy with it and haven't had any issues with it.
