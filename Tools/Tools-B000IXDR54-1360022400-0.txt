review/summary: i love maglitereview/text: solid, quality product that is just a joy to use. i also have a dozen super-cheap new small led flashlights, which i like cause now i have a flashlight whenever i want one right there, but they just aren't as pleasant to use as this one, not reliable and sturdy like a maglight, plus the adjustable focus on this is great. excited also about the projected battery life compared to my 10-yr old incandescent version of this.
