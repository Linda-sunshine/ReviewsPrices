review/summary: Die bugs die!review/text: Lately I've been getting a large amount of flea bites thanks to my pet cat and I was late on taking action to kill the fleas. Now they're everywhere and life is not good.I just received the trap today and can't wait to see if start trapping fleas.****Updated 10/04/2012****I heard that most fleas have a greater attraction to green light more than the regular yellow light. I'm going to go buy a 7 watt green bulb and see if I can increase the effectiveness of this trap and hopefully catch more fleas.****Update 10/10/2012*****Well apparently I didn't have such a big infestation as I thought I had. I got maybe around 10 fleas in the trap along with some other bugs so this items works pretty well. No more flea bites so all is good...for now
