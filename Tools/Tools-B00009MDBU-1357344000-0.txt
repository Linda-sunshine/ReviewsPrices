review/summary: Interesting gadgetreview/text: I think this gadget has potential for being useful. I was curious about the wattage use of various items and the first one I wanted to try was two strings of Christmas lights to see what kind of electric use they took. That was when I discovered first problem. Tree lights were in back of the tree and since once unplugged this unit does not maintain its display (having no battery backup) nor does it have a backlight on its display I had to use flashlight and crawl at awkward angle to get to see the display. Turns out using 0.03 KWh by the way. So based on my using 4 sets of two strings each of these on tree, mantle, outside, etc. using them 6 hours a day for 30 days of the season looking at roughly 20 Kwh of use which is less than I expected. Next season will use the lights more as a result of knowing this does not use much power.Unfortunately I have a lot of appliances I would like to test that are also in awkward positions. Maybe someone has an answer to this and if so would appreciate a comment. Other than lack of backlight for display and difficulty seeing when plugged in to hard to get to location the unit seems to work well. Just received it yesterday so after further testing will add to my review especially noting the comments about some units failing from other reviewers. I note that in the picture of the product it seemed to show an extension cord but that was not included in the unit but that may be the answer for dealing with hard to reach areas. If you want to test a stove, washer, dryer, humidifier, etc. without easy access to the wall socket you will need an extension cord or perhaps some lessons in yoga!Should also note that this unit is three prong so for those without three prong sockets you will need an adapter to use this in the wall.
