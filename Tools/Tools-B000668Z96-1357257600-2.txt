review/summary: it really works......use at night in a dark room.review/text: within a week, out of nowhere, fleas had invaded my couch. I looked around the internet trying to find a solution to this problem. I was considering buying one of those "fog bombs" for the room that spray up pesticide to the ceiling. I then reconsidered, having read the reviews of the flea trap option by Victor.simple premise: the heat and light attract the fleas. The fleas jump into the container to be near the light, where they land on sticky paper and die.I tried it last night and this morning found approximately 10 fleas trapped. That was just one night. I plan on using it for a week straight and then update this review. One thing I would recommend: use the trap only at night while you are sleeping, AND make sure the room where you place the trap is totally dark. Trap doesn't really work during the day because day-light fills the room.also what worked for me is to lightly spray the flea infested area with Lysol. The Lysol kills some of the fleas, and you will notice a difference immediately.update: 1-17-13. well, here it is about 2 weeks later. Now my trap is FILLED with fleas. I didn't count every single one because there were so many. At least 50 fleas. Not only that, but it also trapped 4 flys as well, and several ants. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone at this point.
