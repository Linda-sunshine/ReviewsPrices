review/summary: I got the 12 foot one ...review/text: I don't know any house that has enough outlets, and ours has one room where the outlets are particularly unhandy. So, when I saw the 12 foot one on a cybermonday deal here on Amazon, I jumped at the chance. I just wish they had let me purchase more at that price!It does everything we want it to do. It runs 12 feet, and even more, it has a hanger section on the back where you can hang it on the wall (we needed to). The outlets are nicely designed. We are not using the coaxial protection, for us this was simply a wonderful (low-cost) way of bringing outlets to a different area of the room.Since this is in our granddaughter's room, I especially appreciated the fact that this had the safety covers. The actual outlet sits behind her bed, and the right angle of the plug was very nice because it sits flat against the wall.All in all a well organized power strip. I appreciate that it is also a surge protector.
