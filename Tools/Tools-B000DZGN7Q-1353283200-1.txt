review/summary: Great Disposal-Quiet Operation, Easy Installationreview/text: Nice disposal with quality that is apparent the moment you plug it in. Instead of my entire counter shaking when I turn on the garbage disposal, I'm now greeted by a low hum that disguises the fact that I have this beast mounted under the sink. Maybe its been a while since I replaced a garbage disposal, but I don't remember my last one having a power cord included or having such an easy mounting system. The new quick release mounting is ridiculously easier that the older mount found on my dead badger. I haven't tried throwing anything too big down this thing yet, but it makes short work of my regular household food waste.
