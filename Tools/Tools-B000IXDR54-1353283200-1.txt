review/summary: A flashlight like I haven't seen beforereview/text: This is the best flashlight that I have seen. Over the years I have used many flashlights that are illuminated by both bulb and LED. This one is far brighter and illuminates further than all of them, for a great price. In the wake of hurricane Sandy, I purchased several different brands and types of flashlights, based on different charging/powering modalities and only those with high reviews, so as to be prepared for the next blackout. This flashlight is so bright that I joke to those around me that I can start burning ants with it or that it might burn my house down. These are positives of having a well made MagLite that exceeded my expectations of a similar but older bulb model MagLite I have from years ago. I wish I had this a month ago.There are two downsides of this flashlight. For one it is very tall and heavy and secondly it requires three (3) D-cell batteries. In part these cons work hand in hand to provide the heft of the device but in the end I understand why it is necessary to require three of these large batteries to supercharge this flashlight.In summary, if you don't mind spending the ~$25 for the flashlight and another $5 for the batteries to have a single quality flashlight with a wide blazing beam (which I should note is comparable if not cheaper than heavy and cumbersome lantern-type flashlights which are less bright) then this is the one to get.
