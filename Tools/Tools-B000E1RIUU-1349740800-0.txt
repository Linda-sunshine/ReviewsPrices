review/summary: No mice yetreview/text: To date I haven't caught a mouse in this trap. So it's hard to judge it. The first night I set it out along with two d-Con traps and immediately caught a mouse in one of those. Hard to think there is only one single mouse in a place but don't know for sure. I still am leaving this trap down and hoping if there are any more of the little critters in the house they will find their way to it and be gone. It appears to be well made and easy to set up. After reading other comments I started out with a very small amount of peanut butter. Since then have checked and have added a tiny bit more to see if that will attract them - so far nothing yet.
