review/summary: Simple, Highly Effective Tap Water Filter Systemreview/text: The CULLIGAN FM-15RA LEVEL 3 FAUCET FILTER installs quickly on your kitchen faucet, and is highly effective at filtering your tap water. My local city reservoir gets occasional algae blooms, and the result is bad-smelling, bad-tasting, discolored--but safe to drink--tap water. The Culligan faucet filter removes the bad smell, taste, and color, so that the tap water is sparkling clean again.After you buy the basic kit and install the filter system, you only need to replace the filter cartridges (about every two months; seeCulligan FM-15RA Level 3 Faucet Filter Replacement Cartridge). The Amazon price for this filtration kit and for the replacement cartridges is usually lower than the price in my local stores. Also, the local stores usually carry only the faucet mounting kits, not the replacement cartridges alone.
