review/summary: I love this item!review/text: I have used this Victor Flea Trap for years in my dog grooming shop. I was known for not having fleas get on other dogs from the ones that did have fleas. That's a good reputation to have. I used it daily and nightly for years there and now I use it since I live on the coast. It's always warm even in winter and even with the vet recommended products, I still have them in my yard. I also treat my yard with granules every 3 months, but you just still have them. I got this to put in the house to make sure that I don't get an infestation. This works great and I love it. I would recommend it to everyone with a pet.
