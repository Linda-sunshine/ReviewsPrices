review/summary: Flowtron 80 watt bug zapperreview/text: Give this product 5 starts. have had it for about 2 months. works much better than Stinger brand. It is worth the extra money. Went through 3 Stinger brand one's in 2 years. The Flowtron appears to be built much better. Also unlike the Stinger one that I had to clean out every couple days this one is self cleaning. Havn't had to clean it yet it just cleans its't self. If you are considering the Stinger DONT BUY IT peace of crap. Added a timer to the flowtron to start at dusk and it works great.
