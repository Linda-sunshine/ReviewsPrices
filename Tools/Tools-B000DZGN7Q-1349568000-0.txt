review/summary: Easy installreview/text: We installed the L-8000 about a month ago and it is working great. It is a lot quieter than our previous model. Installation was a breeze and the kit came with everything you need to install. Just make sure to account for the difference in the drop below the sink for the new drain if replacing a 1/2hp or a smaller model. The L-8000 was about an inch further below our sink than our Badger 1/2hp as far as the drain but overall length was about the same. We had no clearance issues during install.
