review/summary: Schlage vs. Kwikset (Schlage Wins)review/text: The Schlage lock is much nicer than the Kwikset SmartCode Lock. Here are some reasons why it is better.1.) The Schlage lock has NO motor. When I first bought the Kwikset I thought that the motor was an advantage. I was wrong. If it is going to only last 2 months then what is the point.2.) The Schlage key backup cylinder is more secure than Kwikset Smartkey, due to the product called the Kwik Torque Tool, by major manufacturing. It is just as easy to open the Kwikset with the Kwik torque tool as using the key. The only weak link with Schlage is that it is not bump proof. Yeah, Kwikset claims to be Grade 1 Security but that is a bunch of crap.3.) Schlage has better construction. Since schlage uses all metal construction, I am sure it will last longer than a Kwikset, which has a plastic construction on the inside, but is metal on the outside.4.) Schlage uses a more solid bolt. The bolt on the Kwikset feels like it is hallow and if the door got kicked in it would break off.5.) The Kwikset is very loud. You can hear it from the second floor. Sometimes, the motor gets jammed and it makes this really loud beep and wakes everyone in the house up if they are asleep. The schlage on the other hand, you can't even hear the beep from the inside, so no one is awoken.Now, enough about how good the schlage is, lets talk about the Kwikset1.) The Kwikset locks with the press of a button from the exterior, but it is the motor that allows this. The motor will break after a month or two.2.) Using the key is easier because it is not all disoriented.Now that I weigh the Pro's and Cons I personally choose Schlage hardware for any door. It tends to be higher quality and I recommend it.Product Links BelowThis Product:Schlage BE365VCAM619 Camelot Keypad Deadbolt, Satin NickelKwikset Keypad Deadbolt:Kwikset 909 11P SMT CP SmartCode Single Cylinder Deadbolt Featuring SmartKey, Venetian Bronze
