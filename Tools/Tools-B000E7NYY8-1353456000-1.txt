review/summary: NOT AS DESCRIBEDreview/text: First off, let me start by saying this is a cool and innovative product. However, if you have an abnormal sleep schedule like me, (which is like 2:00 AM-7:00 AM)and you want to keep your room warm until 2:00AM when you go to bed forget about it. For the night setting it only lets you go to like 11:45pm and then that's it. You can make it go to 2:00AM if you go backwards on the buttons all the way to the AM times but then when you go to save it glitches out the whole program and you have to start over. Its hard to explain, but if you don't believe me buy it and return it as i did for the same reason, just trying to save someone the hassle. Let me reiterate this is not as described, you don't just get the freedom to choose whatever times you like. While it may benefit the masses of lemmings that work 9-5s and go to bed at 8pm, forget it if your a night owl.
