review/summary: Well worth the price!review/text: Given the price of these Power Extension Socket Bits I was very skeptical about the quality of the product. However, once I received them I was very surprised on how great and sturdy they are. I purchased other brands (Dewalt and Makita) and they weren't any better than these bits, just way more expensive. Granted, I still have to put these bits to some heavy use, but for now they are fantastic. For that price, you can't go wrong.
