review/summary: Battery Tender Juniorreview/text: I now have three of these and keep one connected to each of my motorcycle batteries at all times. I disconnect them only when I am going to ride. As soon as I return my motorcycle to the garage, I connect the battery tender back up. I have not had to buy a new battery since I started using a battery tender on my motorcycles.
