review/summary: Flowtron BK-15D Electronic Insect Killer, 1/2 Acre Coveragereview/text: This item was purchased for use in Florida after TS Debbie dropped more than 20 inches of rain. Poultry and livestock were completely devestated by mosquitoes. This "zapper" worked great. So great in fact that it had to be manually cleaned 3x/daily. Would recommend this to anyone. My recommendation would be to buy two if you have a full half+ acre. One placed at each end is amazing in its efficiency.
