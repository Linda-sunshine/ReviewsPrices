review/summary: Easy to use, just don't turn product up to change filterreview/text: I had to get another unit because after 5 months I was changing the filter again and turned the item up to see the bottom better. It is not suppose to turn that way. I cracked the piece and small stream of water shot up into the air when I would try to use it. Aside from my rough housing the product, it is easy to use, and easy to remember when to change the filters with subscribe and save. The water tastes good and I am happy with this product.
