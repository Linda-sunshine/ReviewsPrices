review/summary: Waste disposer replacementreview/text: Replaced identical model. Easy install, left previous sink drain in place and installed existing electric cord and drain lines. Don't forget to punch out plug for dishwasher drain. Seems to be quieter than the older 1/3 HP model in main house. Great price and received in just a few days.
