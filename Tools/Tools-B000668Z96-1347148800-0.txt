review/summary: You Get What You Pay Forreview/text: For $12.92 I did not expect much and that is exactly what I got - not much. I had been using a small bowl of water with a few drops of liquid soap that I placed under a night light and changed every few days. Nothing wrong with this method except that I thought it would be nice if I only had to do something every 3 - 4 weeks as claimed by Victor. As expected, the flea trap is made of about one or two cents worth of very thin plastic. There are two parts to the trap. The bottom part is for installing the sticky pad. Good luck with that. The top part holds the night light. Placing the top onto the bottom leaves it somewhat cock-eyed due to lame construction. I placed the trap on the floor away from my dog's reach and plugged in the power cord. The small bulb gives out a surprisingly bright light for its size. The word in the local flea community is "stay away from this bright light because you may accidently step on a sticky pad". The fleas in this area all heeded that advice.I decided that I would go back to using a bowl of soapy water for a couple of reasons. First, the fleas do not want to step on the sticky pad. Secondly, it makes for a very poor night light because of the brightness and because it is more bulky with the trap and the cord than a regular night light that just plugs into a socket. If this would have worked it would be a good deal. The cost of the plastic is probably a couple cents, at most, plus a few more cents for the cord and bulb and then there is the cost of the boat ride over here from China. Add in the two discs that are included and you have a potential flea solution for a very good price. The problem is that it does not work for me.
