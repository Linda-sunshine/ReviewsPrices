review/summary: Don't be without onereview/text: Simple to install, just plug it in. The batteries go under the LED in front of the unit. You open the battery compartment by pulling the cover out and down, from the top front. I recommend this product. Carbon Monoxide can kill you, you won't see it coming, hear or smell it.
