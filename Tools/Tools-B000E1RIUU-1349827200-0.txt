review/summary: So disappointed...review/text: I bought two of these almost 2 months ago. I really wanted something that wouldn't make the mice suffer, I just want them gone. And for the price I expected to get my $56's worth. I followed the directions exactly and even read through all the tips on the reviews. I haven't caught a single mouse with them. I finally went to walmart and bought some upgraded plastic snap traps, 3 for around $4, and caught 6 in the first two days. I'm so upset that I spent so much on a useless product.
