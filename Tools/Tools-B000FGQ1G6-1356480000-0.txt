review/summary: great!review/text: It has everything mentioned in a great package! its hard to tell by the picture, but the box itself is pretty small. Roughly 7x3 inches. The screwdriver feels very solid with a nice rubber grip. The red thing at the end spins freely. The magnet that locks the bit in is strong. Each bit is labeled. clever and functional locking slider to keep the whole case shut. The best value you can buy!
