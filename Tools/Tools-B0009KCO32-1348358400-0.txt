review/summary: Much better than the knock-offsreview/text: About a year ago, I bought a cheaper version of this screen. Since I have never had one of these screens before, I didn't know what to expect and I had no basis for comparison. But I know that I was not happy with the cheap version.I decided to give the Bug Off Instant Screen a chance because of the good reviews. The short story is this: Bug Off is a far superior screen.The adjustable bar for hanging the screen works very well: it especially allows you to adjust the screen so that it perfectly covers the door opening at the top and bottom--an obvious advantage for crawling and jumping insects (I always used to get crickets in the house because they would squeeze through the bottom of the screen and the floor). The magnets are strong, and the velcro fasteners (which I am not using) are well placed.This may not be the perfect solution, but for $43 (the 48" version), it sure beat buying a retractable screen for $400.
