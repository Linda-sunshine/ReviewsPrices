review/summary: Easy to installreview/text: I used a different brand as my first faucet filter, even though it has a reminder that turns red when it's time to change the replacement cartridge, but the switch from regular water to filtered was so tight that I almost had to force it to switch each time. The switch broke off after less than a year, the whole unit had to be thrown away. Unfortunately I still had brand new replacement cartridges which I wouldn't know what to do with. I'm glad I don't have similar problems with Culligan,it's quite easy to use and the switch is just an easy pull of the little knob that bounces back automatically when turning off the water. I'm happy with it.
