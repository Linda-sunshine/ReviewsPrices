review/summary: Rubber Stopper not the best.review/text: The disposal works well and is extremely quiet. We are very pleased. My husband installed it with ease. The only part that's irritating is the rubber stopper in the sink that split after a few uses. The stopper also doesn't allow for much water or food in which to pass freely on its own, so we are constantly opening the rubber flaps by hand.
