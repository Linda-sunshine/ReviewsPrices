review/summary: Drain on disposal is low..review/text: The reviews on this product were good and I have not had any operational issues with the disposal. However, I did have an installation issue. The drain port on this unit is lower than the ISE disposal that I replaced by close to an inch. I had to rework my drain plumbing to accomodate the lower drain exit from this unit. I was able rework the plumbing well enough to work but I was not able to get positive drain flow from the unit to the trap. It is tipped slightly up hill going to the trap which isn't good. I can't lower the trap any further - it is also tilted slightly uphill going into the wall. If you have an undermount double sink like I do, you may have the same problem.
