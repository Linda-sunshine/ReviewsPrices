review/summary: docbarnhillreview/text: i have had the non- LED version over the years,but this light far exceeds my expectations.. i have both the two D cell and the three D cell version of the LED Mag-lite and both light up the night for up to one quarter mile...would even be good for spot lighting deer ect. for all you hunters!!!
