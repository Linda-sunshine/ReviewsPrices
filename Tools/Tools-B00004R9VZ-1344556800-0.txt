review/summary: never so disappointedreview/text: After reading the glowing reviews on the Flowtron Insect Killer I was so sure it would work that I threw away the box and plugged it in. It worked for three days and died. When I say it worked, I mean it lit up and made a humming sound but it never killed even one insect, fly or bug. Never so disappointed.
