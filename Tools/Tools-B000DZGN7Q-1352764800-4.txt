review/summary: Outstanding garbage disposalreview/text: With a one horsepower electric motor, its performance has been exceptional. It has the power to crush everything in its path (i.e., vegetables, small chicken bones, etc.) It's remarkable. It was easy to install, as well. The only improvement I would make is for Waste King, the manufacturer, to include a switch so that I can turn it on and off.
