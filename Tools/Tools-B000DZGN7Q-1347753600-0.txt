review/summary: Works perfectly, easy to installreview/text: I replaced a "builder grade" Insinkerator Badger with this unit. This is the first time I ever replaced a disposer; after watching a few Youtube videos I was able to tackle this project. Install took about 45 minutes and was painless. The only thing to keep in mind is the unit comes with a 3 prong plug attached. I removed the plug and hard wired the unit but in hindsight I would have liked to install an outlet under the sink. The unit works flawlessly and I am glad I purchased it.
