review/summary: Excellentreview/text: I love this tire inflator/air compressor. I bought mine 2 years ago. I've used it several times and it is still working perfectly fine. Great to have inside your car just in case you need it. I have never used it connected to the cigarette lighter in my car though. I can only imagine it MAY not work as fast or have the same potency, but I am sure it works! It comes with the adaptor and everything!I use it all the time to inflate my daughter's balls and I have used it to inflate a bike's tire as well. ACTUALLY, I have even used it to inflate baloons. It comes with different size tips for all these different uses. I love the fact that you can choose the pressure you want instead of having to guess whether it is good, have to measure with some gauge and then have to add or remove some of the air in case it is not the amount you want/need. Being able to choose the pressure makes a big difference when compared to some other brands.I love it so much that I bought another for my dad. It is light, easy to carry and it is not too big or small. It is just right!If you are considering buying but you are in doubt, go ahead, it is worth it!
