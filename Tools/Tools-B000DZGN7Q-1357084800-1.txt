review/summary: Product works well. Install has been a pain for 30 years.review/text: I like this product and its warranty. I had installed these in my misspent youth, and the install hasn't gotten any better. The Insinkerator disposers have a much better mounting system. I had an Insinkerator that lasted more than 15 years, and I really wanted to replace it with another, but the problems reported with the Badger series disposers caused me some concern.The 1hp Waste Kings were on sale for 85 bucks, and I couldn't resist. It works well and, so far, no issues. And yes I knew the install would a little more work. I do have a few of hints though.1) there are two tabs that you slide the collar over and then you twist the collar to lock the disposer in place. When you have the disposer out of the box, locate the tabs. and note where they are after you install the flange on the sink. this will help you line everything up when you push the disposer into place.2) I have pretty good strength in my hands and arms, so holding the disposer with one hand and twisting the collar with the other wasn't too difficult (plus I've done this before and lining up the tabs helps). I would suggest that you stack some books to support the disposer to where it almost touches the flange on the bottom of the sink. This should allow you to engage the the collar with out too much difficulty.3) Someone suggested using soap to lube the rubber surfaces. I didn't do this, but it might help.4) After you have mounted the disposer to the sink, go back and re-tighten the flange nut on the bottom of the sink. The extra weight of the disposer, and the twisting of the collar might cause the flange to slip.
