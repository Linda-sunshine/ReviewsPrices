review/summary: What a Beautiful Machinereview/text: I had bought a new sink a Faucet nearly a year ago so putting the old, loud garbage disposal back in made no since. I looked around on the internet for about a month. I didn't want to rush it. I did my research and found the &#34;InSinkErator Evolution Compact 3/4 HP Household Garbage Disposer&#34; looked like the best buy for the money. Now to look to the best buy. Where is that going to come from, eBay, a store on the web, or Amazon. This time it was Amazon and what a deal I got, $141.10 delivered. I've seen a little better, but not much.Well I finally had to do it. Our old Fauset was leaking so bad my wife put her foot down and Out the old sink came, piece of cake. The new sink is bigger on one side and deeper. Lets just say that the easiest part was installing the disposal after the sink finally got installed. It so quiet now the cats don't get scared when it get turned on. One of the reasons why it's so quiet is the rubber piece that fits in between the disposal and the sink fits in there pretty good. So good it slows the water when draining, but it's hasn't caused any problems.
