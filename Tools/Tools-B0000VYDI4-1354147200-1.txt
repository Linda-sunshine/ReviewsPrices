review/summary: Excellent investment for a Home Ownerreview/text: Relatively easy to handle, sets up in seconds and is very sturdy. I feel very comfortable on the ladder when it is fully extended and it is quite sturdy. It is does weigh about 35 lbs,or so, so it is not easy for a smaller person to handle when it is either in its storage position or when it is expanded to full length.
