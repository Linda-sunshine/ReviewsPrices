review/summary: Have been using for 2 years!review/text: Length:: 0:40 MinsI have been using this filter for 2 years now and have the filter on the subscribe and save order every 2 months.PROS:It's very easy to install & I didn't have any problems with any leaking.Removing the filter is easy. Make sure to mark with a sharpie where to turn. I once made the mistake of turning it the wrong way and it got stuck.Water tastes ok, can't tell much of a difference (I live in NY city) but it gives me peace of mind.Cheaper (and more eco-friendly) than buying bottled water or water dispensers.Better than those filtered pitchers in my opinion.CONS:Sometimes, it doesn't click back to the regular faucet flow when I turn it off so I manually push it back, No biggie.Culligan says replace every 2 months but I have to replace the filter every month. I can sometimes get away with a month and a half but the water flow is painfully slow by then.Your mileage may vary but we're a family of 4 and are not heavy drinkers so it may just be me. I just wish we can reach 2 months.Note:Based on my use for the past 2 years, For a brand new filter, you can fill 8oz of water in 10 secs.For a month old filter (in my case) I can fill 80z. in 17sec. Sometimes I just leave it running and fill a whole pitcher.Prices vary every time it ships from $8.80 to $12.40 currently.
