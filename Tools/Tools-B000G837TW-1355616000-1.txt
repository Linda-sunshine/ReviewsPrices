review/summary: Works fine, not as quiet as I thought.review/text: This think works fine. I had a plumber install it while the Counterops were being replaced, so I cannot comment on installation. This replaced a 20 year old same brand. Noise level to me is only slightly less than the older unit. This one has a distinctly lound &#34;Click&#34; when you first turn it on. Sounds like the blades kicking into position when the centrifugal force engages. But, hey...we only run Garbage Disposals for a few seconds a day, so noise is not a big deal to me.
