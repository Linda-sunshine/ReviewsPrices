review/summary: Temperature sensitive outlet really worksreview/text: I am using this in an outlet in a detatched garage to keep a heated water bowl from freezing during less than 32F days and nights. Working as expected. Keeps me from worrying that the dog bowl will overheat and malfunction on days when temps are high. Package suggested using it to monitor temperatures in unused homes, by turning on a light when temps fell too low. I thought that was a great idea too!
