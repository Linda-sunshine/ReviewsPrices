review/summary: good filterreview/text: our water wasnt all that bad to begin with , but i thought id buy a filter to see if it could be better. well, i didnt notice much difference but my wife thinks it tastes better, and as long as she thinks it works and is happy then thats all that matters. was very very easy to instal.
