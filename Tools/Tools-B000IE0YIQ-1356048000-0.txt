review/summary: Just Doesn't Lastreview/text: We've owned two of these now and, while they work well at first, both failed in less than a year of moderate use (blowing up pool toys, topping off normal-size car and bike tires). They still make noise (LOTS of noise), but don't inflate. Home Depot replaced it for us the first time, and we'd hoped we just had a dud, but the second unit suffered the same fate, in about the same amount of time.I don't think we mis-used it at all. Probably brought it out every 2-3 weeks on average ... meaning it died in approximately 12-15 uses. Unfortunately, I just don't think it's well made or at all durable.Like others I see here, the failure point for our unit, both times, was the fuse, which is soldered to the unit and can NOT be replaced, which seems silly to the extreme.It's compact, easy to use and when it works, it works well. The bad part is that it just doesn't work for long.
