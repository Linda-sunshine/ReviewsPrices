review/summary: water filterreview/text: always change the filter at the sixth month mark and it makes a big difference in taste quality of the water. easy to install. never had a leak or other problem with these. i think this is the 3rd pack we have installed. always able to taste a difference once replaced. have not used any other brand in the past and have been satisfied with these.
