review/summary: Works great for my low pressure (low water flow) showerreview/text: Very little water comes out of my shower head spout with no showerhead attached relative to other showers I've used. I dont know if that means I have low water pressure or if the pipes carrying the water to my showerhead are simply too small, but in short that means I've gone through a couple shower heads that didnt provide sufficient water pressure for me to take a good shower.I took the regulator/governor (little plastic peice) out of the head of this one (as I have read to do in other reviews), and screwed it on the showerhead. The showerhead works great! It provides sufficient pressure for me to take a comfortable shower. I love the super high pressure setting (where the water comes only out of the middle heads) though it does make a whining sound when on that setting. The showerhead is not perfect with my setup though, as when I put on a "mixed" setting (where both the "Waterfall" effect and "jet-stream" effect are on at the same time), unless the showerhead is pointed directly down, the "jet-stream" shoots out and past the "Waterfall", the higher the showerhead is tilted up (in other words there is not enough pressure for the "waterfall" to keep up with the "jet stream"). This is probably due to my low water pressure, but in anycase this showerhead does the job for me. Its wife approved as well.
