review/summary: Candle in soapy water is more effectivereview/text: I have had a small flea problem for several months, never more than a handful seen in any given day, and usually only one or two. I tried setting out trays of soapy water with a lit candle at nighttime. This typically resulted in a handful of caught fleas by morning. I bought this product hoping to increase the amount of fleas caught. To date it has yet to catch a single flea. I wondered if my other methods had killed off the population (diatomaceous earth, Hot Shot bombs, Raid spray), so I went back to my candle in soapy water technique and have since caught several more fleas. This product may only be effective with a massive infestation.
