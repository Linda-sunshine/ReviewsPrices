review/summary: Mixed feelings, but a powerful lightreview/text: This is my third one of these, as I love the light but keep having battery issues. The beam is strong and easy to focus, and in theory the LED should last forever. BUT I neglect to change the batteries the minute I notice the light begin to dim (after a few months), and they swell and get stuck in the barrel. As a result, I keep having to buy a new one. I'm not really sure it's the light's fault, but the barrel is VERY tight, so if the batteries swell at all, you're in trouble...But I like the light enough to keep buying them. Maybe this time I'll change the batteries quicker.
