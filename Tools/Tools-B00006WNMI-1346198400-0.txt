review/summary: great tasting waterreview/text: I am physically unable to drink tap water. I am able to taste the chlorine and hardness of the water and whatever else is floating in there. I stopped buying plastic gallon bottles because lately I could even taste the plastic in my water. This faucet filter is great. It's convenient and I like that it's relatively cheap. You can definitely taste the difference between the Culligan filtered water and tap water. The smell of chlorine and hardness of the water is gone. If you change the filter every 2 months as instructed, it should run you a little over $60/year at about $10 per filter cartridge. I will keep using this until I move, then I will buy the Berkley water filter system. It's much more expensive at $200-$300, but you only need to change its filters about once every 10 years so in actuality you would save more money in the long run.=======================================================================UPDATE:After owning this filter for almost 4 months now I have to change my rating from 5 to 2 stars. While it helps to make the water taste better, the filter makes my faucet leak a lot of water onto the counter. Also, it runs very very slow so it makes filling a glass full of water a real drag. I am going to bite the bullet and buy one of those water filters that sits on the counter.
