review/summary: The plastic nozzle broke.review/text: I bought this thinking it would provide me a few good years of service, but it lasted a bit over a month.The compressor worked well and pretty quickly. A bit of a pain as to the location of the on/off switch in the cord storage area, but the auto shut-off feature was very nice.Then I took it out today to inflate my snowblower tires and the nozzle literally broke apart. Seems that the business end of this compressor should be less fragile. Very disappointed.
