review/summary: Who needs a cat when you have this!review/text: This little gadget is great! I love the fact that I can simply bait it (peanut butter), leave it in my garage, and empty it without any mess or fuss. It kills in seconds and can be re-used as often as needed. It is no danger to my dog since he cannot get into it - so who needs a cat!
