review/summary: Great customer servicereview/text: I had a Badger 5 that was 5 years old. It cracked down the side just like many of the reviews on this site. When I contacted customer service, they did not hesitate to send me a new one free of charge even though mine was 3 years out of warranty. They did say that they've made changes to materials so the cracking would not happen again.
