review/summary: Blueish light with a big plastic clip.review/text: I used this at an art show to help illuminate some pieces. I found the light to be a bit blue and the clip somewhat awkward. I imagine if you tried to use this with a book as a reading light it would be too heavy/bulky.It's not a bad little light, it's reasonably bright for it's size and I ordered several, all of which worked, but I will be looking for a brighter, whiter light for my next art show.
