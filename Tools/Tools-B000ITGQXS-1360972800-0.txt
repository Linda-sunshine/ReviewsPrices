review/summary: Not bright enough to read medium hardback book.review/text: Based on other reviews I expected this to be a bright light with a broad beam. It isn't. I wonder if I have a defective one.There's only one LED bulb and when I try to read at night, I have to keep moving it very close to parts of the page as I move down. It's easier to hold a flashlight.I'm very disappointed, but I destroyed the packaging and it would cost too much to return, so I've repurposed it as a keyboard light for the laptop. It gives just enough light to see where the keys are, but not enough to read them on the opposite end.
