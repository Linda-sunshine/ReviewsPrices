review/summary: Lasts a few months and then you're out of luck.review/text: Worked fine until one day I flicked the switch off to reset some hardware plugged into it and it wouldn't turn back on anymore. I'd be fine with that if this was caused by a surge, but merely toggling on/off should not blow the unit, so that's an instant one-star. If you regularly need to use the power switch, stay away from this model.It lasted a few months, Belkin's website doesn't even recognize this model as existing and their RMA processes is convoluted. When I emailed their support, they told me to mail it to them and *maybe* they'll replace it. They don't cover postage and seeing how that would be half if not the whole cost of the unit, it's just not worth it.
