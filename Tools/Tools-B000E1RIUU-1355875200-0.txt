review/summary: Great mouser!review/text: I have a boarding stable and our cat passed away. I needed something to help out with the few mice we get in the barn and this did the trick. Just dump out the mouse (no hands touching the dead mouse) And it seems less cruel than the other forms. Mouse just dies as soon as it gets shocked. The only thing that you do need to do is clean the inside of the trap with a Qtip dipped in alchohol so the plates are clean enough to create a good shock. Nice trap.
