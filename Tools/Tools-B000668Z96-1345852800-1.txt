review/summary: Great for trapping fleas!review/text: Our home suffers an indoor flea infestation. At first I was skeptical about this product, but, I went ahead and purchased one to see how it works. And it's amazing!The fleas are drawn to heat the lamp produces. It takes a while for the lamp (nightlight) to heat up and in a few days you start seeing the little suckers stick to the sticky paper. I am going to order two more of these traps for my home and I am glad that I do not have spray so much poison down. But, I still spray once a week and vacum everyday.
