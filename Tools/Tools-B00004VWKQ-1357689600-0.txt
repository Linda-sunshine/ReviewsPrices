review/summary: The rave reviews are misleadingreview/text: Trust me, if you have blades you truly care about (which is probably why you're considering buying a sharpener) you do NOT want to use this cheap sharpener on them. The carbide teeth really 'rip' the blade more than they do sharpen it, so yes the blade gets sharper but it's a dirty jagged edge. You'd be much better off with the Lansky 5-stone system or the Smith's TRI-HONE. Yes they cost a little more but think about how much you spent on your knives and it's probably a small investment in comparison. All I can gather is that all the people giving this thing 5 star ratings don't really know how to sharpen a knife. It doesn't take much skill, especially with a setup like the Lanksy. Please, if you care about your blades, don't buy this!
