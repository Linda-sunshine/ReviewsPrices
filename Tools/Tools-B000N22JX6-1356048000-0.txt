review/summary: Great little heaterreview/text: This little heating device is great for small rooms. It is able to heat a 12'x13' room in about 10-15 minutes on the max setting. It is very quiet and the timer is convenient.It struggled heating my living room that has vaulted ceilings but it works great if you leave it pointed at your direction or have it oscillate to heat a smaller portion of a larger room.It did have a strong plastic smell that lasted about 2 weeks. A little annoying but it did go away.
