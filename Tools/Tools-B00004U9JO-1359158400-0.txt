review/summary: Leaked after 5 yearsreview/text: Same problem as a lot of people writing reviews. We had this installed when our house was built, and 5 years later we started to notice water under the sink. We were able to locate two cracks on the side of the plastic housing, which caused it to drip and spray under the sink. It worked great until that.
