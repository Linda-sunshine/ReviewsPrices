review/summary: Great for an RV...helps avoid winterizingreview/text: Thermostat plugs trip at 38 degrees, but this handy devil can turn on your space heater at any target, 45 degrees and above, in order to keep your RV interior warm. This is more economical than depending on the heater's 65 degree minimum. Three things, though:1) Use a heater w/ analog controls that will come on after going off2) Replace the device's batteries annually3) You have to fool the device with a short heavy duty extension cord if your heater lacks a grounding plug (I am not an electrician, so seek professional advice, yada, yada)
