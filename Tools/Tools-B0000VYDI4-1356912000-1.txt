review/summary: Good ladder but heavyreview/text: All of these multi function ladders are very versatile and compact for storage but come with a draw back. They are heavy. Given that it is extremely stable compared to standard ladders. Does take the place of multiple ladders. Bought it because I needed a ladder that could be used on stairs.Good ladder but if going to use it every day you will get a work out.
