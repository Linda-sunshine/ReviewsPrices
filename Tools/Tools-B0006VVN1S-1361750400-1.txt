review/summary: Great Product!review/text: This product has changed the life of my hair and skin. I had been experiencing very bad dry hair and skin since moving into my new apartment. This shower head put an end to all that! It was very easy to install, I simply had to unscrew my previous shower head then apply a little of the tape that was included with the packaging of my Culligan and voila! Every couple of months you replace the filter and your product is as good as new. Since purchasing, I've seriously told my mom, aunts, friends, co-workers, random people on the street (okay just kidding here) about this product because if you live in an area where the water sucks, it really does help. Anyways, hope my rant (review) was helpful! :)
