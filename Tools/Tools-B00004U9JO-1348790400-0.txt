review/summary: InsinkErator Badger 5 Waste Disposerreview/text: I've had probably 10 disposals over the years. most them have a lot of built in problems and can't be easily repaired. the InsinkErator has most of them beat. With the 1/2 h.p. it can grind up most things you would put in a disposal. None of them can take a spoon or a fork that you might drop in by mistake, but if you do and it jams, you can get it out by turning the allen head screw at the bottom of the motor to release it. great product. I highly recommend it to the homeowner.Ken
