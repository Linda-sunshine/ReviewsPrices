review/summary: Decent quality socket adaptersreview/text: I bought these for use with the Rockwell 3Rill impact drill-driver and they work well. The hex end locks solidly into the drill and the square ends hold sockets firmly, but they can be removed easily. I prefer sockets and extensions to be chrome plated, and these adapters would be perfect if they were. But they were inexpensive and they work well.
