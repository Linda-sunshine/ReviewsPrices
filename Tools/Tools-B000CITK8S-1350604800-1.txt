review/summary: Great for Motorcyclesreview/text: I left my headlight on after riding and found my battery to be completely dead. I bought this battery tender with the hopes that it would bring my completely dead battery back to life rather than buying a new battery. I was so happy that after 3 days of continuous charge the battery tender charged my battery. I fired up my Triumph Bonneville which came back roaring to life.This is a great product and super simple to use. It comes with a quick disconnect for motorcycles which is really helpful especially when you want to maintain a full battery. Do not buy an extra disconnect. I would also recommend the cigarette lighter accessory if you need to charge your iPhone or run a GPS.Great product. Would recommend to everyone who has a motorcycle.
