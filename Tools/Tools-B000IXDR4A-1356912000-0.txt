review/summary: Once you use an LED flashlight, no way you can go back and use incandescents!review/text: I really like how bright this LED flashlight is compared to the regular Maglites I have used before. For many years I have used the incandescent version of this Maglite. It used to go thru batteries like water!I switched to this flashlight primarily for the energy efficiency it provides. With the amount of batteries I was going thru in a month, I could easily purchase the LED version (and not use as many batteries).
