review/summary: Really great, small product!review/text: I've used the philips head, serrated blade, jeweler's screwdriver and regular blade. They all work great, and the thing takes really no more space than a regular key on my keychain.It hasn't bent or &#34;worn in&#34; and the hinge is as tight as the day I bought it. I totally recommend this tool.
