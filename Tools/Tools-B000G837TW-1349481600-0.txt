review/summary: Easy installationreview/text: Just finished installing. Was a lot easier than I expected. First, I had to remove my old disposal which I had done in less than 15 minutes. I had thought the installation of the new would be more difficult. Followed the directions (also watched an install video on YouTube) and it was a piece of cake. Only thing was, I needed my son to help me mount the disposal because I don't have a lot of upper body strength and just finishing pt for a torn rotator cuff. With him holding it up, I was able to turn the collar and lock it in to place. Have to admit that it's not as quiet as I thought it would be, but I'm blaming that on having a low end stainless steel sink. But it works and that's what matters to me. All in all I have to say that I'm pleased with the whole purchase and Amazon is the greatest!
