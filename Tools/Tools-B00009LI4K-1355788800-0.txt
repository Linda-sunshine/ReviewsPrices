review/summary: Rating the shipment, not the actual product.. FAIL!review/text: Honestly, I don't know jack about hearing protectors, so I'm not going to say whether this is a good product or not, HOWEVER, what I do know is that they did a horrible job of insuring it arrived safely. This product was shipped to me in the original flimsy box and nothing else. The box was not placed inside a sturdy shipping box, nor was there any bubble wrap, packing peanuts, styrofoam, or any other protective packaging to minimalize the possiblity of recieving a broken product. The box I received was torn and in terrible shape. I sent it right back to them just the way it was sent to me. The postman looked at me funny.. Like I care.
