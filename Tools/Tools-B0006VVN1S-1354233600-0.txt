review/summary: Great Showerhead!review/text: I can honestly comment on the filtration action, it seems my skin doesn't feel AS dry as it usually does after a shower, my hair is still plenty frizzy- so i guess I just have to trust that it's working as I'm not sure how much difference just filtration can make on our gross city water. However, I CAN say that this is a great showerhead over all! It was easy to install and immediately had SUPER water pressure. It was even better than the head it replaced which was not filtered and more expensive. In fact, it may be too much pressure for my tiny shower stall because now it hits the doors rather than the shower basin causing me to have to back against the doors to get under the stream.. haha. The stream adjust is difficult to operate when actually in the shower as it doesn't have much grip to turn with wet hands and is stiff when it does turn, but just leaving it on the general setting is usually fine. I've had it installed for over 3 months now and no issues at all with function.
