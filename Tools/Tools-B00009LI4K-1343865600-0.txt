review/summary: Absolutely superb. Possibly the best muff cup on the market.review/text: Just received my second pair after the first from about ~14 years ago had to go. These are likely the very best passive (non-electrical/wave cancellation) hearing protection cups on the market. Plastic shell cups with foam inside and a snug seal around the ears. My first Peltor pair been from that Scandanavian company, I think, before 3M bought Peltor, maybe ~8 years ago. I believe the 30 dB noise reduction rating for this pair is among the highest, if not the highest offered for any over-the-head (cup) protection. I expect this new pair to be just as great and trustworthy as the old pair was: not heavy or burden to wear for hours, comfortable, very easy fast-on/fast-off on account of wire band to easily grab, well-made (countless times I dropped & never damaged). Bonus: this new pair I just received shows as being made in the U.S.. This earmuff speaks for itself: check the next time you're on an airport apron, flight line, or range and see what the wing walkers or other shooters are wearing. Want also to double-up (2x) together with an in-ear E-A-R Classic (foam ear plugs)? Now you're speaking full auditory sensory deprivation. This is as good as it gets.
