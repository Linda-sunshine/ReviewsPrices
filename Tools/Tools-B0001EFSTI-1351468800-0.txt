review/summary: Easiest multi tool to carryreview/text: While it doesn't have the best tool set, it has the advantage of always being with me, which is more important than having a great blade or screwdriver that is sitting on my dresser when I need it. It fits on a keyring just like a normal key and is flat and is the least bulky tool I've owned. The straight blade is surprisingly sharp as is the serrated part. The mini flat head screwdriver is great for tightening glasses. The philips is a little small to use for anything substantial. The bottle opener is a little tough to use since you only have the phillips head to use as leverage. But when I can't carry a full Swiss Army knife this little guy usually gets the job done.
