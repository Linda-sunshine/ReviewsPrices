review/summary: Very useful little tool when you forget to bring better equipmentreview/text: This little tool really is a last resort only to be used if you are basically stuck somewhere and need to fix something but you left any real tools behind on accident. This tool has served me well many times, but it has never been easy to use. I have used every function on it, and I've owned if to about 2 years. The biggest problem I have had with it is when it falls off my key ring without me knowing. Sometimes the tool will open in your pocket, then when you take your keys out it will fall to the ground. It's hard to notice it falling since it's so small and light weight. I would suggest buying the 2-pack just to keep a spare.Note that the tool can open all the way up so that it is straight. It took me a while to realize that, since the first stop is only 90 degrees. I thought I would break it if I pried it open all the way. One day I didn't care if it broke or not and was pleasantly surprised when I discovered the full open mode.
