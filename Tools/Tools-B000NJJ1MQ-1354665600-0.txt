review/summary: So User Friendly for Installation & Codingreview/text: I just ordered and received this keyless entry lock to replace the deadbolt on my exterior door. Was so impressed with: 1) the quick deliver of Amazon; 2) the clear, precise, pictorial directions to install, with the optional plans, and parts, for installations; and the simple, colorful instructions to program the codes. It was actually fun to program in different codes for my different "Entryates." It was so easy to install and to program; it is certainly USER FRIENDLY. I am impressed! We'll see how it all plays out.....More later.....
