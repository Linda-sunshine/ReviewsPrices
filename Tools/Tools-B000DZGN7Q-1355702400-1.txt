review/summary: It's a garbage disposal, works, but not as great as others I've usedreview/text: It's got a very small opening - it's quiet. It doesn't suck things down unless you push them down first with your hand (when it's off) and then turn it on. I find that annoying... previous garbage disposals had such great suction and pulled the stuff down without me having to push it down. I think this may be due to a 20 year gap between products (old garbage disposal vs. new) and people being afraid of things falling down or getting caught, etc. I'm not sure, but that's my only pet peeve. I don't use it often, but when I do, at least it's relatively quiet.
