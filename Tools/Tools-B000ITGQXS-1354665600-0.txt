review/summary: Good light for lots of thingsreview/text: This a good light for small tasks and book reading. I was hoping I would like it better than wearing my headlamp to read, but I felt like I was wrangling the light neck too often. I'll probably just stick with my headlamps, as they're a bit more versatile.
