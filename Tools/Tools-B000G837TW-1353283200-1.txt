review/summary: great compactor.review/text: Got this to replace a badger 1.0. Easy to install, although it is a bit bigger in diameter than my old one so my 90 degree pipe is a bit crooked once installed. I just made sure everything was tighten and no leak. This thing is quiet! No need to think twice, just buy it. You will not regret it.
