review/summary: Good quality, useful for its size!review/text: This is not a Swiss Army Knife. It only has a few tools, and some of them can be bit awkward to use. BUT, given that this is something that can be attached to a key chain and is no bigger than your other keys, it's really very handy. The knife is small; you won't be skinning a deer, but for cutting string, opening a package, or cutting a clothing tag off, it's perfect. It's sharp, which is good, but as others have said, it does require some extra caution when using the other tools!The quality is good. The action is tight, and it clicks into the open and closed positions nicely. One thing that I had to get used to was the attachment to the key ring. As soon as it's opened for use, it comes off. In other words, it really can't be used while attached to the key ring. This can be a little annoying, as it requires two hands to open. It's easy to drop your keys! Once I was used to it, this wasn't a big deal.
