review/summary: Larger Size Than Expectedreview/text: I've had this for about a week so do not have a lot of experience with how well it works. However, it is extremely quiet. You can barely hear it from across the room. I gave it 4 stars because I did not find it to be compact in size as the description suggests. It is much larger than the last one & the plumber had to make some adjustments to the disposal to get it to fit. Now my garbage can barely fits next to it. I think I will be happy with it & do recommend it if it fits you space.
