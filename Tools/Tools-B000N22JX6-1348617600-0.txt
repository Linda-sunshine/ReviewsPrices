review/summary: Attractive quality heater for small spaces.review/text: Have bought 3 of these space heaters for bedrooms approximately 175 sq ft. each. First 1 is on second cold season and works like new. Takes a chill out of the air in a just a few minutes. Made well and are attractive. Remotes are a nice feature. Would not heat whole house but works great in small spaces. Lightweight yet sturdy. Would definitely recommend.
