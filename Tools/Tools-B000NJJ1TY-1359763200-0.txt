review/summary: Love it...review/text: We used it on the door coming in from the garage. It makes coming and going so much easier. I don't have to dig for keys when trying to get into the house. It also has a feature to disable the lock. Makes carrying in groceries easier, especially since I can open the door with an elbow if needed.
