review/summary: Sizes are Correctreview/text: I used the 1/4&#34; drive to remove and re-install license plate screws and the 1/2&#34; drive to loosen and tighten lug nuts and run down a jack. A regular drill CANNOT loosen or properly tighten a nut or screw but once it is loose the drill can remove it or run it down until it is snug. You need to start the fastener and do the final tightening with a wrench. An impact driver would probably have enough torque to loosen but these extensions do not state that they are made for impact use.
