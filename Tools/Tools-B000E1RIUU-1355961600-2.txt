review/summary: Either I have smart mice or this thing does not workreview/text: OK I read reviews after reviews and I think I understand how to properly operate and bait the trap. I am now on week three using two traps. I know we have mice because I see their p**p. So far I have been checking for results every day. What I am finding is either the trap does not work or the mice in my house are smart. The mouse manage to eat all the peanut butter off the back side of the trap and walk out. How can this be??? I am puzzled. I think the trap gets deactivated or simply it does not work. No dead mice in the house either. This happened twice so far. I can really take some hints as to what the problem may be. I have full batteries and I noticed that some of the peanut butter makes contact to one of the plates but not both.Any explanation would be helpful.Thanks,Revised as seen below:I have to correct this post. My problem was too much peanut butter. electrically it does not make sense but somehow too much bait makes the trap inactive. I cleaned up peanut butter from the base as described in one of the postings. Within a day I caught two mice (one in each trap). Nice product. Definitely works.
