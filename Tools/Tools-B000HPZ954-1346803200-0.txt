review/summary: its okreview/text: everything as per the product descirption.its light considering its size.its nice to have so many outlets.But....you would like to consider the socket layout as it might not suite your requirements.....I have more charging adapters for mobiles and tablets then for laptops and they tend to interfere with each other.....center strip is good for laptop plugs only...
