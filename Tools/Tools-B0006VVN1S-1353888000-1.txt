review/summary: Terrible instructions - read this for important clarificationreview/text: The instructions are broken into two sections: INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS and CARTRIDGE CHANGE PROCEDURE.The showerhead comes with a cartridge, which I presumed to be a replacement for when the primary was used up.The INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS say nothing about needing to install that cartridge, and I assumed the CARTRIDGE CHANGE PROCEDURE was just that: instructions you needed to follow when replacing the filter cartridge.Nope, you need to follow the "change" instructions, and then follow the "installation" instructions. Admittedly, there is a sentence preceding the numbered instructions for installation that says "Functions only with shower filter cartridge in place. It would be a lot more helpful if that said "1. Follow instructions for cartridge change procedure to install the acompanying filter.".In my case, the absence of the filter caused there to be zero water pressure, and so I followed the instructions to remove the flow regulator, figuring it was my relatively low pressure that was to fault.So, maybe I didn't catch everything in the instructions, and maybe it was common sense to install the cartridge, but the fact is, I spent WAY too much time getting this working.Will review the showerhead itself later once I've given it a try. I guess you get what you pay for.
