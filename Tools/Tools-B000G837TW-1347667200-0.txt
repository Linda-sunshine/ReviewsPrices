review/summary: Great Purchasereview/text: Evolution Compact disposal from InSinkErator is so quiet and easy to install (replaced previous 20 year old InSinkErator product). Another person commented on the poor rubber baffle design ("the baffle requires assistance to put anything into the disposal") but I have found this feature a postitve. It has already saved my daughter's ring and a random wingnut from going into the disposal. Very happy with my purchase and hope that it lasts for another 20 years :)
