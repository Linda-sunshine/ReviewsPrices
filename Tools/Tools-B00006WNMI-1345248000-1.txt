review/summary: Beats Pur and Brita with Both Eyes Tied Behind Its backreview/text: This is an incredible filter. I've been using mine for over three years and it only recently developed a crack in the housing, which is why I'm buying another one. The Pur and Brita faucet filters I've used seem to self-destruct in just a few months. This is the kind of product that will make you say "Back in the good ol' days..." Dot, dot dot.At any rate, there is a review on here stating something about the filter being male-to-male, but it's not. My faucet has a male connector at the end (as I believe most faucets do) and the filter housing has a female connector. It's literally the easiest installation for anything in the entire world. The failure rate of installing this thing is probably less than 0.000001%.Buy this filter. Enjoy a better product. Enjoy better water.
