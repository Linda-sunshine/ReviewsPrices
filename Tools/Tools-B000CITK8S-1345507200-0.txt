review/summary: Works Greatreview/text: Sometimes my F-150 stays in the garage not being driven for up to a month at a time and I got sick of the battery being drained while not in use so I bought this battery tender.I bought the extension cable with this as the ring terminal cable is only about a foot and a half long...not long enough to make it to the front of the truck. I permanently attached the ring connectors to the battery and ran the extension cable to the front of the truck and attached it to the grill with cable ties.The battery tender stays plugged in on the wall so when I pull into the garage, I can now just plug the truck in...no more dead battery!!!
