review/summary: Very useful for replacing computer partsreview/text: I bought this in anticipation of upgrading the HDD in my MacBook Pro to an SSD. I ended up using both a Phillips head and a Torx head, and they both worked perfectly. Highly recommended to anyone who is planning to do surgery on their computer.
