review/summary: Very well made.review/text: This set is a great deal for the price. I've used this a few times for model railroad locomotive and freight car repair, and it works great. The magnetic bits work great, and the rubber handle is very ergonomic. This would make a great gift for anyone who likes to tinker with electronics or other small things.
