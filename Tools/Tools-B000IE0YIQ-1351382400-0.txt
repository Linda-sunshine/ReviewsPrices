review/summary: hooked on the featuresreview/text: i am replacing an older air station that lasted me 2 years of ocassional use. i consider this not good service. BUT its the only inflator out there that has automatic shutoff when desired pressure is achieved: it is both 12v and 120 volt so i can use it on my yacht so the deck hands can blow up water toys on 12v. i can afford to replace it in a year when the warranty runs out. if you dont need its unique features and are in the 47% that some politicians dont care about , you may want to consider another product. i find that most black&decker products dont last--its the CHINA thing.
