review/summary: Lasko 6435 Designer Heaterreview/text: I recently purchased the Lasko 6435 Designer Series Ceramic Oscillating Heater with Remote Control and so far it is a great product. Provides more heat than my older model Lasko and it is absolutely adorable! Way to go Lasko! Only had it for a few days and use it in the bathroom for morning heat, so can't comment on durablility, but can say - it made a beautiful addition to my beige based bath, works wonderfully too, and has lots of easy push button options.
