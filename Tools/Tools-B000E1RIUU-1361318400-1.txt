review/summary: Victor has done it again!review/text: I have always trusted Victor traps. That is something my father instilled in me from a young age. If you had a mouse or a rat, go get a Victor trap he's say. Sometimes he didn't even call for a &#34;Victor mousetrap.&#34; He'd just say, go get a Victor.I was used to the traditional trap, I was hesitant about using this one that kills by electrocuting the mice.Still, you can't argue with the rating, and all of the positive reviews, and so I was won over.Almost immediately I started catching mice. I thought there was only 1 in my apartment, and after I caught him I almost cleaned the trap and put it away. But, I decided to leave it set, and then within a week caught mice 2 through 4.I am very impressed with the effectiveness of the trap, as well as the ease of cleaning. Open the door, dump the mouse out, and if he didn't even eat the bait close the door, turn it on, and reset it.Please note peoples' criticisms. The green light will only blink for 1 day after catching a mouse, so if you go longer than that without checking your trap you'll need to open it and look. Also, make sure the panels inside stay clean or the effectiveness will be reduced.But for me, it was right behind my refrigerator, and very easy to check. I could not be more pleased with this trap.Victor has done it again!
