review/summary: love it so farreview/text: Easy install pull it out of the box and plug it in. Kills moths and small bugs (aphids), mesquitos, etc. I hope it will last for several seasons, have had problems in the past with bug zappers not working in the spring after being put up for the winter, Will find out next spring. So far unit works flawlessly.
