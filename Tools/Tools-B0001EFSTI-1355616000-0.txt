review/summary: Butter Face of a Toolreview/text: I would love to say this is the most useful little tool. It does look the part, great profile on the keychain and despite what others have experienced, it is actually less pointy than some of my actual keys - so no holes in my pockets, but...This is REALLY HARD to use. I need a tool to open this tool. You open by prying the blade and screwdriver apart with your fingers which wouldn't be a problem if the hinge weren't so hard and also if there were some way to grasp the blade safely.That's right, the intended way to open this is to grasp the blade (HUH???) and pull apart - good luck with that.Or better yet - do not buy.
