review/summary: Wish i would have bought this a long time agoreview/text: I have boughten 3 of these now. I use them for my line of work, high tech equipment. I don't really use it as a surge protector more of as an extensive outlet. The spacing on it is perfect, the on and off switch is on the end with the cord and is well hidden so it doesn't get bumped. I've owned probably around 20 surge protectors in my line of work and this one is wonderful. Can't say enough good things about it. It's thin too, around an inch thick.
