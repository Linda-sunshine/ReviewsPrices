review/summary: A fine disposal at a discount pricereview/text: The Wasrte King L-8000 Legend Series 1.0 Horsepower Continuous Feed Garbage Disposal has met all of my expectations and then some. Not only is it able to do the job of grinding all of our soft organic items, but it is so quiet at times I wonder if it is really operating. After one month of ownership I am pleased. Ask me again in a year.
