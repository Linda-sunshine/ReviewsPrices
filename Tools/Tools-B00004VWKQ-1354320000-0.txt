review/summary: Am amazing device: AccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpenerreview/text: I've only had this sharpener for two weeks but I've sharpened every knife in our kitchen (including the serrated ones) and it's definitely put a sharper edge than I could get with my $100+ Chef's Choice unit. I think the only way to beat this edge would be on an industrial sharpener or with whetstones and a strop.I'll return to update this message when the sharpener wears out, but that may be a while.
