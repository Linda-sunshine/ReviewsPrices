review/summary: Great improvement over Mag-Lite's first attempt at LEDreview/text: This product is ideal for the person who walks a pet late at night. It's a toss up whether it is a better flashlight or weapon. The third battery adds weight to improve its weapon characteristics and adds significantly to the time between battery changes. The ability to focus the beam is as good in this LED as it was in the conventional Mag-Lite.
