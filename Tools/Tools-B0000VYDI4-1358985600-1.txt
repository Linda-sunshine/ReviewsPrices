review/summary: Heavy duty spacesaver ladderreview/text: I first chose this ladder because of its reduced size and 300 lb limit. Then I went to the manufacturer's site and watched their video to see it's versatility. As a new home owner this was everything I need in a ladder for an affordable price. I am able to change it's configuration easily by myself. Most importantly this is very sturdy. I live in a single story house on flat land and this size will work for any areas I might need to reach. The great bonus is that when you are done using it, it folds down small enough to fit in an average hall closet. If you are looking for a ladder to access a second story or if you are on a hill I would suggest you view the taller versions of this ladder. I would highly recommend this ladder.
