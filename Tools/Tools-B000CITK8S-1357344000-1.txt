review/summary: Always Chargesreview/text: It can be hard to tell from the picture but this product is a "wall wort" type so make sure you have room on an outlet. I use it on my lawn tractor with snowblower and snowmobile in the winter to make sure they always start when I need them. Charges slow, but it always charges. I have a shumacher 1.25 amp that seems to only like to charge perfect batteries or it reports trouble and shuts down.Love the detachable eye loops that come with this. Just install them on your battery, you have about 2 feet of slack that you can route to an external area. Its capped so weather is not an issue. Then when you want to charge the battery, or just use to maintain them as I do, just uncap and plug in the charger. No need to lift the hood.Never have any issue with the battery tender.
