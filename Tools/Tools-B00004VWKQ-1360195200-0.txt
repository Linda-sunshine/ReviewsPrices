review/summary: Works as expectedreview/text: What can I say? For under ten bucks your knives will be sharp! I have an old set of cheap knives that it made like new only with a few swipes. I also used it for all of my hunting knives. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is it isn't your 100 dollar + sharpening stone set. However, it is hard to beat this if you are in need of a quick edge.
