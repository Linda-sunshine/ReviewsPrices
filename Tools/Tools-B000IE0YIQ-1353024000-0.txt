review/summary: Terrible Design and Terrible Customer Servicereview/text: In spite of how slow it was, this seemed really handy at first, and the auto shut off feature is really slick. Unfortunately, as long as it worked, it was so loud I literally wore hearing protection every time I used it.It stopped working after I had topped off I guess more than a dozen but less than 20 tires. I believe the internal fuse blew - shouldn't have been a big deal. This was when I discovered that it truly is a disposable product. They sell no parts for it, and even the Black & Decker service facility I took the compressor to could not replace the fuse! I did not have my receipt so they refused to replace it. They did offer to throw it away for me and I let them.I know the modern trend is to build everything in China and replace it when it breaks. But an air compressor turned permanently into junk because you can't even replace the fuse? And a company like Black & Decker that just expects you to buy another one? The competing product from Slime is much more highly rated so I just ordered one of those. I guess I will try to avoid Black and Decker products from this point forward.
