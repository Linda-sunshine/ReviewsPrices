review/summary: for garagereview/text: i loved it for the garage, my husband put all of the stuff for cleaning outside on there and they really do stay, the stuff does not wobble or anything. We have 2 rakes a shovel and something else on there and its awesome. I really recommend very easy to intall too like 5 minutes!
