review/summary: Never a problem.review/text: This thing's worked exactly as we wanted it to since Day 1. They make it easy to remember when to change your filter, and the unit itself is easy to use - just pull the little pin on the side to start filtering. The stream is very slow, so be prepared to wait a while. But, it's filtering your water, so can't complain. It's supposed to switch the filtering off when you shut the water off at the faucet, but sometimes it stays on. That's no big deal, just turn it off real quick. I've never had a problem getting it to turn on though.
