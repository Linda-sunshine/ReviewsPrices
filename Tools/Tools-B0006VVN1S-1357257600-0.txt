review/summary: Ahhhhreview/text: I hadn't read the label where it stated your skin will feel softer, before I took my shower, but I noticed the difference when I toweled--off. My rusty water is now much nicer.I had my complex maintence man install it as I don't have tools for the job. Everything else you need is in the package.It was a very good price and the five different sprays are fantastic. Best of all it saves water because it gives much more pressure than other shower heads I've used.
