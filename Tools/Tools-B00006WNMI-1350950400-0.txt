review/summary: Lasted over three years...I liked it so much, I'm buying another one.review/text: I bought one of these filter assemblies in 2009 over three years ago. I knew it worked well, but I hadn't remembered how well it worked until it developed a tiny crack after three years of daily use and I had to go back to drinking my home's tap water while I wait for a new filter holder to arrive.We have VERY high water pressure here, and I remember when I first purchased this unit in 2009 that I didn't expect it to last long under the pressure. I am more than satisfied that it took over three years to finally wear out.When I took the broken filter off my faucet this morning, I noticed immediately that the tap water without the filter has the strong taste of chlorine which develops in a glass of water after the water sits for a few minutes. That taste is totally absent when I use the filter.I am very happy with this product and I am putting in an order for a replacement unit today!
