review/summary: Do NOT Buyreview/text: Everything about this product is a disappointment. The short power cable, the short air hose, cheap accessory needles. Power switch is buried behind the vehicle power cord. Nothing is easy to store away. The dial on the top of the unit is a nice idea, but again falls miserably short. My father owned the original Air Station and it was terrific...this is a far cry from the original. Black and Decker has horrible customer service and (sad to say) puts out a horrible product. Do not be fooled by the low price...buying this would be a mistake.
