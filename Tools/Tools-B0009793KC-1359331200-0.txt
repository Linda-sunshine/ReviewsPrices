review/summary: Whirlpool 4396508 KitchenAid Maytag Side-by-Side Refrigerator Water Filterreview/text: This is an excellent replacement for the OEM wter filter. I have priced these at stores and it is about half of what I would pay elsewhere. I have purchased several of these and they have not had any problems. It it is a perfect fit and I have never had any problems with leaking. There is a definite increase in the taste of our water. We have a high iron content and this removes most of it. After about 5 or 6 months, it will need to be replaced in order for it to work effectively. This is a must buy if you need a water filter for yoru refrigerator.
