review/summary: lifesaverreview/text: I don't drive my car that often, and I got very tired of getting into the car only to find a dead battery. Plus, there's a limit on the number of times AAA will come out and give me a jumpstart! At the suggestion of their battery service-person, I bought this (he didn't recommend the brand, just the type of product). Problem solved! And it doesn't take much figuring out (or hand strength) to raise the hood of the car and do the connections, or to reverse the process.
