review/summary: Will block out many noises. Even the more uncommon ones.review/text: I bought these for a very odd reason. I was in college and my next door neighbor in the dorm had unbelievably loud sex with her boyfriend every single day for hours on end. Props to her, but it was extremely irritating. I couldn't sleep or study and regular earplugs didn't work. I bought these out of desperation, and they did the trick. I slept in them most nights, and while they were uncomfortable to sleep in, they allowed me to actually get some sleep.
