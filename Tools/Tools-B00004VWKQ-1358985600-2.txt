review/summary: Great product + Great Value!review/text: Love this tool! Even my dullest kitchen knife (that I probably should have thrown away 2 years ago) came back to sharp, after 40 or so passes. LOVE IT! This $10 tool will probably save the average household $40-50 a year in new knives. If you don't have one - GET ONE! A must for inexpensive knife buyers (like me) or high end knife owners.
