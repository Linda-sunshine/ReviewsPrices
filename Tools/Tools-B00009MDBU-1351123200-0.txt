review/summary: Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitorreview/text: This small device is excellent for home usage. I needed to buy a UPS for my wife's lift chair, and with the P4400 I could easily read the watts and va that the motor drew during the lifting and lowering cycles, making it easy to size a UPS. the monitor is a very practical idea and well constructed.
