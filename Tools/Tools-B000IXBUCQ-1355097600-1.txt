review/summary: Best Flashlightreview/text: We had one of these during hurricane Sandy. It worked so well that we decided to buy a second one immediately. If you need to light up a room, just point the flashlight up at the ceiling and secure the light so it doesn't tip over.Safer and brigher than candles. And with the LED bulbs, you will get a lot of hours of use out of each set of batteries.
