review/summary: Works good just slow flow ratereview/text: I like the filter ok. It does have a purplish tint to it that I don't care for and it's flow rate is tolerable at best. I like it has a metal faucet connector and the pull valve to activate it that resets when you turn the water off. I may try a different one next just to see if the flow rate is any better.
