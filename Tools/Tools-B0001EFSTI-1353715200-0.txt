review/summary: These things are awesome!review/text: This is the best ultra-minimalist multitool I have come across. It is only about 50% longer than my longest key, so it fits on my keychain without being awkward. I would not carry a leatherman tool or swiss army knife with me all the time because of the bulk, so this is a good solution for me. Great for opening boxes, tightening screws on equipment etc. The bottle opener is not easy to use, but again, if you don't have anything else handy, it will get the job done.There are a few cons: 1) some of them come pretty tight/difficult to open (I have ordered a few of these as gifts); they will take a while to loosen up enough to open one-handed. WD-40 around the pin can help. 2) They do wear out. I use mine a lot, and my first one lasted about a year before the knife was very dull (did not sharpen well), and the screwdriver was stripped. But, as I said, I use it a lot.
