review/summary: Incredibly handyreview/text: Have wanted to get one of these for ages and finally snapped it up in Amazon's deal of the day.Easy to use, extremely versatile and pretty sturdy. Used it on a set of stairs while painting and it was fantastic on that kind of awkward incline.Highly Recommended!
