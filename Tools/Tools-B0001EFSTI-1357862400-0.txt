review/summary: Great Small Knifereview/text: Most convenient knife to have in your pocket. Small, light, at sits with my keys I carry with me anyway. Bottle opener is not great, but it gets the job done. Screwdrivers will get you through in a pinch, just as well as any other folding pocket multitool's screwdriver.After trying many different tools, this is the one that does everything I need (knife, bottle opener), AND is the most tolerable to carry around.
