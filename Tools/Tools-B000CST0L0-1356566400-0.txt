review/summary: Exactly what I needed.review/text: I have a newer Craftsman door opener. It has a purple learn button. This remote programmed properly and is working great. I would recommend this product because it is far cheaper than buying a replacement at Sears. They wanted nearly $40. This one does the same job for under $20. I've only had it a month so I cannot comment on the durabilty but so far it is perfect.
