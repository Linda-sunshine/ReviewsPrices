review/summary: Does the job.... not too bright, just a value for money itemreview/text: Got these for light reading. I don't especially need these much right now as I live alone, but let me explain my pupose. I am a very frequent business traveler, staying for xtended periods in US, europe, asia etc. When I am home, in India, I would imagine this would be pretty useful, to not disturb my wife. Currently m in the US, n i just wanted a small light to clip on the book and read b4 sleeping instead of turning on the room light. So I got this. Nothing special about this, moderately bright, didnt come with batteries( again might not affect typical people, but I dont carry loads of AAA batteries on business trips). I think I paid some 7-8$ for this, would have liked if it came with batteries, had a little better construction and some more light.
