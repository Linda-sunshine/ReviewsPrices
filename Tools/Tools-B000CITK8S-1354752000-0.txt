review/summary: Great Little Chargerreview/text: I thought my battery was charged up but it was not the Junior charger did a great job of getting my battery full. It did take all afternoon and overnight to fully charge my battery on my jeep then switched to float and maintain 13.2 volts. The only thing I do not like is the quick connect is to short for me to run it though the grill. I got to open hood and plug it in. I think I will have to get the extension to do this, But it does a great job charging the big battery on my Grand Cherokee.
