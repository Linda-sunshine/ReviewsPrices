review/summary: Torque Monsterreview/text: I bought this same unit at a warehouse club. It has plenty of torque for normal residential use, probably overkill. When it turns on, I can feel the counter move from the instanteous torque spooling up. It's quieter than comparable Badger / ISE units. Next time, I'll probably buy a 3/4 HP unit and save a few dollars.If you're the kind of person that loves V8s and V-twins, then you can't go wrong with this. F*** yeah!
