review/summary: Helps keep cats downstairs!review/text: We're currently using this at the bottom of our indoor stairs, to help keep the visiting cats--which I'm allergic to--on the bottom floor.My teenagers had no trouble hanging it in the doorway. I bought extra Velcro with this, &#34;just in case&#34;, but we didn't need it. The instructions were included but not very precise; fortunately, they weren't needed.The magnet holds the screens securely. The only issue is that going through the door usually &#34;reverses&#34; the screens, reversing the magnetic poles and rendering them useless. They're heavy enough to stay together, but not as securely. Obviously, I'd prefer not to have to move the screens back every time I go through them.I expected the cats to climb the screen; they haven't tried, so I can't tell you if they would have succeeded. Our dog can go through the screen easily. (She weighs 65 pounds, and we currently have a gate at the top of the stairs to keep her from unsupervised &#34;visits&#34; with the cats.)The next test for the screen door is to remove it after the cats go home, which will happen in a couple of weeks. I will get a removable &#34;pressure-rod&#34; to fit the sliding glass door; in the spring, we'll see if it keeps flying insects out of the house.Yes, I would recommend this. It's easy to install, our dog has no trouble using it, and the only problem is the screens not returning to the correct position when someone walks through it.Definitely worth the money!
