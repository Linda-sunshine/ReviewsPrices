review/summary: Very nice protection options!review/text: This is by far the best for over all protection, for the price! It has a $300,000.00 device coverage, for damage to your equipment if surge protector fails. I bought this because of the Cat5, Cat6 network protection &#34;Very Important&#34; option, all others with it were much more $$. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the back of the protector, the slots for mounting are backwards, and protector would be upside down from what is pictured, had to mount it sideways instead. Other than that, very nice for the $$.
