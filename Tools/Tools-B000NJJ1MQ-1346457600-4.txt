review/summary: Great for garage doorreview/text: I purchased this lock for my garage door that leads to my back patio. It is expensive, but it will keep me from locking myself out of the house. It works well so far and I'm glad I ordered it.The installation took longer than my husband thought it would, but he followed the directions and he managed to install it by himself.We plan to order another one to use on the door from the garage into the mudroom.
