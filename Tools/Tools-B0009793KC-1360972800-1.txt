review/summary: Far less expensive than anywhere else I've bought them.review/text: It is the 'real' deal. I naively thought that the senor light in my fridge could actually tell when the filter was used up and I guess that's what the maker wanted me to think. But, NO, it is only a timer. It counts down one year and then tells you it's time to BUY a new one. Well, truly that depends on your usage. How can you really tell? I'm not sure, but I left mine in for almost two years this time and I was just beginning to wonder if maybe it wasn't quite doing it's job anymore so I ordered this and changed it. If yours is a family of six or eight, you might actually need to replace it sooner. Who knows?
