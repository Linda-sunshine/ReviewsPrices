review/summary: Solved my problemreview/text: I am in a rental home with french doors going out to the patio. I also have 2 dogs. The doors do not have a screen and there is no doggie door. So I was always leaving the door open for the dogs. I bought this product so that I could keep the door open, and not only keep the bugs out but to allow my dogs to come and go as they needed.We purchased a longer rod at a hardware store so that it could be hung across the set of doors. It fits well on one door but we wanted a more permanent solution and needed to be able to open and close the door so we hung it on the outside of the door, requiring a longer rod.The screen was easy to install, hangs well, keeps the bugs out and allows my dogs to come and go as they need. The screen material is thicker and seems very durable. I would easily recommend this product, which is why I wrote a review.
