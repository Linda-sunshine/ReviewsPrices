review/summary: Great ladder for the price. Light and easy to store.review/text: The ladder is very easy to extend and manipulate. It is lighter than most other ladders I have used and flexes very little. If you are buying a ladder, however, buy it a few fet longer than the place you need to reach. I was in a rush and bought this when it was on sale and didnt even think that the 22 feet would put the ladder straight up and down.
