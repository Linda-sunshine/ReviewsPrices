review/summary: Comfortable with plenty of Dexterityreview/text: I've been quite happy with this purchase. I was a little bit leery of buying a pair of work gloves online as I've always had trouble finding gloves that fit well, but this order definitely worked out well. These gloves are extremely comfortable, the padding is in all the right places, and they're able to offer both protection and durability while at the same time giving you the most dexterity you could ask for with a pair of work gloves.As far as fitting these gloves go I can't give anyone exact dimensions, but I can say that most often I find large gloves fit me best, though with some brands and models I've had better success with medium sizes. After reading the reviews here I decided to take a chance with medium and the risk paid off. Basically if you're on the small-side of large, medium should fit you quite perfectly. These gloves have plenty of stretch to them so I can imagine hands bigger than mine still being able to fit into a medium without discomfort.
