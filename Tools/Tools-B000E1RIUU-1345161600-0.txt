review/summary: Awesome Product!review/text: My wife laughed at me for buying a 20 dollar mouse trap, but it is totally worth it. It came last night, I put a little bit of peanut butter as bait and when I got up this morning we had caught our little friend.Really easy to use, the review with all the tips was helpful. You really don't need to over bait. I just smeared a little bit of peanut butter off a knife and that worked fine. It was maybe the size of a dime, and thin enough you could see spots of the case.The battery compartment is a little awkward to install. Instead of the typical 4 in a row battery bay, there is two batteries stacked on two batteries. It wasn't hard by any means, just pay attention which end is positive and which end is negative. there is a ribbon in the compartment that should make battery removal easier.To dispose of the mouse, I just turned the trap off, flipped it upside down over the trash can and lifted the lid a little bit. I didn't have to shake the trap, the mouse just rolled out. There was no blood, guts or urine that I saw, so I just put the trap back in place and turned it back on.I thought about rebaiting it, but there was still some peanut butter left and I wasn't sure I needed it.GREAT mouse trap - Supposedly will last up to 100 kills on 1 set of batteries.
