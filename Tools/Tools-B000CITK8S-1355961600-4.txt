review/summary: Used to be goodreview/text: Started using these tenders over 10 years ago, back then they worked great. I have a lot of batteries so I am continually adding tenders and the ones I have bought in the last few years have mostly been junk. As others have said the warranty "isn't" so you basically are tossing 20 dollars away. I'm buying another brand now, they cost a little more but have been rock solid for the last couple of years.
