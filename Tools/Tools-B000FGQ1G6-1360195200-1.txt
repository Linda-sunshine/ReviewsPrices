review/summary: Great quality at an even greater price/value.review/text: My search started when I needed a teeny, tiny Phillips screwdriver to work on my iPod Nano Gen6 (replace the touchscreen). It turns out the size #000 was what I needed. I figured I could buy a single screwdriver of good quality for $6. Or I could get this 30-piece set for only twice that amount. Furthermore, this set has a magnetic grip for the tips and to hold the almost-microscopic screws, and the other one did not. I can't imagine trying to get those screws in & out with my fat fingers!I was fearful that this set would be poorly made, with soft metal that would strip. But it worked like a champ. It's super easy to change tips, and with the storage case I won't lose the little single screwdriver. I figure I'll never have to buy another teeny driver, and in the world of ever-shrinking iEverything, I expect I'll have further need for it replacing batteries, broken screens, etc. Heck, I may take up watch repair just so I can enjoy more painstaking, tedious repair of tiny things!
