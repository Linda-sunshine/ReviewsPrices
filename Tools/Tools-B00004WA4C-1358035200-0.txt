review/summary: 2 chirping episodes in the first 2 monthsreview/text: I installed this alarm in my master bedroom two months ago, and I have already encountered the low battery chirping twice. Obviously, I put in a fresh set of batteries when I originally installed it, and both times to silence the chirps I pulled the batteries out, popped the same ones back in, and hit the reset button. I find this obnoxious and will be shopping for an alternative.
