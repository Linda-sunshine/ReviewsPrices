review/summary: Solid Work Glove for the Weekend Handymanreview/text: After finally destroying a pair of craftsman work gloves through 3 years of abuse, I was faced with the task of finding a new &#34;go-to&#34; pair of work gloves. I was ordering something from Amazon and need a few extra bucks to qualify for free shipping so I decided on trying these gloves based on the reviews and excellent price. I'm sure glad I did!I picked up the medium size and the fit is pretty snug and secure enough for dexterity (my hand measures 7&#34; from the tip of my middle finger to the heel of my palm and about 3.25&#34; across at my knuckles). There is plenty of padding on the knuckles and fingers, even more than my previous gloves. And the palm material seems to stand up to a decent amount of abuse as well. I wore them for a weekend of hanging drywall and I didn't see any wear or cuts from reaching for screws and cutting drywall for a total of 20 hours over 2.5 days. The one draw back for me is that the cuff of the glove with the velcro strap is a bit longish (i.e. will not be able to wear a watch). But I got used to the feeling and thought that maybe this will give a little extra protection for my wrists.All in all, a solid glove and well worth the price. I would definitely buy another pair down the road.
