review/summary: Great AV System Power Supplyreview/text: I used this to replace two power strips for my audio-visual system. The 90 oriented outlets running down the sides are perfect for &#34;wall wart&#34; style power supplies. The side outlets are spaced far enough apart to prevent over-sized power supplies from covering adjacent outlets.
