review/summary: Blows my Rocketfish out of the water!review/text: I bought a Rocketfish Surge Protector which requires a Master Controlled item to be on permanently. This method was very ineffective for my application. So, I purchased this Belkin! It works great! No more issues with my WiFi shutting off.
