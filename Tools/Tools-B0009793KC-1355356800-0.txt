review/summary: Perfect Fitreview/text: These work as designed. OEM. I just wish there was a bypass for the entire filtration system. I don't need to filter the water at all, however, I don't want to just run the water through an aged filter for fear of growing bacteria inside. There is no option to bypass the filter and avoid the significant ongoing expense of these filters. Whirlpool should address this. They are making more on the filters than they are on the refrigerator. Perhaps they could give away the refrigerators just to sell the filters!!
