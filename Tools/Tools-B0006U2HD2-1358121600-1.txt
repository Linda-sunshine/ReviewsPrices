review/summary: Farm Innovators TC-3 Cold Weather Thermo Cube Thermostatically...review/text: We use this item in our home in Michigan when we're away for the winter.It has never failed us, and the light to which we have it attached goes on, it alerts our neighbors to a possible problem with the furnace, i.e., not operating properly.Provides peace of mind by taking the guesswork out of not knowing whether or not the house is kept warm enough to avoid freezing pipes.Great item.
