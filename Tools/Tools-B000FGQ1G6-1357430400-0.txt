review/summary: For anything A/V, it works great.review/text: I run an A/V business and this has come in handy for in-wall switches, taking apart remote controls, other small electronics and my wife has found a few uses of her own.It has a nice grip and a nice selection of bits as well. It's better than anything I could find at my major hardware stores and I definitely recommend it.
