review/summary: Soft hair and better from the first showerreview/text: First shower this morning. Hair felt way better, skin feels better, will take more time, but the water streaming in my face felt way better thank chlorine shooting you in the face. I cant believe i didnt get this awhile ago., so far i love it, its probably gonna get better. I highly recommend for health to filter your showers
