review/summary: Good spacing on the outletsreview/text: This works great! I can fit all my entertainment center plugs on this one strip. The spacing on the plugs is great for boxy power cords. It was a good price, and the cord is long enough to reach a ways if you need it.Haven't yet tested the surge protection on it, but if I get struck by lightning or something I'll be sure to update!
