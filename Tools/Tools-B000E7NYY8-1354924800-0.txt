review/summary: Accurate temp controlreview/text: I am using this in my 12x16 shop. For heat, I am using a cheap oil radiator heater. Without this thermostat, the shop would either be 80 degrees, or 50! The thermostat on the heater was junk. This thermostat fixed that problem. My shop is now a steady 60 degrees, and it has cut down the use of electricity as well. I would buy this product again.
