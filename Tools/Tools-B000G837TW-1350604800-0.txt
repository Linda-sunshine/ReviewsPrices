review/summary: Stopped working after 2 weeksreview/text: Recieved the garbage disposal on time. The unit was very easy to install and worked great...for two weeks.Now whenever I turn the disposal on I hear a humming noise but the disposal won't work. To make it work I have to get under the sink and use the crank tool to turn the motor and THEN turn on the disposal. I have to do the EVERY TIME I want to turn the disposal on. There is NOTHING inside the unit jamming the rotors. I am debating to return this item to Amazon or use the work # Insinkerator gave me to have a plumber come look at it.What a piece of junk.**************************************11/30/2012 Update:It appears my complaints made it higher up than the standard customer service person. The VERY knowledgeable Insinkerator rep diagnosed the problem over the phone and just sent me a brand new unit which made it to my doorstep in only 4 days. I installed it and so far for seven days the unit has worked well.
