review/summary: Screws wrong sizereview/text: Screws came with this - obviously to attach it to the wall. Problem is the heads on the screws were too large to fit in the recessed connectors. I ended up having to take this with me to the hardware to find screws that were both long enough and had heads that would fit the product. Once up it work great - should have come with the correct materials.
