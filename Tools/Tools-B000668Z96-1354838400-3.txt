review/summary: I was excited....review/text: I was really excited about this product after reading the reviews. I have 2 indoor persian cats. My neighbor decided to store her flea infested stuff in my laundry room while I was away on vacation and in turn, my cats got fleas! I've bombed the house, tried homemade remedies, and have given many flea baths. When I read the reviews on this product I was super excited.. I'm sad to say that I purchased 3 of these with high expectations. I didn't catch a single flea with this. It was disappointing. I wouldn't recommend it
