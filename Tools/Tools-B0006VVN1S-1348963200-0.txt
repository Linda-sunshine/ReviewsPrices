review/summary: Teflon Tape My @$$review/text: There is no teflon tape in this package, a bothersome plastic-sealed package, mind you (needed scissors to cut open and can injure you if not careful, so there's no way it was accidentally taken out or whatever - Culligan deliberately decided not to include teflon tape in, apparently, some of its WSH-C125's, since a lot of people here claim their's did come with tape), so it does not come with everything for it to work properly. The product's writings, more than once, explicitly says that teflon tape is included, however nowhere, not inside the package, not even idiotically hidden inside the manuals, or in the insides of the showerhead when you screw it open (you'd have to be insane to include it in there - guess what, it wasn't even in there) is there teflon tape. A wasted day with destroyed hope, of course because "Culligan" is a shoddy and lying company.I had to use a substitute tape since the old tape was removed and the shower needs to be used frequently, and the best candidate at the time was scotch. Does a half-assed job at preventing leakage, but better than nothing. I await teflon tape from another seller for 4-5 days. Someone should go tell Culligan to screw themselves. I myself did.
