review/summary: Liftmaster Door Remotereview/text: The house we bought didn't come with a garage remote and thus got this thinking it might not work. It worked well with my garage door and set up was easy. It worked well to set up the remote in the car, too. Only negative thing is the shape feels awkward with the horizontal button.
