review/summary: Good Quality, Great Pricereview/text: This battery tender comes with all types of connectors that you could want for connecting this up to a motorcycle battery (in my case) or a car battery for recharge or winter storage (in my case).If your motorcycle has battery tender outputs directly from the battery, you could easily connect this device to your bike without removing the battery. Or, the terminal leads that come with this module could be installed on your bike and directly connect to the charger when needed.Jumper Cable style connectors are a plus if you are in a pinch and want to quickly charge a battery without the work of removing it / adding other attachments to the terminals.
