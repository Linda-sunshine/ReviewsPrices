review/summary: Problem Putting On New Filter Cartridgereview/text: The order came within a reasonable amount of time. It's performance was up to par, and we enjoyed not having to carry and lug water jugs to and from the store to assure safe and cleandrinking water. However, when I ordered the new cartridge and tried to unscrew the old one, it would not come off. My husband tried, and even he could not unscrew it. I called Culliganvia the phone number listed on the back of the cartridge box, and they speedily sent us a new housing unit. It looked very different from the old one and did not have any Culligan logoon it. (Little did I care as long as it worked right, and it did.) I would just assume that if you buy this product and it comes time to get a replacement cartridge, allow yourself ampletime to receive the new housing if there is a problem. Other than this, it is an excellent water filter system and the water tastes great!
