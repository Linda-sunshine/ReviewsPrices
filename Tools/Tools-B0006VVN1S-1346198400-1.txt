review/summary: Best shower head!review/text: I researched several different filters, and found these to be the best bargain. I didn't want a handheld, and this wasn't crazy priced, and the replacement filters are reasonable.I installed this with no problem - nothing broke. I didn't force it more than it wanted to go, and with using the teflon tape properly, I have no leaks. Filters are easy to replace, unscrew, pop out, pop in, screw on, and you're done.Fast forward now about a year. I still am using this filter, and I love it! I live by myself and don't take incredibly long showers, and i'm on my 2nd filter replacement, and going strong. The water here leaves this brownish/reddish residue after a while (especially on shower liner bottoms), and while I have the filter in, I do not get this residue, so my shower looks cleaner. The rubber tips are easy to clean if any calcification develops.I do not think my city water is 'bad' so to say, but this filtering does give peace of mind, and it does keep my skin softer.Word of advice, if you do the subscribe and save on the filters, keep in mind the unit does come with one, so space out the shipments as far as possible. You'll always have an extra this way, too, especially if one comes broken, which I had happen. Amazon replaced it no problem.
