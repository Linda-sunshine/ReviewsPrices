review/summary: Great, even after almost 4 years!review/text: I bought this shower head 3 1/2 years ago when I moved to Texas and had heavily chlorinated water that was absolutely killing my hair and skin. I noticed an immediate difference, even in the smell of the water, and flipped the filter about 6 months after I first installed it, but haven't changed it since--I moved back to California 2 1/2 years ago, and left the filter alone when I re-installed the shower head at my current place. (I actually got on here to buy a replacement filter, although I don't know if I really even need one.)This is a great product with a long life, and I highly recommend it.
