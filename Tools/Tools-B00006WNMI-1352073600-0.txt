review/summary: Better than Purreview/text: I avoided this product for the past few years because the price point was so low. Because it was cheap, I assumed it would be "cheap." On our last move, reading some of the reviews here, I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did.I've been using primarily Pur filters for the last 4 years, so that's my basic point of comparison. Comparing the two, the Culligan is vastly superior.First of all - the water filtration quality is much, much better. The Pur mounts ended up adding a weird taste after a few months. The Culligan did not.Also - after endless frustration with the Pur's plastic connection apertures, it was a breath of fresh air that the Culligan had a metal attachment aperture.One final note - I was hesitant buying this because as a kid we used a pull-out filter where the pull-out stayed out. This one retracts automatically - even if only a small flow of water has gone through.
