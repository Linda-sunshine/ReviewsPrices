review/summary: Really works!!!review/text: I was skeptical... now I am an advocate.Several sources recommended a different &#8211;and much more expensive&#8211; sharpener. I decided that, at the price point for this device, it was worth a try.I have a forty year old chef's knife which I kept for sentimental reasons but which was useless. It wouldn't take or keep an edge. It was the first knife I sharpened and the results were amazing! It has been returned to 'favorite utensil' status. It is extremely sharp!This sharpener is well worth the money. I down-rated it one star due to needing to reverse the carbide sharpening stones after extended use... which I haven't had to do as yet. There are 'replacement' carbides but, hey, they cost a few dollars less than the complete sharpener so what's the point?
