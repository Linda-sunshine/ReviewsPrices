review/summary: good product so farreview/text: I installed this keyboard operated manual deadbolt to replace another brand of keyboard and motor operated deadbolt. The motor operated bolt ran through batteries much more quickly than advertised, forcing me to give the metal key to a user who promptly 'lost' the key. This Schlage product with a manual bolt has been trouble free to this point.
