review/summary: Easy to install + runs quietlyreview/text: This was my first time installing a garbage disposal... I'm not a plumber, but just a reasonably-handy homeowner. This was a new installation (not replacing an existing unit) and it was easier than I could've imagined. The instructions are very clear and detailed, and I'm convinced that anyone who can lift it can install it.I love the fact that this is a quality model made in the USA.I cannot believe how quiet it runs... and this is not even the top-of-the-line.Note: don't forget to get a cord set. Like most disposals, the power cord does *not* come with the unit. I also picked up the air switch, and installed it on the counter next to the sink. It works perfectly, and I never have to worry about getting a shock with wet hands.
