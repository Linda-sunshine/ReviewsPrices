review/summary: A Panasonic TV repairman here in Tampa Fl (the lightning capital) advised me, this is the best I can get !!!!!review/text: I am retired and will spend weeks reviewing things before I purchase anything. I read as many reviews and articals as I can and also speak with as many people as I can.. Recently puchaced a 3D TV and spoke with an older man in the Tampa area who does warranty work for Panasonic and sells extended warranty, been doing this for many years and he does not sell surge protectors. He spent aprox 30 min on the phone with me and bottom line advised the best investment I could make in protecting all of my electronics was the Belkin surge protector that not only protected the the electric plugin but also the cable conection. He advised I would pay apx $50.00 for this but it would be the best money I would have ever spend.Other reviews advised a good protector should be at least 600 joules, this protector is rated for 3940 joules. Belkin gives this unit a life time warranty and $300,000 connected equipment warranty.I called Belkin to see if I needed to register the unit and advise what was hooked up to the unit if I had a claim. They advised no but I must have my proof of purchase, this is all that is required. Thier customer support was great. I had some questions for them and they answer all my concerns and I could really tell they valued me as a customer and they are here in the USABest of all the MSRP on this unit is $49.99 but thru amazon under $20.00 and with my prime account free shipping. I bought 3 for my self and just 3 days ago another 1 for my wife's uncle as a gift.
