review/summary: lots of fun and a good toolreview/text: small and lightweight but effective. I bought this to chop kindling off of firewood. to my surprise, i was able to somewhat easily split small logs. This was extremely dry wood and i doubt it would be able to split fresh logs too easily but I was a happy camper.
