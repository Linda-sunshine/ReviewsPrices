review/summary: Marked improvement over builder grade disposalreview/text: I decided to get this disposal for my birthday for some reason. Our house is 9 years old and the GE disposal that the builder put in was loud and vibrated the hell out of the countertop when anything harder than a noodle was in it. I checked out online reviews and decided to go with ISE. I also decided to go with the Compact Evolution over the Essential or Excel due to the size.When I got the package, I was surprised at how big the disposal was. My old GE was much skinnier but taller. I was worried about putting in the small bucket of a disposal I just ordered. The old disposal was fairly easy to remove. The hardest part was removing the sink flange. After that the new Evolution was easy to install. Placing the spring clip was the most difficult part, but the instructions gave good tips to make that part easier. Overall it took me just over an hour to pull the old one out and the Evolution in. There must be a standard for disposal plumbing since everything lined up with no modifications.We've had the Compact Evolution running for a week now and it's been great. It is much quieter and vibrates much less than the old GE. As per the instructions, we've been placing our food waste into the disposal to be a little "greener". It still will vibrate a bit initially if you put a bunch of juiced lemons in, but it makes short work of them. The only complaint is that if the sink is filled with water, it seems to drain slower than before.
