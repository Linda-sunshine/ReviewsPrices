review/summary: All about the dealreview/text: Like so many reviews I write on here, this one is about the value not the product. Let's face it, if your fridge takes these then you buy them and put them in... whether or not they do what they should is anyone's guess, right? But, since you do have to buy them and put them in, buy these since they're cheaper than you can get them anywhere else, or than buying them one at a time. (If you're like me, you will extend the life of these filters by leaving them in for 2 cycles instead of changing it when they recommend.)
