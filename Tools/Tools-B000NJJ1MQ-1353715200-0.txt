review/summary: Great for a house with kidsreview/text: I bought this so I wouldn't have to worry about my son carrying a key around and losing it. He can now let himself in the house with ease. I also enjoy using it since it is so much easier to enter my code and unlock the door without fumbling for a key, especially if my hands are full.
