review/summary: Does what it's supposed to doreview/text: Bought 2 of these. After using one for about a year, had a need for another charger/maintainer and looked around for a lower priced one as an option - but ended up getting this one again. Does its job well enough and the build is good. Hooking up and unhooking the unit from a car are simple and straightforward. Would recommend it to anyone needing a trickle charger - though i have not yet tried to charge a rundown battery, am expecting it to perform as advertised.
