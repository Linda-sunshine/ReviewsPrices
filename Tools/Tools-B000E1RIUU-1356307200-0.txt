review/summary: ITs the BEST!!!review/text: For you animal lovers out there-Yes I even feel for the little guys...but when it comes to my family and sanitary conditions, all bets are off. I won't poison them and leave them to suffer. I tried the old fashioned snap traps. After one time of hearing the snap in my pantry, I listened in horror as the poor thing died slowly. 15 minutes later, I opened the cupboard to find he had died with the snap through his abdomen, not neck. NO MORE.I purchased the Victor Electric trap and it went right to work. It doesn't make any noise, but I believe it is much more humane.And not Icky- open the door turn upside down and shake. After a few weeks, I wipe out with a Clorox wipe and re-bait.I am currently on my second unit. I left the first one too long with old cheap leaky batteries and had to replace it.For the money it's the best...I use alittle bit of Oreo cookie glued on the back vent with peanut butter. I hope Victor never removes this trap from the market!
