review/summary: Very good detector. Easy to install. VERY LOUD! You won't sleep through the alert!review/text: This is my second unit. Monoxide detectors have a defined lifetime and must be replaced. These units alert you to that time with a short beep every 60 seconds. That is pretty annoying and of course means you will disconnect it until you get a replacement but I don't know of a better way for them to setup the warning. Maybe a 3 day snooze would be a good improvement!
