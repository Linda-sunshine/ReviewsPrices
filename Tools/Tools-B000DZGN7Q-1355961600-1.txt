review/summary: Works well! Would buy again.review/text: This thing really works well. The quick connection to the sink drain had me worried about stability and leakage, but this has not been a problem at all. This disposal has the dishwasher connection placed at a slightly different level than our old waste king disposal, so a bit of plumbing work was required after removing the old disposal before I could install the new one, so be aware that substitution may not be just a 'plug-and-play' affair.
