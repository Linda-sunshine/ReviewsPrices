review/summary: Kill A Watt monitorreview/text: I bought this monitor to use as part of a student's chemistry experiment. It's easy to use, seems accurate, and is reasonably-priced. It's stood up to heavy use (running a hot plate for up to 12 hours at a time) without a whimper. If you have a need to monitor electricity use, this is a great option.
