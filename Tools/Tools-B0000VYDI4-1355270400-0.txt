review/summary: my favorite ladderreview/text: As a Home Improvement Contractor, I love this ladder. It's heavier than most, but if you're of at least average strength you shouldn't have a problem. It can get a little unwieldy when fully extended, but it's something you can get used to. At the end of the day, it comes down to how safe I feel climbing this ladder, and I have to say it's tops. I've found all the Little Giant (and knockoffs like this) to be incredibly sturdy and if I had my choice I would only use these.Pros: STURDYversatileCons: heavyexpensive
