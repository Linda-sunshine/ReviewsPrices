review/summary: Good as an internal or secondary lockreview/text: I've had this lock about 3 months and I am pretty happy with it. Installation is actually surprisingly easy - it probably took as long for me to get the old handles out as it did to install the new one. I used this on my home office door which is an internal door to replace a standard Schlage keyed level lock. There was nothing wrong with the old lock - this was more a convenience so I don't have to bring my keys downstairs to get in my office. One thing to note that this lock is not a deadbolt so I would be careful as using it as a primary lock for an outside door or one with shared access but it could be used as a secondary lock with a deadbolt. Programming it actually really simple and you can have multiple codes so you can selectively allow people access without having to change your primary access code all the time. There is also an option to set a longer (6 digit code, regular codes are 4) code for vacations or such which disable any regular code. Overall I am very happy with it and haven't experienced any of the battery problems that other people have had.
