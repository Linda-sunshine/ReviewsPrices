review/summary: No mice caught :(review/text: I was excited to buy a product like this since I have a barn with horses and mice are a problem. I have dogs and do not use poison. I thought this was the perfect answer to my mouse problem.At this point, snap type mouse traps without bait have caught 3 mice, my Labrador Retrievers have caught 4 mice and this trap has not caught any. I have even moved the trap to an area where I have mouse activity - directly blocking the hole. No mice caught. In my mind, this was a waste of money.
