review/summary: Not worth itreview/text: I received this item as a gift for christmas and within three uses, right between where the two screws on the handle are, it snapped. The reason for it snapping? It was made with a very cheap type of steel. I was using it on wood and chop number 3 snapped it and it flew off. Very dangerous. Just to clarify further, this is the product I purchased, so I am not mixing up the two versions of this.
