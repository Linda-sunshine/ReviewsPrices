review/summary: Peanut butter is THE perfect companion of this trapreview/text: Don't over bait, only a tad peanut butter is sufficient.Be patient, this took us two weeks to catch the tiny rat, but it works great!The best bait is still peanut butter~speaking from experience, we tried a lot of different food...Overall, at the very moment we are considering return the product, it catches the rat. The only reason I gave a 4-start is that there was no green light blinking for victory...it took me by surprise. should have checked the door for tail. :)
