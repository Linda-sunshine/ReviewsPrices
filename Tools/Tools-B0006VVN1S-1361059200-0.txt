review/summary: The water feels great!review/text: Ive been using this filter for about 11 months (replaced it 1x, per instructions of every 6 months even though Im the only 1 using it) and I love it! I love the feel of the spray on rain setting and it was easy to install (Trust me, I cower in fear at the thought of any DIY projects D:)I have a really old poorly maintained studio apartment, so I shudder to think of what is coming out of the pipes. The water from this feels great, my curly hair and sensitive skin are definitely happier (But I admit, I switched to Nubian Heritage soaps, but altogether its a great combination!)If they make a sink filter Ill get that too ^_^
