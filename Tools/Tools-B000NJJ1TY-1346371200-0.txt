review/summary: Solid and easy to install and programreview/text: The Schlage FE595VCAM619 feels and looks high-quality. It is replacing a lower-quality model I tried a couple of years ago (the lower-quality one died). You do get what you pay for, apparently.The Schlage is easy to install. The instructions are excellent. I've been a technical writer all my adult life, and I'd be proud to have written the instructions that come with this.It looks like classy Fort Knox.I also love the levered handles, versus a regular round knob. For the door I put this on, the door knob is so close to the frame that I sometimes scrap my knuckles on the frame opening the door. That will never be an issue with these levered handles. Also, getting into the house with a load of groceries is easier too.
