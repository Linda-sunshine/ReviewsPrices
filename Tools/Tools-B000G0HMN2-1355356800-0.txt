review/summary: Flashlight exceeds expectationsreview/text: This is absolutely the brightest 3-D cell flashlight I have ever used.Its a Maglight, so if you have ever owned one, you know what to expect.Fit and finish are excellent and a heavy duty switch that you can expect to work for10+ years.Its a heavy weight, you won't to carry it far or pack it along on a hike, butfor having a good light on the shelf on in you toolbox, you can't do better.
