review/summary: Great Surge Protectorreview/text: This is my favorite surge protector, in fact this is the second one I have purchased. It's relatively slim, while still providing ample space for even the bulkiest of plugs.Pros:- 12 outlets-size-ability to actually plug in 12 plugs with large plugs.-Ethernet and phone portsCons:-May be my fault because I'm to brutal, but the cord management piece broke on mine, but I rarely used it anyway.
