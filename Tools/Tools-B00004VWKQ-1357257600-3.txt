review/summary: Simple, safe, inexpensive, easy, and it works!review/text: I have tried most of the knife sharpeners that have been shilled on TV over the years. Until I bought this, I had given up, figuring that my lackadaisical hope of finding a no-brainer tool to keep kitchen knives sharp was a non-starter. Other household knife sharpeners were either too much work or, mostly, they didn't seem to do much. This little gadget is a dream come true. It is simple, easy, safe, inexpensive AND it gives my knives great edge in just a few seconds. Now my knives are sharp and visiting children don't scold me for having dull knives. In fact, I plan to give this as a gift next year for the holidays.
