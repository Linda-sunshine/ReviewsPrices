review/summary: This is the best power strip for the moneyreview/text: I've been using this for quite some time now. I was running Christmas light through this for 2 years (at it max 1875watts may I add) and it's still like new. It didn't get nearly as hot as I thought it would based on other power strips. I have since gotten another one of these to run my computer and crazy amount of other things off of it. I have my coax cable hooked up too. I feel much better knowing that I'm using a power strip that can handle if everything is on at once, and that my valuable (at least to me) electronics are protected from power surges. I highly recommend this item.
