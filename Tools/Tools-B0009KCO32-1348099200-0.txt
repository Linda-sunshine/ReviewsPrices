review/summary: Love itreview/text: works great for our backdoor to keep the bugs out. my only complaint is that it sticks to my metal backdoor! nothing wrong with the product itself.I have also had to use screws to secure the top extendible bar. i used two screws for each end and then one in the middle. My kids would hang on the screen and it would pull down.Also, the adhesive Velcro strips don't last long and i've had to use one screw at the bottom of each side to secure it. I think it is a great product. Just needs a little tweaking.
