review/summary: Needed to upgrade 2012 Macbook Pro Memoryreview/text: I purchased this set specifically to upgrade my 2012 Macbook Pro memory but knew I would need the variety for other electronics since everyone is making so many different screw heads these days. Recieved it as expected and on time and made the upgrades without a single hitch. Because the screws are so tiny it was a big selling point for me to have the bits be magnetic and sure enough I dropped 2 different screws during the first upgrade and was saved from trying to find them because of this feature.The kit is conveniently sized and now stays with my desk with 3-4 other key tools so that I always have it available when needed!
