review/summary: Very handyreview/text: I bought this for two reasons. 1st was to help determine why our power bill kept steadily going up(computers left on and an aging deep freeze) and 2nd because I am planning to install a solar array and needed to know where I could cut power usage in order to size the solar system correctly. The P3 worked excellent even though I didn't use all it's functions it allowed me to collect the data I needed.
