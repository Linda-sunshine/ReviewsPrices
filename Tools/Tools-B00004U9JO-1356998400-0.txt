review/summary: Poor quality, they don't last.review/text: I've had 3 badger units go bad in the past week. 2 leaked through the bottom and one rusted frozen. I handle property management issues, so I'm seeing these don't last. One was a 1/3 hp unit, 1 year warranty - leaked. 1/2hp -leaked, says a 5 year warranty but I question why the warranties are 2 years old. Another 1/2hp unit frozen. I managed to free it up with the wrench, but it sounds horrible now and I suspect it too will leak soon. Read the review on Home Depot!! you will see these are crap. They worked great at first, but fall apart quickly.
