review/summary: Still working after a week!review/text: I bought a 2012 V-Rod Muscle and either H-D or Chi-Town H-D in Tinley Park, IL had already installed a battery charger connector. All I had to do was plug the tender into the connector and it was ready to go. No messing with the battery. Before you start taking your bike apart, look around, there may already be a tender connector.The bike had been sitting in an unheated garage in 20*F temps for over a week. The battery was somewhat depleted so the tender started charging and the light was red. After a few hours it flashed green showing 80% charged. Then it went solid green showing a fully charged and monitored state. The tender has a long cord so there is no need to use an extension cord.A few days later it warmed up a bit (thank God for global warming) so I took the bike for a 20-mile ride. It took 5-seconds to disconnect the tender and the bike fired right up with a fully charged battery.
