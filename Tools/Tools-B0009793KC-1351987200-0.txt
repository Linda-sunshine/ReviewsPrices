review/summary: Not pleased at allreview/text: I bought this 2 pack of water filters thinking I could save money by getting two at once. They fit right and seemed okay but the water tasted nasty even after flushing gallons through the system. I wrote it off as a bad filter. Put the second one in and it's slightly better but the water still has this weird taste. I will never order this type of filter again (I assumed with the 'Pur' name on it, it would be okay). I'm also assuming they were new and not used, but either way, I am not pleased with this purchase. I just ordered a different filter that is a 'Kenmore' as I've used in the past.
