review/summary: Perfect for a truck I drive sparinglyreview/text: I have a truck that I drive about once a week. When I start it up, it seems to struggle just a bit to turnover. Since car batteries last longer fully charged, I bought this float charger to keep the battery happy. Now the truck turns over just fine.There is a larger, 1.5 amp trickle charger available but this one brings my battery to a full charge in about a day after a short drive. Since its just a "wall wart" with a cord, I plugged it into the same outlet as my garage door opener and bought the cigarette lighter adapter. Connecting the truck is quick and easy and I never have to mess with opening the hood. Note that you must have a cigarette lighter adapter wired for always-on power for this to work or you'll have to re-wire it accordingly, though.
