review/summary: Very pleasedreview/text: We are very pleased with the netting. It's exactly what we thought and it keeps most of the bugs out (with the exception of when you go in & out of the house). Our only issue is the velcro that you use on your door frame. The netting will only be used in the summer and we don't want the taped velcro to be a permanent fixture on the door frame. It's unsightly. So we haven't used it.....without it, more bugs come in through the sides. We're just using masking tape for now until we figure out another solution. Overall though, I'm glad we have it and I wish we bought it years ago!
