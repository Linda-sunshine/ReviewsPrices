review/summary: Works great so farreview/text: Needed a power strip for my computer area. Wanted one that would protect from strong surges (i.e. lightning). Haven't had to test that functionality yet (thankfully), so I can't vouch for this product in that area, but I like that it has lots of plugs oriented in various directions. It makes it easier to accommodate weird-shaped plugs. I also added1-Foot Extension Power Cable, 5-Packso that all of my power bricks would fit. The two products together suit my needs perfectly. I actually have this same setup (power strip with extension cables) on my flat-screen TVs as well.
