review/summary: This WORKS!review/text: We have some &#34;visitors&#34; from time to time and they seem to bypass most other trap options. This is the only one that works (2 so far) and it's easy, reusable, quick and not messy. It also seems to be the most humane choice (catching them and letting them go is not an option because these suckers come back, and back again). Highly recommend.
