review/summary: No soft water here!review/text: I was excited to find a water softener on line to help soften the hard water we have in my town. However, after using it for several weeks, I find the water to have the same properties as before. My hair texture has not changed a bit. Although I like the shower head itself, I am very disappointed in the results of the softening filter.
