review/summary: Very versatile ladderreview/text: This is a perfect ladder for a homeowner. I don't know that it would be as good for a professional since it is very heavy compared to a fiberglass step ladder or an extension ladder that isn't quite as long. It really depends on the application. But for a homeowner that needs a step ladder every once in a while and an extension ladder twice a year to clean out the gutters it is a perfect combination of the two. I have had mine for over two years now and I just absolutely love it. I have used it in every capacity that it has. Even with the ladder extended fully in step ladder mode it has never felt shaky or unreliable. The rugged hinge assemblies on the side are tough, but very simple and easy to use to convert your ladder into what ever shape you need for the particular project that you are on.
