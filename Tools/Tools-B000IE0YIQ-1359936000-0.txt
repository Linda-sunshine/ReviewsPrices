review/summary: Black & Decker Air Station Inflatorreview/text: I got this product because I wanted to be able to power it through the power outlet in my garage, rather than the car's cig lighter. It worked fine for the first tire. When I got to second tire and connected it to my tire air valve, the plastic connector broke. I figured I was going to get more uses out of this...
