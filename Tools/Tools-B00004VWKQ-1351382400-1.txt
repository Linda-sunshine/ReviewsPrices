review/summary: Really? I don't think so.review/text: I was a professional chef for years, I still do all the cooking at home, and now I am an amature woodworker as well. This gives me both a lot of experience sharpening knives and other various sharp edged tools, as well as a pretty good idea about what sharp is.What this tool leaves behind is not close to sharp. It does cut and leave a nice angle on the edge of whatever it is you are trying to sharpen which could be sharpened if you were able to maintain that angle or want add a second bevel to it. I don't mean true it with a steel; I mean sharpen it. This tool does not.I was looking/hoping for a convenient way to quickly re-sharpen a knife or tool in the field. If there is one, this is not it. What it leaves behind would be suitable for an axe, hatchet, or machete, but not much else.I do most of my sharpening by hand, but if you lack the experience, skills or proper stones to do this, there is only one powered device I would ever let near my kitchen cutlery. If you want really sharp knives, spend the $100+ for a Chef's Choice 120Chef's Choice 120 Diamond Hone 3-Stage Professional Knife Sharpener, Whiteor 320Chef's Choice 320 Diamond Hone Knife Sharpener, Whitesharpener and follow the instructions to the letter _OR_ bring your knives to a professional to have them sharpened.
