review/summary: Small size, quality-built filterreview/text: I replaced my broken Brita filter with this one recently, and it's a big step up. First things I noticed were that the Culligan is much smaller than the Brita in terms of height, and the Culligan has metal hardware that mates the filter to the faucet. My previous filter used plastic for these parts, and it was a continuous hassle to prevent leaking and spraying water. The Culligan was easier and quicker to install than the Brita.Another improvement over the Brita is the on-off pull bar. The Brita used a twist mechanism that often was slippery and awkward to use. This Culligan filter is quick and easy to pull the tab out to enable filtered water. When you turn off the tap, the filter automatically returns to the unfiltered setting -- no more guessing what setting you had it on last time you used the sink!One more observation is that even when using the unfiltered setting, the overall flow speed of my sink is slightly reduced. For me, this is a plus and prevents me from spraying water on the counter when doing dishes. Your own experience may vary.
