review/summary: Great organizerreview/text: This Evriholder 5-item Wall Organizer is just right for my purpose. It works smoothly and easily; just set the handle of the broom on, and lift it out to use. At 17&#34; wide, it fits nicely behind the side door going from house to garage. When the door is open, the organizer is out of view, and in space that would be unusable for other things. I really like this item for broom, mop, duster, and such. The template, mounting hardware and instructions were all there, and made this small project easy to do.
