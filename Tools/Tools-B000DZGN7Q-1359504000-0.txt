review/summary: so far it has been goodreview/text: Replaced a very small horsepower builder model that was terrible. So this was a great replacement. I have had even more powerful disposals in other homes but this one does the job and was priced fairly good considering what these cost these days. I like that it has stanless steel cutters and gets the job done. Thanks Waste King! Not having had it for too long I can not give it an endurance rating yet, but I would hope it will last for many years. I will update this review if it should breakdown, but I am hoping it will last. At one time you didn't have to give that a second thought but as with so many things made in recent years that seem to break after a year or so I now hold my breath when purchasing anything.
