review/summary: Very helpful tool for anyone trying to heat or cool their living space with oil heater, fan, or non-electronic acreview/text: I've only had this device for a month or so, so reliability is unknown. But I can say that it works well to manage the temperature in a room, within the capability of the heater you are using.I marked it down one star for two reasons. First: the display is of low quality and is not back lit. So you may need a small flashlight or to program the unit in a location with very good lighting.Also, already on one occasion, I used the buttons to override / increase the current temperature, and it is supposed to then revert to the program upon the next cycle. But instead, it shut down the heater until I was so cold I woke up. This has not happened since, but I think the program in these thermostats might have a bug or two...
