review/summary: CHEAPLY MADE; BAD BULBreview/text: Victor M230 Ultimate Flea TrapI DON'T HAVE A FLEA INFESTATION. THE PRODUCT WORKS AS IT DID CATCH TWO FLEAS THE FIRST TWO DAYS. HOWEVER THE BULB BLEW OUT ON THE THIRD DAY; I GOT A NEW ONE. NOW IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE OF SOME PROBLEM IN CONNECTION. TOO BAD. IT IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT TO MAKE A WIRE TO A BULB THAT WORKS MORE THAN A DAY OR TWO
