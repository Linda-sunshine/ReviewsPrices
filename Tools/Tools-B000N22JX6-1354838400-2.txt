review/summary: I have not seen my energy bill yet but thanks to this heater so far I have not turned on my gas heater.review/text: I live in a house with a roommate who is rarely home. I'm also rarely home because of work. Plus, in times when I am actually home I'm in my master bedroom 90% of the time. Therefore turning on gas heater has been a huge waste of money. I decided to purchase this heater after reading the reviews.With this single heater, my master bedroom is kept in a desired temperature. I would set at 70 degrees when I'm not at home and increase to 75 once I'm back. It takes a while for the heater to reach the desired temperature but it definately does the job.I cannot say how much it has saved me in energy cost yet, but during winter season I spent about $100 on gas bill.I will update my review once I receive the electric bill.
