review/summary: Works perfectly as desired!!review/text: Bought the screen, it set up very quickly and easily just as expected. Took a little coaching for the animals to learn to how to go through the new screen but it works so nicely now they can let them selves in and out when we are home and we don't have to worry about them needing water or to go potty.I am very happy with this screen and I will buy a new one if and when I need to. I love the ease at which I and my pets can come in and out of this screen and not have to worry about bugs getting in.This screen is relatively heavy duty and installation is a breeze. I would recommend it to anyone look for an easy solution to replace a screen door.
