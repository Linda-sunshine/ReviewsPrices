review/summary: Nice little heaterreview/text: I bought this because it was one of the higher rater electric heaters. I use it in my bedroom in the winter time. With the bed room door shut this little heater does a good job of heating the bed room and I find that I have to turn it off after awhile. When I first got it I used it in the living room but that was to much room for this little work horse. It did keep the area where it was set up warm. The big question is would I recommend it to someone else. The answer is yes, if you need it for a bathroom or a small bedroom.
