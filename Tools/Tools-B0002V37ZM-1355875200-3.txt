review/summary: Perfect!review/text: I bought this to hang my Swiffers and my Bissel long reach Duster. It hung very easily on my pantry wall and I have never had a problem. I have a regular Swiffer in it and a Swiffer WetJet. The WetJet is very heavy and the grips on the wall organizer hold it perfectly fine.
