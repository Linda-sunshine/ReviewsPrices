review/summary: Nice Looking, Quality Keypad Deadboltreview/text: We got a Schlage Aged Bronze Camelot Keypad Deadbolt installed when we joined airbnb and did not want to give visitors a key they could potentially copy.Pros--It matches our oil-rubbed bronze Kwikset door handle perfectly.It does not look tacky on the front door.It accepts multiple codes.It is easy to program. (We keep one code that just we know and temporarily add codes for visitors.)The keypad lights up.To piggyback on another reviewer... The keypad only makes it possible to turn the deadbolt, instead of turning it. This conserves battery power.It comes with a key, so you will not be locked out if the battery runs out.Cons--So far, none. We just had it installed last week and it has worked perfectly so far. I will update this review if anything changes.I recommend this product.
