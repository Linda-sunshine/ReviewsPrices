review/summary: Works great in a pinch!review/text: I love having this on my keychain. I often find myself needing and a small screwdriver for various quick repairs at home and at my office and this tool fit the bill. I even made use of it several times on a camping trip where we had forgotten to bring tools to assemble a small grill. The only minor downside of this product is it can be a little bit difficult to open at times, but then again its good to know its secure to your keyring and won't accidentally come off. The tool slim but solid and blends in nicely with the rest of my keys, despite being longer than a standard key.Overall an incredibly useful and versatile product and all for less than $10!
