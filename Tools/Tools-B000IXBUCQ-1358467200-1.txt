review/summary: Decent but the description isn't accuratereview/text: Good, bright light. The description said something about how far it would light a &#34;target&#34; up. It's inaccurate. This light reaches no further than your average 3 cell flashlight. I would say the only good things about this are that it's typical Maglite rugged built and I assume (haven't had it long enough to be sure) that because it's LED, that it will use less battery. Therefore, you won't be spending as much money replacing batteries compared to a conventional Maglite. Decent purchase.
