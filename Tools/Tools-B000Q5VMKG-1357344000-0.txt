review/summary: First Alert CO615 Carbon Monoxide Plug-In Alarm with Battery Backupreview/text: I had to read the instructions to find out that you can't just press the TEST/SILENCE or CO READING button, you had to press and HOLD the button to receive the desired action. Once I learned this simple trick the device works very well. I've only had it installed for about a week but so far I'm happy.You have to just trust that the standard CO/SMOKE detector installed in your home is working correctly. You can never truly determine whether an alarm is &#34;real&#34; or a &#34;faulty&#34; detector. I had a faulty detector in the basement furnace room and it took two days to prove that the alarm I occasionally received was a false alarm. In the mean time the wife and dogs were running around &#34;wild eyed&#34; at intermittent times. I have since replaced the faulty detector and all is quiet and calm again.I recommend this detector to anyone in need of an alarm or just testing their existing alarms.
