review/summary: old school low tech...but it seems to work greatreview/text: I have had a serious mosquito problem at my suburban house in the north east for at least 10 years now - it is probably due to lack of natural predators for the mosquitos. I have tried chemical yard spray - works moderately OK, and even the big expensive propane burning lighted traps (fan and light both requiring plug in) but the bugs had taken over. This year was as bad as I can remember in past 20 years. I bought this 40 watt Flowtron based on some good reviews here and I am definitely not disappointed! I put the device on a tree limb roughly centered on my 1/3 acre lot on a Friday and by the end of the weekend on Monday we noticed a drastic reduction in the mosquito problem. After about 1 1/2 weeks we are having almost no problem with the little blood suckers. I put it on a light timer set for about 6 hours in the morning and about 6 hours at dusk to try to minimize killing of good insects.I am a very technical scientific minded person, and I could not give credit to anything else besides the Flowtron for dramatically cutting down on the mosquitos. The number of bites I got immediately prior to placing the device was on the order of at least 3 to 4 bites per hour, and after about 4 days of operation, in similar weather and temperature, the bite count went to basically zero per hour. Construction seems good and the grid seems to stay pretty clean just requiring a blast from a leaf blower to clear in out when necessary.I should have bought this thing years ago.
