review/summary: Excellent Disposalreview/text: This disposal works extremely well. It replaced a Badger 5 that was worn out (a cutter came lose and completely froze the unit), I am happy with the way it functions. It make a loud noise when it starts (a one hp motor is powerful) but within one to two seconds it is very quiet. I had it installed by a licensed plumber: the &#34;easy fit&#34; connection required a call to the 800# (answered within two minutes} to get the alignment correct. If replacing a badger with the three mount bracket the adapter kit will be required unless the sink drain is replaced also ( as I desired in my case).It completely grinds everything I have put in it in the 3-4 weeks that I have used it.
