review/summary: Very pleased with it overallreview/text: I use it 2-3 times a day minimum. I walk the dog & use the main door to get in & out. I do not carry any keys & its a breeze to use. Love when I can set up & delete codes. Its easy to do. Used it for 4-5 months now & no issues so far. Dreading the day the battery dies but till then - its awesome.
