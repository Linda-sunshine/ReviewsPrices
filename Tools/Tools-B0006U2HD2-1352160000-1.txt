review/summary: Simple but great productreview/text: Have used these for two winters to protect well head, pipes in barn and water pumps mounted on service trucks. Works as advertised and hasn't failed us yet. Replaced $ 30.00 thermo controlled device that we had to build boxes for to maintain portability. Recommend.
