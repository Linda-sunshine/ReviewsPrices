review/summary: Good filter, good water; indicator light must be changed manually (whirlpool gold)review/text: Works as a replacement for my original filter, Whirlpool filter # 4392857Note: the "Change Water Filter" light inside of my fridge did NOT update automatically after I put the new filter in. To get the indicator light to change from red to green, I had to do it manually - pressed the button quickly 5 times in a row (Whirlpool Gold side by side fridge).
