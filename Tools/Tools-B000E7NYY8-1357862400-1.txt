review/summary: works well!review/text: Simple to use. I have it set up in a small animal shelter for monitoring heat from electric heaters without regulators.Two factors for recomendation after a couple months use:I continues to work, and keep temperatures comfortable.I controls my costs in not overheating the shelter.I would buy this again.
