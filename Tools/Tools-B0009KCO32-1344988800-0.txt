review/summary: Works surprisingly well!review/text: Bought this product to help keep the flies out as we like to leave our back slider open for dogs during the day and it has worked very well. Occasionally we still get flies in the house when it doesn't snap shut properly, but it's been very minimal compared to just leaving it wide open. Have been pleasantly surprised by the product. It's important to get the right size for your door and attach all velcros for a secure fit.
