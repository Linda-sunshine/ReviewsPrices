review/summary: A fine replacement for my previous InSinkErator machine...review/text: This is the second disposal unit I have purchased and installed in my home. I purchased this same sized unit about seven years ago shortly after we first moved in. It worked well for those seven years - right up until my wife unknowingly turned it on with a glass measuring cup inside it. That pretty much instantly killed my old unit, so I got this identical unit to replace it.Installation was fairly easy, and should be for you, as well, as long as you are doing a replacement and not a new install. New installs are considerably more work! We've been using this new unit for about two months now, and it performs just as well as its predecessor. I'd recommend this model for regular kitchen duty.
