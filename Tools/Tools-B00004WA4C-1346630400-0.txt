review/summary: Dies out after some amount of timereview/text: The only reason I purchased this unit was that it was a replacement for one of them in my condo, and I didn't feel like installing a new mounting plate. As expected, it fit right in and with a good solid twist, locked into place. The old one was working fine, but then one day started chirping. Thankfully, the codes are listed on the unit itself, and the one chirp every 30 seconds turned out to be the "alarm malfunction" code. I don't know how long the alarm was installed in the condo, but I was happy enough with the unit that I simply ordered a replacement.It's been six months and the unit is working fine, but now my upstairs unit (same model) started doing the same thing. So I ordered another replacement for that one, too. I don't know how long they last, but it appears that they are designed to expire. They do contain a small amount of radioactive material, so it could just be that the material expired.Other than that, it seems to work fine. It goes off if I'm frying something (but I consider that a plus) and I like that it announces, "Fire! Fire!". So many devices beep nowadays, it's nice to know precisely what is causing the sound. It can be a little difficult to unscrew it when it comes time to change the batteries.
