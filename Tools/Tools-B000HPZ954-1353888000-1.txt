review/summary: I probably need to look at replacing this.review/text: We bought this because we required a power outlet/surge protector with a longer cable. However, some of the outlets just don't work. I've checked the protector itself and it seems like it's functioning properly. I can swap outlets for some of the items plugged in and they will magically start to work in one outlet where it didn't work in a different one. I have no idea. It's very annoying. Had I realized this issue when we first got the item, I would have returned it.
