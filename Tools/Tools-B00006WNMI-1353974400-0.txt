review/summary: Clogged after 2 months. Culligan doesnt care.review/text: I bought this in June, it stopped working by august. Went around and around with culligan, treated as if I was an annoyance. Corporate said to call the local office, the local office said to call corporate. All they seemed to want to do was pass the buck to eachother and tell me they didn't carry this in their stock. Ridiculous. I'm tired of the runaround. I give up, lesson learned.
