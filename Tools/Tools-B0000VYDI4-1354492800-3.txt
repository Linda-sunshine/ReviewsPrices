review/summary: Great Ladder a must have for Homeownerreview/text: I have been looking for a Ladder for general use at home to clean leaves, do some paint touch up and just for everything. I have been eyeing on this Ladder and alas finally on Thanksigiving week it was on lightning deal so i grab it immediately. THe ladder is very strong and sturdy. I have a basic cheap Ladder from Big box store which i purchase 2 years ago and it does not compare to this. THis is the real deal and a must have for every home owner. The only thing is this is kinda heavy but again it's strong so expect this to be heavy but manageable to carry. It will take time to get used to how the ladder works but once you try it you will get used to it. Very easy to use.
