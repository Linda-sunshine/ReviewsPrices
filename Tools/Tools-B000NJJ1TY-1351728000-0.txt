review/summary: If you drop keys....review/text: I dropped my house keys one afternoon in the pasture behind my house. Looking for the keys took one hour.Now with the keypad on the door, I don't have to carry a key, therefore I can't lose the key.It was relatively easy to install, and it's looks great.A very pragmatic product!
