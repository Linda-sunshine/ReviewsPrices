review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: I needed a battery tender for storing my motorcycle over the winter without having to remove the seat to get to the battery. I have only had this product this winter and it was easy to use and install. Indicator light is very helpful and easy to understand as well. My motorcycle battery is charged. We will see come springtime.
