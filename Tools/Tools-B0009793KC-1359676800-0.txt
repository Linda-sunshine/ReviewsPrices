review/summary: Cleaner waterreview/text: Just replaced my really old filter with this one and I am happy. It will not rock your world if you already had a filter but you will notice a pretty large difference if you didn't have one. I live where the water typically taste very chlorinated and this helps a ton. I am on a 6-month subscribe and save!
