review/summary: Fantastic!review/text: Love love love this garbage disposal. My husband installed it in about 10 minutes after it arrived and said it was very easy. It works great - we have yet to put something in it that it can't handle. Banana peels, apple cores, potato peels, etc are all handled with ease. It seems slightly quieter than some other disposals I've used. Great purchase at a great price.
