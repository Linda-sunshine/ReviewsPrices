review/summary: VERY easy to install, very quite as wellreview/text: This is the first time I have attempted to install a garbage disposal and boy was it a piece of cake! Once it was installed, the only annoying thing I can say about the unit that I don't care for but I know I will eventually get used to is the clicking sound it makes when you initially turn on your disposal, after that it is very quiet and it grinds up food scraps with ease! Believe me, if I can install this, anyone pretty much can!
