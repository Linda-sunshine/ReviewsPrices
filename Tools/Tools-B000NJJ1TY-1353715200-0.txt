review/summary: buy this lockreview/text: this lock is great...you can set it to work like a regular lock where you just push the lever to open it, or you can set it to lock each time you leave, requiring you to enter the code to unlock it from the outside. The great part is that you don't need keys. I was forever opening the old lock with a key and them leaving them in the house the next time I left. Then I had to go to the garage for a spare key to get in and retrieve the key chain with the truck keys, etc., which was in the desk. Then back to the garage to leave the spare key. Now the keys just stay in the truck. If I need to lock/unlock the truck I can do it with the keypad on the drivers door, so I don't need the remote. Of course when I'm away from home I always use the remote and take the keys with me. This was an exceptional buy at $100 on sale...worth it even at full price.
