review/summary: It's what I expectedreview/text: I've had this for a while now (maybe a year?) and I still have it on my keys so it's pretty durable. I like having a useful key chain, and I like the key shape. I'd say I've mostly only used it for cutting open boxes.. and I think I've used the screwdriver once.Additionally, I did get this when it was several dollars cheaper. It's a fine key chain but I'm not sure if I'd buy it for $8.
