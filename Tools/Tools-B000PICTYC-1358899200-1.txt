review/summary: awesomereview/text: I can't rate its durability as i have just basically added it to my weapon collection, there are other reviews and videos that do that. i will say that it arrived sharp and in fine shape. It even shipped quickly during the holidays. i am very satisfied. It looks and feels great to hold. I imagine the tomahawk would make a good camping or breaching tool or a good zombie weapon. (there is a video for that too lol.)
