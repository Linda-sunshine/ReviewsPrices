review/summary: Very useful for electronics repairreview/text: This kit is very useful for electronics repair, particularly the Torx tips, which are needed for many cell phones and laptops. The quality is adequate for the price, but not up to the level of German or Swiss tips (of course those are ten times the price). Overall a useful kit to have, and fully adequate for home use, and the plastic case is a good organizer.
