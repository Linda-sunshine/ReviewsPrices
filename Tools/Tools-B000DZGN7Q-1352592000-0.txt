review/summary: Good Disposalreview/text: This is a good disposal with a powerful motor and quiet operation. This model is a little large so if space is tight you might want to take measurements before ordering. Also, I think the design is a little ugly. It looks like old USSR military gear but for the price and performance that's a small gripe.
