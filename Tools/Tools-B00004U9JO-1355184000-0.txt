review/summary: Missing Gasket in Shipment?review/text: The price for this garbage disposal was very good, and it currently appears to be working okay. However, our maintenance man who did the installation told me that there was a part missing from the package, and asked if the package was opened. Specifically, he didn't find a gasket and a plastic tube that attaches the garbage disposal to the pipe, and the connection leaked without a new gasket after his initial installation. Fortunately, he had the gasket and pipe from his own supply of garbage disposals from Badger, and apparently was able to raid his own supply for these parts, but had to charge me additionally for them. Now I recall that the box that the garbage disposal arrived in looked that maybe it was retaped, so that it does not appear impossible that the gasket and tube were removed prior to shipment by someone else. But I can't be sure. So, I guess that you get what you pay for. Anyway, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the garbage disposal continues to work based on user comments here because my old Badger 5 worked well for more than twenty years. (The motor was still good on the old one, but the casing was rusting out. I sealed the holes on the old one repeatedly with plumber's epoxy, and that would last for six months or a year each time, but I finally decided to get the new one.) These days, though, you never know, because perhaps they now manufacture them in China.
