review/summary: keypad lockreview/text: This lock is OK but turned out to be very big. The door I put it on had the pushbutton lock below and the back actually hits this. I do not know if I am going to try to cut a piece off or just change to another lock. Otherwise worked fairly well but a lot bulkier than I expected.
