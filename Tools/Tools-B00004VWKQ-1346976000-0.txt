review/summary: Good value, good toolreview/text: easy to use. knives get sharp. inexpensive product. what's not to like?If you are unsure about using sharpening stones (which, with the correct set of skill and effort can make the knives sharper than this product can), and don't need the blades insanely sharp, this is the thing for you.I could tell the difference after just 2 or 3 swipes with my dullest knives.heads up: metal shavings get left behind on the blade and sharpener, so rinse them puppies off before storage or use.
