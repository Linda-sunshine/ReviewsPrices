review/summary: doesn't work for dirtreview/text: This product really depends on what you plan to use it for. I used this product for an archaeology dig and it did not work for 8 hour days digging in the dirt, it was hard to grasp articfacts, and it did not prevent mosquitoes from eating my hands. It was very uncomfortable to hold a shovel and the dirt would go through the material so my hands were still covered with dirt by the end of the day. However if you are suing this for something less dirty and not involving mosquitoes it might be fine!
