review/summary: Good thermostatreview/text: I bought this for a refrigerator to brew beer in at 65 degrees. It does a good job of keeping the temperature constant at 65 degrees. This is not what it is designed to do but works for me, though not perfectly. The line to measure the temperature is only 1/2 inch long which means I have to keep the thermostat in the refrigerator which in turn means I have to have two electrical cords going into the refrigerator. This makes it inconvenient for what I use it for, but still works since I only need to get the temperature to 65 and the leaks through the door at this teperature are negligible. A longer cord for the temperature probe would be helpful for me and probably for other uses that may need to regulate the temperature someplace other than where the electrical outlet is located. I thought about cutting the wire and splicing in a long length of wire, but I did not know how that would affect the temperature measurement. The price is good and it can be used for a heater in the winter so overall it gets 4 stars from me.
