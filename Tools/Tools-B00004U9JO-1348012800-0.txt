review/summary: Broke after 3 years of light usage, replacement has no cordreview/text: This thing fell apart after 3 years of light usage and to my surprise it only had a 2 year warranty. My fiance bought me a nice one but it didn't fit in the space so I ended up with another badger. I went to install it last night and when I went to attach the cord (rather than just having one preinstalled) the instructions mention that you should attach the cord (NOT INCLUDED) -- emphasis added. They could not even charge $2 more and include the cord?
