review/summary: Great taste, small sizereview/text: After using Brita for past 5 years, I moved to this based on so many positive reviews, and reasonable cost. I am glad that I moved. Taste is similar or better than Brita, and the cost of filter replacement(with subscribe and save discount) is nearly half of that of Brita filter for the total of 200 gallon filtering.size of filter system was small, and installation was easy and quick. I can't think of any negatives. Just wondering that why I did not start using this earlier.
