review/summary: Worked ULTRA fastreview/text: I bought this item because I had a mouse in the garage. Within 5 minutes of putting this device up I had a mouse trapped. Easy to dispose. Put the trap back in case the mouse had a friend and sure enough about an hour later caught another. Best mouse trap a must have
