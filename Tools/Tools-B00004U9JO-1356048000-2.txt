review/summary: Easy to replace.review/text: I replaced my old badger that was over 10 years old. After reading many negative reviews I was leaning towards another brand, mainly because the reviewers stated that their badgers did not last. But since my lasted over 10 years, I thought I would go with one again, It was very easy to replace and I was pleasantly surprised that it was much quieter than the one I replaced. I am happy with this purchase.
