review/summary: Great tomahawk!review/text: Delivery was fast, even do a made a mistake with the delivery date,(they gave me an estimate date from Aug/ 22nd till Aug/27th) I wrote an email and the product got home quite fast as I needed it by the 24 right before the week end. I was able to take it on the trip with me!The tomahawk looks and feels great and is easy to throw. Also very sharp and comes with a nylon protective sleeve.Love it.
