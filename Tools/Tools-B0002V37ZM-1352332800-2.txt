review/summary: Just OKreview/text: First, for ANY wall mounted tool holder, check your geometry carefully. Because the working end of any tool is likely much wider than the handle end, you can have at most two tools at the same height. Which means that you have to put the tools at different heights. Have a look at the product picture - three tools occupy two heights above the rack. The ones in positions 2 and 4 have to have their working heads BELOW the handle ends of the other 3 and also different from each other (they're too close to allow any width in the working heads). That means that you need a great deal more height than the longest tool you're planing to hang. In many spaces e.g. a normal closet, this won't be possible and you'll be storing far fewer tools than the 5 shown in the product photo.As for this unit in particular(a) it's quite deep (3.5") which again is a problem in a small space (b) the "rolling ball" grips are cute but they don't work well on thin or thick handles - they want standard mop sized handles (c) and the roller grips depend on friction - if you ever get anything oily or greasy on them, the tool will just slide through.All in all, simple hooks might be a better choice.
