review/summary: Great!review/text: I love this product for helping me organize my laundry room. It does hold my thin handles swiffer very well as well as everything else I tried. My only complaint is the screw holes are deep and narrow so I had trouble finding something to mark where the holes needed to be drilled. But once I got past that everything was smooth sailing.
