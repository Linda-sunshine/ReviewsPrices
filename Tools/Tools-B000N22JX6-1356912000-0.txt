review/summary: Great Heater!review/text: I love this little heater! It is perfect in the bathroom! It heats our small bathroom very well, we don't even need to use the oscillating feature! It's quiet, efficient and the perfect size for a small bathroom! We have also used it in a medium sized bedroom with tall ceiling, and like the results there too (also without using the oscillating feature). It wasn't super warm in the bedroom, however, it was comfortable!
