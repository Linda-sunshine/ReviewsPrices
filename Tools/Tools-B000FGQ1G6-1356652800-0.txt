review/summary: OK, but not great. Bits are soft.review/text: This item does work. The bits fit. The case is fine. Only problem is the metal used for the bits is too soft. I have bent/twisted a couple of them under normal use. I am not abusing them. Kind of disappointing, but I guess I should not be too surprised given the price.
