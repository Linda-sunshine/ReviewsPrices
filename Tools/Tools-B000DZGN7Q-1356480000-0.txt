review/summary: East Installreview/text: I was able to swap out my old and put this in within 20 mins. No leaks and the thing is so quiet and yet so powerful. This was on sale and was well worth the $90-ish that I paid for it. It came with the rubber thing that you put in the sink and doesn't require plummer's putty.
