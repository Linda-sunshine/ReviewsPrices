review/summary: Intimidating Tomahawkreview/text: Lets be clear, this is not something for chopping down trees, it's a weapon! This is not for lumberjacks. The original version was used in the jungles of Veitnam but had a wooden handle and was used as a weapon/tool. This version from SOG is a big improvement and for the little money it cost you can't go wrong. I will use this as part of my BOB. It's light weight and sturdy and can be very intimidating in the right hands as well as being useful as a breaching tool or around a campsite or even for field dressisng game. My wife carries a large knife with her BOB so this compliments our preparediness if the SHTF. I read some reviews where some have said they enjoy throwing this tomahawk and I agree it can be fun but in a combat situation, unless you're an expert, I'd advise against trying this. In most cases you're just going to give the other guy another weapon. I've been through wilderness survival training and spent a lot of time in the back country and if I could only choose one tool to have this would be my choice.
