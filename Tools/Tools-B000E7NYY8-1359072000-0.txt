review/summary: Great investment but ..review/text: ....make sure whatever you are using it for has a mechanical on/off switch (the switch is in a different position when the unit is on than when it is off). In other words, if the heater/air conditioner stays on if power is removed and restored, great: that's what this is designed for.I turn the heat off completely in our house in the winter and use an oil filled space heater in the bedroom. The unit has been flawless in getting to and maintaining the temperature I want. However, the unit can't make a space heater (and I assume an air conditioner) adjust the temperature faster than the heater/A.C. could do on normal conditions. So if it's really cold or really warm, adjust the timer accordingly.The first one I bought shorted out but the replacement has been flawless.
