review/summary: It broke right after the warranty was up.review/text: I had my house built, all new appliances, and expected things to last longer since I don't cook and am not in the kitchen much. WRONG! But, the biggest shocker is that the Badger disposal is broken. What? How? Why? I don't put much down there outside of toast and ... well, soft foods. No utensils. I don't have young people playing with the disposal. I just don't get it and am highly disappointed in this product.When you're looking for a disposal - stay away from Badger!
