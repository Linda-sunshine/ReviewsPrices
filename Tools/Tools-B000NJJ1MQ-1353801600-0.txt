review/summary: wouldn't fit on my doorreview/text: I was going to use this on a back door that has a half-lite (large window). The edge of the window moulding prevented me from being able to mount this lockset on the door. Also, the satin nickel was a different shade that the knob set already on the door....As it didn't work for me, I returned it.
