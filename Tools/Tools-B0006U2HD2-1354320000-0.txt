review/summary: Item was defectivereview/text: The premise of this item is great and would have solved a problem, i.e., turning on a heated outdoor pad for a feral cat. When the outdoor temp was 28 degrees, the pad still had not turned on when it should have been on at 35 degrees. We returned the item in Nov. 2012, even though the time period for returns had expired. Suggest that if planning to order, do it closer to the time it will be used. We ordered in April but cold weather does not hit Tennessee until late fall. We had no way of knowing the item was defective until the three-month return period had expired by a few months. Technically, Amazon could have refused to refund our money, but they did make an exception under the circumstances. We give one star for the item, and five stars for Amazon!
