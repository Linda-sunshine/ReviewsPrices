review/summary: Turn off the dark....review/text: Purchased this flashlight over a year ago. Did not need to use it much until last week when the power was lost for days with Hurricane Sandy. Well let me tell you, it is truly amazing how bright this flashlight is. Point it to the ceiling in any room and it will light it up completely. Take it outside at night and you will also be amazed. It is also fun to see how much brighter it is compared to the older Mag light I have. I will be ordering a few more of these for friends and family. For a little over $20 there is no reason not to have this in your closet.
