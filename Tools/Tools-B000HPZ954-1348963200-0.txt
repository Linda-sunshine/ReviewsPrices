review/summary: Finally Enough Outletsreview/text: I bought this for my home theater setup to replace three daisy chained 6-outlet strips that had the outlets so close together that only three or four were usable when power adapters were plugged in. The Belkin is laid out nicely to accommodate six power adapters and six standard electrical plugs. It has a built-in cable manager that keeps things neat although this feature isn't shown in the picture on the web site.The only complaint I have with the product is that the phone and coax jacks are not labeled as input and output. There is a diagram on the accompanying instruction sheet that identifies which is which, but I doubt that I'll be able to find that at some future time when I'm trying to reconfigure it. I took off one star for this omission.
