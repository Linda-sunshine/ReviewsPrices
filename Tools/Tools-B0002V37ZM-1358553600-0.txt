review/summary: It Works.review/text: Mounted this in my laundry room on my drywall. Included with the unit are those plastic anchors you need just for that purpose. The unit has 5 mounting holes thoughtfully positioned to safely balance the weight of the unit. I leveled it out, marked the holes, drilled where needed, gently hammered home the anchors, and mounted the device all in a matter of minutes. Finally got my brooms and mops (yes, the Swiffer too) off the floor and out of the way.
