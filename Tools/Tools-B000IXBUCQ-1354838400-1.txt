review/summary: Always wanted onereview/text: As a dude, I've always wanted one of these heavy duty flashlights. I was not disappointed. I accidentally dropped it right off the bat and I think it hurt the floor. Very sturdy and the light is unbelievable. All I had on hand were some no-name dollar store batteries and it's still unbelievably bright. I didn't know you can adjust the beam by twisting the top near the bulb. Great flashlight.
