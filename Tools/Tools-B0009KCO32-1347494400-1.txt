review/summary: Perfect for an apartmentreview/text: I normally wouldn't buy something I saw on one of those "As Seen on TV" commercials but after reading a Times article about how this product was really worth it I decided to buy one. I live in an apartment and this screen allows me to have the front door open and let in the fresh air but keeps the bugs out. It was worth every penny. I have no problems putting it up. The first time we put it up it took a little bit but that was only because we wanted to make sure we have the velcro in the perfect places. I would recommend you buy the Velcro Extreme Indoor/Outdoor Rough Surface Fasteners, 1 inch x 4 inches and the 1" Square Adhesive Rubber Magnets. With these to extra items it made the screen perfect. I will definitely we recommending it to all of my neighbors.
