review/summary: Pretty Impressedreview/text: I recently replaced both garbage disposers at home from the InSinkErator Badger (pretty much the default for all home builders) to the InSinkErator Evolution. The Badger, though works and performs, has some quality issues and are known to stop working after 4 or 5 years. One of mine gave up, so I knew it was time to replace them. I went with Amazon as it was about $70 cheaper than Home Depot. They arrived quickly and installation was quite easy. I chose to replace the sink drain that holds the disposer as I enjoy home projects and wanted to spend the extra time to make it brand new, but if you already have a InSinkErator you can actually mount the new unit in the same drain mount you already have.Pros:more powerful than the badgera lot quieter than the Badger. I couldn't believe it was on and runningrelatively easy installationcan reuse drain mount and drain from other InSinkErator unitsCons:Need to buy the power plug as the unit doesn't include oneA little bigger than the badger. If you have limited space below your sink, make sure to measure
