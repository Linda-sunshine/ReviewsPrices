review/summary: SOG TOMAHAWKreview/text: HAD 2 OF THESE TOMAHAWKS. THEY LASTED OVER 1,000 PLUS THROWS. WHEN THEY BROKE I CONTACTED SOG AND THEY SENT ME REPLACEMENTS. THE REPLACEMENTS 1 LASTED 3 THROWS AND THE OTHER LASTED 7. SENT THEM OFF AND WE AKSED THEM IF THESE WERE MADE FOR THROWING AND THEY SAID YES. TOOK OVER A MONTH TO GET THE OTHER 2 BACK. FINALLY GOT TO PLAY AGAIN AND THE 3 THROW 1 BROKE AND MY OTHER ONE IS STILL IN ONE PIECE BUT HAS THE SCREW'S MISSING OUT OF THE HEAD ALL READY. I MEAN IS THIS A JOKE? DID THEY CHANGE THE QUALITY OF THE HANDLE? OR WHAT. I JUST WISH I CAN GET MY MONEY BACK NOW AND GET A COLD STEEL!
