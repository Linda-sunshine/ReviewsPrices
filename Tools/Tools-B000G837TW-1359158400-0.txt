review/summary: Can't go wrong with this unitreview/text: I highly recommend the Evolution Series to anyone looking for a new garbage disposal. I agree with a prior reviewer, there are other places where you can find the Evolution Compact for more money, so it's worth buying from Amazon unless you want to go to Home Depot and pick it up the same day and pay more.I installed the unit in one hour. Great instructions.Product Features:Two Grind Stages Quickly Grind Difficult FoodsAt Least 30% Quieter Than Standard DisposersIdeal Choice for Small Households and Restricted Cabinet SpaceQuick Lock Sink Mount Allows For Easy Installation and Replacement of any Disposer4 Year In Home Warranty on Parts and LaborBest part about this purchase is it Ships from and sold by Amazon.com. I'm a Prime member so I got it in two days.
