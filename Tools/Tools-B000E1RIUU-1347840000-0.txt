review/summary: There is a better mouse trapreview/text: After several attempts over several months to catch the mouse that had been reeking havoc in my house, I finally came across the Victor M2524 mouse trap. What a dream! It caught the mouse after the second night (when I moved it to the proper location) and I have been mouse-free since. It is easy and safe to use and I have recommended it to everyone who will listen.Thanks Victor for such a great product.
