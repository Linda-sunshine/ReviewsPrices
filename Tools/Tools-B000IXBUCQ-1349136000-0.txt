review/summary: Very, very bright flashlight!review/text: I just recevied this flashlight and it works great. Much brighter than I expected it to be. Very long range outside at night. You're able to adjust from a very narrow beam to a very broad span. I'm considering buying another one to keep around the house in the event of a power outage or for security purposes. I also purchased the clips to mount it inside my bedroom closet so I always know where to find it. Quality product for a reasonable price.
