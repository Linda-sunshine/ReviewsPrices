review/summary: Made it so sharp I almost cut my finger offreview/text: I was so used to not really having worry about my knife being sharp enough so I was a little careless the first time I was chopping onions with my newly sharpened Victorinox. I seriously cut myself with my awesomely sharp knife thanks to the Accusharp. It didn't need stitches but man did it hurt.Accusharp for the win!
