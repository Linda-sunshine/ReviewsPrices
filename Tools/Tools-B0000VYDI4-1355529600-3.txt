review/summary: Best ladder we have.review/text: This is our new favorite ladder. So sturdy... so much sturdier than any of those wooden &#34;A&#34; frames we used to have. I don't feel at all nervous on this one. You can use it as an &#34;A&#34; frame or as an extension ladder. It is quite versatile. I also like that it folds to a relatively small size for storage in your garage. It's sort of heavy to lug around compared to the old wooden style ladder or even some aluminum ladders but... it's just so worth it because of it's stability and it's ability to transform into different styles of ladder.
