review/summary: FAILSAUCEreview/text: Worked ok for a few hours then just made a bizzare clikity sound - very much like one of those plastic wind up toys after you wind em up & let em go - instead of switching power to a space heater it was controlling. Clearly they cut too many corners to bring this to market. Don't buy.
