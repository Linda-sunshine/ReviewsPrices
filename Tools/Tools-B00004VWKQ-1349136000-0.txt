review/summary: It Worksreview/text: This product actually works. I have used it to sharpen all of my knives, my axe, chisel, even my putty knife. So easy to use, that you actually keep knives sharp, because it only takes seconds to hone your knives to razor like sharpness. I am hoping it lasts for a while, but at this price it really doesn't matter. My electric sharpener is gathering dust.
