review/summary: Great booklight.review/text: This booklight is just what I wanted. I am a junior in high school and I have great grades, but this year I wanted to give sports a try to lose some weight. I didn't want sports getting in the way of my studies (for my games can go into 8 or 9 at night) so I bought this light so I could do my homework on the bus.The adjustable neck is really convenient because I can put the light at virtually any angle I want down on my paper. It stays hooked on my clipboard tightly and provides a nice bright light for me to work under. Hard not to be impressed with this product.
