review/summary: This thing is awesomereview/text: I wanted a professional flashlight for camping. This is not really a good tool for hike-camping as it's heavy (3 D batteries). But as a general tool for creating light outside, it's amazing. Even just in my backyard this thing illuminates the whole place. The pushover for me from the 2 to the 3 cell version is that this one lasts a very long time: 79 hours.The spotlight dial is great. It moves from a pretty great spotlight to a very broad ring, with a slight, less-light hole in the middle.Camping, with the stars out, the beam is visible when you turn it towards the sky, for maybe 30 feet.It's balanced well for carrying. The rough section of the metal is in the right spot. And it is a high-quality-feeling flashlight.
