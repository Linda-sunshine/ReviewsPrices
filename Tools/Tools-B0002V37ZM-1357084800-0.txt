review/summary: So happy!review/text: I couldn't put this up I had to have the hubs do it when he got off work, you have to drill holes into the wall then put in the plugs...whatever. Too difficult for me, that's why I'm giving it a 4. I'd much rather have something that's easy for everyone. Other than that, holds everything perfectly (even my Swiffer with that itty bitty handle) and it looks great! I'm extremely happy.
