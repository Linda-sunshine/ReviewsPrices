review/summary: I got zapped on this zapperreview/text: This product has an electric cord about as long as my index finger, and the mosquito repellent stick on the bottom packs you are suppose to stick on the bottom of these zappers will not stay there. They keep falling off. There needs to be a compartment or a small latch of some kind to hold these in place. For that matter they want $35.00 for a few of these things. The zapper itself only cost $49.00. Don't bother with this. Buy some bug spray! BK-40D Flowtron Electronic Bug Killer---NO
