review/summary: This thing is fantastic!review/text: I got one of these for my boyfriend for Christmas last year, because he's always needing a tiny blade and sometimes a screwdriver. He loved it, and of course his sister gets a hold of it after him only owning it a few hours, she uses it wrong and it got bent a little bit, but it still works and closes tight, just a little off-centered. 9 months later, the only real damage to it is still from his sister bending it.He's a mechanic and is really rough on his things, he's gone through 3 duct tape wallets in the past yearish and completely destroyed a pair of combat boots just from normal (for him) use, but this thing is still working great, sharp, and used pretty much ever single day! Just don't let your older sister use it to open her kids' overly packaged toys with it. I'm definitely buying him another once this one wears out, but at this rate, it'll be a while. :D
