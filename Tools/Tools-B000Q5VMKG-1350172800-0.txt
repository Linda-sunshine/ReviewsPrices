review/summary: Carbon Monoxide Alarmreview/text: California now requires such alarms in double-wide manufactured homes. This one from Amazon was reasonable in cost, has a cord to be plugged into an outlet and if the power goes off, there is a battery back-up. I told others in our small community about this alarm, as it meets state standards at a reasonable cost.
