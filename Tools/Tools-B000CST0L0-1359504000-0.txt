review/summary: Reliable and does exactly as intended.review/text: Just a standard, no nonsense remote control switch that works reliably. I needed an extra remote door opener next to an inside basement door. Rather than try to hard wire another remote switch to my opener, I just programmed this switch and stuck it next to the door. Used with any purple programming system garage door.
