review/summary: It does what it says it willreview/text: It works fine for what it is built to do. I will keep it and use it. I was looking for a small compressor that would blow air so I could clean my spne heaters. This doesn't do that but it will inflate stuff and you can preset it to only go so high in air pressure. It will come in handy.
