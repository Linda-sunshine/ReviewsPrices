review/summary: better than expected!review/text: Great item, it is performing better than expected after reading other reviews. It will only hold pole type cleaning items, no dust pans or small brushes. No problem with any of the items falling. Smooth and easy to hang and remove items. Would purchase again. It does require you to drill about 5 holes to mount the item to your wall or cabinet.
