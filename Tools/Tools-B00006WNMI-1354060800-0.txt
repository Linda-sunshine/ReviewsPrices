review/summary: Water Tastes Good; Needs more Replacing than previously anticipatedreview/text: If you read the instructions thoroughly, this piece is quite easy to install. Unfortunately, it only comes with one filter and the instructions say to replace this filter every 50 gallons...which differs from the listed 200gallons in the description.The water tastes more clean to me and there is no longer an after taste of metal pipes. However, it pours slowly and when you have the faucet set to the standard, unfiltered flow, it also pours more slowly. I actually kind of like that aspect.
