review/summary: Tastes a lot better than Brita pitchersreview/text: I've been trying to use Brita pitchers for a long time, but I still can't get the weird taste of my tap water out so I normally have to resort to bottled water. Not with this filter. I fill up a big pitcher and put it in the fridge and it tastes like the well water I grew up on - perfect. The weird iron and chlorine tastes and the disgusting smell are gone. I've found my filter.
