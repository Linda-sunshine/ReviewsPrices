review/summary: I like Itreview/text: Because of the overwhelming number of positive reviews, of the 626 that were posted at the time of this writing, I felt safe in ordering this product. When it arrived I was not disappointed. It has a dozen outlets, protects my cable and phone service and takes up relatively little space. It does everything I needed and more. No complaints so I give it 5 stars and when I need another surge protector I will get another one of these.
