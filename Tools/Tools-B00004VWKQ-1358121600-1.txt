review/summary: Sharp, unfinished edge in 10 passesreview/text: Like the many other reviews have mentioned, this sharpener works. It does pull a lot of metal off the blade, but in 10 swipes you will have a sharp edge on your blade. This does not create a finely honed razor-sharp edge, but it does produce a very sharp edge good enough for daily use knives.I'm very happy with this product, and encourage others who are looking for a quick and easy way to resharpen their cutlery set or pocket knives.
