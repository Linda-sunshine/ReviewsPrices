review/summary: Keeps my rarely driven car ready to goreview/text: I don't drive much, and my car can sit in the garage for a couple of weeks between uses. I've been having a problem keeping the battery charged, especially in the winter. It's always started, but it clearly is struggling to get the engine to turn over.My mechanic offered two suggestions: drive more or get a trickle/float charger. Since a charger was only about $20, I figured it was the better route to take rather than waste gas.I looked at a couple of similar models, especially the Black & Decker BM3B model (Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer) since the price included attachments to plug the charger into the car's power outlet. However, since my car (an Infiniti) does not have a "hot" plug, those attachments would not have been of any use.The Battery Tender Jr had a lot of good reviews, so I gave it a shot. So far, it's been working great. It took about 24 hours to bring my battery up to the full charge level. The unit is very easy to use, and all the attachments are well-made. The LED status lights clearly indicate the charge status. The only quibble I have is that the charger unit does not have a cord - it plugs directly into the wall (or, in my case, into an extension cord). The next model up in the Battery Tender line (the Plus) has a cord, and also charges faster, but also comes in at twice the price of the Junior. So I went with the Junior.Very pleased with this, and highly recommend it.
