review/summary: Leaking afer one yearreview/text: I have gone through sooooo many filters and I love this one, so I am getting another. It is still under warrenty but for $16 it's not worth pursuing. I'm just going to buy another one. It suddenly started bulging at the top when the water is on showing several cracks in a star pattern and leaking from the very center. Maybe our water pressure is too high. Well, I can't do anything about that. I repaired with duct tape and now it's leaking through the duct tape. The plumber who replaced all the plastic parts in our toilets with metal parts said that the plastic parts melted from too much chlorine in the water. So maybe that is what happened to this filter, but that's what we need the filter for...to remove the chlorine!
