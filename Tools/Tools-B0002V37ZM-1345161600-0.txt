review/summary: Evriholder Magic Holder 5-Position Wall Organizerreview/text: In all fairness I am using this product for unintended purpose. I bought about six to line part of my garage wall to hold tools, etc. The gravity gripping feature works fine if the tool is not too wide. I previously attached one to an outside brick wall near my propane grill to hold various grilling tools. It works fine also.
