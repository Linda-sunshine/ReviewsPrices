review/summary: Didn't work for me.review/text: I was excited by the prospect of catching and killing fleas without spraying chemicals all over the house. I got the flea trap yesterday and when I was trying to configure it noted that the bulb seemed a little loose in the socket. I did my best to tighten things up and when I plugged it in, the bulb exploded and tripped the switch on my breaker. I went out immediately to our hardware store and bought another bulb of the same size and wattage. When I plugged this in, it no longer worked at all. I threw away the whole contraption before I was able to ever test it out. At $12 it isn't worth the hassle to try to return it.
