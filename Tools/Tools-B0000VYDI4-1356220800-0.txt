review/summary: Bent legging. & heavy!review/text: For actual use its a great ladder. The few spots I dislike is the hooks used to secure your adjustments. I feel they were poorly thought out. Hard to pull out and adjust and when weight is applied the torque and don't sit perfectly in not h. To use this ladder you may have to have help. It's truly a heavy beast. I'm 6'3 230 and this thing gives a run for the money. When in operation it's works great. I love the versatility. If you are someone who will occasionally I'd recommend this. Frequent users be Leary. I bought this for 160 so great value here.
