review/summary: Awesome!review/text: My son and I have been out throwing this at everything. It has a good weight, well made. Good size. Nice looking. Sticks in wood if you aim right, chops at it if near miss. It's plenty sharp. We are not experts in this area but we would both recommend this tomahawk! I think I will buy another for myself.
