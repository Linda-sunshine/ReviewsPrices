review/summary: these traps are the bestreview/text: I have used every kind of trap under the sun, these are the best by far. If you have a mouse in your house you will definetely find it dead in this trap. THe best thing about it is that you can open it up and dump it and you can actually do it without even seeing the mouse if you and squimish. I also hear alot of people talking about baiting there traps with peanut butter. i have tried it with little success. I am going to tell you that Ruffles sour cream and cheddar chips are the best bait ever. I am telling to, try it and you will see, mice love them.
