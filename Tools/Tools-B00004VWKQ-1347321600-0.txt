review/summary: EASY, DURABLE, & WORKS!review/text: I have used this exact model sharpener when I was a journeyman Insulator & Lagger for over 20 years...I am not in the trade any longer, but I still like to use this tool on all my knives at home! I still have the original sharpener, but it is getting old and worn - so I looked around and was happy to have found the product-line here on Amazon! Accusharp has added many different models since I've first bought mine (80's - pre-internet days) - but this review is on this model - so let me give you a few tips from my experience:~ The sharpener is great and leaves a razor-sharp edge...but understand that it is not a honed edge and that it removes metal from the blade each time you draw your blades across it. In other words...I wouldnt use this on a set of $1000.00 Henckel knives - cause if you sharpen the blade consistently...it will eat away the blade and turn them into filet-knife width!~ If you are going to use it on good knives...use it sparingly and just a few passes to get an edge - than maybe hone it with a stone or other honing tool to keep the edge longer.~ This is great on double-edged blades...axes, knives, and even works on serrated edges.~ When the blades get worn (this will take many sharpenings - so you may not need to ever worry)...you will notice that the knives edges wont get as sharp as you would like...so, you can just open it (3 or 4 screws) and switch the blade positions...now...what used to be the innersides - will now be the untouched outersides and BAM - you have a new sharpener again!~ Careful when sharpening the blades...the sharpener has a finger-guard...but if you consistently rub sharp blades across it - there is the potential of cutting thru the plastic and possibly your fingers!~ I love this sharpener and think the price is well-worth the expense...I have paid more and have received much less! So...feel good about this purchase - you will not be disappointed.Enjoy!
