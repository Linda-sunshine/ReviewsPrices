review/summary: Works perfectly for us.review/text: The building in which we now live is over 100 years old, and the wiring hasn't been updated in some time. So, we have only about one or two outlets per room (none in the hallway). Thankfully, we have a pretty spacious living room, which comes with three outlets. But, because of the ancient wiring, the electricity can't keep up with all our gadgets and gizmos. Plus, with our new daughter, we've got some more electronics that plug in and out on occasion, such as the soother and breast pump.Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that the outlets obviously don't provide enough plug-ins for our stuff, and the single bar power surges aren't up to snuff, so, after researching one of the favored ones on Amazon, I ordered this power surge and couldn't be happier--so far. We've had it only a few weeks, but it's already convenient.My wife and I especially like that some of the outlets on the Belkin power surge are on the sides, so we can plug in the big bulky ones that have the power bricks on the end with the pins. This allows us to actually be able to use the full line of outlets in the middle, which many can't. Now I'm able to have my Atari, PS2, PS3, hard drive, other powered accessories for the PS3, our TV, lamp, router, modem, and my wife's breast pump all plugged in without having to take any out. Another feature I like, which I'm not sure if it's standard, is that you can hear a "click" when you plug something in, which tells me it's fully in. It's a neat little touch I like that I haven't had with our power surges.I haven't used coaxial power, but the end of the power surge does also come with a cord wrap, which is nice.
