review/summary: bought tworeview/text: I bought these for my front door and back door. I could only use one for now. The back door dead bolt is to close to the handle so this would not fit that door. I will hold on to the second one till I get a new door. The lock went on easy but I recommend you read the direction. We have been using this for a few months now and I must admit it works great. We do not find ourself fumbling for keys and the button to light up the keypad works great. it does make life easier getting into your house.I would recommend this to family and friends.
