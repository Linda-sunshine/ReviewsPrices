review/summary: Bond would have carried one of thesereview/text: I've had mine for years, and finally decided to give them out as gifts. The plus: Everyone LOVES them. They're very cool/hip/useful. The minus: Now I'm not the only one around that has that "cool key!" I can't tell you how many times this little guy has been useful to me, or those nearby. Enjoy!
