review/summary: Not really 13 feetreview/text: The product description is not very clear. I needed a ladder that was 8 feet tall when it is double sided. The product description never says exactly what it is. The 13 feet is when it is single sided and fully extended. But, when folded and double sided, it is not even 6 feet. Now I have to return it and start all over. Plus, it is very heavy and hard to carry around. The first thing the manufacturer has to do is list measurements in all positions.
