review/summary: Great Tomahawkreview/text: This is a great tomahawk. The end of it is a short length and great for chopping small pieces of wood if that is what you would like to use it for. It has a great design and is easy to hold as it is very light. I would recommend this item because the design is awesome and it comes with a case for the blade which definitely makes it easy to store or pack with camping gear.
