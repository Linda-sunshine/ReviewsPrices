review/summary: Only worked for 3 weeks...review/text: This flea trap is very effective! My infestation is out of control and this sucker is catching 50-60 fleas in a week. Awesome! However 3 weeks after purchasing, the bulb has blown out. Now it's useless to me. Hopefully I can buy some replacement bulbs, because I'd like to try to keep using it.
