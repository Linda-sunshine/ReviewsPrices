review/summary: holds yard & garden tools off the groundreview/text: Received this garden tool rack for Christmas. It's holding a street broom, a rake, a hoe, a car washing brush thingie, and a garden spade, under a cedar deck outdoors. We rack the heavier tools with the tool end up and handle side down. This winter we're using the hoe and spade for breaking up icy spots on steps and walkways. So far the rack is holding up.
