review/summary: Works as espectedreview/text: Already use it for one year. It control my rooms temperature perfect during the night. save me a lot of electricity. Without it, because of poor insulation of my bed room which is exposed to north wind, the bed room temperature is always below 65 degree F even the wall thermostat is set for 72 degree F. Now, with Lux WIN and a small heater, I can easily make my bed room temperature stays at 70 degree F.
