review/summary: Great productreview/text: I recently received my Culligan FM-15 faucet filter, and was very pleased, by the size, the ease of instillation, the water. and the fact that the filter last twice as long as any other brand. I had a Britta previously, and was sorry I didn't read reviews before buying that junk.
