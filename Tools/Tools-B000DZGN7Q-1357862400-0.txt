review/summary: powerfulreview/text: easy to mount and quieter than expected. The only drawback so far is the easy mount makes the opening diameter non-standard to normal sink drains, need to store 2 drain plugs now. The smaller size doesn't seem to affect its ability to suck food through the opening.
