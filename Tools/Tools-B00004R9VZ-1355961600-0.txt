review/summary: Good Productreview/text: Bought this as a present for my sweetheart--it has a nice blue glow for summer evenings on his porch. We hang it on a shepherd's hook, at the far end of the porch. Mosquitoes were the main concern, but we have noticed other irritating bugs were lessening. A year ago, his porch was swarming with these gnat-sized irritating bugs that swarm around the head. Now they are gone. Also, we had some nasty mosquito illnesses down here down in Texas, but with the placement of the Flowtron, no mosquito bites since using it every summer night. Do read other reviews that recommend cleaning procedures. We are very satisfied with this product.
