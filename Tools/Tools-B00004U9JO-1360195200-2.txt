review/summary: Don't Buyreview/text: We had to replace after 8 years and had to get the same unit because of space. It's very cheaply built and rusted out and started leaking water. Unbelievable how cheap they make this product.We've had garbage disposals for 35 years and this is the only one that's rusted out.
