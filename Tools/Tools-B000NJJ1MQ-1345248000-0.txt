review/summary: Works great - looks greatreview/text: I have two of these at my house and have used them at work for a few years. They seem to hold up very well - the batteries seem to last at least a year of lots of use. I like the schlage locks better than some of the other brands. (we have a cheaper brand at work too and it doesn't seem to look quite as nice and the box that is on the inside side of the door is much larger.
