review/summary: Wow! What a difference!!review/text: Let me start by saying that I live in deep South Texas and we have really hard water down here. I initially bought this showerhead because of scale build up in the shower. It stated in the description the filter would help with scale build up, so for twenty bucks if it helped keep it in check, I figured it'd be worth the money...then I took a shower with the new showerhead. WOW! Could not believe what I was missing. I felt somehow cleaner and my skin actually felt soft after just one shower. Installation was a breeze, the hardest part was removing the teflon tape from the previous showerhead. The new showerhead even comes with it's own teflon tape for installation.Definitely happy with this purchase, and buying it as a Gold Box special was a bonus.I'll update to see how long it takes before I need to replace the filter.
