review/summary: Worth every penny!review/text: This is my first Werner. I have seen the same item at Home Depot and have seen demo on how to use the ladder. I decided to purchase the ladder after seeing the deal on Amazon. First the shipping was great. The ladder arrived in 2 days and right on time as I was putting up Xmas light. I love the easy and flexibility of this ladder. It was easy to pull apart and reset to different configurations. It is a little heavier than other aluminum ladders, however, it is compact and can be easier set up by a one person.
