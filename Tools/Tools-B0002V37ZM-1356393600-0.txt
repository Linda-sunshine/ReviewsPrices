review/summary: A MUST HAVE ITEM!review/text: I was getting sick and tired of my brooms and Mops and DUST PAH being stuck between the Refridgerator and the wall. If I WANTED the Mop, the broom was in the way and Vice Versa! I wouldn;t have even noticed this if Amazon hadn't listed in my Quick Picks, but I DID... and I'm glad I did. Now all these items are on the INSIDE of a closet door! UNSEEN and IN ORDER!This appeared to be the best model for the money, and after I installed it (EASY even for a &#34;Handyman Beginner!&#34;)I can't understand what the other more expensive models were offering to justify the increase in price as this one does the job.
