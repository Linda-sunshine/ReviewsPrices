review/summary: Does what I need it to do.review/text: I wanted a good surge protector for my office. The cord is plenty long and it protects power, coax and ethernet. My only complaint is that in my application, I am hanging it horizontally and the mounting holes are designed to mount it vertically. Not really that big of a deal because I just used four strips of heavy duty velcro to mount it. Don't over-think this one; it does what it's supposed to do and is a good buy.
