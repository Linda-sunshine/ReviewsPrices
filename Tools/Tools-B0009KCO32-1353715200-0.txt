review/summary: Great option for those who can't have a screen doorreview/text: We purchased one for our front door because we are renters and our landlord will not allow a true screen door. This has worked out nicely. It keeps the bugs out while letting the fresh air in. I have found that it is not exactly 'hands-free' when going in and out. I often need to turn around and fix the magnets so they connect. Overall, this is a good product and definitely solves a problem for those of us who don't want bugs inside, but want a breeze!
