review/summary: Advise against - Disposal leaking from bottom of unit near reset switchreview/text: Today I opened the kitchen cabinet and noticed water dripping from the bottom of this garbage disposal. A quick internet search shows many customers with this same problem. The unit is not customer repairable but must be replaced. The leak damaged the cabinet and dripped into the basement. I will not purchase this brand again.
