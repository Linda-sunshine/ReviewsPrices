review/summary: Highly rated -- Works greatreview/text: Although we have only had this disposal installed for about a month, it is working very well. It is VERY quiet, and has taken everything we have thrown down it without any problems. Over the holiday we put ALL of the potato peelings in it and held our breath (we could never do that with our old disposal). It worked perfectly ! We did the installation ourselves, and found the instructions to be very easy to follow, with only one step that didn't work out. We finally figured it out, but would recommend the manufacturer include some troubleshooting tips in the instructions.
