review/summary: Been Working Great for Two Seasonsreview/text: I've got this outlet thermostat connected to a window mounted evaporative cooler and it works great. It's been controlling the temperature in my living room for 2 years, and I've never had an issue with the programming or the schedule. I like that it has a temporary override feature as well to bump the temp up and down for a few hours without messing up the daily schedule. Highly recommend.
