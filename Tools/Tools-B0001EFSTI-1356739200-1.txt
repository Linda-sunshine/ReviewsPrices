review/summary: I give these away...review/text: One buddy told me the Utili-Key I gave him was &#34;life changing&#34;! I will not guarantee that this will be the same for you. I will say that the Utili-Key can change your life more than that silly novel The Promise ever could. How you ask? Well, would thinking positively fix a prospective client's glasses on one of the biggest sales calls of your entire life? No, it would not. But the small Phillips head on the Utili-Key would. That actually did happen with me. Would visualizing yourself opening up a package from Amazon actually open the package? No. But the knife on the Utili-Key would. I think you can see where I'm going with this review...
