review/summary: flashlight you can trustreview/text: There are tons of flashlights. Recently, many other companies are trying to imitate MagLite by making similar design "aircraft aluminum" flashlights which are shoddy quality and made in china. I tried one of those. It died on me on 2nd use. Don't be fooled. Maglite is the original and the best heavy duty aluminum flashlight. Very reliable, very bright and made in the USA. It will not fail. I would not trust any other flashlight at all and that says alot.
