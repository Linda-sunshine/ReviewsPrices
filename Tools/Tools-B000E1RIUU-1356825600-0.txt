review/summary: Nice ideareview/text: First delivery was damaged. Amazon replaced it quickly and without hassle. Otherwise, it is a well made device. You put peanut butter on the back wall of the device, just beyond the electrocution pads. There are holes on the wall, presumably so the little critters can find the peanut butter. They have managed to clean the peanut butter from the outside and inside of the death chamber (long, skinny tongues?). So far, no trophies. I'm planning to offer weekend cat sitting services.
