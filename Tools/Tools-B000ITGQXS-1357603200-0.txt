review/summary: Excellent Book Light!review/text: I've had a few book lights, over the years and this is by far the best! It is bright enough to light up two pages, at once. Its neck is long and flexible, so it is easy to get it into whatever positions you prefer. It is sturdy enough that you could fall asleep while reading, roll over the light a few times, and it would be fine. The light itself is pleasant, not too yellow or too blue and not glaring. It also doesn't pulsate, like a CFL light I've tried. In addition to all of this good stuff, it takes standard AAA batteries! Those silly disc batteries are expensive and sometimes a pain to find. There's just nothing not to like about this light.
