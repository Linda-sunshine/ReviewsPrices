review/summary: Good Ladder!review/text: Great ladder. Very solid with good workmanship. I'm 65 and I have trouble working with my fingers due to arthritis. I was concerned that the latches would be hard for me to manage, but they work very smoothly and take little effort to set the ladder to the length and configuration needed. Highly recommended!
