review/summary: Great productreview/text: This is the greatest thing. I've been looking for a controller like this for a long time. Most either control just heating, ot just cooling. This is selectable and can be used all year for all seasons for heaters and fans. In the winter I place a fan behind my wood burner and plug it into this controller and it comes on when the heat rises, and shuts off when the fire dies down. No more cold air blowing across the livingroom. Congratulation guys! Finally someone is using technology to benefit the average guy with ideas he can't normally devise himself without some monstrosity standing in plain view. Wives will appreciate this if she is married to a do-it-yourselfer.
