review/summary: Great outlet stripreview/text: I don't care about the surge suppression features but wanted more than the 6-outlet trip I was using. This is just the thing. Well made, thin, with a decent length cord. The outlets grip plugs tightly and are well spaced and oriented in several directions so that "wall warts" fit without colliding.
