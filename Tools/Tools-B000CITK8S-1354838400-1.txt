review/summary: Great Product!review/text: I keep my motorcycle and my wife's motorcycle on this tender 24/7/365 when we are not riding. We ride a couple times a week during the summer and maybe once a month through the winter. Our batteries are always at the ready with no issues whatsoever. When we get back from our rides, the indicators on the tender are green within a minute or two which tells me between the tender and the bikes charging system the battery is always topped off. My wife's bike is 4 years old on OEM battery and mine is 3 years old on OEM battery.
