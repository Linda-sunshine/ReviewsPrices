review/summary: Waste King is Kingreview/text: Item lives up to it's name. It is the easiest, quietest, and fastest disposal I have ever installed and used. I have installed four other disposals two from scratch and two as replacements. This one fit like a glove, no major remodeling to make it fit. Wife loves it being so quiet, chops the food super fast. Make sure you read the instructions (I actually did and they are on the money). I did not have to purchase any additional parts, to include pipes. If I have to ever replace another one (for someone else) I will recommend getting one of these.
