review/summary: Greatreview/text: I bought 3 - one for my motorcycle, one for my wife's scooter, and one for my Toyota Supra. I worried whether the 750 ma would be enough to keep the Supra's big battery, alarm, etc. all happy. It does fine, as long as you don't expect it to charge a discharged battery. I'll have to see if they are still good in a few years.
