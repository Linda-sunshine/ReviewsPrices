review/summary: Solid, stable, flexible ladderreview/text: I am completely satisfied. This ladder is solid and stable. The hinges and J-locks work smoothly and positively. The PK70-1 LeveLok LevelerWerner PK70-1 Ladder Leveler with 2-Base Unit Attachmentsfits well and installs easily. (It does require drilling six holes.) The ladder is a bit heavy, but no heavier than advertised, and is easier to carry around and more stable than the extension ladder that it replaced. It is not inexpensive, but it is worth the price, and was substantially cheaper at Amazon than at the big box store.
