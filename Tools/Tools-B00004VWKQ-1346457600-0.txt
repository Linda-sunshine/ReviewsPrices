review/summary: Excellent reviews are right on ..... GREAT knife sharpenerreview/text: AccuSharp Knife Sharpener With Replacement BladesThe excellent reviews are right on! My husband discouraged me from ordering this knife sharpener. He had his sharpening stones and was as happy as pie. "Just another thing for the junk drawer," he said. Now this is his favorite new gadget .... it does such a fine job so quickly. And it is so easy to use .... it doesn't go in any drawer, but sits on the kitchen counter waiting for the next job. Great value at Amazon too ...
