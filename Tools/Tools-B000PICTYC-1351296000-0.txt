review/summary: great tomahawkreview/text: Bottom line, it is a great throwing tomahawk. The blade was really sharp right out of the box. I did the slicing paper test. Was razor sharp. I took it outside and started throwing at a wooden target I made. After I got my distance right I was sinking it every throw. It is well balanced and feels good in your hand. I threw it for about an hour and the blade was just as sharp as before I used it. It is also a good chopping axe for small limbs. I believe it has a lifetime warranty.SOG Specialty Knives F01T-N Tactical Tomahawk
