review/summary: Bad Badger, Bad Insinkeratorreview/text: Insinkerator used to be "the name" is garbage disposals. Now, its just a piece of garbage. Shortly after the warranty expires, so will your Badger 5, but not before dripping water, food goo and gunk under your sink. After reading all these bad reviews, are you really gonna buy this hunk of junk?
