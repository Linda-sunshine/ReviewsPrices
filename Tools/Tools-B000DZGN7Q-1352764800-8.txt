review/summary: everything it promises to bereview/text: This disposal works as good as they say it does in the Waste King literature. We ran into quite a few problems while installing it...it took my husband 6 hours to install...although that may be more his lack of experience, than how hard it actually is to install!After it was installed, it works beautifuly. It's so quiet, I can barely hear it - even while standing right in front of the sink.We love it!
