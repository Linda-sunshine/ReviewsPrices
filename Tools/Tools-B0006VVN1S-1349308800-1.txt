review/summary: Cow countryreview/text: We live in central california, well water that smells bad bad bad, we have a whole house filtration system, but we were hoping to diminish the sulphur, egg smell in the showers even more..this product did diminish the smell a little...not much.This might be great for city use,, for us it did not do what we needed.For the price, this is a good product. Use it for city and I think you will see the differences that they promote.
