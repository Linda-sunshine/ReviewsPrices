review/summary: Good Golly - good price, good product, good servicereview/text: This is a good (ready quality product, trying to take out the hyperbole here). Replaced my old filter, water tastes good, and I have ordered the 6 month subscription to keeps things simple. I did not see any price advantage of the 3 pack (however I used to buy the 3 pack, because it was cheaper).I get one each 6 months, and that will remind be to replace.Tip for those who dont know this - pull off the front lower grill on your fridge to make it vastly easier to grip and twist the old filter out. I found that it made it a good time to clean out the dust bunnies, gross, and they hamper the effeciency of your fridge. I also find it easier to reinstall if the fridge doors are open, you can see the clips that the grill snaps into, much easier.Good filtering.I typically rate 4 stars for quality products, reserving 5 stars from outstanding products. This is very good, and easliy recommended.
