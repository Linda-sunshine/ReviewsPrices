review/summary: Got this as a giftreview/text: I received this as a gift. I use it in my study right by my desk. It does not blow out the fuse like an older one I have. It has not raised my electric bills. When I was using it as an extension cord the cord got hot. I plug it directly into the wall and there is no problem.
