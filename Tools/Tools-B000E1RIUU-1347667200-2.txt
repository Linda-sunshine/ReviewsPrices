review/summary: Electronic Mousetrapreview/text: One of the best inventions of the century! Just need to remember to check it EVERY DAY to see if there is a dead mouse in it. It doesn't miss. I thought I had caught all of them in my RV and stopped checking the trap. By the time I checked it, a dead mouse had decomposed in the trap and was difficult to remove. Also, a rather unpleasant cleaning job. I thought the trap was ruined, as the metal plates got corroded. I cleaned and sanded them and the trap works like new again. I bought two more just in case.
