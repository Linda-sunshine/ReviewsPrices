review/summary: Great DIag Toolreview/text: This was purchased to perform a KillAWatt mod where I hack in a wireless transmitter to do data logging. The unit alone was handy to see what was costing me money. Of course the more time it was plugged in the more accurate the cost was.Pro:Works great!Easy to use options on the frontCon:Large, can sometimes prevent you from using the other outletOutdate design. Looks 'old'
