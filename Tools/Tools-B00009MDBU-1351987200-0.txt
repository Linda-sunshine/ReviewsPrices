review/summary: Does what it is supposed to doreview/text: this product works as advertised and I enjoy using it to monitor equipment power draw. My only beef is that it is an outlet hog and mostly blocks the other outlet (in a duplex setup), so the use a multi-prong extension is almost required if you want more than one item to access the outlet.
