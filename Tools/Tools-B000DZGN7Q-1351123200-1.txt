review/summary: More Grinding Power for Less Moneyreview/text: We recently moved into out newly constructed home. I decided to skip the builder's garbage disposal base option which was a 3/8 horsepower Badger. The area under the sink was prewired for a garbage disposal so I was free to select and install a disposal after we closed on the house. Initially, the lack of a wrench for in-jamming was a concern. But then why is a provision for un-jamming designed and built into a garbage disposal; does the design engineer expect it will frequently jam? The Waste King had significantly higher horse power and rotational speed than comparably priced garbage disposals. Installation instructions were clear and easy to follow. After installation I noticed that water that appeared to be dripping from the bottom. I called the number listed on the instructions. The person at Waste King was very helpful. She suggested the paper towel test (wrapping every disposal connection /opening with paper towel and filling the sink and then releasing the water down the drain to find the leak and locating the leak source by the wet paper towel). Using the paper towel test, I found that I had not tightened the dishwasher drain hose clamp tight enough. This disposal works great and so far nothing we put in it appears to bog it down. It's also much quieter than I thought it would be for a 1hp unit. The lifetime warranty is a plus.
