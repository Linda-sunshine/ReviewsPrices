review/summary: Battery door won't stay closedreview/text: I bought two of these earlier this year. Luckily, we have not had an occasion for the alarms to sound. However, on one of the units, the battery door doesn't close properly, and there is not a way to repair it. It stays open slightly most of the time, and occasionally falls open completely. It has been this way since I received it. However, it was not apparent until I opened the product packaging and opened the battery door to insert the batteries. Due to the packaging of this product in hard plastic that had to be completely destroyed to get it out, it wasn't possible to return it once opened.
