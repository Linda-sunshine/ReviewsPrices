review/summary: Best bug light I have ever owned.review/text: Ok..for full disclosure, this is the only bug light I've ever owned. We have about 2/3 an acre, about 1/2 is trees. I put this thing on a timer and it is on from about 4 PM until 6 AM mon to friday, whenever the temperature is above 50 degrees. It never stops zapping.I also have the mosquito attractant on it. We live in a swampy area of Virginia and the mosquitoes are abundant. There are still mosquitoes around, but the population seems to have dwindled. Whereas, I might have gotten 12 bites in 5 minutes, now i'll get about 4. I will def be getting more of that in the spring. Is it wrong to be gleeful about hearing the zaps?The negatives....This thing ends up nasty. I suppose all of them do, what with them being covered in bug corpses. I've seen the birds eating the crispy critters on the ground, but they won't pick them off the grid. I use a stick and just poke the bits out. oh, turn it off first and don't stand downwind or you will get covered in nasty bug ashes. This is not how the manual says to clean it, btw, but it works for me. I've prob just voided my warranty. I didn't coat it in Pam as another reviewer suggested. Still no problems for me to clean it.My kids wanted me to tell you that the fire flies are gone too. That makes me kind of sad, but they can go play in someone else's yard....
