review/summary: This thing works!review/text: I was skeptical, but for the price, willing to give it a shot. We only have one cat, vacuum every week and were trying to maintain better control of our indoor/outdoor cat's flea issue. We treated her with Advantage II and used this flea trap for about a week - moving it every day to a new location in the house. We only caught 3-8 in any one location, for a total of about 40, which was a relief. But it really worked. The fleas came to it, got stuck and died. We placed it in the same place repeatedly, every other night or so - so it was all through the house. Definately recommend!
