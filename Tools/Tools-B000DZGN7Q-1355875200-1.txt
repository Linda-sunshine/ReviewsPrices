review/summary: Couldn't Be Easierreview/text: This really was pretty much easy as pie to install. I was a little worried because we don't have much room under the sink, but it popped right in. As others have probably pointed out, you need to make sure you seat the gasket that attaches the disposal to the drain as low as possible. A lot of people put it up too high (where it feels like it should fit), and the disposal won't mount. The assembly is all together when you pull it out of the box. Just pay attention to where the gasket is already and you won't have a problem when you put it back on. So far I love it. Easy to wire, easy to install, limited vibration. It has chewed through everything I've put down it and the warranty can't be beat. I'm all about value, and as long as you wait for this to go on sale (Amazon seems to put it on sale for $90 or less every couple of months) then this is hands down the most power for the money you can get.
