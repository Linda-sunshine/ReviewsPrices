review/summary: Faulty equipmentreview/text: I bought this for a flea problem i had but i got it and it was not hard to put together but the bulb blew out the next day i put it on and it would turn off during the night not sure if that is what it is supposed to do but I was not happy with it. Hope it worked for everyone else who got it. All i did was get Hot Raid bombs from walmart and flea powder and took my cat to get a flea bath and the fleas are all gone.
