review/summary: Tastes the samereview/text: I tasted the water straight from the tap and then from the filtered source. I registered no discernable difference. The water here in Las Vegas tastes bad and smells bad to me. In the past, when I have run out of bottled water, tap water is still undrinkable and I have to make an emergency trip to the convenience store. Fortunately, I have many choices to obtain bottled water 24 hours a day because I really can't drink this stuff. All that said, this item does not help my situation. I have a zero water filter system which works great, but I go through a filter every few days, so I no longer use it. I drink about a gallon or more of water every day. To summarize, I wound't recommend it. Also, it takes about 20 seconds to fill a 16 ounce cup. I did follow all the included instructions perfectly.
