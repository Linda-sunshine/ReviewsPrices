review/summary: Very handy, one for every keyringreview/text: I bought four of these, one for each vehicle to keep on the key ring. I use this tool at least once per week. I've tried every type of small multi-tool available and this one gets the most use because its always on my key ring. Never a hassle with airport security, it works great for opening packages and fixing minor problems without having to make a trip to the tool box.
