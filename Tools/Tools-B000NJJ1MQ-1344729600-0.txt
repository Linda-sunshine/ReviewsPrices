review/summary: Really easy to install, easy to operatereview/text: I just got this in the mail and installed it yesterday. It was super easy to install. I'm not that handy, and it took me about 10 minutes to read the instructions, remove my old deadbolt (also a Schlage lock), and install this new one. It's also pretty easy to program and operate. I love it, and more importantly, my wife loves it, too. We're planning to get another one (probably the self-locking version) for a side door.BTW, if you've been looking at the Samsung ones, I also spent a lot of time looking at those. They look super sleek and I like the idea of cards. However, I just read too many reviews where people were running into issues with the magnets not working well, so I deferred on those. When this one showed up on discount as a Gold Box deal, I pounced and haven't regretted it since.
