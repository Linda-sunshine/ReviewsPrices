review/summary: Whisper quiet, fast, effectivereview/text: First, the handyman I hired did not need the electrical cord (just re-used the old one) or the diswasher fittings which I bot with the unit. I was able to return those unopened for a refund, a pleasant surprise.The disposer works better than expected. It replaced a 1/2 HP unit that was 7 years old and sounded like a bad transmission on a Mack truck. It was a bit bigger than expected, but as an added benefit, the necessary re-plumbing makes the whole sink plus the diswasher function better than when I had it first installed.I was quoted $75 to install it, but then needed all the plumbing under the sink replaced plus replacement of one drain. The job ran $150, took half a day.The disposer exceeds my expectations and hopefully will significantly outlast the prior unit.
