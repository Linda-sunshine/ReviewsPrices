review/summary: very handyreview/text: I've had this on my keys for over a year now and it is very useful. Its a little difficult to use but 98% of the time and grateful I have it. One of the pieces on the screwdriver head broke on an unruly screw but for the price and how much I use it, its a great gadget. plus it looks just like a key when folded up and its not bulky at all!
