review/summary: A great battery tender at a great price!review/text: I ride a 1978 Honda GL1000 Goldwing on a daily basis. My alternator won't tender my battery unless I'm riding over 3500RPM (highway speeds), so city riding eats up my battery very quickly. I have no idea why it took me so long to get my hands on this little battery tender, but it works like a charm. It's a trickle charger, so there's no speedy charging - but leave it plugged in overnight, and you will notice a big difference in the way your vehicle starts up. I can even tell a difference in power when I'm on the road! This is a MUST HAVE for any motorcyclist, especially with the older year models.
