review/summary: Exceptional Product - Function Meets Beautyreview/text: Background: This was the first item I bought for my house the day I signed the mortgage. Since then, I have bought two more of these for the back deck french doors, another for a friend as a Christmas present, and the doorknob variant of this (also sold by Schlage). I must say WOW! What a terrific device.Quality: The first one I purchased was 4 and a half years ago (July 2008). It still looks and works great. The 9V battery lasted 4 years in the device. I have owned the two in the back of my house for about two years, and still haven't had to change the battery in them. The finish shows a little dirt of time, but could be easily taken off with some never-dull.Function: Just flawless. I have never had a single instance where this device didn't function correctly. I am ALWAYS able to get into my house, and I never have to carry around any type of key. I can't tell you how many temporary codes I've made for contractors, friends, and such.Overall: it's an expensive gadget, but it is well worth never having to worry about buying a locksmith, or breaking into your own house.
