review/summary: Battery Tenderreview/text: If you are plan on storing your bike over the winter or for a long period of time, you should obtain this product. Since I live in the Midwest and our riding season is 3-4 months (at best) I was trying to decide rather to store my bike at a dealer or my garage. After careful consideration and understanding that it would cost me over $200 I made the wise decision to store in my own garage. All the dealers were going to do was use the Battery Tender as well. Easy choose for me.I would recommend the product to all Motorcycle Enthusiastic!!!
