review/summary: Good home set - computer repairers should invest in a bigger kitreview/text: Sturdy driver and the bits have lasted a few months of constant use, but it's a little weird getting used to the case - it takes a little effort to align the bit to it's position in the case.If this has all the bits you need go for it - it's a great precision screwdriver set. The Tekton 135 piece kit is $20 more if you need everything, and also works great.
