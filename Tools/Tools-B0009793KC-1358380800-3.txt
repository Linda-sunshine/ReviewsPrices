review/summary: Works well, no stinky smell or taste.review/text: Fridge came with our newly purchased house, and the old one needs replacement as the indicator said, so we never used the water and ice from the fridge. Just ordered one of this to replace our old filter, and after proper flushing (let dispenser run though 4 gallons of water) the water tastes fresh and cold, awesome.Haven't tried the ice yet, but supposedly the ice needs to go though 3 full batch of production before usable, so we'll see.For people's water that tastes funny after fresh filter installation, flush longer, the funny taste is from the active carbon and it won't kill u, just bad taste.
