review/summary: Black & Decker ASI300 Airreview/text: This is a handy inflator that I use for my bike, car and golf cart tires. It works well and shuts off when the dialed in pressure is reached. The switch to turn it on and off is quite awkward and the DC cord needs to be pulled out to turn it on and it toggles one way for AC and the other for DC. It's also hard to see what you are doing as it's in the back of the unit. It should be in front by the pressue dial.
