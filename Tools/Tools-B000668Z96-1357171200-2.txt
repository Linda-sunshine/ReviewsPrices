review/summary: Didn't work for mereview/text: I was encouraged by the reviews and maybe expected to see more after setting this thing up near where my cats sleep for the night, but it didn't catch anything except some lint. i even moved it to where the cats sleep during the daytime (near my kids beds) expecting to &#34;lure&#34; the fleas off and more proximity exposure - nope, didn't work either. maybe this is for cats with more fleas, not just a few per cat, but didn't do what i expected.
