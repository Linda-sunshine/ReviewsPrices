review/summary: Fleas no morereview/text: I will say that so far I only caught 3 fleas in this trap but it could be due to treating the rugs, the furniture nightly, vacuuming and treating my pet as well. I believe that whatever eggs hatch, this flea trap can and has caught fleas that perhaps I missed. I keep it plugged it as much as possible and believe that every step you take to get rid of fleas is positive and maybe I have a good hand on the fleas and thus not too many in the trap. Three fleas so far are three fleas less, right?
