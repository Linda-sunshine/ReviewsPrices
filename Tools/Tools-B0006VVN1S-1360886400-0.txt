review/summary: Cleans my dirt water great!review/text: I live in an apartment building that has city water that comes out smelling of sulfer and occasionaly brown. My hair felt disgusting and I felt like I smelled like the water and was self conscious about this until I got this filter. Since I got the filter, the shower water feels so much cleaner, does not smell and never comes out brown. This filter is really great and I'm so glad I chose this one. The power and options of the shower head are also a very nice feature. The water comes out strong with a lot of water pattern choices. This is the one.
