review/summary: Clean waterreview/text: I'm pleased to have purchased this water system and threw out the old Pur. This filter is lightweight, easy to install, and I taste the difference with my water. The pur cheated me out of my money with the the faulty light installed. I think the change filter light came on like a week after I purchased it and the replacement filter was like $20 bucks! On top of that, I read reviews that the pur filter system claims were bogus and the filter didn't get all the chlorine and other remnants that we don't want added in our drinking water. The culligan system suggest changing the filter after so many gallons of water or 2-3 months. My pockets are happy and I like that my family is drinking clean water. Once you go culligan you'll never buy another filter again:-)
