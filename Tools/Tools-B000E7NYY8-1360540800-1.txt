review/summary: so far so goodreview/text: I read the reviews saying this product was prone to failure. The application I have this in is cutting on an exaust fan in a cabinet to keep from having too much heat buildup. So far it has kicked in at about 77 deg when set at 75 and kicked off at 73 2 deg plus or minus is close enough for my application.
