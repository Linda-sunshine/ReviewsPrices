review/summary: Makes a difference.review/text: I can really tell a difference in my skin and hair when I shower at home with this filtered shower head versus when I visit my parents and shower at their house. My skin is less dry and my hair is softer. I still get mineral deposits on this shower head, even when changing the filter every six months, so maybe I need to change it more often. It's still nothing compared to the mineral buildup around the bathtub faucet - good grief my water is hard.
