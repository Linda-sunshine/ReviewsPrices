review/summary: What a wastereview/text: This was a total waste of time and money. I had high hopes, because I'm inundated by mosquitos. The thing worked for a very short time, and never attracted mosquitos. I bought the attractant and used it. One light is intermittant and the grid seems not to be electrified. A friend has had similar success. I just bought a bat house.
