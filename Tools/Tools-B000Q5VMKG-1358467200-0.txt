review/summary: First Alert CO615 Carbon Monoxide Alarmreview/text: We have always used Kidde alarms, but I read reviews on carbon monoxide alarms and this one the First Alert CO615 was top rated. So, we purchased it to replace our Kidde alarm. I like it better than the Kidde because of its size and looks. In testing it, I am certain it would wake even a deaf and sound sleeper like me. Very pleased with it so far. Would recommend this Amazon.com purchase to everybody.
