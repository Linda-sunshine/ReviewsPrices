review/summary: 17 yrs. and still going strongreview/text: bought my first Thermo Cube(TC-3) 17 yrs. ago, wanted something to turn on a light bulb to keep my water pump from freezing, two years ago I thought it had stopped working correctly and begin looking around for a new one, very difficult to find at that time, when I did find it at Amazon.com I was so relieved that I bought two to have a spare for the future, after further inspection discovered the old one was indeed still working just fine and still is today, the Thermo Cube is such an important device to have and the Amazon.com price is so fair that I don't mind at all having two spares waiting on the shelf for when needed
