review/summary: Simple, Foolproof, and Effectivereview/text: This is a simple tool that just about anyone can use and get good results. It will take a dull knife and make it sharp enough to be quite serviceable. For hair-splitting sharpness you'll have to go to a lot more trouble and a much higher level of expertise. For 99% of people (and cutting applications) this should be good enough.
