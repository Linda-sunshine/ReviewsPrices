review/summary: Gimmick that works moderately better than a glue trapreview/text: The first night, I set up the Flea Trap in the main problem area and set up several Real-Kill 5" glue boards, flat on the floor, in other areas. The cheap $1 apiece glue boards caught more fleas than the flea trap. That's pretty sad. After 48 hours, the trap caught maybe 30 fleas where I would say the glue boards caught 50+ each. Victor is charging $15 for a $2 light, a $1 plastic dome, and two $1-2 glue boards. Even an optimistic estimate means they're charging at least twice what this is worth. If this product had cost half the price, I would probably have given it a 3* rating.
