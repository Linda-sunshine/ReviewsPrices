review/summary: No reason not to give it five starsreview/text: Nice product for the money. It had a long cord for the charger and the option of eyelets and alligator clips was nice. I hooked the eyelets to my battery and it is safe to charge while the rest of the electrical system is connected. It takes a really long time to charge a dead battery, but they don't call them tenders for no reason. I plan to leave the eyelets permanently attached to my motorcycle battery...plan is to tuck the remaining cord under the seat. It should work fine for that application.
