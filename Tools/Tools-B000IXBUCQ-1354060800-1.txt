review/summary: Dependable, sturdy flashlightreview/text: The 2D Maglite with LED has all the quality of the original bulb versions, but the batteries last much longer. I've been able to use recycled batteries with much success using this and a 4D Maglite LED flashlight by collecting all the expired batteries from my friends and re-using them.. It requires that little battery life to provide adequate light.
