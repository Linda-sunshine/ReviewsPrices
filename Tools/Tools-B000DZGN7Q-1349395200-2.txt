review/summary: Great disposalreview/text: The L-8000 is a bigger then the ISE PRO333 it replaced that lasted for 11+ years. And I, of little handyman experience, had little trouble removing the ISE connection and replacing with the provided quick connection. I did have to go and replace the provided drain pipe. It was a 90 degree elbow and I needed a straight piece. It has been in place for a week, and it is fairly quite. During start up, it does have one quirk: as it spins the blades up, you get one metallic clacking sound and then the normal whirring.I did not have to buy an adapter, just the plumber's putty for the sink. The electrical cable was already connected so I just needed to plug it in.
