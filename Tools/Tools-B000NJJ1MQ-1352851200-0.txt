review/summary: Perfect for pet ownersreview/text: This lock is a must for every home. weather its the need to get in quick due to weather, or something worse. Not having to fumble for keys is a life saver.With having dogs, occasionally we have to rely on others to let them out, with the keypad lock, we can still lock up our house and have a friend or neighbor let our dogs out.Install was very easy, my wife actually installed it. Battery seems to last a while too, which also makes it easier to use.
