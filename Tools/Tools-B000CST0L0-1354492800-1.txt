review/summary: Extra remote for my gate - works just finereview/text: Bought a couple of these to keep on hand for our gate (gave one to the babysitter and one on hand for the occasional lost or out-of-battery remote). Easy to program and work great. This was the only remote that would work with our gate, though. I wish LiftMaster had one with an extra button so I could program my garage to the other button. All of the remotes with two or more buttons were not compatible with my gate. So, I have separate remotes for each (though they are the same brand).
