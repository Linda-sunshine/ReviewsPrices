review/summary: Loved initially, but extremely short life spanreview/text: I bought this a year ago. It worked great for the first month or so and the bendable portion was stiff enough, but then it started flashing or turning off (not from lack of battery power) and I had to keep fiddling with the bendable portion trying to get it to stay on. Became progressively worse until now when it's virtually impossible to get it to turn on despite new batteries.
