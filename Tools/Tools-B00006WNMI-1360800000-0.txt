review/summary: Agonizingly low flowreview/text: I want so much to give this product a good review. The water coming out of it tastes great and no longer smells like heavy metals. Its insultingly low flow, however, forces an hour to pass before filling a gallon-sized jug. It's come to the point where we avoid the sink in which this filter is installed. Best left on a faucet the only use of which is to rinse toothbrushes. Perhaps the water pressure in this old house is too low to do the product justice. We'll never know.
