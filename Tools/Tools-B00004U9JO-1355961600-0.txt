review/summary: Easy to Install, Works Greatreview/text: I purchased this disposer as an upgrade to our old one. We previously owned a 1/3 hp model, and it was slowly falling apart (It was over 10 years old) So we purchased this model. It arrived quickly, and it comes with great instructions. One note: You will need to swap your old powercord over from your old unit. This does not come with a power cord. I purchased a power cord kit at Home Depot, it's made by InSinkErator, and only cost about $12.00. You will also want some plumbers putty, but that's it! Everything else is included. I'm 24 years old, and a female with almost no experience in home repairs. But I did it by myself, without any problems. Like I said, very easy to install, and the instructions are very clear. It works great! Whatever I put down the drain, disappears almost instantly. I wish it was a little quieter, but I know they sell insulted units that are much quieter. I just didn't have the budget for one of those models. Overall, for the price you pay, this is a fantastic value!
