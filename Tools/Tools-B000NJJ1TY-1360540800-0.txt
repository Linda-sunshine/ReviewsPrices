review/summary: Great but before you buy...review/text: I installed this door lock on a new door and I just love it. However, this is very important, crucially important actually. These should not be bought for doors with glass panes. Because one of the glass panes is so close to the part of the door where I installed the door lock, you can tell it's a little off. There is just barely enough wood between glass pane and edge of door to install this properly. I got lucky and did not damage the door but I can see this going wrong for many if they attempt to do so. If you would like to see a picture of my installation, I will upload an image on the products page so you can see for yourself.
