review/summary: Great Dexterity, Poor Leatherreview/text: I have never found a pair of gloves that I was able to feel through as well as these. I was using them for a good bit of mechanical work, and they did a great job of allowing me proper feeling in my fingertips for the small jobs, and protection from the larger jobs. After about a month thought, I began to notice the leather was tearing and ripping, and the soft cloth between the fingers is getting chewed up from sharp bits. I wish they would have wrapped the leather all the way around the finger, so I don't have to worry about cutting the side of my finger. But all in all, great gloves.
