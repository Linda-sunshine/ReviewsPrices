review/summary: Battery Tenderreview/text: Just wanted to find out on one of the battery tenders the plug unit is coming apart. Do you send me a new one and I send the old one back, or how does this work. Could you let me know so we could resolve this issue. I had sent in a copy but just recieved a email,about the item, but had realized it was on the wrong purchase. It is one of my battery Tenders. NOT the HDE realistic Dome Security Camera? Thank You .Mike
