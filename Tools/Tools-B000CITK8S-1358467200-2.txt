review/summary: Works great!review/text: Bought this from my motorcycle when I was planning on being out of town for a couple weeks. What was thought to be acouple weeks, turned out to be over a month.When I got back, I disconnected the charger and my bike fired right up. Wow! it does what its supposed to do. Very happy! Easy to hook up and disconnect.Also used to keep my car batteries charged. Great product!
