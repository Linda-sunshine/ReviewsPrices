review/summary: Utilitarian yet cheap appearancereview/text: Im mixed on this one. It is solid and balanced well, but feel cheap. The handle is fully synthetic, but they should have rubberized it. Last thing you want this type of tool to do is slip or rotate on you in use. I only paid $25 though which is not much for a tool like this.
