review/summary: Waste King L-8000 Legend Series 1.0-Horsepower Continuous Feed Garbage Disposalreview/text: I love it. My husband installed it with a little help from me. He read the instructions, thought about them for a bit and then we jumped in and did it. It was not hard to remove the old disposal, but it did take 2 pair of hands to hold and install the new disposal. We are in our 70's, so a younger person may be able to do it by themselves. The new disposal does have a different sound than any other one that I have had, but it works great!!
