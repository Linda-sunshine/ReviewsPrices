review/summary: Quiet, warm, attractive.review/text: This little heater has been a warmly-welcomed addition to my bedroom. I wanted to find a cost-effective heater capable of maintaining a poorly-insulated 8x10 foot room at about 20 degrees (F) above outside temperatures.I looked at mica heaters, radiant oil heaters, and a dozen or more ceramic or quartz heaters before deciding on this model. Although it is a little pricier than similarly-featured competitors, the Lasko is significantly more attractive. I'm very happy with this heater - it blends into my decor and keeps the chill off.
