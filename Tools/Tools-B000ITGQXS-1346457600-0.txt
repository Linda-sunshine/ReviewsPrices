review/summary: GREAT booklight!! I'm buying another!review/text: Love this clip-on light. I read a million (or so) reviews of dozens of lights and finally decided on this one. Bought two and they're perfect: lightweight, strong clip, bright light with the just the right span, very flexible neck which is handy, nice looking and consistently work well. I'm ordering another one today. I use one for the changing table for late night diaper changes with my new baby. Have the other one for reading in bed (not that I have time these days) and now I'm buying one for the carseat so I can see her when I drive at night (we had a choking scare, so I don't want her out of my sight). Highly recommend this booklight.
