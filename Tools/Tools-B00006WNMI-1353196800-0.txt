review/summary: fantastic filter & durablereview/text: The FM=15A Culligan filter is 100 times as good as PUR. I bought a Pur faucet type filter, within a day, it kept falling off. Probably because of the plastic Adapater. The Culligan filter faucet adapter is metal and makes for a superb, sturdy product.
