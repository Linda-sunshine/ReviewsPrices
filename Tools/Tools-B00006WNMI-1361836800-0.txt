review/summary: Poor craftsmanship, although filter does workreview/text: Length:: 0:18 MinsThis video shows where the filter began to leak after 2 months of normal use.I just purchased my second filter in 2 months. The first one began leaking in the elbow between the faucet and the filter housing. BUT, the nasty taste we had from our water was completly eliminated over the past 2 months, and an entire unit was only slightly more expensive than a new filter anyway, so I was ok with replacing the entire unit.We had very "flavorful" water in a basement apartment - I don't know if it was from old pipes or what, but it was gross. We also have aBrita Atlantis Water Filter Pitcher, Whitethat we used for having cold water at the ready. But this faucet filter allowed us to have clean-tasting water when we needed it for purposes other than drinking, namely cooking and such.The quality might not be superb on these, but for the price, I'm satisfied with the product.
