review/summary: It only has in 1 magnetreview/text: I also own the taller 96&#34; version, but this shorter version only comes with one magnet to close the screen. That is a flaw, as the screen doesn't close very easily. If it had two magnets like the taller ones it would work much better. Can't recommend.
