review/summary: Great ladder!review/text: Weight is a bit high but for what it does and how far it reaches it is a great ladder! I worked super storm Sandy in NY and had the little sister 13' Werner and all but very few roofs did I need a taller ladder but this one will fill the bill. The ease of extending and maneuvering is easy. The only change I would like to see is a &#34;lock&#34; to keep the push buttons to open the ladder up open until I get it where I want it. A little heaver than the little giant but for $200 difference I can carry the extra weight.
