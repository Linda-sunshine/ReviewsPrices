review/summary: Decent Addition for Hunting and Camping.review/text: I know I probably should have gotten a hatchet but this was just so much more fun. The blade comes lubricated to prevent rust and with thick sheath that you can attach to a belt or backpack. The tomahawk tears through wood for about a weekend but then needs a good sharpening. It came in handy for multiple tasks when camping. The head of the tomahawk can be used as a hammer and is great for pounding stakes into the ground. The pick on the opposite side of the blade is great for gripping a log to drag to the chopping area.All around a great purchase.
