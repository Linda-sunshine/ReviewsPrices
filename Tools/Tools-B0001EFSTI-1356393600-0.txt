review/summary: Great miniature toolreview/text: Another Christmas present that I received this year from my Amazon wishlist! As advertised, it's the size of an average key. From the locked position it extends out to 180 degrees making the blade/saw and bottle opener/screwdriver easier to use. Has a very positive snap to it when closed and fully extended. A good tool to have that doesn't take up much room.
