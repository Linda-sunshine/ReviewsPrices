review/summary: The dogs figured it out very quicklyreview/text: In reviewing similar products most advertised 12-18 magnets, this product had 3 or 4 sets (6 or 8 magnets). I think it would have benefitted with the extra magnets. The weighted bottom helps swing the 2 pieces back together and works excellent when going out of the house. When the dogs come back in the weighted bottom gets stuck on the door sill, it still covers 90% of the opening so still a benefit which is the primary reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars. Our door opening is actually 94x28 and the extra &#34;loop&#34; to slide the tension rod through makes it the perfect length, the width we added extra velcro strips to get a better fit.
