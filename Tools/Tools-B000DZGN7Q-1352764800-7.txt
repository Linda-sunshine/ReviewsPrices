review/summary: EZ Mount is really EZ!review/text: My sister's disposal was leaking so being a good brother, I installed this for her. Lucky for me, the day I was looking for a disposal, this was on sale! Score! I've never installed a garbage disposal nor have I even touched one so I was sort of nervous. The old disposal was a Whirlpool and taking it apart was fairly easy. We have a stainless steel sink and didn't even bother to put any plumbers caulk or anything like that. I faced two challenges. The power was hard wired and the plumbing wasn't typical. The power cord was simply stripped off and I was able to connect it and for the plumbing issue, a trip to home depot solved it. FYI, the plumbing for this is not in the pipes section. Kitchen plumbing is sold well, yeah, near kitchen stuff. I couldn't believe how easy it was and I've never done plumbing work! It grinds well and compared to the whirlpool, it's quieter. Hope this helps!
