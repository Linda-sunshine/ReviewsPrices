review/summary: Almost perfect...review/text: I do a lot of roadside service, and getting a flat tire off the drivers' side of the car quickly is extremely desirable - you minimize your exposure to inattentive drivers. I've used four-way wrenches in the past, but with a heavy-duty battery-powered drill, a pocketful of sockets (really, most lugs are one of only six sizes) and a power extension, I can get wheels off nearly as quickly as a NASCAR pit crew. The SE extensions are well-constructed, fit my sockets tightly, and would have rated five stars if they had only had stems (the part between the hex faces and the socket mount) 1/2" to 5/8" shorter - I'm not accustomed to having sockets so far from the chuck, though I'm sure it'd be easy to adapt to. These are bits that users are going to find invaluable for assembly and disassembly of just about anything mechanical, and any number of jobs that require wrenches or sockets and involve a lot of wrench-turning - this speeds things up far more than most people could imagine.
