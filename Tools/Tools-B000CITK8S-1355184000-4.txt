review/summary: This Battery tender is boss.review/text: So I had one of these, and to make a long story short, I left it plugged in and backed my car out and ran it over. I got it good, pushed the two 'prongs' into the body. After disassembling it, everything looked ok, I pulled the prongs back out into position and plugged it in, and it STILL WORKED.However, I am paranoid and don't trust something electrical that is going to be plugged in when I am not around (shorts and stuff) so I replaced it with a brand new one. These are the tenders you want if you have an AGM / Sealed battery. Been using it on 2 of my batteries and it works great. I had a 'regular' trickle charger and I toasted a battery.Don't skimp on your battery tender, get this one.
