review/summary: Thermostatic Plugreview/text: This is probably a good product, but I haven't been able to test it because it requires a &#34;flat&#34; (flush to the wall) outlet to insert the wide, two-plug item. All our outdoor electrical outlets have the required plastic surrounds and covers to protect them from rain, and this product does not fit inside the plastic surround. It does have to be outdoors to respond to the weather temperatures.
