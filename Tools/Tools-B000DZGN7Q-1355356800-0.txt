review/summary: Great Disposer!review/text: Replaced an ISE that started leaking (rusted through) after about 5 years. I studied online reviews and this unit got high ratings. I was prepared to spend $250 to $350 but got this for less than $120 with free shipping. Installation was easy and it performs flawlessly. It spins faster and is quieter than the ISE it replaced. With it being all stainless on the inside, I'm hoping it will last for years. Best of all it has a lifetime warranty.
