review/summary: Worked at first, but having doubts.review/text: I bought this showerhead last winter because I moved to an area that had very hard water. When I first installed it, it worked like a charm. My skin was not as dry, and my hair stopped falling out so much. However, after replacing the cartridge, it seems as if the filter is no longer working. My skin is back to being a dry, flaky mess, and my hair is falling out in clumps. I don't know if it's something I did, or the filter is a dud, but I wish I could figure it out. Regardless, I saw amazing improvement in the beginning, and the product is definitely worth trying.
