review/summary: Smooth running and quiet.review/text: In our old house, we had the usual garbage disposer and accepted that it was &#34;okay&#34; but never gave it much thought. We sold that house and moved here. The disposer that was here was horrible. Conversation had to stop once we turned it on, and it was obvious when we turned it off, after what should have been long enough, that the food scraps were not really ground up. So we bought this Waste King L-8000 at amazon for a price we couldn't touch locally and had it installed. We still marvel every time we use this disposer. Sure, we hear it running, but we can continue a conversation, and it takes only moments to do its job.
