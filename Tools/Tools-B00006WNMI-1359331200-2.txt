review/summary: This is a nice unit!review/text: I had my doubts the first week,the water was slow for the first few days.I think it takes about a week for the charcoal (or whatever is inside to filter)to become saturated with water.After a week it was running fast and tastes delicious.It takes me 8 to 10 seconds to fill a pint jar,I think that's fast.I keep a brita pitcher on the countertop for my husband-he dos'nt like anything that takes more than 2 seconds.This unit is compact,I like the way it shuts off when you turn the water off.I loooooove it.
