review/summary: great productreview/text: Bought this product to help organize our cleaning supplies and it was exactly what we needed. The look of it is very basic and could probably have a nicer presentation but for the price and practicality it's a great buy. We use it to hold our mop, broom, swiffer sweeper and swiffer wet jet and they all fit great. It's easy to take things on and off but they seem secure when they're on there. It's nice to have a little more room in the closet too.
