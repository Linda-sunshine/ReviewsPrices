review/summary: Eat Garbage Like a Boss!!review/text: This is a great disposal system. I just love it. It is a bit larger than expected compared to my old 1/2hp unit. EZmount is just that easy. I did buy the extra adapter for the three bolt system but the ezmount is the way to go. It is a bit loud not too loud so if noise is a concern to you then I would get the wasteking model that is has the sound insulation for me the sound is not bad since it is not on for very long. After doing dishing I just turn it on while the water drains. This a very powerful unit. Much cheaper than the brands sold in the retail stores and is much higher quality. Install instructions are clear but the instructions on removing the old unit are not very clear so if you do not know what your doing then check out some online video's on instal/removal first. The only tool I used to install this was my sog powerlock and towel.
