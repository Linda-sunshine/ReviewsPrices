review/summary: Perfect solution and humane kill says it all.review/text: I bought this device at the local hardware store. I was a little skeptical at first because I thought it was a scam-to good to be true. It works like a charm. I hate killing anything, but my family's health is more important. I just used it again it caught 3 mice in the last 24 hours. I think they travel in families. It saddens me to take out the whole family but it's better they go out in this device rather than a glue trap that is just plain cruel!
