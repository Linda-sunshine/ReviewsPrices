review/summary: Never get locked out againreview/text: I love this keypad. Our doors are the kind where you can open them up without unlocking them. I was so afraid of accidentally locking myself out. Now I don't have to worry about it. My kids don't have to knock on the door and wait for us to answer, but If I don't want anyone walking in I can lock the top lock and no one will get in even with the code. I love that when we are away from home I can allow whoever I want to go into our house and then change the code if we don't want them to come in again. This was a great purchase.
