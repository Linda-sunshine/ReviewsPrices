review/summary: EXCELLENT!!!!!review/text: This remote was one, two, three, to program!! Worked immediately with my Craftsman garage door opener with the purple smart button. Better and cheaper than the one that came with the opener! If you are having trouble with your Craftsman garage door remote, throw it out and buy this one!! (remember to check the smart button on the back of the unit, it has to be purple!)I bought two, and programmed them both in less than 5 minutes. Cost me less than one Craftsman remote, even with shipping. Oh, and I got them in like two days!! Awesome!!!
