review/summary: Best Filtered Shower Head for Bathingreview/text: We've tried the Sprite & the Jonathan.While both seemed good with the chlorine filtering issue, they were terrible as shower heads. They spray pattern was so small, it almost felt like you had to move your body around the shower to get water coverage. Not this guy. It has a full spray pattern like a shower head should. Also, if you like a "hard" spray, I suggest you remove the water restrictor plug.
