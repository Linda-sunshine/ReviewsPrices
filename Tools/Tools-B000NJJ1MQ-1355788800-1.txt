review/summary: Works perfectlyreview/text: This deadbolt has been installed for about 5 months. Our whole household loves not having to fumble for keys. It was easy to install, and it has not once failed. The lighted keypad is great for when we forget to turn the porch light on. It's simple enough that my 6 year old can lock and unlock the door with his own code.
