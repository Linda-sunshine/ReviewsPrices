review/summary: How about a little peanut butter with your toast crumbs Mr. mouse????review/text: Several nights ago while on a midnight snack run, I surprised a mouse in the kitchen. He went flying down the counter from behind the toaster, and dropped behind the refrigerator. On investigation the next morning I found mouse droppings in back of the toaster and surmised he had been dining on a few toast crumbs. Since that was the only place I found evidence of him, and there was absolutely nothing else available for him to eat, I decided back of the toaster, against the counter edge was where I would place this trap. I have never had occasion to use a regular mousetrap myself, but I remembered my father catching mice in those spring loaded things when I was a kid, and the idea of some mouse jumping around, NOT dead in one of those things did not appeal to me!I followed directions on the Victor trap, heeding the advice of several reviewers NOT to overbait. Set it up right after dinner about 7pm, turned out kitchen light and went upstairs to watch TV. Walked back in my kitchen about 3 hrs later and Voila!.. green light was flashing on trap! No blood, no mess, no drama....... the mouse was quite dead and appeared to be asleep!I am delighted that I didn't have to touch him; just turned the box upside down and flipped him into a plastic bag. The trap wasn't even dirty... I just wiped off remains of first peanut butter bait, re-baited it using a toothpick, and set it up for the remainder of night. Perhaps one of his friends or relatives will be zapped by morning!
