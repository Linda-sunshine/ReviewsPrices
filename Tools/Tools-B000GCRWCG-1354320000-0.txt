review/summary: Decent quality for a cheep pricereview/text: I purchased these to add to a number of emergency kits for the family. The 10 blankets I received were from Everdixie USA EMS Supply Company, and made in China. All were packed in individual zip lock style bags. Unfolding the Mylar blankets, I noticed they were of thin material, but held up to a test session during a cold evening in the Southwestern High Desert in late fall. It did what it is designed to do- Radiate body heat, and block out wind. Unfolded, it was large enough for me (5'11"/200lbs) to wrap around myself. While I was somewhat careful in it's handling, the blanket did not rip or tear during this test use. I would recommend this product for any emergency kit.
