review/summary: It works.review/text: We recently purchased an old house in a rural area that gets real cold in the winter months, and have discovered that this equation equals the occasional mouse, no matter how tight you think you have your place sealed up. If you're serious - and seriously squeamish - about getting rid of these unwanted tenants, this trap is your new best friend. Put a teeny dab of peanut butter on the side wall, turn it on, place it near the "scene of the crime", and the next morning you'll have a blinking green light and a slightly heavier trap waiting for you. The product does what it says it will do, with neither muss nor fuss for the homeowner and at the very least seemingly no prolonged suffering for the mouse. While the pricetag seems a bit daunting at first, I figure I paid twenty bucks and then some for a wide variety of unhelpful gadgets that essentially served as feeding stations and port-a-potties for our little guests. This one gets the job done, quickly and efficiently.
