review/summary: Good to have in emergency, learn to use it firstreview/text: These things definitely work but, under certain conditions. They technically work best when directly next to your skin so, if you get wet and are waiting for your clothes to get dry by the camp fire these would be perfect for that situation. But, if you forget your sleeping bag and think this will substitute then you'll be in for a ridiculously long and cold night. These can also be made into many different things you might need in an emergency when combined with a roll of duct tape like a tube tent, poncho, tarp and whatever else your imagination can come up with. Cheap and worth carrying around.
