review/summary: More Power!!review/text: This was the first holiday season in 3 years that did not leave me under the sink with the wet vac & tool belt trying to free herb stems and potato peels from the garbage disposal and drains!I'm not a huge fan of the new &#34;easy collar&#34; system, but after installing I realized that liberally applying food grade silicone lube to the rubber collar made installation much easier.Most of our food scraps now go directly down the disposal and this thing never hesitates.
