review/summary: Owned two of these locks, plan on getting more.review/text: This lock is simply brilliant. I had one on my front door of my previous house and it was one of the first upgrades I made to my new house. I'll be phasing out all of this house's deadbolts with these as time and money permits.This lock only has pros:-Attractive-Long battery life (did not have to replace my first one's battery, had it for over 2 years)-Smooth operation-Easy to read, especially at night with illuminated keypad.As for any safety concerns that people occasionally mention, I look at it from the &#34;weakest link&#34; principle. This basically means that the security of my house is as strong as the weakest link - and as I have windows on ground level (as do the vast majority of houses...) then a pane of glass is the weakest link. The lock isn't there to keep people out, so much as to make my house a less convenient target.
