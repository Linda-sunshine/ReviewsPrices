review/summary: Just for prettyreview/text: I wish Amazon had negative scoring. I can say they fit well and are comfortable but that's where the good things end. I don't abuse gloves. I don't go digging in rock piles or anything. The day after I received them I wore them to do some light gardening. They weren't really involved much as my cutter was doing most of the work and my left hand, with gloves on, was grasping what I was cutting. In less than two hours these gloves were coming apart at the seams, literally. My index finger on my left hand was entirely unraveled. Since I did like the gloves as far as feel I chalked it up to fluke and sewed it up. Within the next hour the right glove began to do the same thing. Being as I didn't want to fool with returning them I sewed it up as well. There was no pressure on the fingers from being tight. As I said they fit well so if your objective is for pretty, as I doubt very seriously these would do little good in keeping your hands warm, then these will fit the bill but if you want to actually use them I suggest you move on
