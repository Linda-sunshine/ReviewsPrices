review/summary: Lux thermostat controlreview/text: I am using this in my insect room to regulate the room temperature with a ceramic heater. Overall, the features are great with a wide range of settings you can use to make a precise schedule. This includes a schedule to set morning temperature, day temperature, and evening temperature for all 7 days of the week. It has been fail proof with the schedule I have been using, turning on as soon as the temperature drops 1 degrees below the set temperature, then turning off as soon as the set temperature has been reached.The only reason this item did not receive a perfect 5/5 from me is because of its thermosensor accuracy. I have some new analog temperature gauges that I have in different areas of the room, and they all read 1-2 degrees below what the Lux outlet thermostat reads. It is important for me to have precise temperatures for my research, so I had to compensate by increasing the settings on the device to 2 degrees higher than what I normally need.Overall, a very handy device and I highly recommend it!
