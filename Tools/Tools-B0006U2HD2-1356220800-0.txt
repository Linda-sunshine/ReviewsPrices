review/summary: One of the sockets failedreview/text: I bought an on at 35 and off at 45 outlet a few months ago and have been using it in my well head. I recently moved it to my chicken coop to control a brooder lamp. On the first really cold night I noticed that the brooder lamp did not come on. I moved the plug to the second outlet and it is working. I have a second one on order to put at the well head but will test it thoroughly before I use it there. It's still early winter here, but I was expecting this plug to both work and be reliable.
