review/summary: Works well enoughreview/text: It doesn't replace having your knives professionally sharpened, but it is useful for when you need a little extra sharpness in between. Nothing is worse than fabricating a chicken with a dull knife, and this sharpener is good enough to get you through the job. I mean, you do get what you pay for. With the price in mind, it's a great value
