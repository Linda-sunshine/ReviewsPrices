review/summary: Quick and EZ to Installreview/text: Everything you will need is included in the box. Don't bother with the waste king 3101 adapter as I could not get it to work or fit. Just use the EZ-mount system it is easier and quicker for installation. You don't need to buy an extra stopper unless you want an extra stopper. I was able to install this disposal in under 1 hour with a helper handing me tools while I was under the sink.Just read the instructions and watch the installation videos at waste kings website.Gather your tools and prep everything for a quick and easy installation.You will need to buy plumbers putty however. And you may want to use some dishwashing liquid on all the plastic fitting threads so everything will hand tighten quicker and more easily. You will also need a light under the sink so you can see what you are doing.
