review/summary: Excellent product.. Very pleasedreview/text: This is a great product from Belkin... I bought it to replace a previous power strip that damaged by PC power supply. So far so good...Has a sufficient number of outlets and two wide cable guides to keep connections nice and tidy.. Would definitely recommend this product for the price.
