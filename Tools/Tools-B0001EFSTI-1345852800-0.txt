review/summary: Not great materialreview/text: I enjoyed this tool for a couple of years and it came in pretty handy at times. Unfortunately it broke yesterday. My brother tossed me my keys from about 5 feet away when I wasn't looking and it hit the wood floor and broke. I was amazed and disappointed. Hopefully they're a little better made now.
