review/summary: Fantastic everyday multi-toolreview/text: The tool is exactly as described. Each function works as intended. and the key is easily used everyday. I could not give it a full 5 stars for a couple minor reason.Pros:Each function works as described.Stays closed.Nothing functionally wrong at all, the negative are simple personal preferences, and should not be used to dissuade anyone.Cons:Key length is slightly longer than a normal house key, which causes it to stick out a bit.The blade could be a bit sharper.The bottle opener works, but it has to go around the entire bottle cap to open it.
