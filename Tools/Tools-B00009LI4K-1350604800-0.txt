review/summary: Nice Ear Muffs but not for indoor shootingreview/text: I debated what to buy for hearing protection for use at an indoor range and came across this set of ear muffs. With a 30 NRR, I figured that these would be great. I also saw Peltor Optime 105 listed on a few other sites making me think they would be just the thing.On Wednesday, I headed off to the range, and it didn't go so well. They were tolerable for the 9mm I was shooting but some of the larger caliber pistols fired a few slots down from me came through really loudly. After some shooting, I left with sore ears and a splitting headache and decided to return these.I suspect that these would be great for running an angle grinder or other loud tools in my garage, but they are definitely not what you want for an indoor gun range.Ignoring the incompatibility between the product and my usage of it, I will sat that ear muffs felt kind of tight on my head (I don't have a large head). I've used other 3M ear muffs in the past with power tools and don't recall the same issue with the fit. Unfortunately I don't know which ones those were.
