review/summary: LOVE IT!review/text: I love the Flowtron 1/2 acre bug zapper. It is my new best friend. It keeps the bugs away from me so that I can work without being pestered. I hear the zapper frying pests. Occasionally I've witnesed knats lined-up on the wall just waiting their turn to go 'in'. Since I've started using the Flowtron bug zapper, the population of flying pests has diminished. It's a wonderful product. I plug it in whenever there's a bug inside, and I use it every night in the barn while doing chores. I initially bought it for fleas in the house but I can't comment whether it works for that or not. I don't know if fleas go to the light. But regardless, it's my new best friend and we go to the barn together and work each evening. I bring it inside again each night because I don't want it to get filled up with cobwebs and barn dust. I just ordered one for my daughter and her husband as a Christmas gift! shhhhhh!
