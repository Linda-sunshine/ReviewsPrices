review/summary: Terrific.review/text: We have had a combination lock on our front door for years and we just love it! We can program it to a special temporary code for the dog sitter during vacations and our teenage children can let themselves in the house without worrying about carrying/losing a house key. The one we had previously was great (or so we thought), then I bought this one based on other reviews and a recommendation from a friend. On our previous one, once you pushed in the code, the deadbolt opened automatically on battery power --- boy did we go through a lot of batteries and even got locked out once when the batteries died unexpectedly. So when I read that this one required you to manually turn the knob after pushing in the code, I had mixed feelings --- would it be a hassle to do that extra step, but perhaps it would save on batteries. Well, it is most definitely saving on batteries -- haven't changed them once yet -- and the extra step of turning the lock once you punch in the code is no hassle whatsoever. Also, this one has no screws on the outside (couldn't believe my old one did!) and both sides of this one are metal whereas my other one had a plastic casing for the part that is on the inside of the door. Recommend!
