review/summary: Super brightreview/text: Good price! I only give it 3 stars for 2 reasons:1) It's super bulky and doesn't really hold up well on my kindle due to the size comparison.2) The light has to be adjusted in a position that would disturb others because it causes a glare on my screen and therefore not letting me read...rendering it useless.
