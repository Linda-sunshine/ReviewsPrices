review/summary: The best quick sharpener for the average personreview/text: I am not a master sharpener or anything. I don't do well with a whetstone or even those diamond pattern flip open sharpeners, although that is a handy EDC pack item.I bought one of these AccuSharp sharpeners about, wow, about 10 years ago. I still have it. I just bought another one. It is very easy and quick to put a new sharp edge or touch one up. Very handy for your pocket and kitchen knives. It saves a lot of headaches at trying to sharpen one side, then the other, then back to the first, argh.
