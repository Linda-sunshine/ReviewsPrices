review/summary: split second major klunk sound when you turn it onreview/text: This replaces an 8 year old builder installed insinkerator badger 1/3 hp, which was very noisy. The badger developed leaks from the bottom (on Christmas Eve).A professional plumber had this Waste King installed in minutes, and said it had a lifetime warranty, that it was a very good disposal, but would be noisy (which is not so noisy after it starts). The split second hard klunk is because it is one gear, one way, and does not reverse upon start-up like some of the others. It will grind up anything, but plumber said not to put egg shells in any disposal. I would give it a 5 stars for how efficient it is, but the split second hard klunk always jars me. One wonderful thing is the removable black rubber splash guard thingy that can be easily taken out and put back. Yes, the opening is a little smaller, but you can see the whole inside with splash guard removed..THE FOLLOWING ADDED A FEW DAYS LATER: Plumber was here again yesterday (to fix tub spouts) and I showed him how noisy the klunk was. IT SOUNDED MORE QUIET!!! He said it would sound that way forever, that it is an amazing disposal, and I should just get used to the klunk.I think the klunk is going away...
