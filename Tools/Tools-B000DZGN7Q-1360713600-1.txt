review/summary: Seems to be one of the bestreview/text: Much better all around than the 3/4 HP Badger it replace. Which was not all that old. I should have purchased one of these when instead of the badger. Disposal install easy. Plumbing install not &#34;hard&#34; but not that easy either as it required a new kit from HD as nothing lined up as this unit is longer, etc than one it replaced. HD sells their pvc dual sink disposal kit for about $14.98 or so.
