review/summary: Good Temporary Solutionreview/text: I bought this to put up on a back door of my house that currently does not have a screen door. It opens up to the pool area and is in a great spot for cross ventilation when the AC is off (which is this time of year down here), but with no screen leaving it open invited lizards and bugs iside. Here in South Florida, building code has exterior doors open out unless a hurricane rated screen/storm door is installed. Well, to get one installed, you literally have to rehang the exterior door itself so that it opens inward. Since I don't feel like doing all that work right now, I thought I would give this a go since is was under $50.It works. It is not the prettiest thing to look at, but it allows me to keep that door open without all of the critters getting in. I will be going to buy another magnet type of fastener for the upper part of the screen since, as others have stated, it doesn't stay together too well and the gaps between the two panels would allow bugs in.Functional, but will only be using it until I am ready for the big project of installing a real screen/storm door.
