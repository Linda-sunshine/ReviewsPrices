review/summary: Plate & a Light Work!review/text: But only to a point. I read some other commenters' experience, thanks, and am trying out a simple plate, soapy water & clamp light to deal with fleas in my place. The product on sale is certainly more efficient self-contained, but if you have the materials available it's worth trying the Dawn method first. However, I've noticed that flea infestations develop in pockets that tend to shift around. Just when you've gotten one area, you will step into another unexpectedly. If you have a really serious infestation, you'll probably have to consult Dupont or Monsanto, plus an exterminator. These traps only scratch (sorry...) the surface.
