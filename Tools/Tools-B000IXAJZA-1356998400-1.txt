review/summary: Truth in Advertising - Maglite 3D LED Flashlight.review/text: When checking reviews for the Maglite L.E.D. 3D cell flashlight I found some poor reviews, however one reviewer was smart enough to notice the the poor reviews were from around 2009, However after that date Maglite addressed the problem and installed a newer,brighter and way better quality LED bulb. I purchased one and can honestly say it is 5 to 6 times brighter than a standard krypton bulb. I have had a few get togethers with friends and family and I pulled out a standard maglite 3D flashlight and a new L.E.D. maglite 3 cell flashlight and turned them both on side by side, people were astonished by the L.E.D. Maglites bright white light, it made the standard maglights beam look yellow and dim, almost as if the batteries were going dead, even though I had installed new batteries in both lights. I highly recommend Maglights L.E.D 3D cell flashlight for the following reasons:(1) Brighter Whiter light.(2) Longer range with more clarity.(3) Extended Battery life "up to 72 hours"(4) Extended bulb life.(5) More impact resistant(6) Water Proof(7) Excellent Value ($29.00) as of this writing on Amazon.comWhen you need a flashlight generally it's for a serious reason, why not have the best when that time comes. =MAGLITE L.E.D.=Made in America.
