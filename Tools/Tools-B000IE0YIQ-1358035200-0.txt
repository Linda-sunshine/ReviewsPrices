review/summary: Great, reliable pumpreview/text: I've owned two of these pumps. I bought the first one in Fall 2006 (at that point the 12V plug was detachable from the body) which finally died after 6 years use. The night that one died I bought a replacement one from a local retailer (the new design with all cables / plugs permanently attached). Being able to detach cables for compact storage was nice on the first one, but I still love this pump; it's been incredibly reliable and being able to set the desired pressure and leave it unattended while you do something else is so convenient it will spoil you. My first one was used rather heavily (going to the track once a month and using this to adjust pressure between sessions -- in one year I probably put as much use on it as most people would do in 3 years). I love this pump so much that I told my dad he had to get one when his last one died.
