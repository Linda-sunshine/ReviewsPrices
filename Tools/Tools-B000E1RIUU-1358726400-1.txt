review/summary: Does not workreview/text: I have had this device for approximately one month and so far, there has not been one mouse trapped, killed or whatever. There are signs of mice, but none caught. I will keep baiting it and trying for another month, and if nothing I will strictly go back to the old type of traps, evil as they may be.
