review/summary: Works but light burned out in less than a week . . .review/text: The flea traps works well and trapped several fleas while it worked, however the bulbs burned out in less than a week. I purchased three of the traps. The first bulb burned out within 24 hrs and the other two a few days later. I'm not sure if they were bad bulbs or bad traps. I will replace the bulbs and see if it works once I do but am disappointed they burned out so quickly. For this reason I am only giving it a two star rating. Otherwise I would give it a five star for the amount of fleas it did attract for the few days it worked.
