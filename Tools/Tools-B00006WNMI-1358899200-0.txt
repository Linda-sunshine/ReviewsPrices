review/summary: impossibly slow flow of waterreview/text: Received my filter and installed it OK, but to my horror the flow of filtered water is ridiculously slow and the flow of unfiltered water not much better, both are unacceptable. Have read other ratings that bear up my complaint. No more water filters unless they do not impede the stream of water, particulary the unfiltered. IT IS GOING BACK TO AMAZON THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND GOOD RIDDANCE!
