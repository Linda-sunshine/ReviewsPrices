review/summary: Bug Off 48 by 80 Instant Screen really worksreview/text: We have large doors to our metal building and actually is sized 48 by 84, but this was the closest size of a product that we could find. We build a wood 4 inch header on the door to make up for the distance we needed and then it worked great. It really does keep the flies, mosquitos out, etc. out of building while we can enjoy the breeze. This helps us to cool or warm up the inside of our building by allowing the breeze to filter through without dealing with the pests. Thank you Amazon for having this product available.
