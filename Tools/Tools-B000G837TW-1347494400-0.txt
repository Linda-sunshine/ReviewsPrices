review/summary: Powerful yet quiet!review/text: Replaced an earlier Insinkerator that after thirteen years had begun to leak. Unit went in easily - detailed instructions were easy to follow. In the month that followed, no problems, and we look forward to a long usage-life. Since our house has a great room, with no walls between kitchen area and the living room area, quietness as well as power is important.
