review/summary: In Sink Erator adapter not needed, Great unit.review/text: I was replacing an ISE 1/4 hp with this unit. I bought the 3 bolt adapter based on recommendations I read here. It isn't needed. Removing the three bolt mount is pretty easy and this unit comes with a rubber gasket, so no plumber's putty is needed. Very simple installation. Took me about 20 minutes. Much quieter than the old ISE and much stronger.
