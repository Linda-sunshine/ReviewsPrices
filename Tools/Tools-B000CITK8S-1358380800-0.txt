review/summary: Good Chargerreview/text: Use it primarily to recharge the spare batteries for the kids' peg perego ride-on. Works great for my purposes. I like that you can leave the battery for longer periods than is needed and it will not overcharge. I have left the battery on it overnight and for longer periods during the day and the batteries have never hot or otherwise impacted from what I can tell.
