review/summary: Better Controlsreview/text: My single room cabin uses radiator style space heater for heat, as these heaters are slow to heat up and good at maintaining a constant room temperature once heated. It seemed with the builtin thermostat, it was either too hot or too cool with these heaters. But with this little plug in thermostat, it is a constant 78F with no problems. Plug the heater in, turn the heater to its highest setting and let this thermostat do the rest. Well, the temperature of the thermostat must be set to the desired temperature...set mine to 78F.Looks just like a thermstat on the wall for a centrol air heating/cooling system. Though wish that there was a built in cord so that the thermostat could be hung higher on the wall...maybe 4ft. Other then that, the device works nicely.
