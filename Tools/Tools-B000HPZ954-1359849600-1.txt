review/summary: These are basic, entry level protectors, seems to work for mereview/text: This is about my 4th Belkin surge protector, all of which have been this same general series and all above 3k jule protectionI decided to replace my 8-outlet 2960 jule with this guy because I needed more outlets and wanted a longer base cord just in case, this does the trick, lots of outlets and placed in a smart way. the cord is long and uses high guage wiring.I dont use the internet/phone/cable and never have, but I like the easily protected outlets and the layout, as well as the simple LEDs
