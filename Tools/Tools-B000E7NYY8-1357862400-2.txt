review/summary: very flexible programmingreview/text: Upon reading instructions and hooking this up to a light bulb for testing it worked correctly, This uses very similar programming to my Lux home thermostats so it was easy for me. It looks to be of high quality and I have used Lux products for years with no problems so I expect none from this product.
