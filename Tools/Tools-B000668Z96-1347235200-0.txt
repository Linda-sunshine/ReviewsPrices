review/summary: These traps don't work.review/text: I was being bitten by fox fleas in my back yard. My feet and ankles were covered in them. Thinking I brought fleas into my house, I bought two of these traps. The only thing I caught in these traps was dust so I was glad I didn't have fleas in my house. Thinking they worked, I loaned them to my friend who had a REAL flea infestation in her house. She placed them for three days next to her dog's bed where she knew there were fleas. The only things she caught were two moths and a fly that were attracted to the light.These traps are worthless. They just use up electricity and your money.
