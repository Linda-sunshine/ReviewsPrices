review/summary: My husband loves these glovesreview/text: My husband uses these gloves a lot (he is already wearing them out). They are very well made and fit well. This is a great gift for the man who uses his hands a lot! The faux suede is a little thin it seems and my hubby already made a small tear in the palm of one of the gloves but he probably was handling something sharp.
