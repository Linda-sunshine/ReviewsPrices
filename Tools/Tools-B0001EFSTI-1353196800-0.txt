review/summary: Another great Swiss productreview/text: This little multi tool is a handy and worthwhile addition to your keychain. It provides some often needed tools without taking up much room in your pocket. You don't even notice its there but it comes apart to become very useful when needed. The two parts are well stuck together so you don't have to worry about them separating by accident. They are a little hard to separate but not impossible, Its very secure. But they are very sturdy and can do the job.
