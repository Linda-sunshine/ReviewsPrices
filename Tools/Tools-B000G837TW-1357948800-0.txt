review/summary: QUIET & ROBUSTreview/text: The Insinkerator Evolution is a very quiet and robust disposal. We had an older lower HP one that practically shook the kitchen when we used it. Ear protection might also have been a good idea. This one is incredibly quiet and was easy to install. At 3/4 HP, it will take just about anything you throw at it.Be sure to buy the cord kit too because it doesn't come with any form of electrical cord. You can buy them on Amazon or at Home Depot. Since I forgot to get it, I went to Home Depot. Expensive disposal compared with its cheaper cousin (but much less at Amazon) but worth the money.
