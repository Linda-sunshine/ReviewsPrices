review/summary: Fan of Flea Trapreview/text: There are a lot of negative comments about this product, and I am not sure why. It works great!! It is obviously not going to be able to catch all fleas, but it really does trap a lot of them and get them off of the carpet or pets. Once they are in the trap, they are stuck and die.We have had ours on in our living room for over three weeks now and the light still works. We only had to change the paper once so far, just recently, because it was looking gross with all the fleas. This product should be used WITH other forms of flea control like sprays and spot on treatments for pets but when used with those other products, I think its been effective. I would recommend this product to people because its effective and the price is right.
