review/summary: Fun!review/text: What a fun product. When I first bought it I ran around plugging everything into it, seeing how many watts each device was drawing. Now that I've had it for a while I will admit that it's been gathering some dust, but it still gets used from time to time. After my most recent power bill at the apartment I think I'll dust it off and give everything a thorough test and see where I can make improvements. A neat gadget, and worth it when you're considering where to improve your energy consumption.
