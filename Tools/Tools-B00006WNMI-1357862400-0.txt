review/summary: Very happy, but have had two fail in exactly the same way.review/text: Plastic filter housing first became 'wobbly' at connection with metal faucet adapter (note: have uploaded customer images and comments to document this), then started leaking and eventually separated. As I also mentioned with my images, this happened both to my unit and my mom's around the 2 year mark. Nonetheless, I plan to buy another, because I was very happy with the performance.
