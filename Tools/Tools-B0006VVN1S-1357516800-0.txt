review/summary: Pretty good shower headreview/text: The water pressure and spray setting options are great. It's a noticeable difference from my previous waterpik shower head.The spray settings knob is hard to turn with wet hands.Be careful using a wrench to tighten when installing. I used a soft washcloth and still scratched it.
