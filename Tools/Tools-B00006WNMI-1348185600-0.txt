review/summary: One of my best Amazon purchases EVER!!!!review/text: I was extremely frustrated after having to replace a PUR Faucet Mount Filter System twice in the past year, not to mention SEVERAL times in the past 3 or 4 yrs, all because they became leaky or sprayed water on me and all over my kitchen. The new click design is the worst ever and I would've changed to something else, but I had a carton of filters from Costco that I wanted to use up. Well, after reading all of the negative reviews about PUR and 265 formal customer complaints elsewhere, I decided to go with Culligan and I am SOOO glad I did!!! It came the very next day, the price was less than a replacement filter from PUR (the ones that are sold separately) and I was able to install it in literally seconds. I don't care that it is white or that it doesn't have an indicator light, the ones on PUR never worked right anyway. I think that is just another scam by P&G; to sucker the consumer in replacing filters unnecessarily and increasing their profits. The customer service person I complained to was very nice, but I have no intention of waiting to receive an adapter or replacement system, when I can switch to something that will save me money in the run and I actually think the Culligan filter looks better, too.I really think this Culligan product is the best filter system out there and I am going to return the unused filters for the PUR crap that I still have, to Costco.
