review/summary: Great purchasereview/text: I gave this a 4 because it isn't as nice looking as the other faucet water filters out there.Besides appearances, this is awesome! I do recommend not using it with the water on full blast. I have read and seen photos, it will burst off the threads on the actual filter and leak like a sieve. So as long as you don't do that, you are set with perfect functioning water filter. Water tastes great, awesome price, auto-shut off feature is nice too. Simple and well made..
