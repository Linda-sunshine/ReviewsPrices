review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: The design blocks both outlets. So to get a reading on say the refrigerator, I would have to also disconnect the radio or other device using the second outlet. Putting the plug at the top and the readout on the bottom would free-up the other outlet, and still provide the information I was seeking. Not practical.
