review/summary: Lots of easy connectionsreview/text: It's big but allows easy connection of multiple power block adapters. I have not used the coax and telephone connections.I like the power plug is angled at 90 degrees so it does not stick out so much from the wall. My power outlet is behind a dresser drawer. I use the holes on the backside of the surge protector to wall mount it.
