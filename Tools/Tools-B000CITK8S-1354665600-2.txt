review/summary: a must have for the ATV or JetSki owner..review/text: If you dont have a trickel charger for your PWC or ATV at some point you'll wish you did,Takes all the wonder if my battery is up to a full charge for the day. A green light tells the user the peak performance is met and ready for service. A relief when you must consider all the necessary things to do and include in a sucessful outting.Plug it in each time your done using the battery and you'll be fully charged ready for the next trip ,Cheap insureance, I would be happy to recommend.
