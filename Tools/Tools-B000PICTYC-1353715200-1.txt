review/summary: Big Disappointment!review/text: From its writeup, I expected a well-balanced, well thought-out, state-of-the-art tool........NOT!I consider my hands to be &#34;small-large&#34;. Even so, the handle felt too small in diameter for my comfort. That, coupled its being &#34;top-heavy&#34;, made using it feel awkward and uncomfortable. Cheap hatchets from a discount store have felt much more user-friendly.
