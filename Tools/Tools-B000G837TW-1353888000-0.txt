review/summary: Forget it!review/text: We've owned this unit for 3 1/2 years and found it to work quite well. This past week (post Thanksgiving) the unit locked up on us and we were unable to "un-jam" it. I went out and replaced the unit myself (home depot has most of the Emerson InSink Erator units ) as the fittings are identical (and the cord is a 5 minute swap).I called the company for a refund (receipt in hand, I did the work, old unit ready to ship back).....and was told only an in-home repair is allowed.....I'm on my own, no refund. The lesson I learned......don't do it yourself, have them come out. It will take more time, some one has to be at home......but this is their warranty, no refund for their product if you do it yourself.
