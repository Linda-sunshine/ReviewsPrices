review/summary: Multi-ladders are the futurereview/text: Aftering getting my first multi-ladder I can say I will never go back to the days of having several ladders laying around.Ladders take up room, lots of room. Except this ladder. Not only isn't several ladders in one, but because it folds up into a 3' tall, 1' thick, 2' wide object it'll never, ever take up much storage space.This feature also makes it incredibly easy to carry through doors, and around the house.I've used it for every purpose for a year now, and I've never been frustrated or had a single safety concern. This thing is solid, and a breeze to adjust.I also looked around for a while before making this purchase, and you will not find a durable multi-ladder for cheaper anywhere (that was a year ago though). It ships for free right to your door; what else do you want?
