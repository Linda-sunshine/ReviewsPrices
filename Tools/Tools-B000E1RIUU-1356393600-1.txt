review/summary: Only for dumb tiny micereview/text: I bought one of these with no luck. My thought was that I just needed more in mulitple locations. So, I spent about $100 for about 5 more of these. I put them out using peanut butter and left them out in mulitple locations with no luck. All I got was a little mouse laughing at me as he went scurring around. I actually have video of a mouse running in and out of one of these. So, I spent another $10 on about 5 regular old wooden spring traps. The $2 spring trap caught him within 2 days. Don't waste your money on this.
