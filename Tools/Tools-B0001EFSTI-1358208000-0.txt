review/summary: On my keychain for five yearsreview/text: I've had this swiss tech for five years now, and it has remained sharp and durable for a number of uses, such as opening packages at work or at home (when those pesky scissors have run off again) or bits of string and odd fabric that's come loose on your clothes while you're out. (The bunched up string sticking out of your sleeve? Yup)I've also done some less daily chores with this, such as a mini pry-bar to force open electronics, saw through bars of aluminum, puncture the odd balloon, and gasp, even use the screws (though they're quite useless imo). Throughout the abuse, the swiss tech has remained sharp and reliable, has not been bent out of shape and has not gained any rust/inability to pivot.When closed, I have never caught myself on the blade, which is cleverly recessed just enough to prevent any harm from accidentally befalling the user. Closed position also securely locks the device to your key ring, cleverly disguising it from the casual glance. Opening it slightly allows the device to be released from the ring, and it is instantly ready for use.This device was only ten dollars, and has gotten many jealous comments from my guy friends, who find the novelty and use of the utili-key to be one worth having around, especially since it is such a finely crafted piece of material at a low price, and such a low profile that it would hardly make a difference appearance/weight-wise if you were to carry it, but it can always come in handy in an emergency.
