review/summary: Works for mereview/text: This is the second one I've purchased. First one lasted almost exactly one year of continuous use. Living in south east GA bugs are year round. First season I had to take the leaf blower to it about every week. This year has been somewhat less, but the I feel that this bug killer is doing what it's supposed to. Overall it I have had a decrease in the number of mosquitoes while on my patio and that means more time outside That's good enough for me to purchase a replacement.Pros:Ease of use, apply mosquito attractant and plug in.Clean up with leaf blower on lowSeems to work after the attractant is past due for changingCons:Had to buy a replacement after a year, but it was exposed to all elements for that timeRather indiscriminate killer of bugsIt is quite bright at night, so neighbors may not like the light, but hopefully they appreciate fewer blood suckersYou have to find a way to hang it, mine is on a plant hanger.
