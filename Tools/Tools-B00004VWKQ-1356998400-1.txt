review/summary: Second One We Boughtreview/text: We bought the complete sharpening set before and wanted another for our vacation home. It really works well. I use a sharpening steel on our good knives, but this simple device puts a sharp edge on most cheap knives. You know, the dull ones you keep in the drawer and don't use for very same reason.
