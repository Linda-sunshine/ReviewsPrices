review/summary: I should have done more researchreview/text: When I received it it was left outside when no one was home ,lucky no one took it.And one of the latches that holds the ladder from moving has the plastic latch cracked.I also found it hard to operate.I also found it cheaper locally days after I bought this one.I would have been better off buying a 17 ' extension ladder.
