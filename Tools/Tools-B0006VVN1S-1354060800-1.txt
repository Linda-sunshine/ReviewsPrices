review/summary: worth every pennyreview/text: I serioulsy didn't know a showerhead could make such a difference. I never thought I would be reviewing a showerhead but it's that good. So far, the benefits have far outweighed the cost. I purchased and installed this showerhead several months ago. My skin and hair feel softer, my scalp no longer itches and my shower doesn't smell like chlorine. And for those of you who color their hair, another added bonus, my color lasts longer and looks better. AND I installed it myself without anyone standing over me telling me I was doing it wrong. In other words guys and gals, it's fool-proof :)
