review/summary: InSinkEratorreview/text: We replaced a bottom of the line InSinkErator that lasted six years, because it ended up having a crack/leak in the main housing. This model is much quieter than the basic version, in particular since it has a big sound insulation blanket around it. So, if the noise of the cheaper units annoys you, this one is noticeably quieter. Can't say it works any better, but hoping it does last longer. EZ Installation by the way.
