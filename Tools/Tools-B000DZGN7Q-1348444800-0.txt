review/summary: Eats Garbage like a ROCK STAR!review/text: So i have been looking for a Disposal for sometime, i was getting irritated and annoyed by the one i have, although it was still working somewhat, it grew louder and took longer to chew the crap up. I believe it was on its last leg, plus it wasnt grinding the junk small enough so started to periodically back up plumbing. When i took the all dark blue mystery machinery i noticed it was all rusted and part of the grinder was actually gone.So on with the review.... i cook a lot so im constantly chucking my crap in the disposal and this thing pulverizes everything you throw in it. (Potato skins, fiberish veggies... carrots, celery, etc, chicken bones of any kind)And to top it off, it is quiet, i dont know if its as quiet as the one made by that one company that starts with an "I". But for the Price and Warranties, you cant beat WK!!!
