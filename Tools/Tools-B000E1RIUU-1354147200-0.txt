review/summary: Amazing. It Just Simply Works!review/text: This trap is the best. Very easy to set up and it simply works. It's like shooting fish in a barrel. You set the trap and, if you have mice in your house, it will catch them. And clean up is easy - just dump the mouse out and set it back up. You can even reuse the bait each time (peanut butter). I highly recommend this trap!!!
