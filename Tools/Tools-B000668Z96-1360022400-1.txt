review/summary: Great idea..but the only fleas much prefer my cat over this trapreview/text: After a new neighbor moved in next door with a dog, I've started to notice fleas on my kitty. He is indoor only, and I give him regular baths followed by Advantage once a month flea medication. The fleas keep coming back, they are sluggish in part due the effects of the Advantage, but the fact that I'm finding them and flea dirt in my cats fur is unsettling, it means there are more then just the 2 or 3 I find combing him. I vacuum and mop my hardwood floors every other day, washed all my sheets, blankets, cat beds at least a dozen time...I'm going crazy. I thought this would help me identify where the fleas are coming from, but I've moved the trap to every room for at least 24 hours each area and not one flea. It's frustrating, and the last thing I want to do is introduce is a bomb or something with harsh chemicals...I really wanted this to work, but I think the fleas just prefer hopping on my cat instead of this trap =(. Going to try some flea repellents on sprayed in my cats fur next to see if maybe that will entice the fleas to seek out the lamp instead.
