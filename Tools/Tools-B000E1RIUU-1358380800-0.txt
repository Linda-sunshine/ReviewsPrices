review/summary: The better optionreview/text: I had tried the traditional spring mouse traps, but the mice kept taking the bait without springing the trap. The first night I baited this trap I caught a mouse. I reset it and set it out the next night and caught another. It's quick and easy and I didn't get my fingers snapped using it.
