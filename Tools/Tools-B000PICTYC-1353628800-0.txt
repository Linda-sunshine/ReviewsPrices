review/summary: Versatilereview/text: This tomahawk is great. Super sharp and lightweight. I took it into the field every day of a recent hunt and used it to clear branches and small trees for a clear shooting lane. The only con is the handle is rather narrow, but this was easily remedied with some 550 paracord wrapped around the handle. This vastly improved the control and feel.
