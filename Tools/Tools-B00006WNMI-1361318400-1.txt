review/summary: Water filterreview/text: Filter easy to install, preforms what it was designed to do. Only negative is that it cuts down on my water pressure. The\is because I have well water and the pressure in my tank isn't sufficient to give me a good flow of water. But, it serves the purpose that I bought it for.
