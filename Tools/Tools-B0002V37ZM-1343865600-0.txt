review/summary: Great gadgetreview/text: This is a great tool for getting your brooms and mops off the floor. I was able to install it in just a few minutes. I noted that a few reviewers mentioned it did not hold properly. Perhaps they installed it upside down. I find it easy to get the mop and broom off and on and it holds securely. As I use it, if it doesn't perform, I'll update this review and let you know. Sometimes first impressions are wrong, but right now I can give this a recommended buy. The price is good in comparison to some other options.
