review/summary: Work Great! Money Savers!review/text: I bought these to test various electrical devices to see how much they were costing me on a monthly basis. Found that the vintage kegerator fridge uses very little and probably costs me less than $3.00 per month to run and my buzzing neon beer light is costing me over $8.00 per month. I now keep the neon off. Surely this will find other power suckers in the future.
