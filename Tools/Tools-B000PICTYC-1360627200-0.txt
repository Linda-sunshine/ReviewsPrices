review/summary: Good tomahawkreview/text: I bought mine at Walmart for $20 in the hunting section, but that was about 3 or 4 months ago. Since then, it's been a great tomahawk. But I just got the United Cutlery M48 and the M48 is better than this tomahawk in every way. The thing is though, this SOG is a lot cheaper. And the M48 isn't really $15-$25 better either even though that's how much more they will run you. I got the Ranger M48 so I spent $45 on mine right here on Amazon. So that's nearly DOUBLE the price of this SOG. And this SOG will do anything you need a tomahawk for. My M48 will be going to Afghanistan with me, but this here SOG Tactical Hawk has been the work horse of my three tomahawks and will stay that way for sure. I can't tell you how many times I've needed it for random stuff around the house. Plus it's easy as heck to sharpen. I once went to chop something on my back patio that was sitting on an old rug, the hawk chopped right through that and the rug in one little chop. It hit cement. It was a little bit flattened and dulled on the upper tip from that and I sharpened it right up in about 5 minutes with a cheap wet stone from walmart. It's a tough little hawk. Pretty plain and nothing special, but it's worth every penny and gets the job done just as any hawk on the web. Good thrower too.
