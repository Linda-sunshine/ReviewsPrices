review/summary: Genius!review/text: I've tried a lot of broom holders out there and this one is the best. It is sturdy and holds poles as thin as a golf club but also as heavy as a big shovel. It has kept my garage so much cleaner. I bought the Store N Slide version (basically this Magic Holder but it slides so you can install behind something) from Amazon for my parents and it is even more amazing. Every garage should have this unit! It makes me so happy to have all of my mops and brooms so neat and tidy.
