review/summary: SOG fusion v UC M48review/text: Just received the SOG and UC M48 this week. If you want a solid and dependable everyday working tool, the SOG is superior, hands down (cheaper too). If you want to scare the crap out of an ill intentioned home intruder grab the M48. The SOG arrived in perfect razor sharp condition. The M48 had a grinding flaw in the cutting blade, and, the blade is not straight with the handle (out about 1/4" to the left on the bottom). The M48 was on sale and I figure I got a factory defect. The SOG was also on sale and as I mentioned, arrived in perfect condition. Had to sharpen the M48 blade (very dull). The M48 sheath also had the top rivet pop out. Not worth the hassle shipping the thing back. It's cheap enough and I'll buy another if it bugs me too much.
