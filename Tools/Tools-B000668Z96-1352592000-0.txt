review/summary: It really works!review/text: Ok fleas had overrun our house like nobody's business. We tried everything including shampoos , front line, flea collars and any other product that claimed to kill fleas with extreme prejudice. Nothing would kill these fleas. I was starting to wonder if they had morphed into some evil non destructible strain of crawling misery. To make matters worse we have an indoor cat so I'm not really sure how we got fleas in the first place. I suspect a guest to our house with a flea ridden mongrel was the offender. So as a last resort I see this flea trap. I figured I was about to get suckered for the sticker price but I was desperate. So we buy one. We also buy generic capstar in the capsules. So we get the trap and the capstar. So its game on. My cat bites through my thumb in protest to me trying to administer the capsule. I decided that mixing into her food might be to both of our benefit. I foolishly plug in the trap. A very low tech affair in concept and construction. So off to bed I go thinking this will never work. So morning comes And I go to check my harvest. I have trapped a flea! I figure at this rate I can probably win the fight in a year or two. So I leave the trap plugged in another night. Day two I have 8 dead fleas. Now I am a madman waiting for morning to come so I can tally a new body count. On day 3 I have 15 fleas. Along with the capstar doses I have finally found a way to conquer the miserable critters. So basically I use the same mentality I use with snap traps on mice. Keep them set till there are no more takers. A great flea trap. I wish I thought of it.
