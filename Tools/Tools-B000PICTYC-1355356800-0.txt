review/summary: Great Tool, Just What it is described asreview/text: Looking at some of the reviews I wondered if this was truly a deal. I checked it out at a recent gun show. It is well made, strong, and has a metal band that is at the weak point where the handle meets the head, this gives extra strength where axes always breakdown. The handle is banded with grooves that give good hold barehanded, with gloves, or wet. The axe edge is very sharp, as someone noted it will shave your arms. I was able to make 3/4&#34;-1&#34; cuts in seasoned hardwood with only moderately hard swings. The point is thicker and very durable, I think the handle will last as long as the head. Very well made piece.
