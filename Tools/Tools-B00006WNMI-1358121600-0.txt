review/summary: Works wonderfullyreview/text: I've been using this filter for a couple of weeks now and couldn't be happier with the product. I instantly noticed great improvement in my tap water, which previously had a slight odor and unpleasant taste. As a result, I've not only stopped purchasing bottled water from the store, but I'm drinking much more water because it's now so pleasant and cost effective. The one issue I had is that the supplied adapters did not work with my faucet, which has external threads but is too small in diameter for the filter. Lowe's didn't have what I needed, so I went to a local plumbing supply store and they easily found what I needed. I will post a picture of the adapter for those of you who have this issue.
