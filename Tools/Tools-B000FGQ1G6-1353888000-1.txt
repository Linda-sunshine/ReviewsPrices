review/summary: Perfect for model helicopter repairreview/text: The size of the screwdriver was perfect for removing small screws on model helicopters. One reviewer mentioned the smaller 4mm bit size, but that is something I appreciated as it allows the shaft of the screwdriver to be smaller. The swivel handle is basic but the tool seems strong enough to last especially for such a low cost.
