review/summary: I use at all the timereview/text: I had used one for work for many years and can arrest to the durability, flexibility, and usefulness of the ladder. Since I purchased it, I've used it more times that I can list here. It's not too heavy and can be handled by a single person fairly well. It's great for those jobs that regular ladders don't. (stairs, etc.)A great little (and big) ladder at a bargain price!
