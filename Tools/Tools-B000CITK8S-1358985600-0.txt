review/summary: Works very well with only 1 issue.review/text: I bought this because I am retired now and my Ford Ranger sits out in the cold for long periods of time without being used. I also have a front loading John Deere tractor that sits for long periods of time. This charger does the job!! The only issue I have with it is that the cord is a hard, cheap plastic and is stiff. Couple that with freezing temperatures and it is barely flexible. Made in China. I gave it 4 stars because it works very well but the cord sucks.
