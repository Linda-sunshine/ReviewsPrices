review/summary: convenient door lockreview/text: We bought this lock to replace an existing Schlage keyed door lock (separate deadbolt and handle, which worked well) because of the convenience of the digital lock. By habit we lock the door when we leave the house. On occasion I have been locked out while working in the yard when my wife went to town and locked the door. I often forgot to carry a key when I worked outside away from the house, so I have used a key hidden outside. Having spare keys for each of our family members when they visit was also problematic. Installment of the new lock took about 30 minutes and was mostly straight forward, except I had to rotate the exterior trim 90 degrees because the gap between the former lock and handle was a little too small. The resulting look is quite acceptable. The lighted pad is very helpful in the dark. The new lock system has worked well for the month that it has been used. The best feature for us is its great convenience. The exterior of the lock, while outside, is not exposed to rain, so I can not address its response to foul weather. I have not yet had the opportunity to evaluate its operation under severe freezing conditions.
