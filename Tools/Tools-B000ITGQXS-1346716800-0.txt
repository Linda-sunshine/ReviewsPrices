review/summary: Powerful little light!review/text: This little light is so powerful, you can light up an entire room fairly well with it. The clip doesn't mangle pages in a book, and the swivel light is good for adjusting where you want the light to go (a good thing when reading in bed and my husband is snoozing). I've also used it for cutting my baby's nails when she's sleeping, and for looking for small toys under the couch.
