review/summary: Very good productreview/text: Bought this last summer for double door/doorway. It worked out great and I am looking forward to using it again this year. It went up really easily, all the hardware needed came with it. The screen material is very study and stands up well to the elements and cats. Magnets are heavy duty and keep the screen in place pretty well. The only drawback for me is that it is very dark. Other reviewers had mentioned that before so it was not a huge surprise, but it does block out a fair amount of light.
