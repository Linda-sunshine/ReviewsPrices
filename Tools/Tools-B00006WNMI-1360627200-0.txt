review/summary: Water pressure is terrible.review/text: Not only the the water coming thru the filter come out too slow, but the water coming thru the faucet without using the filter is too slow. It is barely enough to be aereated. I will not make this mistake again. Give me the option to conserve water with a removable part. Don't force me to conserve water if I chose not to.
