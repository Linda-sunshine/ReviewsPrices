review/summary: Not convenient to usereview/text: Because of its size and shape, there are very few places this device can be plugged in without displacing other plugs. Thus,to use it in my entertainment center (TV, DVD player etc.) is impossible. To use it for my refrigerator requires unplugging other appliances that share an outlet. The device should have a cord coming out the back. In fact, one could purchase a very short extension cord, connect it to the back of the unit and solve this problem. But why should you have to?
