review/summary: Smelled all the time, loudreview/text: In the past several decades I've owned nothing but Kitchenaid disposal units. When the no name brand unit in my new house broke I did some studying and decided to buy the Waste King model after reading positive reviews in magazines and here.The disposal works fine I guess. If anything its too powerful. Its loud and the whole counter would vibrate when I turned it on.it installed easy enough but the reason I give it 2 stars is the problem of the thing constantly emitting a bad odor. We called repairmen out and they cleaned the line but the odor stayed. I poured various liquids and odor eliminators to no, or temporary, effect. Finally I found the source of the problem. Ground up food attaches itself to the underside of the rubber gasket around the feeder. For the rest of the time I had the unit I had to pull the rubber gasket out and clean it with a stiff brush daily or the odor would return.Finally I'd had enough and went back to a Kitchenaid unit, no more odor problems! And its much quieter too.
