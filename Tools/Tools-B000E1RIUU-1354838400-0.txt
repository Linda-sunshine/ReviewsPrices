review/summary: Not sure if it works or not.review/text: Ordered this at the 1st sign of a mouse in the house! I found the opening and ultimately closed that up. Never have gotten a chance to catch the mouse. I assumed it would work if the mouse when inside. I liked this option as a more humane option to a snap trap which crushes the mouse or especially a sticky trap where the mouse will sometimes rip or chew its own leg off to escape. This company claims that the mouse is electrocuted in about 3 seconds.
