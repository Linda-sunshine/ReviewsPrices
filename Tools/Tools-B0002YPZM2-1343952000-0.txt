review/summary: Excellent product, reasonable pricereview/text: These gloves fit well, have a improved palm padding material. The thumb and forefinger have extra material knowing that with this type of glove this is the point that will get the most wear. Extra material at the finger tips too. Well made, I would buy them again.
