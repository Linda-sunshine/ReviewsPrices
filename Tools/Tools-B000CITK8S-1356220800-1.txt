review/summary: Couldn't be Easier to Use!review/text: The thing doesn't even have any settings on it. It just self-adjusts down to trickle rate after charging. I used this for my motor scooter battery. All I had to do was to plug it in, attach the cables and forget it. After a few hours it was fully charged and the light has just stayed green now for several weeks, presumably ready to just re-insert into my scooter in the spring and go! I check it occasionally to see if it's getting hot, and it has not gotten hot. Initially, I had attached the cables in a horizontal position--which did not make a connection; so just attach them in a vertical position and you'll be good.
