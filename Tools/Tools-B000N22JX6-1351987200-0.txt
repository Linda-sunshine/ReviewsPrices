review/summary: Pleasantly surprisedreview/text: When I unwrapped this heater I was a little taken back by the small size. But the heat it produces and the nice appearance make it a very nice heater. The remote is a great thing, I can turn it on from the warmth of my bed and in ten minutes my bedroom is nice and comfortably warm. The small size allows for it to fit in the smallest of rooms and still look great. I highly recommend this item. I am editing this to say - I liked this heater so much I purchased another one. It looks attractive and it HEATS, low/no noise, has a timer, has multiple heat settings, and a remote control, great value!!! Excellent product.
