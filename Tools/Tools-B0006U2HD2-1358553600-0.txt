review/summary: Just what I neededreview/text: I have about 12 dwarf citrus trees that require some protection from the occasional freezing weather that we get in our area. To give them this protection, I wrap some old style (non-led) christmas lights through them and use this thermostat to control them. So far it has worked perfectly for this purpose, turning on the lights when the temp gets down to 35F, then off at 45F. No setting of temperature, and it only cost about twelve bucks.
