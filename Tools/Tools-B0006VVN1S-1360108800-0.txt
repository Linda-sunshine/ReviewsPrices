review/summary: Very Good, But Not Greatreview/text: We have very bad water in our house. The house is over 60 years old with galvanized pipes. Between rust and hard water it's very hard on showerheads. It doesn't take long in our house to completely plug up a showerhead. And yes, you can use vinegar to remove the hard water, but it never works quite right.This filtered showerhead has solved all of that! We've been using it for 3 months and have as much water pressure as we started with. No hard water stains on the head. I can't say I've noticed a big difference in my hair, but my skin is not quite as dried out as usual.The only con I have with it is that it doesn't produce a very wide spray. If it did, it would be absolutely perfect!
