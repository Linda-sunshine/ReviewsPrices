review/summary: Super Productreview/text: After 5 years of use, my last Bug-Off screen wore out and I needed a new one. We use it on the door from our screened back porch so that our dog can go in and out without us having to open the door. It also allows us to leave the door from the house to the porch open and not have flies and mosquitoes come in. It works great and, in five years, when this one wears out we will buy another. If it gets heavy use like ours, the velcro will not last very long. I put one clamp on each side, about halfway up, and those work great. If you do not have a pet that runs through the screen to try and catch squirrels, the velcro might be sufficient. All in all, it is a very good product that I can recommend without hesitation.
