review/summary: strong, lightweight ladderreview/text: This ladder is smaller than my two Little Giants, and considerably lighter which makes it easier to move around. For single story work, this works quite well. The 300lb duty rating is quite high for something this light - roughly akin to the Werner "yellow" ladders in terms of duty rating. Recommended.
