review/summary: Works great for my motorcycle battery!review/text: This battery tender does exactly what it's supposed to do and I've had no problems with it at all. I like how it has the option of using the clamps or the ring terminals for making the connection. Since my battery is &#34;conveniently&#34; located under my gas tank, I went ahead and hooked up the ring terminals to my battery and routed the wire through my frame so that I now have a nice easy way to connect the plug. When I'm not using it, the plug is tucked away and out of sight. Now it's like I'm using a brand new battery every time I go to start my bike and it fires up immediately. It's also nice to know that the battery tender will not overcharge the battery. I'm very satisfied with this product and I'd recommend it to anyone considering buying it.
