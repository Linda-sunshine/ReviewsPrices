review/summary: Exactly as advertisedreview/text: This is the third Battery Tender I've purchased. I use these on boat batteries, lawnmowers and a sports car that spends months at a time sitting in the garage. Battery Tender Junior is quiet, cool and reliable. The cord is long enough and the quick disconnect feature allows for quick access to the vehicle its attached to. Highly recommended.
