review/summary: Got him.review/text: Totally murdered that mouse. He's dead. Mission accomplished. Light didn't flash so I didn't know he was dead until it started smelling suspicious in my place--then I checked. I'd still recommend the trap though. It worked really well and I just opened the top and dropped him in the trash can. Good alternative to the spring loaded trap.
