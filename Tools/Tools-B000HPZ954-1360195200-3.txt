review/summary: Just what i neededreview/text: I was looking for a surge protector that had atleast 10 outlets and that were spaced far enough appart that I would be able to utilize each plug. This was exactly what i was looking for. My only knock would be that the wall mounting holes in the back are quite small and did not allow for a standard size screw or nail head. But I was able to figure out a solution easy enough.
