review/summary: Good product, good pricereview/text: For what it is this screen is great. The rod isn't quite large enough and sometimes slips down the inside of our metal door frame we use this on. Also it is difficult to get the length just right on the floor so that the screen will close if you have any raises in the floor from say the door frame.Could also use more magnets...only has one set in the middle and one set at the bottom.The velcro that sticks to the door frame is white while the screen's velcro is black. I suppose they make the velcro white b/c they assume most frames the screen are going into are light colours but our doorframe is a dark brown so the white is noticeable and a little bit cheesy.But it does the trick. It's a good price. It keeps the bugs out. My dog can enter and exit easily. It has nice netting so you still get a breeze through the house.
