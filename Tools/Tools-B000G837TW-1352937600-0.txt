review/summary: So far so goodreview/text: Quiet and powerful, very compact and easy to install. Unit is what I needed for a limited space installation. Based on previous experience with this brand looking forward to many years of good service from this unit. Just wish they would include a power cord wit the unit but you can always use the cord from your old disposal. Pricing was very good better than I could find locally.
