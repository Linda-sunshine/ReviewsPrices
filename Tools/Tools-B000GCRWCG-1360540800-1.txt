review/summary: Become the poptartreview/text: The lot comes in a sealed plastic bag with the thermal blankets individually wrapped inside. The blankets themselves are inside of zip top bags with holes mfg in the sides. Blankets are pretty solid, wont rip if you pull on them, but are susceptible to tearing on corners or thorns. I have yet to test how well they keep you warm, but the product looks up to the job. Shipping was fast.
