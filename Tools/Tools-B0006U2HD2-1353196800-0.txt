review/summary: On at: ALWAYS Off at: NEVERreview/text: Definitely will be sending mine back. The thermostat does not turn off the outlet, AND one of the plug-ins will not allow me to plug anything into it. The right side allows a plug, but something is blocking the left outlet. Not too happy and will buy a better one at our local farm supply store.
