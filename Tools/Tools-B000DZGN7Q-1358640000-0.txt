review/summary: This is a powerhousereview/text: My old disposal finally died. I read many reviews before I finally settled on this one. I liked the price to power ratio and the very good reviews. It was really easy to install, and I've been using it for several months. It's extremely quiet and vibration is almost non-existent. It's eaten everything I've thrown in, including chicken bones, potato peelings, sour milk, etc. Just a few seconds and it's whirring silently with everything flushed. I do avoid long, stringy vegetables, like asparagus peelings and corn husks. I found that always jammed my last one, and I haven't tried that on this Waste King. I highly recommend this for any normal house use.
