review/summary: Silent but deadlyreview/text: This disposer replaced a a very loud and huge one that was many years old. My husband installed it on his own quickly and easily - he read other reviews which were helpful with the installation process. It was up and running in less than an hour. Man, this thing is quiet as a mouse....when it's running it makes the same sound as a "dead" or jammed disposer. I didn't realize it was grinding when we first flipped the switch! And grinds everything we put down there. It doesn't take up tons of space under the sink. The only con so far is the rubber lip around the drain. It's pretty stiff so I have to shove stuff down the drain with a spoon. Sometimes water has a hard time getting down the drain if some food blocks the stiff opening, so water backs up into the sink until I press the food down and get the water flowing down again. its really not that big of a deal, just something i noticed on occasion. Hoping the rubber softens over time. Other than that con, this thing is awesome! Would buy another in a heartbeat!
