review/summary: Not too sure this is how it should workreview/text: Just got the filter tonight, very hopeful from all the nice reviews. Very easy to install. I hate to waste water by running 10 minutes, so collected the water in a bucket.Problem:I only turned the water on to 1/6 of full pressure. Water leaks from the top (where it connects to the faucet). I also tried a PUR. The two are not so different in terms of leakage. May be there is a problem with my faucet or I should not turn water on to more than 1/6 of full pressure? OR may be this is just one filter seed so I should get a replacement and try it again?
