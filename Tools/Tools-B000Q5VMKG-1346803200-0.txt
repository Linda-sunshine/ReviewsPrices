review/summary: Junk!review/text: I ordered two of these units in April 2012. Both units have falsed more than once, usually in the middle of the night. The peak level buttons on both were erratic in function from the start -- the button on one unit recently failed completely. I've junked both and ordered a couple of Pro-Tech units to replace them.
