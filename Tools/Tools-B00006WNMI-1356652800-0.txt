review/summary: I can't believe I've fought with the other crappy brands this longreview/text: I've tried the two other brands of faucet water filters, let me just tell you... they break, you replace them, they work for a little while, they fall off- repeat. My husband has warned that if I bring another faucet filter into the house he will throw it against the wall, he was that frustrated and fed up. That all changed when I tried the Culligan filter. It fits, it works, it stays put, its amazing. I can't believe I've fought with those other brands' filters for this long. The water tastes great, it installed in a snap and it was so affordable!! I am so happy! Its constructed so nicely, its lightweight, I'm in love! Thank you, thank you!
