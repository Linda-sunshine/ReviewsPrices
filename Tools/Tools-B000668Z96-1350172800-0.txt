review/summary: Not worth itreview/text: This item does not work. When I first received it, I was so excited. After setting it all up, I was hopeful that this would be the end to the flea problem we have. As i went to plug it in, I noticed nothing was happening. So I went and check on the unit and guess what the light bulb was burned out, making the unit useless. I haven't even used it and I can't use it.I contacted Amazon and told them what happened. They shipped me a new one. Willing to give the product a second chance, I went and put the unit together. This time, I noticed a huge crack in the piece that you use to tighten the bulb to the structure. Well now the light bulb won't stay on and keep falling onto the sticky pad.I eventually just asked for a refund. In the whole 5 days in trying to get this unit to work, 0 fleas have been caught.
