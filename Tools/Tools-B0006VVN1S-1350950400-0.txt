review/summary: Didn't really notice anythingreview/text: I bought this filter because i recently switched to using all-natural shampoo bars, and having filtered water works better with the bars, however, i'm not noticing any difference so i'm not sure if this filter head filters minerals, but the chlorine smell is definitely fading, so this is still a good product. And it's very easy to install so if you are not looking for a really strong filter for skin or hair purposes, this is a good deal.
