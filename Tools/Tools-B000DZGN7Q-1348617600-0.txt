review/summary: Waste King - My First Garbage Disposalreview/text: I bought the Waste King L-8000 because when I bought my house, I forgot to check if a garbage disposal would be included.Installation was pretty easy - it took me a while to get the nerve to install it as I don't have many plumbing skills. Too bad I waited so long (over a year) it was fairly simple.The bad:I'm not a garbage disposal expert or anything, but I thought you could run a garbage disposal with a sink full of dirty dish water. When I run the disposal when the sink is full of water though, it starts vibrating my sink and the countertop FURIOUSLY. I contacted their customer service and they told me I shouldn't run the device this way- I should run it from an empty sink. I don't know if this is true or not, but the individual I spoke to didn't inspire much confidence. I read the service manual from cover-to-cover and it didn't mention anything about this either way.I'm still happy with the product, I wish their customer service was more engaging though.
