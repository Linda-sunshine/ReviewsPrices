review/summary: Works great (but I didn't install it)review/text: This works really well - easily holds up to 5 brooms/ rakes/ swiffers. Super simple to take the tools on and off. I'm not the worst at mechanical construction, but the installation was not intuitive. I glanced at the instructions, then handed it to my boyfriend and begged him to install it.
