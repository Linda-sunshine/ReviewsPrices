review/summary: Taller than I thought it would be.review/text: I have been looking for a ladder that is heavy duty and most cost big $ so I was happy to find this one. I was looking at the different options and I needed a ladder that would allow me to reach 10 foot, along with reaching the roof of a one story house. I knew I didn't need something huge but after looking at the stats I was confused by the numbers. Another thing that was confusing was how it turns into scaffolding. It has the ability to become two ladders while the part that you stand on would be up to you to provide.
