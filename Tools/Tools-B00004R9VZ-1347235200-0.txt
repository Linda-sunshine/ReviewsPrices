review/summary: Good bug zapperreview/text: The Flowtron insect killer works very well to keep mosquitos under control. I have it installed just below the edge of my deck and it seems to attract the bugs before they get on the deck area, making outdoors in the late evening much more enjoyable and safer from the West Nile virus. Good buy.
