review/summary: Good for Outdoor Workreview/text: I work for a cable company in the Pacific Northwest and needed some new gloves for the coming rain and cold season. I've used two or three different kinds of gloves some good, some bad. These gloves are great! I've only been using them now for about 2 two weeks but I am very happy I bought them. They fit my hands better than any other work glove I've purchased so that immediately impressed me. I haven't had the worst of the weather yet but in the cold and rain I have used them in they perform fantastic. I'm planning on buying another pair just to have on hand in case I lose these ones and that way I won't have to swing by a hardware store and pick up a set that I am just buying in order to get through the day. If you buy these gloves I am sure you'll be very happy you did!
