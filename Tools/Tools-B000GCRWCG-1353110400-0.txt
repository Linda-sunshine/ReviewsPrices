review/summary: Another use for these blankets . . .review/text: I have never used the mylar thermal blankets, before . . . but thought they might come in handy for emergencies. I've found that I can use them now that the weather is chilly. I'm renting a house, and so, cannot make any permanent modifications. There's a long hallway that separates the living room from the bedroom, and this hallway exudes cold air this time of year. Since there are no doors to these rooms to inhibit the flow of cold air into the living areas, I'm using extension rods with mylar blankets over the entrance ways. The blankets are just folded over the rods a couple of inches and taped into place. These are hung where there would ordinarily be doors. And they work! Stepping from the cold hallway, moving the blanket aside just enough to enter the living area . . . . what a temperature difference! Like night and day! So warm and toasty inside. The mylar blankets do a great job keeping warmth inside partitioned rooms! Hopefully, this will keep the costs of heating down, too . . . . as I would only need to concentrate on keeping certain rooms comfortable.
