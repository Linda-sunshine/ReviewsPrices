review/summary: Great, Easy to Install Screen!review/text: We have French Doors in our livingroom and miss out on any evening breeze that passes our way. My husband and I decided to look into these new, easy to install screens and found there are many on the market. We checked Amazon and found Bug Off to have the best rating. We ordered a 60" by 80" screen and received it quickly. I was able to install it myself as my husband looked on, doubtful I could put it up alone. I had it up in about 15 minutes and immediately felt the breeze make its wasy into the livingroom. Our puppy thought it was the best thing to happen and made her way out immediately. Our bigger, older dog is afraid to go through it. This screen is study, easy to use and closes shut pretty well. We've had it up for two weeks and so far, very good!
