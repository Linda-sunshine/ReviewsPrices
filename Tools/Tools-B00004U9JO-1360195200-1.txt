review/summary: Perfect replacementreview/text: Not much to say other than it was a replacement for my broken one. Installation was easy, remove old with a twist disconnect wires and connect them to the new one, lift and twist to hold in place. ( reminder do not forget to open the dishwasher plug for dishwasher discharge )
