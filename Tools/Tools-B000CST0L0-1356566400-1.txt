review/summary: Chamberlain single button garage door remotereview/text: I installed a new garage door opener 5 years ago. It came with only one remote controll. Well in the mean time my daughter got her drivers license, yes then a car, then started parking in my 2-car attached garage. As we all know these kids are so pampered these days that I agreed to purchase one for her. She loves it, and I'm lost for words.
