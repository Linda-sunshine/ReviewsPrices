review/summary: Good compact ladderreview/text: This ladder is compact for its size - a good feature. I wish that the rungs on the ladder were a bit more flat so you could get a better grip with your foot, but it's still a good ladder. It's handy that you can move this ladder around and use it at different heights. It's not that heavy either, but still is sturdy. I think it's a good buy for the money.
