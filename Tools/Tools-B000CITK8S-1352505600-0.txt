review/summary: Fantastic product and great pricereview/text: These chargers work extremely well, and for the price, you can't afford not to have a couple of them. There are already some excellent reviews on here, won't explain everything again. But I use these to keep all of my cars that are in heated shortage charged and use the 2 port ones (with temperature compensation) for the unheated portion. These are so much less expensive, I might use these on some less expensive batteries that will spend the winter in the cold. They also work well to charge batteries if you aren't in a hurry, and I tend to trust them more than my normal battery charger for that duty as well. I wrecked several batteries last winter with cheap trickle chargers, and now I'm sold on Battery Tenders.
