review/summary: Just OK. Definitely not greatreview/text: I have a pair of these that i was issued like 9 years ago by the Air Force. Do they work well at keeping the noise out? I can tell you, using them standing mere feet away from F-15's while wearing them, that they do indeed keep noise out. That is where their goodness stops, though.Here is my list of negatives and/or non-awesomes:-the little metal wires in the headband are not padded, and they become uncomfortable after a while-they aren't as lite as they could be-they grip your head harder than they need to (more spring tension in the metal wires), and can give you a headache after a while-the ear cups are HUGE, and can get in the way if you're doing stuff while wearing them-a common feature among earmuffs like this nowadays is that they fold up. this keeps the wires from getting bent, and the cups from breaking off. these do not have this feature.I deployed to the middle east with these, and the metal wires got all bent to crap in my duffle bag. This made me happy. After 9 years, I want new hearing protection.
