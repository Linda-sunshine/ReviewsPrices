review/summary: Purchased one to test and now bought the secondreview/text: I am very happy with my Bug-Off Screen. I purchased one for my home office in my backyard. I had french doors and couldn't find an easy approach to screen it so ordered one to try it out. It works as advertised... Very simple to set up, allows for easy access, and my dog can come and go as she pleases. I just put in an order for a second one for our back door. Very happy with these! Definitely recommend!
