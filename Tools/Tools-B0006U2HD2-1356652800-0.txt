review/summary: Pipe saverreview/text: We are using this in an old dairy where the well comes up. The room is 36 square feet and we wanted to install a heater so the pressure tank would not freeze. We could not find a heater with a thermostat that went below 65 degrees. We didn't want to heat the room, only stop it from freezing. We have had several hard frosts and this has done the trick.
