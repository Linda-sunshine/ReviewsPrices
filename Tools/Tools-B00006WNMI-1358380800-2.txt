review/summary: NO leaks, music to my ears.review/text: I'm not going to blast Brita and Pur, but the thing that bothered me about them was that there was always somewhere on the two filters that would leak. Whether it was where the filter attached to the unit, where the unit attached to the faucet or the nob/button to turn on the filter.. water would be dripping, hitting the stainless steel sink like a bad, out of tune drum. And the longer I had those two filters the worse this problem would get.The Culligan does not have any of these issues. It connects to the faucet with a metal connection (not plastic), and works like you would expect it to. This is the biggest thing for me. It just works. I can get up in the middle of the night and get a glass of water quietly. If you have been disappointed with other faucet based filters this one will make you unreasonably happy.
