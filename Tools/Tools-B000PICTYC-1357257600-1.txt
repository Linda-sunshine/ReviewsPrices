review/summary: SOG Toamhwakreview/text: Great service from Amzon in processing and shipping the order. Good axe for daily use and medium duty use. The handle is comfortable. For its size it is light, a nice feature. I will see how the stainless steel holds up with time. I suspect it wild fine for my use.I would recommend this axe for light to medium work. I am not sure it will hold up well to heavy duty use.
