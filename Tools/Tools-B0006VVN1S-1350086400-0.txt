review/summary: Great product!review/text: Ive lived without soft water for about 6 years and forgot how awesome soft water really is. My girlfriend and myself noticed a difference almost immediately. Her hair got softer and less damaged. I noticed the biggest difference with how my skin felt, I no longer have that feeling where your skin feels like it has a film of soap on it after you get out of the shower. Overall great product, highly recommend it!
