review/summary: Great Purchase!review/text: Awesome product at an awesome price! I wasn't disappointed on any level of my purchase. I bought 5 of them; one for each of my media areas, as well as one for my computer/printer/modem area in my office.Key features to me:#1. 4156 Joules (Biggest reason I bought!)#2. 12 Outlets, efficiently located#3. Slim design#4. Mounting ability (I wall mounted all of my media area surge protectors - very clean!)#5. Right angle plugSide note: Shortly after I mounted the surge protectors, my local cable company (Time-Warner) had to come to my home for a service call unrelated to the surge protectors (Modem replacement) and the technician said that running the coaxial cables through the surge protectors was probably unnecessary and may actually be counter-productive to quality of reception (Another level of filter?) because they have a surge protector at the street box where it comes into the house, as well as the main box for the area. That said, I didn't change anything and my reception is beautiful. The point is, in your area, it may be counter-productive to quality. Ask your local cable company if coaxial protection on your surge protectors is necessary. If I knew this before hand, I may have purchased a similar Belkin product, minus the coaxial cable inputs for a little less money...Regarding the quality of the surge protectors and the price; outstanding! It's everything they represent it to be.
