review/summary: Exactly what I wanted!review/text: I was a little nervous buying this product, because I was seeing mixed reviews regarding it. Then it showed up and it was damaged, I wasn't feeling anymore confident. I ordered a new one and it shipped out before I could even return the first one. It arrived promptly and was in perfect condition. I have it installed now and it's PERFECT! I love it! It suits my needs perfectly! I have two brooms and two swiffer duster mops that hang perfectly behind my dryer. Would definitely recommend this product!!!
