review/summary: Great Piece of Equipmentreview/text: The build quality of this tomahawk/hatchet is very good and durable. I am using it in a survival pack in case that terrible day ever comes or if I am out surviving in the woods somewhere. I would trust my life with this to get my out of a jam or for general survival needs for cutting and gathering wood and the such. Excellent piece of equipment to have and every home or survival person should have one just because you never know when you will need something like this and it is all around a very useful tool.
