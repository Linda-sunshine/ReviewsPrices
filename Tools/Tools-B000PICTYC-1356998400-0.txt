review/summary: Awesome Tomahawk!review/text: This little tomahawk looks pretty sweet in my knife/sharp-things collection. It has a nice weight to it and doesn't feel cheap. A regular hatchet will probably function better as far as practical-utility is concerned, but this could definitely be used as a tool if you do not have a proper hatchet.
