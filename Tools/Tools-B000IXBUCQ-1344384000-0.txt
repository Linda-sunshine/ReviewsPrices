review/summary: Great for work!review/text: I work security and bought this flashlight to use on the job. Except for being an LED light, it's exactly the same as the one supplied by the company. It's also several times brighter and is effective at a greater range. This makes it safer to perform my job, poking into dark corners and what not. I can more easily identify just what it is I'm seeing. As a last resort, I can use it defensively if attacked by the occasional (admittedly rare) aggressive transient.
