review/summary: Evriholder Magic Holderreview/text: I actually purchased tis product at a local store. Agreed that it installs easily, but it only took a few uses for the tension springs to fall out of the black ball shapes and therefore they lost the ability to grip anything. Since my mop, broom, dry sweeper, etc., all have a tip on the handle with a hanging hole, I finally took the "magic holder" down and put up an item advertised as a key holder -- but it worked just as well.
