review/summary: Good solid choice for a multiple outlet stripreview/text: I ordered this outlet strip to plug many technology products in each night for re-charging. I particularly like the fact you can close off the outlets which are not being used. I have had no issues with this product and would recommend it to anyone wanting some extra protection, especially for technology products. This is a much better strip than most flimsy, plastic ones purchased at lower prices.
