review/summary: Love This Little Sharpener!review/text: If I can ever remember how to hold this sharpener (I always have to turn it around a few times until I get it right), I love it! :) It works wonderfully to sharpen my knives, and it lasts forever! I have had/used it for 4 years and it's still going strong. I keep it in my kitchen drawer, and pull it out every time a knife gets dull, and it quickly and easily has it sharpened back up in a flash. Highly recommend!
