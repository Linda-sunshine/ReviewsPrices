review/summary: Screwdriver setreview/text: I needed a bunch of tiny screwdriver heads for opening up my laptop computer. In particular, I needed philips #00. This set functions well. The tips are magnetic and sturdy. My only complaint is that the sizes etched into the different pieces are hard to read.
