review/summary: So far, so goodreview/text: 2 1/2 years ago our plumber replaced the disposal that was in place when we moved in. That disposal (which the plumber provided) died young but just out of warranty. Wanted something with a longer warranty. This disposal runs well and has a much longer warranty. Can't comment on installation difficulty; our plumber installed it.
