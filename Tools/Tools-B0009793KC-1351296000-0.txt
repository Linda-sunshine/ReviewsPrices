review/summary: Great productreview/text: We use this in our KitchenAid fridge. We tried another brand which left a chlorine taste in our ice cubes. This disappeared completely when switching to this product. We order via Subscribe and Save and get a discount as well as free shipping, and it arrives right around the time we need to change the filter - great system!
