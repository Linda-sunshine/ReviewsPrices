review/summary: great productreview/text: i bought this about 6 years ago at a home store. paid almost twice as much. its the best, i use it in a front porch i turn it on heat in the fall and forget it till spring. its simple to use and overridd. once and a great while it will need to be turned off and on but maybe once the entire season
