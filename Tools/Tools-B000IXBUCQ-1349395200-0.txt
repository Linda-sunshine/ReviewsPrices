review/summary: Great heavy-duty lightreview/text: Though there are many imitations and look-alikes out there, this is the only heavy duty long-lasting battery powered light that gives a good light for you to work with. Just remember this isn't a tactical-type of flash light, but a practical/industrial flashlight so the lumens aren't overwhelmingly bright. It also doubles as a baton I just might add. For non-lethal security detail - I would recommend this light, or even the 4-D cell version. LED means you won't be changing your light source as often (if at all) and you get that nice, crisp white light instead of that yellow coloring. Bare in mind that it is harder to identify cable color codes with any LED light, therefore it is recommended that you do go with an incandescent-type flash light. Other than that, this light shines.
