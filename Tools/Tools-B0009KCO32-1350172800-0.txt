review/summary: Easy to install screen, good for a rental unit, gets the job donereview/text: I have a rental apartment in San Francisco with a patio, but I never leave the door open because the bugs come in. Finally I had enough and spent a bunch of time looking around for a solution that didn't cause permanent damage to my apartment but actually worked.Summary: This product fit the bill, though it isn't classy looking, but it's also not hideous. I recommend this if you can't install a permanent door and/or if you don't go through the screen door very often. If you have a bunch of kids constantly going in and out, it's probably not so good...Pros: The unit was stupidly simple to install. I barely read the instructions. It took literally five minutes. It fit the door perfectly (but make sure you measure your door and order the right one! Mine was the 30" wide one). It's actually kind of a brilliant design considering it's price and abilities.Cons: It looks cheap. It feels cheap. It doesn't always "close" properly so you have to futz with the magnets. Another review on here recommended adding a magnet, I probably will do that and then it will "close" better.Notes: It's basically a screen "cloth" attached to a dowel bar at the top, with a weighted bottom, a slit through the middle with some magnets so that you can walk out, and velcro on the sides. The top bar expands to lock the whole thing in place, and no tools are required for installation.I do recommend this product and am very happy with what I got for the money.
