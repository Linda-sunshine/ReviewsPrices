review/summary: Love these glovesreview/text: I bought the XXL forCustom Leathercraft 125XX Handyman Flex Grip Work Gloves, XX Largeand I am amazed they fit so well. I have pretty large hands and typically end up running through other XXL gloves since I end up putting extra stress to the seams and the finger tips (the middle in particular). I've sealed my 6 car driveway, did a ton of yard work, and even used them for paintball with no problems. I'll be purchasing another couple of these since I got the driveway sealant all over them and so I can have a supply of well fitting, durable gloves in-house. Even with all that sealant stuff on it, they fit, feel, and function very well. I am very pleased with this purchase!!!
