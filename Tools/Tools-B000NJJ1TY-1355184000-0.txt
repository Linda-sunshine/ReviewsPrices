review/summary: Disappointed, then pleasantly surprisedreview/text: Wonderfully convenient when coming in the back door in the dark or with groceries. Easy to install and program.Lasted a little over 2 years - very light usage - electronic part has malfunctioned. Battery had been replaced week before. Cost me a locksmith call to get in my house - I'd left the door unlocked & gone outside without my keys so couldn't get in another door either. After locksmith left I put the key into the lock to see if it would work - well sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't and I can't get the key out. Too expensive to last only a couple yrs.ADDED INFO: Went to buy a replacement lock. Salesman at Lowe's suggested I call Schlage Customer Service so I did. They are sending me a free lock. All they wanted was the serial number from my lock.
