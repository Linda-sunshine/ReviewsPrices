review/summary: Good Qualityreview/text: I needed an adapter to connect my sockets to my cordless drill. I came across these on Amazon for only $3.50. I really only needed them for one repair project I was working on, so I didn't care if they only lasted me for the one use. To my amazement, the are actually built really strong! My craftsman sockets and drive extensions snap on really snug. It took some work to remove them, but it's way better than the alternative (being too lose).You get 3 adapters to fit sockets for: 1/4 inch, 3/8 inch and, 1/2 inch.The quality of these way surpassed my expectations. Now, instead of throwing them away after my project was complete like I expected, I am put them in my tool box with my sockets. I definitely will be using these more often!
