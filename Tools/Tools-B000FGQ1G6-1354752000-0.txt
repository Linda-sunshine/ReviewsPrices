review/summary: Got the job done for me.review/text: I needed tool kit to open up my macbook, and this one did a good enough job for me. It seems reasonably well made, though it probably won't last you a lifetime. or even heavy daily use.If you need a toolkit for occasional use or a specific project I can recommend this one.
