review/summary: Victor's has the best traps for fleas and roachesreview/text: I had a horrible infestation of fleas since I cannot turn a stray cat down that wants to stay.The Flea Trap I ordered had some kind of shortage in it. I called Victor's and they immediately sent me another workable trap -- no questions asked -- and I got it fast!!!I caught thousands and thousands of these buggers in my trap -- looked that way anyway. I still use it now and then. I strongly recommend it. It works best in a totally dark room -- the fleas are attracted to the light.I have used Victor's products for a number of years now. Good company. Good product.
