review/summary: As good as the originalreview/text: We had an unfortunate disappearance of a garage door opener, so needed a replacement. Took about a minute to sink this remote up to my garage door. This one looks and acts exactly like the one that came with the garage door originally. If you're looking for a replacment or an extra opener, this is a good product.
