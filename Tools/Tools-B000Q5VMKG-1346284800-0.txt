review/summary: It Works - So Glad I Bought Itreview/text: Bought this for my daughter three weeks ago when she moved into an apartment building that uses gas. Today the alarm went off and the digital display indicated a level of 60 that went up to 80 within 30 minutes. She called the gas company (please call 911 not the gas company if your alarm goes off) and because she had the numbers to report they were at her apartment building within minutes. Their tests confirmed the alarm was right and the CO level was due to a faulty water heater. So glad I bought it the week she moved in and that I didn't procrastinate.
