review/summary: CHARGE!!!review/text: The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery. I purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and I am pleased to say that the unit works great. It is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition.I made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive & negative terminals on the battery. The opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use. When I know that I will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time, I simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery's power supply.Battery Tender makes larger charging units, but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for ATV's and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers. Because of it's very discreet size it does not take up any needed space. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility.
