review/summary: Kills everything except tiny fruit flies (too small)review/text: I really love this flowtron, zaps hard, cool to watch electrified sparkles of moth and other flying insects. I used it indoor, works for me. This model in particular does not kill the tiny pesky fruit flies. Recently I juice a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables, got some pesky fruit flies and this thing doesn't catch flies that small, I wish it did so I wouldn't have to make a fruit fly trap just for them. But everything else, common mosquito, flies, moth, you name it - kills. If this thing would kill the tiny 1-2mm fruit flies then it'll be 5/5 stars.Read my review on The Executioner electrical hand-held zapper that TOTALLY SOLVED my tiny midget 1-2mm fruit fly problem. http://www.amazon.com/Executioner-Swat-Mosquito-Swatter-Zapper/dp/B000MU2MJA/The Flowtron 1/2 acre works GREAT, after nearly a month, still working great, no issues with built quality on the one that I got. Kills EVERYTHING over 2mm flying insects, moths, mosquitoes, flies, bees, etc. I got the Executioner zapper for the tiny fruit fly insects, which most people don't have a problem with.
