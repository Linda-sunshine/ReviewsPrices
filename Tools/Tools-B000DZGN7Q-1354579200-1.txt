review/summary: So far, so good!review/text: This was incredibly easy to install. It took about an hour from beginning to end. It shipped quickly and I had it in a couple days. I read some reviews about leaks and broken plastic parts. I have not had any problems. It was noticeably quieter than the previous In-Sink-Erator. My only complaint is the plastic part that attaches to the sink. This is visible from the top, and my fear is that it will scratch and wear. I would give this 5 stars if that were a metal/chrome part.I'll update this review if I have any problems.
