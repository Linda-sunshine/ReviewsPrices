review/summary: Overly sensitive!! Do not install in any room adjacent to a kitchenreview/text: This alarm is way too sensitive. It goes off every time we pull bacon out if the oven, doesn't even take things to burn before it goes off. If you can't cook anything greasy ever, why have the alarm installed? Rip out! And get a less sensitive model, because I don't need a smoke alarm to tell me when my bacon is done.
