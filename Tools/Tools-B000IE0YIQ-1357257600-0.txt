review/summary: Awkward to use.review/text: The air station inflator has been functional, so far, but I have found it awkward to use. The on and off switch is inside one of the compartments and doesn't have a good handle on it, despite the fact that you must carry it around to each tire as you fill it up, since the air hose is so short. The machine also seems finicky, since you must follow certain actions for it to work right, instead of just running, like a gas station inflator might work. The machine does what it's supposed to do, it's just not very simple or convenient to use.
