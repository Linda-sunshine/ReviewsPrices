review/summary: This is pretty cool little toolreview/text: This is pretty cool. And really does blend right in with the other keys. The knife isn't super easy to use (neither is the bottle opener) because of the way it folds at a weird angle. But everything works well in a pinch. I can't decide if I like this or the swiss army key chains better. I go back and forth.
