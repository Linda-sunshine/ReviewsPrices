review/summary: Great for the price.review/text: I have tried multiple pairs of work gloves to use around the yard and for housework. This pair, so far has stood the test of time. I like them because they breathe during the summer months when it is hot and keeps your hands warm as it is starting to get colder out. I have trimmed rose bushes and did not have anything go through them and poke me.
