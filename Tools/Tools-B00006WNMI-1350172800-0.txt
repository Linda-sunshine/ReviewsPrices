review/summary: Top cracked and leakedreview/text: I bought this filter in Feb/2011, so its been almost 2 years. Even though it's a good filter and worked as expected, I am giving it 2 stars because of the following1) The top started to cracked soon after installation and finally it started to leak today2) Culligan does not honor 1 year warranty if you did not buy from them directly. I had an issue with the equipment two months after I bought it. When I had the issue I called Culligan and they flatly told me they would not honor the warranty since I did not buy from them directlyI guess its better than other filter out there in the market but not good enough
