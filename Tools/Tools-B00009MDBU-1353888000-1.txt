review/summary: Stopped workingreview/text: This was nice for the price, and gave me a good indication of the cost of my appliances. I would have liked it to retain a memory of the wattage by using a battery, even if the memory only lasted a few minutes because you find yourself having trouble reading the information on the device when it is in a hard to reach area.I bought this probably 3-4 months ago and now it no longer works, it cut the power off to the devices that were connected to it also. I would not mind paying a little more for a more reliable device.
