review/summary: wasnt sure if i should buy, but happy i did!review/text: i have oil heat and i just wanted something to heat my living room a lil so i could keep my heat low! the days its been cold i had it on for about 2 hours and it raised my temp in the house from 64 to 69..i was very surprised that this little heater would do that !! so i would say for the amount of money i spent...about $50 ..i love it!!
