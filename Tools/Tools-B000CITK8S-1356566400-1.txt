review/summary: Battery Chargerreview/text: I had one of these for years and gave it away. I've also recommended these to numerous friends, and they have all been grateful and impressed. Great for the vehicle you just don't drive that much, or an extra battery that you don't want to go dead. Buy one so you have it when you need it. I also have a CTEK that is highly regarded, and it is a toss up between them. I tend to grab this one more for maintenance, and the CTEK when I need to charge. They both have been great products for me.
