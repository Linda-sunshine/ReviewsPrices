review/summary: Wonderful Flea Device!review/text: I give this 5 STARS, 10 stars if I could! I've used this on a few flea breakout occasions. I don't know why all the bad reviews? They WORK! I use this along with the generic CapstarChicken Flavored Flea Killer Capsules for Cats and Small Dogs - 12 mg Nitenpyram Per Capsule....Same Active Ingredient As Capstar - 12 Capsules Treat 12 Pets 2 - 25 Pounds& generic ProgramLittle City Dogs once-a-month FLEA CONTROL Capsules for Cats and Small Dogs - TWELVE 165 mg Lufenuron Capsules ...Same Active Ingredient As Program - a full year of protection from flea eggs and larvae for your pet& ZAP! There goes my flea problem! My kitty Beetlejuice has an allergy to flea's, so it's a nightmare when I get flea's. I have to keep buying more traps because my relatives & friends see how well they work and "borrow" them (never see them again)! I think the negative reviews on here are due to the lack of flea's in their home. If you have a problem getting your pet to take a pill, I suggest "Pill Pockets" they're a real treat!Greenies Feline Pill Pockets Chicken 1.6oz.If you DO have a major infestation of flea's, I can guarantee you'll catch them with this wonderful invention, the flea trap! Buy it! You'll be glad you did!I HIGHLY recommend the Victor Ultimate Flea Trap!!!!!
