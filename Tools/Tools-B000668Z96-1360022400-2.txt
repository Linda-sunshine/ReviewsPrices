review/summary: Did the trick 100%review/text: I only live in a small studio apartment, still I was quite impressed with how effective this trap was. I plugged it in and caught aboiut 5 fleas the first few days, but within a week there were around 200 of them stuck to the glue pad. At that point the problem was resolved. No more fleas, not on my dog, none biting me, none anywhere. After 2 weeks I replaced the glue pad, that was 5 days ago. There is not a single flea in the trap. Vaccuming along with keeping this trap plugged in has completely eradicated the pests. It may take more of the traps to work in a larger home, but I have faith in this product.
