review/summary: Great all purpose ladderreview/text: I replaced my old 16 ft. ladder and 6 ft. step ladder with this. Luckily I got it on sale before the price went up but even at the current price its a good deal. So many configurations and it only took me about 5 minutes to figure out how the change it into the various positions. I love that it can be a 9 ft. step ladder. The ladder is not too heavy at about 45 pounds and can be carried easily by someone of average strength. Should last a long time. Not sure why anyone would spend 200 more for the little giant when this seems like essentially the same ladder.
