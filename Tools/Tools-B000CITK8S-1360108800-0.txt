review/summary: Battery Tender the bestreview/text: I have been using the Battery Tender Jr. for several years and just purchased another for a different vehicle. I have and old Corvette that is a project car. It has been sitting for a very long time. Every time I went to work on it I was having to buy a new battery. After 3 batteries I bought my first Battery tender and have not had to worry about it since. Always fully charged and the enginge in the old Vette fires at first crank. Love it.
