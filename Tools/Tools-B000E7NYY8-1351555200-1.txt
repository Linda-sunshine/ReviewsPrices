review/summary: Great Thermostatreview/text: This works great for the heaters that don't come with a thermostat built in. I have been using it now for over a month and love it. You can program it to a different setting for different days and nights as well as its easy to change the setting if the weather gets warmer or colder then you thought it would be. It is a life saver and is saving me on my light bill.
