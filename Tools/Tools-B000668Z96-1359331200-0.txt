review/summary: Neatoreview/text: This works really well. I bought 2, since our flea problem got out of control. One of our 4 cats is allergic to fleas, so he got cuts all over him almost overnight. This, combined with daily combing of all the cats (even the princess who very much objects) and his wounds have healed. Getting rid of these disgusting creatures is tough, anything that helps is a good item.This is only 4 stars since one of the light bulbs burned out after 2 days.
