review/summary: What a neat device!review/text: Our refrigerator was freezing things even with the temperature control set to the warmest setting. It wasn't a bad thermostat (after wasting money on a new one I bought a temporary air-sensing thermostat--the Robertshaw CC-1) and everything is working great again--but for how long? It has a very slow leak and the coils no longer get cold enough to turn off the built-in thermostat even though the temperature inside gets down to 15F! If the leak is very slow it could run for months or years before it will no longer keep things cold. So, I bought the Kill-A-Watt to monitor how much the refrigerator is running to keep it at 35F inside. After just a couple of days of monitoring with this device I can see that it is running less than 40% of the time (it is using about 1KWH/day but it would use 2.88KWH/day if it ran all the time). I will leave the device connected until it is running something like 75% of the time before getting it recharged with refrigerant. A repair man told me it is not possible to fix the leak because 90% of the coils are embedded in the side walls and not accessible. Since it is part of a matched refrigerator/freezer pair, and they no longer make identical replacements, we would have to live with a mismatched pair or buy a new freezer also. The Kill-A-Watt is saving us hundreds of dollars at this point! This product is an amazing buy.
