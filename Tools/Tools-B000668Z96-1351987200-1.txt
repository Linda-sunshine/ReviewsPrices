review/summary: tired of the bitesreview/text: based on the number of fleas in the trap it works well.The only problem I've had with it is the light bulb burns out in about a month. I've found that the white night bulb works better than the clear ones. the only other thing I recommend is to get the refill packs for the botttom of the trap because they loose some of their stick from dust after awhile.
