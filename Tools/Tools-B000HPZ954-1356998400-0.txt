review/summary: Love it!review/text: I always love Belkin they make the best Surge protectors ever. Especially for use here overseas. Splendid. I don't feel like I'm over using power to be honest I don't think I have that much stuff to plug up but when power goes out, I'm glad my electronics won't be blown.
