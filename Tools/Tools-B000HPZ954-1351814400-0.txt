review/summary: I bought this to fix a rats nest of power strips, the "protection" is an extra bonus.review/text: I had a rats nest of power strips.. er let's say my other half did ;-) After some of my firsthand life experiences responding to disasters (including our own small house fire due to aCoralife Biocube, Size 14aquarium catching fire- no joke!) I've been slowly going through our home and fixing potential issues before they become a serious problem. This Belkin power strip is exactly what was needed. The outlets are configured to allow plenty of room for adequate airflow to cool those all too warm transformers as well as ample traditionally spaced outets. The 8' and 10' cords (on the 12 outlet model) are plenty long to mount this strip to wall behind furniture or in our case wire tied directly to the entertainment center to keep the strip off the floor. The 8 outlet model only comes with a 6' cord. The various cord lengths help to make the strip even safer by so many aspects (allowing the cord to be routed so perhaps no child or animal walking by spilling liquids into the powered outlets), no cords on the floor to trip over, etc. Now we can safely move the entertainment enter to clean under/behind with only the single power cord to be concerned with (and a couple cords run to the HDTV...)The Belkin power strip is hefty, but speaks of quality craftsmanship. I highly recommend and intend to purchase several more as the budget allows. Simply, when it comes to our families safety you can't put a price on piece of mind.Update: We now have purchased several and have been very impressed with the ease of plugging and unplugging cords. We have already cleaned up several cord issues and feel safer having these around. Sure, any of them can fail to protect items plugged in, but these Belkin outlets add a layer of peace of mind. Priceless.
