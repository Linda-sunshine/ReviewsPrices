review/summary: nothing but trouble.review/text: Nothing but trouble. Couldn't line up batteries with a defective internal placement. My return date expired because of my fiddling around trying to fix it and my busy schedule. arrgh..25 dollars for a trap that can't close the door to the batteries..cheaply made.shop around for something else.
