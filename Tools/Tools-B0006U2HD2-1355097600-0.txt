review/summary: Versatile Adapterreview/text: I now have several of these. They are awesome. You can use them for battery chargers so that the charger runs when needed most. Control a work light that you use for keeping a pump house above freezing. Even a small wattage electric heater on your boat. Saves electricity so that they don't run when not needed. I would however mark on them with a felt pen so that unsuspecting family members don't confuse them with a standard outlet extender. They are marked but not boldly.
