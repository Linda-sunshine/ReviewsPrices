review/summary: *WARNING* Your door hole must be 2-1/8 in diameter!!review/text: My guess is most modern doors have holes with 2-1/8 inch diameter. This wasn't the case with my old door, it had a 1-1/2 inch hole. I had to enlarge it. So be sure to check yours before ordering.Properly enlarging an existing hole isn't too difficult - provided you have the right tools. Search youtube for how-to video's. The bad news: if you screw up, time to buy a new door. The good news: it's easier than you think.As for the lock itself, working great so far. So much better than our old keyed lock.
