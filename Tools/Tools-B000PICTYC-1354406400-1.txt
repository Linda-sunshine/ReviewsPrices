review/summary: Efficient and Deadlyreview/text: I left my other tools at home my first night out this year camping, taking only my knife and this tomahawk. I've cut trees with it, severed limbs hunting (on deer) with it, and from time to time used it like a hammer. It comes RAZOR sharp, and yes it dulled a little the first day, but I'd expect that in the rocky terrain I had to use it in. When I got it back after the weekend, I put a new edge on it and that edge has held through multiple camping trips so far. It's an invaluable tool and a great addition to a go-bag!The only con I can think of is related to getting used to the handle. It's got a straight handle and is slimmer than a hammer or traditional hatchet or axe, so it seems to rest differently in the hand when using it for lots of serious wood-cutting. After a couple hours of making firewood, my hand was blistered. I got a little smarter the next time and wore gloves when I planned to use it continuously for a long period of time and have had no problems since. It's a GREAT tool and a deadly weapon. My wife made me buy her one, as well as my hunting buddy. We love them.
