review/summary: Best ladder I've ownedreview/text: Having owned a few ladders, I have been able to use a number of different styles, and having owned this for well over a year now, I can say that this is the best ladder I have ever owned.While it is a little heavier than other ladders of similar length, which could be an issue, this is merely a result of it being much sturdier than most ladders. In addition to being sturdy, it is also adjustable in many different ways. I've used this as a straight ladder to get on my roof, folded it 90 degrees and extended the height to provide a nice ladder pushed away from the wall when painting my ceiling and finally folded it 90 degrees and extended both sides in order to create a platform to work on above my stairs.So, while I might need an even bigger ladder for reaching higher places, this isn't really necessary with my house, and so this ladder is nice balance between sturdiness and functionality.
