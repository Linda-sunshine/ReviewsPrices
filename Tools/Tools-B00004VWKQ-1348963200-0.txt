review/summary: Produces consistantly quick and clean cuttingreview/text: I have a son who is a woodworker and is an expert at knife sharpening. He has kept me in sharp knives for many years, however when it came to kitchen knives, they need sharpening more often than I want to impose on him to maintain. I went looking for a sharpener that I could use for maintaining my own kitchen knives and ordered the AccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpener. I have used it several time and it has given my knives an edge that helps me with consistantly quick and clean cutting, during food preparation. Thank you
