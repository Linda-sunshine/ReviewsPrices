review/summary: Waste King 8000review/text: Ordered the Waste King 8000 and received it in just a few days. It looks and appears to be so much better than my Badger5. Installation took more like 4 hours but believe now that I did it once, that time could be cut in half the next time. It is important to note the length from the middle of the unit to the middle of the exhaust water exit tube. My badger was 5&#34; and the new unit was 5 9/16&#34;, so a difference of over 1/2&#34;. It did fit but is very tight and will monitor to make sure there are no leaks. The noise level is fine and the grinding seems far superior to my older unit. A major upgrade to my prior device.
