review/summary: Perfect for my motorcyclesreview/text: I have three motorcycles, a boat and a jetski,keeping the batteries fresh throughout the winter storage season is a challenge . The battery tender JR is perfect, and easy to install. I have two and once a week I rotate the tenders to a different battery , so far the batteries have stayed &#34;hot&#34; and ready to go.
