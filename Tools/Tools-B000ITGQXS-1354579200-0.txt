review/summary: Good productreview/text: This is a great light. I bought it to clip onto the top of my computer monitor. The grip is soft yet secure, perfect to protect my monitor. It is bright enough to light up my keyboard and books when I am working at night. Yet the light is soft enough that it does not bother my eyes like my cfl desk lamp sometimes does.The only downside is that the led light causes some glare on books and my kindle screen when I'm reading. It's not bad but does get annoying sometimes.
