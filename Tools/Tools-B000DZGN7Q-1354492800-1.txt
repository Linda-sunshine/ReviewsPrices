review/summary: Great disposalreview/text: THis diposal has the oomph to get the job done as long as you don't try to stuff it and then turn it on. Easy installation if you are replacing an existing disposal which I was. I would buy it again but since it has a lifetime warranty I don't expect to until I move to a new house.
