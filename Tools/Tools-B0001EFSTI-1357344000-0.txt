review/summary: Very useful addition to my key chainreview/text: I use this tool several times daily... very useful. Wonder how I got by without it before. Has really saved me a few times as well - for example one time a door handle came off and I would have been stuck as this was the only thing I had on hand that I was able to use to open the door.
