review/summary: Super Powerfulreview/text: I got this during a black friday lightning deal, and paid a plumber friend of mine to install it. After watching him install it I'm glad I paid the professional as it didn't quite line up with my current plumbing and required some plumbers putty to seal some gaps. I'm sure you'll find it's much bigger than your old disposal, so be sure you measure your undersink cabinet and make sure you have enough room for it.To test it out, I even ran chicken bones down it and it chopped them up perfectly. I have no worries about this disposal being able to handle anything I put down the sink.
