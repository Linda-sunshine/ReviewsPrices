review/summary: Great reviews from Consumersreview/text: I bought this because of the reviews it received from Consumers Report. It is powerful and should do a good job. It was easy to install. The only problem I encountered was the way it locked into the sink. It has a lip that it fits in and when I locked it in, it did not seem to fit snug. I get a few drips every once in a while when I am using it. It is my hope that they will stop after a while.
