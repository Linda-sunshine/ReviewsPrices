review/summary: easyreview/text: This lock is a great addition to our home. We frequently travel, so the ability to program a different code for a caretaker and easily erase it when we get back is a huge plus. No more being locked out or fumbling for keys to lock up when we leave. I would recommend this to anyone. Four stars instead of five because I had to drill a larger hole in the door in order to install.
