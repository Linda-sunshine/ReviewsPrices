review/summary: Work Greatreview/text: I bought two of these traps, and they work a lot better than I was expecting. I have to say, it would have been really easy to construct one of these myself, but it is worth the money! The pads are super sticky. They're good at catching spiders and fruitflies, too.What I was wondering, is how they come by the 93% success rate. Is that by word of mouth, or did someone count all the fleas on their floor, then figure up the difference as they were caught? ;)The little light sure is bright, too. It makes a great hallway nightlight.I've been waiting for the cat to stick its paw on the sticky pad....so far, so good.Anyway, I highly recommend this product, and am jealous I didn't think of it myself!!I gave it four stars because the plastic parts are rather flimsy.
