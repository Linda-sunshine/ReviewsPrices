review/summary: So strong it grinds chicken bones with ease!!!!review/text: I bought this to replace a smaller horse power model i have in my home. I have always had a garbadge disposal but always 1/2 hp or 1/3 hp models. The price was great for this online so i decided to get the 1 hp model. WOW, i would never reccomend anybody to buy less.The instructions say you can put bones in it but i had never put bones in a disposal. This model i tried it and bamm... it took a second to destroy chicken bones like they were butter!I am trying to be green and reduce trash, so i can compost vegtable scraps and now put bones in the disposal!!!I am very pleased.
