review/summary: Very useful monitorreview/text: Helped me to work out that a substantial part of my $600 electricity bill was the dehumidifier ($50/month).However, it won't help with 230V things like the swimming pool pump or the air conditioner. For that you'll need something like this:Owl Micro Wireless Electricity Monitor
