review/summary: Works extremely well.review/text: This tomahawk exceeded by expectations. I had owned an M48 tomahawk by united cutlery, and after about a year or so of abuse, it finally broke. It was well worth the 30 dollars I had paid for it. So when looking for a replacement , I decided to buy this by SOG instead. When I received it, I didn't seem to like the way it felt or was balanced. But, when i took it out to throw, I found it to be a lot easier to throw and be accurate with it than the M48. This tomahawk works well and could get any job done.
