review/summary: No Brainerreview/text: I've always used a pitcher-type filter or a had a built-in refrigerator filter. I recently used the Brita type at a friend's and thought it was a good idea. Culligan had the best Amazon reviews and was cheapest. No brainer.Took less than 5 minutes to open the box and install. I have been enjoying filtered water in my new apartment ever since.Tip: re-use plastic water bottles until they start to get a "taste" or until you have used each for about 2-3 weeks. I refill the same bottles with this filter, put them in the fridge, drink, repeat. You are recycling and getting cold, filtered water. Best of all worlds.
