review/summary: worthless!!review/text: The product is a sticky pad and a clear christmas bulb. I have 2 dogs and a cat- other than a few gnats the only thing I caught on the sticky part was the cats tail. I must admit watching the cat jump around with the trap chasing it was probably (to me) worth the money I paid for it, other than that I find the product is totally worthless. I have had it maybe 3 weeks and the bulb already burned out and there isn't one flea on the trap but the dogs are covered in fleas. Not an effective flea trap at all!
