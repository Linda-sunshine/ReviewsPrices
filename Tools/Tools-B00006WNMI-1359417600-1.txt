review/summary: Excellent filter, incapable customer supportreview/text: I chose the Culligan FM-15A over its competition because it is NSF certified. This is a big plus as it proves efficient removal of harmful contaminants from cold municipal drinking water. Although even unfiltered drinking water in my geographical area is supposedly of high quality, I can still visually see a difference between unfiltered water from the tap, and water that passed the Culligan FM-15A. The filtered water is slightly clearer and has no taste whatsoever. Also, according to the NSF report, the Culligan FM-15A reliably removes lead from municipal drinking water which is the number one reason why I purchased it in the first place.This product deserves only four out of five stars because the Culligan customer support was, although friendly, not helpful and extremely inefficient. After multiple calls and countless transfers I gave up trying to extract any useful information about the faucet adapter dimensions from them. Their employees answer questions wrong or just don't call back at all.Conclusion: Great NSF-certified filter that comes with two faucet adapters but incompetent telephone service.
