review/summary: See ya later Insinkeratorreview/text: After my 5 year old Insinkerator failed and I found this Waste King model here at Amazon, I made the change. I have had Insinkerator products for approx 30 years and always thought they made a good product. I had no idea of what I was missing out on. This new Wasteking is quiet, has much more torque. and just simply does a better job of doing what a disposer is suppose to do; grinding up food and waste and getting rid of it. My previous 5/8 HP Insinkerator would consistently cause the sink drain to clog when processing potato peelings. The new Waste King gobbles up whole potatoes and they just disappear. I suspect it is because the higher RPM motor and better stainless steel grinding chamber are pulverizing the product and not leaving big enough pieces to collect together and clog the drain. Anyway, I am very impressed with the performance of the L 8000 and very satisfied with the the purchase of this product from Amazon. Installation was very easy, even with having to remove the Insinkerator 3 bolt system and replacing it with the fast and easy Waste King system. My wife loves the fact that the splash guard is easily removed from the sink for cleaning of the crud that builds up on the back side which causes sink odors. Buy it, you will not regret it!!
