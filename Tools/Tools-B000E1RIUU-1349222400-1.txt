review/summary: First Killreview/text: I just had my first kill with the Victor Electronic Mouse Trap. It was a good kill, caught between the two contacts and stone dead. The only problem it was not a mouse. It was a cricket. Looks like the Victor Electronic Mouse Trap thinks it is a bug zapper. Emptied and reset easily. Looking for my next kill. Maybe a mouse this time.
