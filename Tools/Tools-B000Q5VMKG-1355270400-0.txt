review/summary: a must havereview/text: I like how it has a display to let you know what is going on instead of just beeping. Been using it over a month without issues like false alarms or anything like that. Great that it plugs in and has a battery for backup. You can even mount it on the wall if you want but be aware you will have a cord hanging.
