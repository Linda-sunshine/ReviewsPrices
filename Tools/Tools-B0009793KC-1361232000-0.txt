review/summary: Same product for a lot less then the Big Box Guys!review/text: I installed a prefilter in my water supply line to help this out and man the ice maker is nearly clear cubes and the water maker runs faster with a stronger stream now. This filter alone, removes the nasty chlorine taste and smell and polishes the water so it has a nice mouth-feel. Pair it with a prefilter and you wont believe how nice the water can be.
