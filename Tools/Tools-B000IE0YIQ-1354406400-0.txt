review/summary: Value for price?review/text: Works fair, for the price you may be better off spending a little more and getting a better unit, if use is more that once or twice a year. Compact design and light weight is definite plus. The plastic connector is not very good, it over heats and blows the fuse if filling a car tire, noise level is very loud. The switch is not very user friendly - - bad location, cords are difficult to return to storage position.
