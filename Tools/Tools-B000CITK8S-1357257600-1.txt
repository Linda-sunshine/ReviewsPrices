review/summary: great for the moneyreview/text: for the money, this is excellent. you attach the leads to the appropriate terminals on your motorcycle or ATV battery and close up the compartment and have the pigtail come out to where it is easily accessible to you. i have one for my Harley and i have another one for my Grizzly 700 ATV and they maintain the batteries quite well and extend the life of the battery if plugged in regularly. you can also use the pigtail plug to power some of the different heated motorcycle jackets.
