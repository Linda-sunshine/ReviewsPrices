review/summary: Truly a masterpiecereview/text: I have to admit, we bought this because of the one review - truly terrifying to fleas. The review had us laughing so hard, but how true it was... We have had this up and going for 24 hours and we have caught probably 30 fleas so far and we intend to buy more... we have one inside cat and one that goes outdoors too so we get fleas and this is an amazing way to deal with them without harsh chemicals.. the fleas DO seem drawn to it especially at night, but yea this is an awesome item... My guess is for those who have not had luck with this product either have put in in areas that arent prone to having fleas or dont have as much of a flea problem as they think. I totally recommend it. Like I said and for the price? Perfect!!! We will be purchasing more no doubt!!! Kudos to the creator of something so simple and so effective.
