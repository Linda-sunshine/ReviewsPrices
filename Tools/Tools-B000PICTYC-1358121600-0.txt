review/summary: SOG Specialty Knives & Tools F01T Tactical Tomahawk, Blackreview/text: Excellent product. Great for camping, utility around the place or on the trail. Throws well, balance is good. Handling is very good , I especially liked the longer handle with overall length coming in just a tad over 15 &#34;. Get one you will not be disappointed.
