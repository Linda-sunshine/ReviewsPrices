review/summary: Outlets to spare!review/text: Needed a new surge protector as my computer peripheral collection keeps growing. Very pleased with the ample spacing of outlets for those awkward &#34;wall wart&#34; adapters. Built in cable management is also a plus! Competitive price was also appreciated!
