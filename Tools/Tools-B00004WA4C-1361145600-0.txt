review/summary: 7-Year built-in Obsolescencereview/text: I bought this product (KN-COSM-B) over 7 years ago. A while back, it started chirping every 30 seconds. I was surprised to find the chirp still occurred after replacing the batteries.The Kidde website describes this symptom as the unit reaching end-of-life and requiring replacement. It probably makes sense that these units shouldn't last forever, but it would be nice if the manufacturer was more transparent about the life of the product during the sale. They could call it a "7 year smoke and carbon monoxide detector."To the manufacturers credit, they have posted a discount code for their product on their web site for repeat customers which cuts $10 off the price and provides free shipping. It costs about $5 less than the price I see on Amazon. Unfortunately, a little research was needed to discover the discount code and the code does not work with resellers like Amazon.
