review/summary: Does as it says and as reviewedreview/text: Just got this bad-boy installed over the weekend. No issues at all, very easy install. As some have mentioned you will need plumbers putty to seal the drain in the sink... other than that, all else needed (other than tools) is included. The splash guard that goes in the drain (which can easily be removed and cleaned) has more of a plastic feel than rubber... not near as "solid" as the older one... no problem though just made me go hmmmmm. It does have a bit of a "jolt" when turning on though it is 1HP so it has some power behind it. So, no problems... got a great deal on it... good decision.
