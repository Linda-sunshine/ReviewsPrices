review/summary: Nice - just be awarereview/text: Okay, this is really a nice lock, solid, and not like the crappy Weiser electric I had where the motor wouldn't pull the bolt all the way back, and you were continually changing batteries. Because this is hand turned, those problems don't exist.Better keypad too, easy to see.What I don't like - limited to 4 digit user codes, somewhat pricey, and no ability to have this automatically lock (on other versions of this you can, apparently, but didn't realize that).Overall good lock.
