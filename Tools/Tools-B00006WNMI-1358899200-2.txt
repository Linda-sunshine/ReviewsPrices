review/summary: Exactly what i wanted.review/text: After using a Brita filter and getting annoyed with it, and seeing all the horror stories about Pur units, I was happy to find this simple and elegant solution. A huge selling point for me was the fact that it auto-switches back to unfiltered. My wife hated that I always left our old Brita filter on filter mode, and this completely solves the problem. Save my marriage! Thanks!Pros:Auto-Switches to unfilteredEasy installDon't have to turn the switch to engage filter thus it doesn't loosen the fittingMetal construction feels far more durableSimplistic designCons:No indicator light that filter is used up (just mark your calendar)
