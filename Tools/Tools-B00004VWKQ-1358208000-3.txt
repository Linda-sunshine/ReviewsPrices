review/summary: I can't believe how well this works.review/text: Growing up, I only ever sharpened knives with a whet stone. I bought one of these to upgrade to free shipping on an order, and have been amazed at how well it works.Every week or so, I do a few passes with this over my Chef's knife, and it keeps it very sharp and well honed. Great item!
