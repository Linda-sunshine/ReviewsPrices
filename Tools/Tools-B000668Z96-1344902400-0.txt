review/summary: Design needs workreview/text: This is a great product in theory. It works because I've had something similar before and it was fantastic. The single biggest problem with this flea trap is that the glue pads that line the bottom of the trap are thin, so they are warped by humidity or something and do not lie flat on the bottom of the trap. Four squares of simple double-stick tape per pad would solve the problem (I put down tape loops and they worked fine). The threading on the screw-in lightbulb socket is a bit cheap and hard to manage, as is the threading on the cuff that holds the light bulb housing in place. Generally, though, it's a good value. Two pads are provided. As long as I can get more, I'm happy. I think the improvements I suggest would make it much less annoying upon assembly, however.
