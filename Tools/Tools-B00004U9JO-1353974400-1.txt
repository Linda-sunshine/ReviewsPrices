review/summary: Loking forward to another 16 yearsreview/text: This is the exact model that was installed in my house when it was built in 1996 and it lasted until now. I decided to replace the broken one with the exact replacement because the plumbing was already setup to accept it and the old one did last a very long time.The disposal seemed a little quitter then my old unit but it is still loud enough to know that it is being used. The sound isn't really an issue because the disposal is only run once or twice a day for about five to ten seconds. So spending extra money to get a quieter unit wasn't really necessary. All-in-all this is a great garbage disposal and hopefully it will last as long as my old one did.Tips: You will need to use your old power cable and install it to this disposal if you use a wall outlet to provide power to the unit. If you have your dishwasher attached to the unit like I do I would recommend using a wood drill bit to drill the plastic plug out from the side. That is what I used and the hole was perfect with no edges or burs left behind for wastes to get stuck to. Lastly, lightly retighten the three screws under the sink as the plumbers putty continues to set. This will insure the unit fits snugly as the putty takes shape with the upper flange.
