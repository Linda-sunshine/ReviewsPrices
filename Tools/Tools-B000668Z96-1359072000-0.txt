review/summary: Caught something with wings.review/text: I bought two of these as well as two of the refill packs. I've had them running for 24 hours and the only thing I have caught is a gnat or something with wings. I added these to my arsenal after discovering fleas a couple of months ago. I first tried Frontline on my two cats...no good. I then moved to the carpet/upholstery spray...not much good. I then added Program for my cats and used Capstar to kill the adult fleas. Capstar works great but doesn't last. I then moved to a carpet/floor powder. I still had fleas so ordered these Victor Traps. I vacuumed and washed everything every single day for the past two months. Either the fleas are finally gone or these things don't work.Update: 02/23/13. Still have fleas and have two of these traps which have not caught 1 single flea since I've had them out.
