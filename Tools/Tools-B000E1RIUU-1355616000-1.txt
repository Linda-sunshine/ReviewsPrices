review/summary: It works! No muss, no fuss.review/text: Easy to set up and use. It tells you it's armed. It tells you that you have a success (i.e. dead critter) of which you must dispose. What more could you ask of a mouse trap? Only negative, it's expensive. But cleaning up after vermin is expensive too.
