review/summary: So far so good, and warm.review/text: I just wanted a RELIABLE heater for my small apartment. This has so far fit the bill. Yea, it was a little more pricey but I was willing to pay a little more for something that just WORKED. Keeping it simple and reliable was all I cared about.No, this does not put out massive heat. Yes, over the course of a nights sleep it will keep a small apartment bedroom warm.Yes, it makes that annoying CLICK when it turns ON and OFF, any light sleepers like me will hate that but all space heaters do this so we are out of luck.
