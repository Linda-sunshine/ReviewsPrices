review/summary: Great chargerreview/text: Purchased this charger for a car I only drive once every two weeks. Electronics in newer cars these days will drain the battery when the car is not in use. My car pop a low battery warning, so I purchased this, and within 1 day, my battery was full again, according to the solid green light on the battery tender.No more low battery warning, great product!
