review/summary: Thinking about using water instead of sticky pad.review/text: This item seams to catch some fleas, not all of them though. Since I have no pets right now, I am thinking about filling the tray with water when I run out of sticky pads. The replacement pads cost way too much for what they are. I am hoping that the fleas will fall in the water and drown because they can not swim at all.
