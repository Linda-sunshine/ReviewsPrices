review/summary: Simple design yet effective. You cannot beat itreview/text: I have had many sharpeners over the years from a stone to a black ridge. If this sharpener wont get your knife sharp enough to shave your arm then, your knife belongs in the garbage/scrap pile. I ended up removing the finger guard to get a greater angle to sharpen some badly abused knives. I actually flip the sharpener upside down stationary and slide the blade. This is much safer and you can feel what the sharpener is doing, better.
