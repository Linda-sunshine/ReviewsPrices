review/summary: Not Surereview/text: Not sure if this is good or what. I think its better if you have a flea infestation. I left it on all night the first night and didn't catch anything. The next day the light bulb blew out. So not sure what to think about that. I guess they should come with a better bulb. But since I don't have an infestation I assume it would have taken much longer for the fleas to make their way to the trap. Haven't picked up a new bulb yet so haven't been able to test it any further.
