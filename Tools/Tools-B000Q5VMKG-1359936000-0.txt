review/summary: Easy to Install; Moderately Loud But Piercing Sound; Awkward Testing Buttonreview/text: This FIRST ALERT CARBON MONOXIDE PLUG-IN ALARM is easy to set up. You insert the two AA batteries for backup power during electrical outages, then plug the device into an unswitched electrical outlet. That's it.A continuous green light tells you the unit is on AC power; a blinking green light tells you it's on backup power. The instruction sheet explains how to test the unit when you first install it, and advises weekly testing after that. To start the test, you press and hold a half-button on the left (below the display). This activates the alarm: the display cycles through the possible CO levels, and the horn sounds a moderately loud but piercing alarm. To turn the alarm off, you press and hold the left half-button again. Testing the alarm usually takes me a couple of tries, because the half-button must be pressed quite firmly.There is another half-button on the right (below the display), that you press for a display of the highest CO level recorded by the unit. My unit is still displaying "0" after about five weeks, which I assume is correct, because there's no reason to think the unit isn't functioning properly. The CO level display also includes an icon that tells how much charge is left in the backup batteries.This seems like a good, inexpensive, no-nonsense CO monitor, and I trust the First Alert brand. However, because the test button is slightly awkward to use, I rate this product at 4 stars ("I like it" on the official Amazon scale).
