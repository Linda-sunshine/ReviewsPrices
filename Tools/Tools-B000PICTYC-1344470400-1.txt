review/summary: Good for the $review/text: I like this product overall and have just a few issues with it. One the steel is softer than I expected as I found out when trying to shatter some tempered glass. I did shatter it but the tip fo the spike deformed slightly. The glass is pretty hard though... Also it is heavier that I expected. Not bad but to use it in a defenseive situation you will likely want to choke up on the handle uless you have massive wrists. Overall though its a great product for the money. I cant wait to start throwing it next time I go camping.
