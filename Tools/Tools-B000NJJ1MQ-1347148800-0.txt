review/summary: Super simple, easy to use and installreview/text: This product is definitely Good Enough if all you need is a simple keyless deadbolt. I was looking between this and other too-cute Samsung RF-id units, but you can't go wrong if all you need a simple combination deadbolt and still want to have a key in case the battery dies. Obviously, this unit isn't bump-proof for security, but for you what you get, it's solid!
