review/summary: Better price as compared to most other filtersreview/text: I like this filter. The flipside is that the replacement filters cost almost as much as the whole new one. If they could work on that, that'd be great. Overall, I think this does a good job of filtering. We don't have hard water where we live so I wouldn't be able to comment on that.
