review/summary: Perfect For My Needs. (Hardware Included Is Garbage).review/text: Bought this after my wife nagged me to re-organize the garage and it has exceeded my expectations. The unit is well made and easy to install; but like the title of my review states, the hardware included is garbage (screws and anchors), but more on that later on.I was able to securely and easily fit a swiffer mop (not sure why some couldn't), a broom, a steamer and rubber maid mop. All stayed in placed and have been, since I bought it a week ago. To place brooms, etc. onto the holder, you line up the broom with the slot, then down a "downward" motion into the slot. Items are held in place by a roller ball, which has rubber rings on it to create friction and hold any item in place. To remove the item, do an upward motion and out it comes without a problem.The only problem I have with this item is the included hardware, specifically the anchors, which are of very low quality; once in place, they didn't have a tight hold. The organizer felt loose. So I dug out some of my own anchors for a more secure installation.Other than the crappy anchors, the unit is perfect for my needs. It's holding items on each slot without a single problem. But know this, in order to fit everything, and according to the instructions, you'll have to invert some itmes, so a mop's head will be pointing up and a broom's pointing down and so on, so the bulk of your items do not get in the way of each other. Hope this helps.
