review/summary: SLOWreview/text: I do not know how good is the water comes out of the filter, but I can tell you that the flow rate is extremely slow. On the unfiltered side, flow rate is reduced by half. On the filtered side, flow rate is reduced to less than 1/10 of the original flow rate.Make sure you use the rubber or it will leak.
