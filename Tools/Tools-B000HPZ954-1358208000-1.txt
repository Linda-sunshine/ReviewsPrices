review/summary: These are great, order you won't be sorryreview/text: I am on my third one. Workes tremendously for all those awkward plugs that would otherwise take at least 2 spaces in a normal plug.Also have the one with rotating plugs and both can be useful but this one is less unwieldy and awkward, stable and handles lots of plugs
