review/summary: Makes great tasting waterreview/text: i live in an area that has fairly good water. it usually has no taste but occasionally i notice a stronge chlorine taste which i don't like so i order this and viola the taste is gone and the water is great---even better than most bottled water. glad i ordered this.
