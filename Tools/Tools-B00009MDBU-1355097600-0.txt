review/summary: This is an excellent hi-tech meter that can save you money!review/text: Length:: 3:54 MinsI was fascinated to get one of these devise as one of my past jobs was to help power companies measure their volts, amps, watts, VA, VARS, Power Factor and frequency to control the power grid networks and their generating turbines. This small device is very powerful for the features that it has and can be a useful tool for help lower the cost of the electricity in your home.It is a small package that packs a lot of features into its operation and allows you to see how much it exactly costs to leave that computer on all day or to operate a lamp in your living room. One of the key areas is analyzing the power required to operate that older freezer or refrigerator for example when you consider how much more efficient a new one might be today using modern technology.It is estimated that most homes waste 20 percent of the power they pay for and that they could turn off many items in their homes and lower their power cost. I like this device and I believe it can help many people accomplish just that or even more savings.There are some claims in the promotion of this product are over the top like the ability to predict power brownout conditions. I still think this is a very good product and from my testing it is accurate and reliable. Just remember that you can only check those items in your home that:* Plug in with a normal AC plug* Draw less than 15 amps* Operate on 120 voltsThe only con I have against the product is that the display should light up when you press a button so you can read it in a dark area.I like this product and I recommend it to you. I put together a very simple video to show you its features. I hope it is helpful to you.
