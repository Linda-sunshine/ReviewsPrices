review/summary: Great heater, delicate remotereview/text: I have only had this heater a few weeks. It effectively heats the space I bought it for, doesn't make too much noise and looks attractive (although not as attractive as in the slightly blurry product photo). I like the various options - it meets pretty much every need I could imagine.The remote, however, is extremely delicate. Today, I knocked it off of a table onto a carpeted floor, and now it no longer works.
