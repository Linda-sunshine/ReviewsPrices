review/summary: Great filter, cheap filter replacementsreview/text: This is the second filter I've owned and the third one I've purchased (gave one to a friend). Each filter is good for 200 gallons (Brita Pitcher filters from amazon are more expensive (you buy 3 at a time) and don't filter as much water as one of these. Now, if I love these so much, how come 4 stars, right? I am taking a star away because the pull-diverter doesn't automatically retract when the water has finished dispensing. This isn't really a huge deal, but the filter will be ruined if you fun hot water through it (due to anaerobic bacteria being a biological filter) so you have to be on the watch to make sure you push it in after each use.
