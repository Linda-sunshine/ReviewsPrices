review/summary: Absolutely Works!review/text: I have two words regarding this... BUY ONE!!!Well OK, maybe two or more depending on your needs. But I'm here to tell you that these things really work.Caught/killed the first critter in about 5 minutes and thereafter I kept "de-crittering" the box on a regular basis til- Hark! No more critters!!!Zapped at least ten the first day... with one trap!!!I might try the ultrasonic repellant thingys next.But for now, killin' them is more fun and more permanent anyway.SEND THOSE PESKY CRITTERS TO THE ELECTRIC CHAIR!!!
