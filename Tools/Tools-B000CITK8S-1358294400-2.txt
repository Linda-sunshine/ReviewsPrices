review/summary: A great charger!review/text: I had to replace my 5 year old unit. It died due to too many power failures, not the unit's fault. It was great while it lived! I bought another one and they have improved it. This one is heavier and seems better made. Best thing to save my expensive moto battery. I recommend this if you have a bike, snowmobile or small engine with electric starter/battery.
