review/summary: smoke detectorreview/text: It's very good- EXCEPT there is NO volume control- and is WAAAAAY to loud! I think the sensitivity of detecting is also way to high- example- in winter, had my furnace on- was roasting a Turkey- and had 4 burners of stuff simmering-on top of stove- the resulting steam caused the alarm to go off! Frustrating and embarrasing-as NOTHING was burning! I have removed the detector to a far back bedroom. Where it isn't doing me any good.
