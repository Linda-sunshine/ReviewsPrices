review/summary: Simple, Reliable, Inexpensivereview/text: I bought the Tender Jr to use on my ZZR600 bike during the winter months. I absolutely love the two different types of connections that are included. I am leaving the eyelet leads on the motorcycle and tucking the wire away. Removing the seat is somewhat difficult on my bike and requires tools. Having the option to leave the connection on with a very small length of wire being tucked away is a nice option. I can leave the connections on and put the seat back on without any wires being in the way. Both connections have fuses built in so if something should go wrong the fuse should take the hit. I love the LED indicator as I can poke my head in the garage and see the status. I start my bike once a week to warm up temperature during the winter months and the disconnect/connect is a breeze.+ Two Different Leads Included+ Both Have a Fuse+ LED Status Indicator+ Inexepensive+ Automatically Switches to Float Charge+ Will Not Overcharge_Bottom Line_ There are many different types of chargers and tenders on the market, some with a much higher price tag. The Tender Junior is inexpensive but not cheaply made by any means. The unit functions great and has many convenient features. I would absolutely recommend it to a friend.
