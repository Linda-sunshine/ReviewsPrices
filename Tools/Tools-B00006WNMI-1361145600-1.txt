review/summary: The best of a bad lotreview/text: This is the best faucet filter of the group but that's not saying very much. They all are made with too much plastic and tend to break after a year or so and this is no exception. I've tried many brands of faucet mounted filters so I have some experience. (This is the third one of this model I've had.) The diverter valve on this model always stops working after about a month so and it no longer &#34;automatically&#34; turns off the filtering mode when you shut the water off. It's a disappointment, customer service is worthless and I suspect that faucet mounted filters is a nice idea but nobody has executed the idea very well yet.
