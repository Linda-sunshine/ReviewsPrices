review/summary: Problemreview/text: I am now into on my fourth P3. All the good comments made are accurate. It does what it is supposed to. But after a while, the voltage becomes inaccurate, it reads higher than it actually is. I cannot tell if the other readings are still accurate as I have no way of checking these. I have had to return two units to the dealer and the same thing is happening to another one I now have in use.
