review/summary: A quality, affordable lightreview/text: I originally bought this to use for my 2nd Generation Kindle, because the case I used had no light. The clip has a good grip, holding the light firmly in place, but did not create any undue pressure on the Kindle itself. The light is very bright, and provides nice even lighting across the page. The flexible neck holds its position nicely until adjusted.I have also used this on a number of printed books. Again, the clip holds the light in place without damaging the books in the slightest. It has come in handy for providing illumination to all kinds of situations all over the house. A great light at an affordable price.
