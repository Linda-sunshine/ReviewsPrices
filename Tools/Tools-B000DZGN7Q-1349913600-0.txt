review/summary: The Bone Crusher!review/text: When my 1/4 HP Inskinerator died abruptly, life at my house came to a halt. "Don't put things down the drain? Have you lost your mind?! What is this? Soviet Georgia?!"Rather than replace the broken one with an identical unit, I decided to go with one that had some power.Installation was very easy. The only problem was the power cord. My unit was hardwired where as this unit had a 3 prong plug. I could have spliced the power cord and hardwired it or i could install a socket and face plate. I decided to install the socket because I wanted to keep the unit in tact in case i had to return it.Noise: Not as loud as you would think. I is actually a little quieter than the insinkeratorPower: Shockingly powerful! Citrus peel? Yep! Coffee grounds? Yep! Chicken bones? Actually, yes.Fit: The drain fitting is slightly thinner than the insinkerator and it comes with a different drain plug. The problem with this is the other side of the sink matched the insinkerator drain size. Now ihave two plug covers, one for each side. Not that big of a deal.Installation: Taking off the old unit was more difficult than putting this unit on. If you can read, the whole process shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.Value: Unmatched. With a lifetime warranty on the motor, this unit is hard to beat.
