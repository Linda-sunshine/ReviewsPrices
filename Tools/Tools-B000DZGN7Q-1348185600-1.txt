review/summary: Worth the Moneyreview/text: I bought this item to replace a Badger disposal that had lost a part of the grinder inside, and I should have replaced it then. Instead, I ended up with an expensive plumbing bill when the kitchen sink plugged up because the food waste wasn't being ground up sufficiently. Being too frugal cost a lot of money! The new Waste King L-8000 is quieter than our previous model. Obviously, it grinds better, too. It took two people (my son and I), to take the old disposer out and install the new Waste King. I didn't need anything more than the parts that came with the disposer. I'm really happy with my purchase and can recommend this product without reservation. The whole job took a little more than 4 hours. Two to get the old one out and another two to install the new disposer. We used a stationary car jack to help in holding the disposer in position for both the removal and the installation.
