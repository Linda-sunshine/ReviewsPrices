review/summary: Great retro fit - easy installreview/text: I have Schlage key deadbolts in my steel doors and I replaced one with is. It was a snap to install. Just removed old and all holes were matched. Took 5 minutes. It is a relief now that I don't have to give out keys to visitors and just creat a unique code for them. Easy, easy install and programming. I am ordering 2 more!
