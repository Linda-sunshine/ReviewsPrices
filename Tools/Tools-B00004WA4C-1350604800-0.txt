review/summary: KIDDIE CO....TOP SHELF OUTFITreview/text: I recently had such a great experience with the people who manufacture Kiddie Carbon Monoxide detectors.. I purchased 2 about 2-1/2 yrs ago and they worked fine until last month.Wondering if I could possibly have them repaired, I called Kiddie Co. After explaining my problems with both they asked me for the serial #s.Told me 2 new units would be shipped the following week.They sent me 2 new units over $100.00 value at no charge, and I did not have a sales slip, nor did I need to return the old units. For anyone who is looking for one I recommend this company..It gets no better than this IMO.
