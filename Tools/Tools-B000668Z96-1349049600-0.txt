review/summary: flea trapreview/text: It's everything they said, caught lots of fleas and some flies and gnats. I put one in 2 rooms at opposite ends of the house, they are great. Nothing shows up for a day or 2, then they must put out the word because lots of fleas caught. I have 3 cats and 1 dog inside all on flea meds, hopefully this will fill in any gaps in the flea reproduction.
