review/summary: Everything I thought this ladder would bereview/text: My Werner MT-22 ladder arrived exactly when I was told it would. Unpacked it and immediately used it to hang an Owl nesting box 14' off the ground. Very sturdy and so easy to adjust. This is the finest ladder I've ever used. I was told by two different General Contractors that Werner made a great ladder and this company surely gets my vote. I've got lots of projects to complete at home and this ladder is going to be a great help. I give this ladder five stars and highly recommend it to others.
