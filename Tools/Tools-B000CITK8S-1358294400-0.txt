review/summary: No more dead batteries from lack of inactivity.review/text: I got so sick of my batteries in my riding lawnmower and Yamaha Rhino going dead just because they sat for a couple of weeks at a time. Wish I had bought these much earlier. I have two now and they are worth their weight in gold. A couple different options to connect to your battery- clamps for the quick access, or (my preference) the wired plug that requires a one time installation by attaching to your battery. After that you just plug it in and unlplug when ready to ride.
