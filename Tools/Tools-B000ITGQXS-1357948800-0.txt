review/summary: Great light where it is neededreview/text: I bought these lights for my kids to use after lots of evenings in the car with them asking to turn on a light. The light clips on to lots of things - my kids use them on lap desks - and provide plenty of light for them to read or color or write in the car at night. One issue is if the kids bend them around and they reflect in the driver's rear view mirror. Hopefully explaining the safety concern of blinding the driver will prevent your kids from doing that. My kids have also used them throughout the house when they need extra light to work. We have only had them for a few weeks, so I can't speak to longevity. They use two AAA batteries and the package said the bulb will last for 100,000 hours!
