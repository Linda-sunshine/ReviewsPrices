review/summary: After 7 days, I'm disappointed. My old 444 insinkerator was better than the Evolution Compact.review/text: I've had the Compact since Oct 2nd. It's not very quiet! I just put pizza crust in it and it scared the heck out of me when I turned it on because it sounded like a Mac Truck coming thru my kitchen...and I automatically jumped back.I tried to dispose of onion's papery skins the other night and it did absolutely nothing to them but roll them into a ball and the disposal sounded like there was a tennis ball rolling around in there. I checked and noticed the onion skins were still whole and had been rolled into a ball. Last night, I tried lemon peels and it also had a difficult time chopping those up and shuddered loudly as well. There were lemon rind pieces left behind so, I cleaned them out by hand.What is wrong with this garbage disposal? InSinkErator changed their disposal line which should have improved them but not according to my experience the last few days, compared to my former InSinkErator model 444.I owned the 444 since 2003 and that baby was the best disposal and I've owned many well known top brands before it which were all junk and did not last. My 444 wasn't broken but it needed to be reset from jams too often so, I wanted to beat it to the punch of dying and replace it. I miss my old 444!The Evolution Compact has a 4 year warranty so, I will call them to check this thing out.Given that I used the 444 for 9 years, with zero complaints or service calls... I should know when something isn't working properly.I didn't want a disposal just for soft pasta! I'm sorry to say, but the Compact reminds me of all the bad disposals I've owned before the 444. If it can't dispose of pizza crust, lemon rinds without sounding like it's going to fall out of the cabinet or onion skins by rolling them into a ball and complete the disposal job, then it's not a great machine and as of now, I cannot recommend it.
