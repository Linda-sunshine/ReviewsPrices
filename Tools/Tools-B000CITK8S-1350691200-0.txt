review/summary: Works Great!review/text: I use this to keep Harley battery charged.. First I installed a Powerlet adapter port on the handlebars and ran the wire under the fuel tank to the battery. When riding, I use the powerlet port to keep my iPhone charged while it calls out GPS directions to me via bluetooth headset. When garaged, I connect the Battery tender to the battery through the powerlet port -- i.e. swap out one plug for another. Works GREAT!
