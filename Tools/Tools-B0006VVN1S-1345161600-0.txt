review/summary: Excellentreview/text: I have very hard water. The softening these inexpensive filters provide is amazing and to think the annual replacement cost is only $20 per showerhead. Great product. Those reviewers who complain about installation problems here are a bit plumbing-challenged. Install it correctly and it will work just fine. Cross thread it...don't tighten it down enough...you will have problems.
