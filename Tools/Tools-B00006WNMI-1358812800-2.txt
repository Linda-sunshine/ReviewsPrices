review/summary: Easy to install. Worth the money.review/text: The Culligan FM-15A filter come with everything you need to install-it takes less than 5 minutes. I sent a sample of my tap water and a sample of the water after running through the filter out for analysis. It was amazing what this little filter filtered out. And, the water out of the filter tastes great.
