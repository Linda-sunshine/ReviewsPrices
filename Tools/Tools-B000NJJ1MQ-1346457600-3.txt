review/summary: Schlage BE365VCAM716 Camelot Keypad Deadboltreview/text: I like this product. Easy to install (except strike plate), but the instructions are terrible. Even the reference to a website is no big help. They expect you to know how to install locksets already. If you are replacing a deadbolt, this could be easy, BUT! minimum spacing from the center of the door knob to the center of the deadbolt is 4". They want it to be 5"-5 1/4". Mine was 1/4" less than the 4" and the bottom of the Schlage keypad deadbolt hits the round cover plate of the door knob. If you don't want any trouble make sure you have at least 5". ANOTHER instruction-less item is the Strike Plate in the jamb. My existing one didn't fit, so I had to replace it with the one provided. They also provide a reinforcement plate that goes under the strike plate for added security that is a piece of thicker metal and is held with (2) 3" screws. Here is the instructions given "For maximum security, install reinforcement plate." Sounds easy, but that means a lot of careful work with a sharp chisel. Pilot holes for the 3" screws have to be deep and the right size. I did read somewhere "don't use a screw gun" but it didn't say why. So since these screws where 3" long, I used the screw gun and (1) snapped just as it seated. I recommend rubbing some bar soap on the screws before install to lubricate it. If the screw is squealing on the way in, stop and rub some soap or beeswax on it. Once it's in, it works great.
