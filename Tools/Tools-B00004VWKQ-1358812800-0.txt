review/summary: Best inexpensive sharpenerreview/text: I have used many sharpeners and most are a waste of time and money. this one actually works.the good. Low cost, easy to use, remember to follow the directions. Does a very good job bringing knives back to being razor sharp. I sharpened several dull knives to the point I could cut cleanly through a piece of paper.the Bad. Not much, does not work as well as diamond hone, does not cost as much or take as long to learn how to use.would I recommend it? Yes, of all the knife sharpeners I have tried, and I tried more than a dozen it works the best by far
