review/summary: It really works!review/text: I've never had a flea problem before as both of my cats are indoor cats. But I discovered the back enclosed patio was being over run and naturally my cats picked them up and brought them in the house. I think the fleas are coming from the local squirrels that like to climb the patio screens like ninjas, taunt my cats and then eat all the bird seed from the feeders.Totally creeps me out since my cats love sitting on me the minute I sit down any where in the house. So I've been obsessed with getting rid of the fleas!So I've take a multi-tier approach. 20 mule team Borax all over the back patio, this Flea Trap just inside the door and weekend baths for the cats along with natural flea sprays and products. Luckily my strategy seems to be working because the number of fleas in the trap is dwindling rapidly.This flea trap has been the best one I've tried. It is unobtrusive, effective and efficient. Just put in the sticky pad, plug it in and let it go. The light acts like a night light for the fleas attracting then trapping them without chemicals or harm to my cats. I highly recommend it.
