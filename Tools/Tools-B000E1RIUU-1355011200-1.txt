review/summary: Worked very wellreview/text: We discovered after a bit of repair work on our house that we had some mice. I've dealt with sticky pad traps in the past and the fact that you toss Mice alive into a garbage can horrifies me. The idea that it is somehow more humane is strange to me. And the traditional traps can almost cut the rodents in half. So I decided to try these traps. They worked like a charm. I had seven mice dead and a rodent free house. I would recommend combining them with Riddex Sonic Plus Pest Repellers. These messed with the mice and had them running all over the house, but by day 4, all of them had run right into these traps. I had no problems with these.
