review/summary: Works for mereview/text: I read most of the reviews and chose to try it myself. So glad I did. We have bombed so many times this year and they still come back. This has been the worst year we ever had with fleas. Set up was easy. First night it trapped 6 fleas. Yes, it is only 6 but I don't want any in my house so 6 less is fine by me. Gonna do like the instruction say and leave in on for 24 hours. Got a replacement bulb incase it blowed like others said it did. 97 cents a walmart. No biggie. My sticky paper didnt roll or curl and it was easy to get into the tray. I didn't get any stickiness on my hands. A+ product in my book. Very happy with this purchase.
