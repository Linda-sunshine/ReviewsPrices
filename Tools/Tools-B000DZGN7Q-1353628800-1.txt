review/summary: Excellent appliancereview/text: Its quiet and does the job. Works much better then the Badger I had previously. I had it professionally installed by a plumber. There was one slight problem with the installation. It comes as a plug in, where as my other disposer was hardwired, therefore my plumber had to set up an outlet under the sink.
