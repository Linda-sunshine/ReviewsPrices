review/summary: No complaintsreview/text: The maglight is very bright. The adjustable beam is nice since LEDs can be very direct. We were without power for a few days after hurricane Sandy and this made life a lot simpler. If you have a solid/smooth surface to sit it on, you can stand it upright and shine the wide beam onto the ceiling and it lights up a whole room just fine. This would be slightly easier if the end cap had more square edges rather than the slightly rounded cap, but it works fine and isn't a con in any way.Great product and an even better price.
