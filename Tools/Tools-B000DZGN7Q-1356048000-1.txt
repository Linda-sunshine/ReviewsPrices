review/summary: So far, so good. Disappointed that it was made in China.review/text: Installation was very simple and operation seems much better than the rusted out Badger 5 it replaces. I hope it lasts longer. The only disappointment I have is the fact that it was built in China and that detail was missed by me until looking at the actual box. According to their website: &#34;Anaheim Manufacturing Company is an international company located in Southern California.&#34; Had this been manufactured in USA, I would have given it a 5 star rating.
