review/summary: Best Mouse Trap!review/text: I knew going in I would not be disappointed because I have their much larger electric rat trap.Being the computer geek I am, I had a wireless security camera pointed at the spot I thought they were hanging out and it would email if it saw motion. After confirming the spot I popped in 4 AA's and had a catch the very first night.The next night just as I was going to bed around 10pm I had a 2nd kill, I emptied the trap and re-baited and a couple hours later while I was sleeping had a 3rd kill. All I used for bait was a piece of dog food (dry kibble). This works for me and I don't have to worry about cleaning off sticky peanut butter or dealing with any possible mold.One thing is for sure, mice check in, they don't check out. I attached 6 screen grabs of one mouses last moments from my security camera.
