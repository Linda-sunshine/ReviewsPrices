review/summary: Broke within a monthreview/text: The light worked fine for about a month. It is similar to the Mighty Bright lights. I didn't think it worked any better than the Mighty Bright lights we own, but it seemed to be fine. However, soon the on/off button broke off and it cannot be used at all. We were disappointed with the low quality.
