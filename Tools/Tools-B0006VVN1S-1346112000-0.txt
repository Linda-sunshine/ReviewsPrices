review/summary: ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!review/text: I cannot say enough good things about this! I just bought it a few days ago but so far am in LOVE with it. My water is VERY hard -- full of scale/minerals. It literally coats my chrome and shower doors, to say nothing of what it does to my skin and hair. But I always thought a shower water filtration system would be: 1) big & ugly (with the those "sidecar" looking filters); 2) expensive; 3) difficult to install and maintain. This one is NONE of those! It was easy to install (I had my super do it though), it looks incredibly neat & nice, and the shower is amazing -- feels great (good pressure, nice spray), and the water is wonderful so far! Plus the price is fantastic. I am really thrilled with this purchase. And yes, I am a real person. :)
