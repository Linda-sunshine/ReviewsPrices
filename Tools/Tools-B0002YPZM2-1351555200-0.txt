review/summary: The best driving gloves I have ever worn !review/text: I'm a long haul truck driver and like to wear gloves when I drive. Spandex gloves are great improvement over leather gloves for driving because unlike leather they don't suck all the oils out of your hands and leave your skin dry and cracked.Prior to using CLC Handyman gloves I've tried several different main line brands of spandex gloves.Although they were comfortable non of them lasted more then 3-4 months before wearing through. My first pair of CLC gloves lasted more than two years before one finger finally wore through. I just couldn't believe how long they lasted.My new CLC Handyman gloves are made a bit thicker then my old pair and all though would prefer a thiner glove for driving they are still comfortable and made extreamly well.Also CLC gloves are easy to clean, just wash them out in the sink with hand soap and you won't believe the amount of grim that releases after just a month or so of use. It's almost like they have a built in grease release.I purchased my first pair from Home Depot several years ago and was sorry to see them drop the line, but I was very happy to find CLC gloves at Amazon for a great low priceBH.
