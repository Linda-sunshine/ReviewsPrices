review/summary: Awesomereview/text: This is simply an awesome product. The sheath that comes with it sucks, but the Tomahawk is excellent quality. The reason I don't like the sheath is, when i was placing the Tomahawk back in the sheath, the blade cut the threads along the top. So now I have a Tomahawk sheath with a big gap in the top, and the blade slips up and out sometimes. They have some Kydex sheaths on here to replace the cheap sheath with, i might try one of those.
