review/summary: great surge strip, but keep an eye on the kid protectorsreview/text: I've purchased maybe 3 or 4 of these belkin surge protectors at this point. They are really great, but on two of them I've noticed that the kid-proofing sliders sometimes pop out. Not a deal breaker at all, but I wanted to point it out.
