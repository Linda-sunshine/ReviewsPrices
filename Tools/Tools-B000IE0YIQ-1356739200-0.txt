review/summary: Broke after first usereview/text: My first Amazon review: I took a chance on a low priced compressor after considering the cons mentioned, and which are true, from other reviews. It broke on my first use.After using it on 2 bicycle tires and a car tire, it failed to come on to pump the 2nd tire. Then when I pressed on the small plastic clip to remove the nozzle from the tire, the clip broke off.So with no problem from Amazon, I easily was refunded for the purchase and returned the product.This unit may be fine if used carefully for small objects such as a bike tire or ball.Looking now for a sturdier compressor.
