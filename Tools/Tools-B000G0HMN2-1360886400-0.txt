review/summary: Brilliant Light!review/text: Wow! This flashlight is really BRIGHT! I'm very happy with my blue maglite flashlight! I was worried about the dark spot in the middle, like I'd read about in some of the reviews. There was NO need for my worry, it's adjustable so that you don't see it! That was the ONLY minor problem that I seen. I also love the white light from the LCD compared to the old dull yellow light from the old ones. I highly recommend this light, if you're looking to buy a good, sturdy, solid flashlight!
