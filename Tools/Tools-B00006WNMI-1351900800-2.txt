review/summary: Had to replace 2 filters in more than 2 yearsreview/text: I don't have any complaint about the water quality from filter ... i guess it should be good but I had to replace 2 units in 2 years or so. First one did not got jammed with the cartridge and i discovered this once it was time to replace the cartridge. Nothing worked to unscrew the cartridge.On my second unit the pull out plug got lose and comes out once in a while when you use it. Also the top of holder developed crack in less than a year due to water pressure.I guess it could be well constructed to avoid these kind of issues.
