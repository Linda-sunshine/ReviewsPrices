review/summary: Quit Working After 3 Monthsreview/text: When I bought this in September, 2012, I thought this was a great way to protect my new Samsung 60 in. TV and Home Theater System very recently purched from Amazon. It completely quit working in December, 2012, after only 3 months. Of course the return policy per Amazon is only 1 month so too bad for me. I just ordered a replacement one made by Monster and hope for better results.
