review/summary: Excellentreview/text: I've had this tomahawk for about 4 months, in that time I've put this thing through several abuses. I've used the spike to dig and smash cinderblock, the blade to cut and remove trees 9-13 inches in diameter and yet I've done little more than rub the black coating off the spike. It's accompanied me on 5 backpacking trips, and on each its impressed me. I know have antiquated my fixed blade knife to a either a bench position or being carried by my girlfriend. I'm wholly impressed by this item, it shocks me to this day that they're so affordable and yet so well made. What was originally a &#34;why not!?&#34; whim of a buy has become a new habit and interest.Pros:Balanced for throwing (if you into that sort of thing)Excellent weight which allows for effective chopping yet doesn't weigh you down past the value of the item in your kit. This is a major &#34;pro&#34; many full tang hawks are simply to heavy to make up for themselves in effectiveness.Spiked head allows for prying and smashing.It's fun to say &#34;you've brought a knife to a tomahawk fight&#34;.Fits on your hip very nicely, the sheath is cheap but easily reinforced with ALIS mounts and duct tape.Cons:The 420 stainless of which its constructed will loose an edge after long term use. I carry a small sharpener to maintain my edge. I've had no issues with this minor flaw. It's easily compensated for with an item I already carried.
