review/summary: Awesome productreview/text: Stop carrying keys! We installed this lock on our front door, and it's worked perfectly. I love that you can program your own codes and revoke them easily - so we've provided it to our housekeeper without risk, and my wife and I love it - no longer have to carry a house key. It did take about an hour to install, and I had to modify the existing door holes quite a bit, but after some finagling, got it in, and it works great. It is a bit tough to turn, so if someone has limited finger strength, they may struggle to get this locked and unlocked. Not a problem for us, looks nice and has functioned perfectly so far.
