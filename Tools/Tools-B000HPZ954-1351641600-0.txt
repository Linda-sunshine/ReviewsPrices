review/summary: This is very necessary!review/text: I bought this mainly because I needed more plug space. My small white surge protectors were getting filled up and didn't match the color in my room. This has a long cord, nice color, and has all the outlet space you need. I haven't had a power outlet to comment on that, but overall a great product.
