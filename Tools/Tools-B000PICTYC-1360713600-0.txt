review/summary: SOG Specialty Tactical Tomahawkreview/text: I am retired and now have plenty of time to camp and kayak. The Tomahawk is ideal for light weight packing and clearing a campsite. I sharpens very easily and holds an edge. I is jus the right weight and size to carry in my backpack or my kayak. The price was right, so I bought it and I am very impressed with my purchase.
