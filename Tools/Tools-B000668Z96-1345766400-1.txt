review/summary: Works better than I thoughtreview/text: Used this trap for one week and did not catch one flea. I know my dog has fleas because I can see them. This product is another example of claims that are not true. Since writing this review I gave the trap to my daughter. See used it for a week and caught 15 feas. I guess my dog had fewer fleas than I thought or I did not have it placed correctly. I felt obligated to correct my review to be fair to the manufacture. I can now recommend this product.
