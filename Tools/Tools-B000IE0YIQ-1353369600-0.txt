review/summary: It is great when it works.review/text: I have been using this little compressor for over two years and loved it. I say loved, past tense, because it suddenly would not power up on AC or DC and after reading, calling, emailing, checking.....it does not have a serviceable fuse. Such a small thing, but obviously planned obsolescence. Maybe B&D doesn't want you to be able to keep it going long enough to wear out. I was very disappointed, because I really liked many of the features that people have mentioned and if I had reviewed this 3 days ago I would have given it 4 or 5 stars! If you want something to last more than two years, this is not the unit to buy.
