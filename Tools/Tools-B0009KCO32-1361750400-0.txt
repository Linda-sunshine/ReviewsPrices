review/summary: Works Greatreview/text: I read the reviews and opted for this over the cheaper versions. I am very pleased with it. I actually received one of the cheaper ones for Christmas, and there is a marked difference in the quality. The Bug off instant screen is much thicker and rigid material. The adhesive tabs also are of a high quality as are the magnets. Installs in minutes. I will be looking to purchase another one for my double french doors as well.
