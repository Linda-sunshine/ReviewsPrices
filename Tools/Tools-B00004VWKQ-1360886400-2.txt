review/summary: Handy and effective. A great tool.review/text: I have a 10&#34; chef's knife that's about twenty years old. It's a kitchen workhorse and my favorite knife. I use it for everything from slicing meat to chopping veggies. When it's sharp, it can slice tomatoes paper thin. Sadly, it hasn't been that sharp in a while.There aren't any places nearby to have my knife professionally sharpened, and my skill with a wet stone is pathetic.This little wonder was featured as a &#34;Best Buy&#34; on PBS' America's Test Kitchen a while ago. When I saw it here on Amazon, I took a leap of faith. If I could save my favorite knife for under $10, why not?****CAUTION****This sharpener requires that you place your knife &#34;Blade UP&#34; on the counter and run the sharpener along the length of the knife's edge in light strokes. This is counter intuitive to what you might think.It's also somewhat DANGEROUS IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW DIRECTIONS.**HOWEVER**If you hold the knife 'firmly' on the counter with your left (or 'non-dominant') hand and glide the sharpener lightly along the knife's edge with your right (or dominant) hand as instructed, you will avoid injury.It's an ingenious idea. Put too much pressure on the knife blade, and you risk injury to yourself AND the blade.When used correctly, the finger guard will protect you from cuts.The first time I used the sharpener, it took about 30 passes to bring the knife edge to the desired sharpness. According to the instructions, this is normal when you first use the AccuSharp. Besides, my knife was pretty dull.The instructions recommend cleaning off the knife after you sharpen it to clear away any metal dust that is often the result of the sharpening process. This is a No-Brainer, but I thought I'd mention it anyway.I use my knife every day, so it's not uncommon for me to run the AccuSharp over it once a week. One or two strokes over the knife's edge is usually enough. Between the AccuSharp and my honing steel, my knives are in tip top shape.The AccuSharp even sharpens serrated knives!I highly recommend the AccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpener. It's a simple, inexpensive, portable device that will sharpen almost anything.
