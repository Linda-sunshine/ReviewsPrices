review/summary: Convenient but cheapreview/text: I loved this when I first got it, but after about 5 months of only occasional light use, the Philips head tip broke right off. I was tightening down a screw on a Wilkie talkie (small screw into a plastic clip) and the head of the screwdriver stripped right off. This is an inexpensive pocket tool, and I would like to think I got my monies worth out of it, but there are so many other pocket tools out there of better quality that this one is not a must have. If you like it, buy it, but just be aware of its limitations. Very nice &#34;design&#34; though.
