review/summary: Simple garage door openerreview/text: I used this 1 button replacement door opener for the 3 button, light, entry codes, etc. openers provided with the original garage door opener. We needed a 3rd door opener for my teenage son (3rd driver). We received 2 openers with the original garage door system.For some folks, it might be useful to have the 3 button, full function garage door remote opener. For us, we just have the garage door opener, so the 1 button remote is far more useful. I switched to the 1 button, since I got tired of fumbling around with the 3 button product. I regularly hit the wrong button while approaching the house and the door didn't open. This 1 button solution is far more useful to me because - it only has 1 button - completely removing any operator-error on my part.Very happy with this solution. 5 year battery. 1 button. No headaches (anymore) with "did I hit the right button".
