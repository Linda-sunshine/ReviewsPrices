review/summary: For the record...review/text: After purchasing this item based on it's high reviews, I started to read the lower reviews while it shipped. Many of them said that the headset is not adjustable and that is NOT true. I, not to brag, have a larger than normal cranium and these guys fit me just fine. I can't say I have slept in them or worn them for extended periods of time, but for 100 rounds at the range they are more than sufficient. I don't review a lot of products, but wanted to clear the air on the negative reviews. They are adjustable and tight...but what good ear protection doesn't seal???
