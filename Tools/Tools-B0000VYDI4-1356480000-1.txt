review/summary: Functional Ladderreview/text: The ladder is heavier than I thought it would be, it also does not come with the board to make it scaffolding. It is large, too large to put in a regular car trunk. On the positive side it can reach tall areas of the home and get the jobs done I needed to do. Overall, I am happy with this product.
