review/summary: Great Tool To Keep on Keyringreview/text: I love this little tool. It easily fits on a keyring, and you won't really notice it. It is slightly longer than most keys, but it doesn't cause a problem. It can be a little difficult to open (you really have to get your fingernails in and pry it open), but it's very handy. Of course the knife blade isn't very sharp, but it's sharp enough to open boxes, trim a string off you clothes, or other little tasks. And the screw drivers are handy too. Overall, a great little item and great quality.
