review/summary: Does a great job but build quality is not what I expected.review/text: After installing the product I noticed that my old one (15 years unknown brand) was built more solidly. It was all metal construction and had a 3 bolt mounting system. It felt like it was not going anywhere while it was installed. The model comes with the EZ mount system and the drain insert was made of plastic. This results in a very weak connection. I can touch the base of the Waste King and move it around. I can my kids tossing one of the random jugs of cleaning products under the sink and it snapping off. I pray this doesnt happen.Out side of that. The products does what it says. I've already dumped a bunch of food down...more than I normally would just to test and see what it can do. I am happy to say it ginds food very well.Would I buy the product again? Time will tell.
