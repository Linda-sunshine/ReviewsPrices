review/summary: Crispreview/text: I decided to switch from bottled water to a faucet filter in the attempt to save money. This filter was the obvious choice as it filters 200 gallons per cartridge. The other filters I looked at only did 100 gallons. We go through about 3 32-packs of .5L bottles at $4 apiece every month, or 576 gallons at $144 per year. At the low price of $16.79 and only $8.80 for cartridges, I will only need to spend $34.39 per year for an equivalent amount of purified water. Saving myself over $100 every year. For a poor college student, this is a lot of money.Now, onto the quality of the water. I poured three glasses and tried them side-by-side for comparison. One glass was tap water (I live in Duluth, MN and our tap water comes from Lake Superior), one glass was Pure Life bottled water, and the third glass was water from the Culligan faucet filter. I've never had a problem with tap water, but I could really taste the difference. The filtered water tasted a lot cleaner and you could even see the difference. The tap water was cloudier. There was no discernible difference between the filtered water and the bottled water. The installation was incredibly easy, also.Overall, I think a water filter is the way to go. As I pointed out, I will save roughly $100 every year. Not to mention the 1152 empty water bottles that I won't have to recycle every year. There are two people in my household, so really I only use 576 bottles of water per year. But say only 1% of the US population (3.9 million people) drinks bottled water and they switch to filters. That is 1.78 billion water bottles not created. The number is much higher when you realize that more than 1% of our population drinks bottled water.
