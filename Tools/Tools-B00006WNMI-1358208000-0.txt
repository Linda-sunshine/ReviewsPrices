review/summary: Economically speaking this is the solid choice.review/text: This is the second time I've put this model Culligan on my tap and it probably won't be the last because it saves me money. The initial setup is cheaper and the filters last longer. I also like the design. The filtered tap is held up out of the way so you still have room to wash your dishes, and the water pressure on the filtered tap is stronger than some of the competition. Choosing the filter is a simple matter of pulling out the diverter on the side, and it is designed to automatically shut itself off when you turn on the tap. That diverter can get sticky after about a month, so watch out for that. Using hot water on a filter shortens its life considerably. This delivers water that is safe to drink for the right price, and the rig lasts a goodly while, barring the sticky diverter (which is really a minor annoyance all told). The only thing I would say the competition does better is taste. The PUR filter, as shoddy as it is otherwise, delivers great tasting water. I think the Culligan filters out minerals that add to the flavor of water and the PUR leaves the minerals in. I can live with that. I will probably stick with the Culligan tap filter.
