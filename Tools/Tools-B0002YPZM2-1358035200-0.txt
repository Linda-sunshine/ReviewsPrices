review/summary: Great Valuereview/text: I've worn through dozens of work gloves. I haven&#8217;t had a whole lot of time to wear through these yet, but they seem to be a great value for the price. They have padded knuckle-areas and palms, and reinforced leather around the first and second fingertips and thumb tip. My only gripe so far is the wrist cuff is slightly higher than I like &#8211; if you wear a watch when you work, the cuff may be annoying; I take my watch off for most work anyways. So far, I would not hesitate to buy again; I do recommend them.
