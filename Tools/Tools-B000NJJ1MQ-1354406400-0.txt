review/summary: A great addition to my housereview/text: This lock has proven to be a great addition to my house. It allows exit and entry without having to carry your keys. It still provides the same level of security I had with a key lock system. It has proven so handy and user friendly that I purchased a second unit to install on my shop. A plus for this unit is that the batteries are mounted on teh warm side of the door and should last longer.Just remember to read and follow the installation directions to insure the lock works correctly. I didn't and the lock did not work properly. After reading the instructions and a simple 90 degree turn the lock works perfectly.
