review/summary: Very Versatile BUT HEAVY!!!!review/text: Awesome ladder, can configure it into many different configurations. Have not tried to make it into two small ladders yet though. Very easy to use, but beware...I have the 22ft version and it is very very heavy. I am 26 year old male, go to the gym 5 days a week, weigh 180 lbs and can bench press 275 lbs and I struggle at times finding an easy way to carry this ladder. Would not recommend for a female living on her own due to this alone!!!! Besides the weight issue, it is very sturdy and the locking mechanism is pretty easy to use. 1 star off for the weight, but it shows it is quality made. I got it for only 159 dollars and free second day shipping from amazon prime! CANNOT beat that!!!
