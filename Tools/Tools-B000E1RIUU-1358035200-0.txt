review/summary: waste of time and moneyreview/text: Maybe I just got a bad one, but.... nothing. Buzzed a little when I put the batteries in. Nothing. Tested it. No charge. New batteries, same results. Test light never even flashed once. Worse was trying to send it back. Took over three weeks waiting for UPS to come back and pick it up; three phone calls to customer service. Finally they let me print a return label and drop it off at UPS. Never had these type of problems with Amazon before, hope its not the start of a new trend.
