review/summary: Solid construction. Great battery life.review/text: Bought a dozen of these as gifts for our top clients. I already had one. I've not owned a decent flashlight before and had been tempted to buy a multi-D-cell MagLite before but I expected the batteries were a little expensive to chew through. When I saw that they had released a quality LED model I bought two immediately - one for the house and one for the garage. The beam has a reasonable focus range. I can light up a building 300m away with ease. If you want a quality flashlight, look no further.
