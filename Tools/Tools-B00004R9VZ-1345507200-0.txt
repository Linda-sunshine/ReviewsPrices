review/summary: Great Moth Killerreview/text: We had a hugh outbreak of mosquitos in late July due to heavy rains from late May thru July and the county didn't have any money for pest control so I thought I'd give this unit a try. It is extremely effective at killing the local moth population but I have yet to see any indication that there has been a massive skeeter kill. On a side note, this unit gives off a tremendous amount of light so I got two for one. A skeeter killer (??) and a security light.
