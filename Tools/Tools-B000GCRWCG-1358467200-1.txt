review/summary: Surprisingly warmreview/text: Got these for the bug out bag. I don't believe in counting on something in an emergency unless I've tried it first, so I took one out of the packaging. You feel instant warmth when you cover up with one of these. I highly recommend these not only for the bug out bag, but for your car as well. You never know when you'll be stranded and need them.....
