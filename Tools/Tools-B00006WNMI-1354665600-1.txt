review/summary: Great Faucet Filter!review/text: This filter is great. It leaks occasionally, but all in all it's pretty effective. I'm snobby and like to double filter my drinking water. I filter it through the sink and I filter it through a water dispenser I keep in the fridge. (I don't have filtered ice, otherwise, I wouldn't care.) The water tastes pretty good even with this filter, so you don't really NEED to double-filter it like I do; I'm just used to water not having a gross taste and never want to go back.
