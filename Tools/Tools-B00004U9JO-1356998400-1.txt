review/summary: Keeping Jackie in Customer Service Busyreview/text: The unit came in the town home my daughter purchased, so she didn't get a choice of brand. Amazingly (sarcasm), the housing has developed several vertical cracks. I see that this is a common issue with this model. Having worked in both design and manufacture of consumer goods, I find it amazing that, as seems to have happened with some 1-star reviewers, the "expired warranty" response would be used by the company when there is obviously a design flaw. Jackie, no need for a response for this review; we are buying a new one from one of your competitors.
