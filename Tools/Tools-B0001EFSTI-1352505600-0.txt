review/summary: Great but easy to losereview/text: "A knife, a knife, my kingdom for a knife". Do you ever need to open a reinforced taped package or those nuclear bomb-proof clear plastic store packages, or cut something simple, but you just cant do it without that sharp piece of steel. You try the edge of a credit card, a house key, a ball point pen or anything in sight but you need that SHARP STEEL EDGE. This tool fills that void and goes undetected by all security checkpoints. I worked at a prison for a year and they never noticed it!! For that alone, it is worth the price. THE ONLY DOWNFALL IS IT WILL FIND A WAY TO COME OFF OF THE KEYCHAIN so you may as well buy 2 or 3 at a time. Cant they just drill one little hole in it and solve the problem?!!!!
