review/summary: No more keys!~review/text: I love this thing. We got one for the front door but forgot to take off the handle (the part that you turn to open the door) that had a turn-to-lock widget in it.NOTE TO SELF (or to you, dear reader): If you get this thing, you will love it so much that you will throw all of your keys away, forgetting that the handle also locks, and then your pet sitter will lock you out of your house unintentionally while you are away. Buy this, and also buy a dratted handle that doesn't have a little turn lock embedded in it, so that you don't have to borrow a ladder from a neighbor in order to break into your own dratted house while you return from camping, dirty and tired, and it is nighttime anyways so you can't see anything!I have bought three of these now, and more non-locking handles to match. I have one on the front door, have since added one to the back door and the basement door, and am looking at buying another to put inside the garage, between the garage and the house. You simply can't lose with this thing, it is so awesome...unless you don't learn from my mistakes!
