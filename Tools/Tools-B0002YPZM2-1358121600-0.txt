review/summary: Good glovesreview/text: These gloves are comfortable and durable (at least a lot more durable than the Lamont brand i was buying). They went almost a month and a half before the first tear at my job, lasted just as long as a pair of Mechanix basic i once had, but the Mechanix gloves weren't near as comfortable. Lamont Brand usually only lasted two weeks before the first tear. All in all these gloves are a great buy!! I love'em and just order another two pair of them. I would recommend these gloves to anyone!!
