review/summary: LED brings a whole better game to Maglightreview/text: I've bought about 6 of these flashlights now in different colors. I love the heft and construction of Maglight, and the brightness of the LED bulb is great. The light is a nicer and, again, a brighter color that hasn't dimmed at all in the years since I got my first one (my normal maglights HAVE dimmed in that time, making them less fun to use). I'm really not interested in owning other flashlights, so I'm glad Maglight is keeping their game current.
