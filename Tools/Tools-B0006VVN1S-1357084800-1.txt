review/summary: Instant Improvement to Water Qualityreview/text: This shower head was purchased to install in an apartment with the worst hard water I've ever experienced. Our skin was feeling way too dry, itchy, and chlorine smelling to go any longer without some type of change. We purchased this head and saw instant results. Installs in mere minutes! Can't speak for how long the filter lasts quite yet, but the initial review is nothing but positive.
