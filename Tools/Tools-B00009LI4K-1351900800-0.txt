review/summary: Great for operating small equipment and power toolsreview/text: I have one of those Little Wonder wheeled leaf blowers (it's a landscaper grade heavy duty blower, not one of those wimpy backpack noisemakers). It's awesomely loud! These hearing protectors do a great job of taming the noise. I'll be using them for all my lawn equipment and power tools. Fit well, comfortable, and really cut the noise.
