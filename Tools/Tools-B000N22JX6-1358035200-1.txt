review/summary: Great for bedroom!review/text: This heater has done a great job of heating my bedroom with vaulted ceilings. I purchased it after being loaned one from a friend and having it warm the room so well. The older unit borrowed from a friend it difficult to turn on from the top on/off button anymore as the switch became inoperable over time. So far the two i purchased for myself are operating well. This heater doesn't provide intense heat, but blows warm air. We saw a significant increase on our electricity bill operating two of these during sleeping hours.
