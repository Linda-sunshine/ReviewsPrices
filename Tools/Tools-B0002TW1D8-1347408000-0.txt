review/summary: Weak for an impact driverreview/text: I ordered this set with a Makita corded impact driver. Tried to see if I can loosen up the wheel bolts on my car. Could not loosen one, took out the second and the attachment snapped on the third. It may be just too much to ask of this set. I bought a replacement piece, forged, for more than the cost of the whole set. So far so good, but I am clearly more timid to apply full force. Realistically, with the narrowed part on the hex shank, it may be too much to expect the tool to take the abuse of the impact driver.I believe Amazon should not be recommending this set to go with the Makita driver.
