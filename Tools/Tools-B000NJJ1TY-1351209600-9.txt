review/summary: All I hoped forreview/text: First, Installation; slightly more difficult than a normal lockset, but just a few minutes extra did the job. The unit itself looks very nice (also matches the other locks in our case), and functions very smoothly. The light up feature is great at night, brightly illuminating the numbers.This leaves the need for a hide-a-key very slim & we can REALLY hide it well.I would truly reccomend this unit.
