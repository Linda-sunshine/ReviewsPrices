review/summary: My second in two housesreview/text: After moving rental houses, I somehow lost my first Culligan FM-15A. Well, that just wouldn't do, so I promptly replaced with another one.For the price, I like it more than Brita, which is the only similar filter style I have used. The fact that it automatically switches back to regular tap water once you turn off the water is great. Filters seem to last a long time before the taste goes off, but they are cheap enough that I tend to replace on schedule.Installation is a breeze as long as you don't have a fancy sink faucet. They give you a few adapters but if you have a non-standard tap you may need to look somewhere else.
