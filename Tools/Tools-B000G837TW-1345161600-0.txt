review/summary: Garbage Disposalreview/text: We had an InSinkErator garbage disposal before and were happy with it. It was 1/2 HP and did not do well with potato peelings! (not a pretty site when the drain stopped up) Decided this time to get "more power" and now the potato peels are gone with no problem...PLUS..it is so quiet! Love the quiet! Much less noise than our prior model. My husband and son installed it with no problem. (easy for me to say!) We're very happy with this model.
