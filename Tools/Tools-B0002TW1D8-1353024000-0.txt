review/summary: A must have to put with sockets !!!review/text: What can be said about such a simple item ?In most of South America getting something like this is next to impossible. Just the other day used the 1/2" !!! why? just because my impact drill and sockets (with these extensions) was RIGHT THERE and it was just as easy to fit up the adapter as it was to snap on a socket wrench and the impact drill makes for a darn tight nut and I like the sound of the driver "hammering" the nut tight.Makes me wonder why I didn't buy a set BEFORE now to keep with my sockets and HONESTLY should purchase another to keep with my battery operated Impact driver.Someone at Amazon should get an award for having the idea of "ADD ON ITEMS". Click and add to order,, no worry about shipping charges if you meet the minimum.
