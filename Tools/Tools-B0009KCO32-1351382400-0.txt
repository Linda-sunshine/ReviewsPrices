review/summary: Works well! A good option if you don't have a true screen door.review/text: I bought this screen because we did not have a screen door. We had a full curtain flap before this screen (no split down the middle) and this one works better to keep the bugs out. We have 2 dogs that run in and out all day long and the magnets don't always close the screen shut but they are heavy enough that the screen closes most of the way anyway. I did find the velcro strips don't stick well to the metal door frame even though I cleaned it with soap and water, but again, they work well enough. I think this screen keeps about 90% of the flies and other flying bugs out of the house.
