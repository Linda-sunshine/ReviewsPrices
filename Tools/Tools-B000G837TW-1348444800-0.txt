review/summary: Strong Silent Typereview/text: What can I say about a disposer that I have only had for a month? Of course i could say negative things if those were true, but I have nothing negative to say yet. In this case, the InSinkErator Evolution Compact 3/4 HP Household Disposer has lived up to its billing so far. As usual the shipping and support were great. Packaging on this was good. The shipping box was a little banged up, but the inner contents were well protected, and everything looked great when i opened the box. This comes with all the pieces you need to install it new except the plumbers putty. You will need your own tools of course. It was as most people said easy to install, the hardest part being getting the old disposer out. I chose to go the easy route and not remove the drain and mounts, so this basically just twisted on to the old mount. I really wanted the look of the new product, but i probably saved a couple hours by not doing that, including the trip to the store for plumbers putty. I did need the power cord attachment which i purchased for a great price and installed very easily.Once installed, this has run quietly and efficiently to date. I have been impressed with the power. The other day i ground some stuff and it was almost as if i had not put anything in. Pretty different from the old one, which seemed like it was working really hard to grind up anything a bit challenging.All in all, I am extremely pleased with the InSinkErator products so far. For less than $200, I have a new installed disposer, with fresh power connections, and no leaks. It runs strong and quiet, and my woman could not be more pleased with me as well! How do you go wrong with that?!?
