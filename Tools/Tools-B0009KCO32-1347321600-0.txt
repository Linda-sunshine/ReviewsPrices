review/summary: Pretty much uselessreview/text: It only has two magnets, and they are the very weak refrigerator door style magnets that barely hold together even if you push them together. Every time you walk through this thing you have to manually push the magnets together and smooth out the wrinkles so that it doesn't have huge gaps letting bugs through.Maybe I just need a different size? It does seem to drag the ground a bit. I will see if I can return it and order a different size. If so I'll come back and update this review. Either way it still needs more magnets to help it close better.
