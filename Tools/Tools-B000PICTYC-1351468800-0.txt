review/summary: Everything I wantedreview/text: Well....as a member of the armed services and someone who loves gear...This was an amazing buy! Just the right weight and size for me. and useful for camping or just clean fun. Its SOG which I have used for many years, and on my deployment, I trust my life with it. If you are getting it to kill zombies then it will do wonders, or maybe you just play a lot of Medal of Honor, either way, its badass, its looks badass, it is pure badassery! For such a cheap price it is such a steal! If you are pondering it, well ponder no longer and BUY BUY BUY!
