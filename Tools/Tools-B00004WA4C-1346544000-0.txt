review/summary: nice price, good item to havereview/text: I had to put this up to be legal, and I was happy about the price on this one, compared to anything I could find locally. It seems loud enough, and came was easy to get on the wall.I have never had anything go off for carbon monoxide, so all I can say is that everything seems to work when I test it. I kind of like the way it yells words at you, not just a tone that your brain can ignore.Yelling fire, fire, fire is much more noticeable that just a sound.
