review/summary: Battery Tender Junior Battery Chargerreview/text: This is the ideal product for someone who stores a vehicle for extended time. It charges the battery safely at a very slow rate, and it can be left on without risking overcharging the battery. It maintains a full charge and the electronics shut it off automatically when the battery is fully changed. I have the conveninece of leaving the battery in the Miata when storing it and yet have a worry-free experience. Signals from a small light tell when it is actually charging, when it is 80% charged, and when it is fully charged and just being maintained. By preventing discharge and by protecting against overcharging, I believe that the Battery Tender may significally prolong the service life on my sealed, non-lead-acid battery. I paid around $25 for my Battery Tender Junior and I consider it well worth the investment.
