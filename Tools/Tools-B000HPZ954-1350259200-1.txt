review/summary: Disappointing Outletreview/text: I can not recommend this outlet for the simple reason that f you have six "Wall Warts" installed in the outer two rows of sockets, you cannot use any of the six "Internal" central row of sockets. Hence it is only a six outlet unit, not 12. Had Belkin maake it just a bit wider, it would have accommodated six "Wall Warts" in adddition to six standard power cords. Some genius saved a few cents in plastic, and by so doing reduced the unit's functionality by 50%.
