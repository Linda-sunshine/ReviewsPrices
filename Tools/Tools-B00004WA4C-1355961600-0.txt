review/summary: Kidde CO/Smoke Detectorreview/text: I have several of these throughout the house and they always seem to work as long as you keep up with battery changes. Have yet to have one fail (that I know of). I'm extremely grateful to have never needed to be alerted of impending danger by this life-saving device. Knock on wood. You can't put a price tag on keeping your family safe, so yes, this is a great value !!!
