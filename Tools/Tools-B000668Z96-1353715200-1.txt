review/summary: Flea Trap; Simple Idea and No Poisonsreview/text: It is simply amazing how effective this simple device is when placed in an area with fleas. Without any poisons, the warmth of a 7 watt light bulb attracts the fleas. The fleas then land on a sticky disk and are trapped.Combining this with the &#34;Vet's Best Natural Flea and Tick Spray&#34; we have found a combination that eliminates the fleas from our pets and our home without bringing in products that may be harmful to us and our pets.We have not had a complaint about fleas from the kids in several weeks.Adding the the &#34;Victor M230&#34; to the rather pleasant smelling &#34;Vet's Best&#34; has yielded a powerful flea eradication approach this summer.
