review/summary: Saved me money right away...review/text: ...Not because of electric bills (hopefully that will come as well), but because I was about to buy a special power strip that cuts the power to the big screen TV and blu ray player when you turn the TV off. I was very surprised to find that the TV was taking hardly any &#34;phantom power&#34; when turned off. However, my elliptical machine was the real power hog when it was turned off! So now I know which things to unplug where I would have been guessing before. Also, my son uses two monitors with his computer. One is newer and one is the old kind. The old one eats a lot more power than the newer one.
