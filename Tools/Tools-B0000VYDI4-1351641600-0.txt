review/summary: Little Giantreview/text: Ladder is nice, heavy-duty and small when retracted. It fits in the back seat area of my Dodge 1500 quad-cab pickup. It combines flexibility with functionality and the price is a fraction of the popular little giant series while being a functional equivalent.
