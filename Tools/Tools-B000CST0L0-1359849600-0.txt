review/summary: Easy, straight forward, no gimmicksreview/text: To me, pushing a button to have the garage door open is one of the greatest inventions of humankind. I left my old remote in a rental car and needed to replace it exactly, so this was it...purple button and antennae and all. I watched on YouTube some videos made my Liftmaster to make sure I programed it correctly. I had to program my new one along with my husband's at the same time to give them both the same code. It took only seconds to do.
