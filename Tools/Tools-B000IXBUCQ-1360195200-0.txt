review/summary: Best flashight on the market in my opinionreview/text: I have owned many maglites over the years and they are still the best quality flashlights available and are still made in the US. Pay up and get the best and you won't be tossing it away in a few years like other flashlights. The technology and design results in a very bright beam and the durability is unmatched. The only reason I ever have to purchase new ones is due to losing or misplacing them or leaving batteries in way too long resulting in leakage damage.
