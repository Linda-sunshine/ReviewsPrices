review/summary: Great ladderreview/text: This is a great ladder. So flexible it can do anything. It is a bit heavy though, hard for one person to move it. The up and down movements take some planning and getting used to but it is very tall and stable. I have very high ceilings in my house and needed this to be able to change light bulbs!
