review/summary: Great &#34;Quiet&#34; disposer, plenty of power and very quiet!review/text: This is my second InSinkErator, the first was the 5/8 HP model in a different home, which worked great. This 3/4 HP model doesn't break a sweat no matter what we throw at it! Not only does it work well, my wife is very pleased at how quiet it sounds with just water or with a full load of potato peelings.The first 5/8 HP model cost more than this one here on Amazon, the first one I purchased at Lowe's, this 3/4 HP model is well over $200 at Lowe's, buy it here and save some bucks! Easy to install, had to cut the connecting tube from the other sink about 3/4&#34; to make it fit right, be sure and use plumbers putty where it connects to the inside of the sink, keeps the drips away ;&#62;)
