review/summary: Perfect for all jobsreview/text: I have purchased several of these for anound the house and farm. I have a 4 wheeler and tractor that only get used once every few months and they now fire right up every time thanks to these units. I also have a car that has an electrical discharge (somewhere) and after sitting for a few weeks would have a dead battery, well this has solved that problem. I have found that this also makes batteries last longer by keeping the battery maintained through the winter months. I really like the fact that they send two connection types so I can hardwire one to the vehicles that will be stored and just clip to the units that will be used more often. I have given these to family and friends and everyone loves this compact but efficient unit.
