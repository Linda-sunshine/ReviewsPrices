review/summary: Great! absolutely Fantastic.review/text: Space heaters are the Best /.Worst. Theyre great at keeping a room warm, but the worst in terms of electricity cost! What good is a 40 dollar cheap ol' space heater when it costs you double that much running it in a month? The heat sensors on cheap space heaters are terrible, and some don't have any. The answer? Save the earth and save you money and get one of these.I found this while reading another users review on some lasko space heater I was looking at. Instead of buying another space heater with a digital temperature dial, I opted to buy this and connect it to one of my space heaters I already own.WORKS GREAT! instead of the space heater running continuosly, it keeps my room at the temperature I set it on. 1 degree change, only takes around 5 minutes from the space heater. so that's saving me around 55 minutes of unecessary electricity.I don't know why they don't make digital sensors on all space heaters. The few bucks you save buying it, you waste it with the electricity! Trust me. When I run 1 space heater at home in a month, my bill goes up &#34;at least&#34; 40 bucks. Come to think of it, I don't know why i'm so ecstatic buying this device as a solution that a space heater manufacturer should address in the first place.
