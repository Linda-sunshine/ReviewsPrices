review/summary: best price for a quality water filterreview/text: paid $16 for this 200 gallon filter, so this is a great deal. I installed it in less than 5 minutes, so that was no big deal. heads-up... You'll probably need a wrench to un-tighten the old faucet end, and attach this one, as I couldn't do it with my bare hands.The switch between normal water and filtered water could be a little better, as I don't like how it switches automatically to unfiltered after turning the faucet off, but that's not a big enough deal to lose a star.For the price, best deal you'll find... not a purchase you will regret.
