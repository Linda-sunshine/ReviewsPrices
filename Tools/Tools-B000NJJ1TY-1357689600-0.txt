review/summary: Loved it until the code buttons are showing wear - easy to break in?review/text: We LOVE the convenience of this door and could never go back to keys - our kids can go in and out of the house without worrying about keys. It's so convenient for when contractors/relatives have to come over and we aren't home, and for the dog walker. We installed it when my youngest was 5, and he had no problem using it. The only complaint we have is that the 4 numbers have been worn down from frequent use, so it is easy to tell which 4 numbers are part of our security code. Not too high security! ALSO, when it was installed, we were unable to change the code. It is a manufacturer defect, we were just unlucky - my contractor offered to take it to the store and exchange it, but I didn't have the time that day to stay home and guard the door while he was gone. So, we have given our code out to many people, and am unable to change it. That's bad!So, I was thinking of trying to wear down the other numbers with baby oil or something? To make them match the others.I'm going to call Schlage and ask if they can send me a replacement, due to these 2 major issues.
