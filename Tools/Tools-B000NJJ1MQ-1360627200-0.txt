review/summary: Love it - Schlage BE365VCAM619 Camelot Keypad Deadbolt, Satin Nickelreview/text: Had this product for about 2 years. It was easy to install, straightforward to program. Comes with pre-programmed user codes which can all be changed (great for letting in cleaning people, for example). Biggest pluses of the design:- Easy to use.- Looks nice.- Key override.- !! Doesn't waste battery power trying to throw the deadbolt !! While some might prefer a product to actually lock and unlock the deadbolt, this action takes a lot of energy and would kill the batteries quickly. I bought this one because the code enables/disables the deadbolt in the spindle; YOU still have to turn the deadbolt to lock and unlock. This is a much more effective/efficient design for a small, battery operated system. As I said, I installed it about 2 years ago, I almost never use the key and I have not yet had to change the 9V battery!
