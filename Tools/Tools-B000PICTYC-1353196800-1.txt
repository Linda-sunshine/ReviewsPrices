review/summary: Handy tool for the "bug out" bagreview/text: We just had the Hurricane Sandy disaster; though the hurricane went north of us, we faced possible evacuation. I added this tomahawk to my bug-out bag for a couple of reasons:1. It is a nice axe-all purpose tool.2. The other end could make a decent window punch for the car (though not ideal as a window hammer.)3. You might have to hack yourself out of a damaged building. So this is great for the bug-out bag.It's also a nice camping tool.The unit comes with a cordura case around the head, to protect it and you. It seems very well made and definitely, a good addition to the basic survival tool set.
