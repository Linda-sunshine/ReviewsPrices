review/summary: Does what it saysreview/text: I use this in my greenhouse, where I have a small heater plugged into this thermostat outlet plugged into an extension cord. Most personal heaters won't adjust to 35 degrees but this thermostat in series (in the space I want to keep from freezing) works great! My young citrus trees have survived a number of freezing nights without wasting a bunch of power thanks to this thermostat.
