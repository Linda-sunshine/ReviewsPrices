review/summary: Great Cheap Setreview/text: This little set has everything you could possibly need for tiny work -- torx bits, etc, for working on computer parts. It was a great deal. I don't know about the long-term quality, but for the price and the fact that the bits are used on delicate items I don't know how strong it needs to be. I've used it several times and the bits seem to be holding up just fine.
