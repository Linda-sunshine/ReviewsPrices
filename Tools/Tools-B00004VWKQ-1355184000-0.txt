review/summary: Excellent Sharp Knifener for the Pricereview/text: I was very pleased to find that this simple little device does an excellent job of making sharp knives. Rather than moving the knife through the sharpener, you hold the knife stationary and run the sharpener across the knife a few times. Don't wast your money on some expensive prax electric knife sharpener; try this sharp knifener, you'll like it, especially at such a low price!
