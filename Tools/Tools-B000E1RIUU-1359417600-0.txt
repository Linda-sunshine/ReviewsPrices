review/summary: most humane way to kill a mouse, in my opinionreview/text: And the mice don't seem to expect it. Mice can be incredibly smart and avoid those snap traps/glue traps/humane traps like the plague (lol.....mice caused the plague....sorry wasn't trying for a pun there but...). Anyway, you put some chocolate inside here (they LOVE chocolate...see, they ARE smart) and it works like a charm. They do like peanut butter too so what I did was put some peanut butter down and then a piece of chocolate on top so that the chocolate wouldn't slip onto the metal plate that should remain free of debris (so that it can electrocute the mouse...sorry mouse, but it's you or it's me and it's not going to be me darnit!). Anyway, this is a great solution but check it often because you will be surprised how fast you will catch them with this and once the trap has a mouse, you don't want the mouse to start decaying. Not only will the house stink, but the trap will too, rendering it useless to use again (other mice will smell the decay and avoid the trap).
