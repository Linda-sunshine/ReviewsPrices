review/summary: Information not properly disclosed -- can't use it with hot waterreview/text: I bought this and when I received the package, I read in the manual that it should "not be used with hot water." I called the company Culligan and they told me it is unsafe to use and will melt if used with hot water (above 100 F, which is really not that hot). That makes it quite useless in many cases...what do you do when you need hot water from your kitchen tap, e.g., for washing dishes...remove the filter every time? The main problem I have is that the manufacturer does not disclose this information on the product page, but writes it only in the user manual. I felt kind of lied to and I am now trying to return the filter.
