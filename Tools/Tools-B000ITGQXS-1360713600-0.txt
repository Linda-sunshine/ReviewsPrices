review/summary: Too bright for reading in bed.review/text: I wanted a book light because i love reading in bed at night and my night lamp is too bright for my partner sleeping next to me. turns out this book light is almost as bright as my night lamp itself. I have to twist and turn the neck of the lamp in a lot of weird positions to read without disturbing my partner and it's a real pain. It can be used as a task light though. It has a very flexible neck and it's easy to carry when travelling.
