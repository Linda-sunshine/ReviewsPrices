review/summary: Works perfectlyreview/text: It's cheap, and it does what it says.You may want to pick up an extension cord to use with this since it's on the bulky side, and it's difficult to use without any.I picked up two 3 foot extension cords just to use with this. I plug one extension cord into the wall or surge protector, then plug the P3 into the first extension cord, then plug the second extension cord into the P3's front, and plug in the electronic equipment I want to monitor into the second extension cord. This makes it easier to manage the P3 while it is in use.
