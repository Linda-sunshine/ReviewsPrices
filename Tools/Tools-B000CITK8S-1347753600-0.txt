review/summary: Exactly what you needreview/text: If you have a motorcycle, scooter, moped, atv, dirt bike, etc., and have periods of time about 2 weeks or longer that you don't ride, a battery tender/charger is a great thing to have. It's super easy to use and keeps the battery charged up without using a lot of electricity, so your battery doesn't go dead and you buy a new one. Since this one comes with a variety of connections it will work for your bike. Great little item to have for any rider.
