review/summary: Nice tool for breaking things, throws good, tooreview/text: I bought this tool to help break things during demolition projects with an organization I volunteer with and also to try out as a throwing tomahawk for our Scouts. We throw tomahawks as a Scouting skill and the tomahawks we bought last year were very poor throwers and are falling apart.This tool is well made, the head is securely attached to the handle and the head has enough heft for lightweight demolition, which is what I wanted it for. It throws well, too, the spike on the backside means that the hawk will stick even if the back side strikes the target first.I'm very pleased with the purchase andwill likely pick up a few more for throwing practice.
