review/summary: SOG F01T Tactical Tomahawk, Blackreview/text: Shipment received on time. I love this tomahawk. It feels so comfortable in your hands the the edge comes unbelievably sharp compared to most. You can easily shave with this thing right out of the box. I don't recommend it though. :) I recommend this tomahawk for anyone who spends a lot of time in the wood and is looking for a quality tool.
