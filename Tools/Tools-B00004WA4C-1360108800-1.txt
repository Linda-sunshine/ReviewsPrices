review/summary: It's *loud*review/text: All I can tell for sure at this point is that this device is very loud (possibly too loud). I would suggest using ear protection when you set it up. If you put the batteries in wrong, you get a super-loud tone. The first thing the device says is &#34;press test&#34;. Only do that if you're wearing ear protection, that's how loud this thing is.Pros: It will certainly wake you upCons: Your ears will buzz for a while after you set up this alarm
