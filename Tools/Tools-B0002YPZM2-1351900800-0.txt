review/summary: great fitreview/text: comfortable, well made, and not too bulky to get in the way of your work. I usually hate wearing gloves since I can't normally handle smaller parts with them. These fit so well that it isn't a problem. very durable and well put together. And they breath just enough to be comfortable in warmer conditions but still provide a fair amount of warmth in cold weather. My new favorite pair of gloves.
