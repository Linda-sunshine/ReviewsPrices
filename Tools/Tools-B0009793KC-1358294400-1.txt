review/summary: Could have been a defective unitreview/text: I purchased this filter because of the great reviews. It could have been that I received a defective unit but the filter was horrible. It left a ton of particles floating in the water and it tasted like crap. I've never had water that left a 'film' in your mouth. I was using the Water Sentinel model on Amazon before so I think I'll go back to it.
