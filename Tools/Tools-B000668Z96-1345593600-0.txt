review/summary: Crazy Amazingreview/text: Although this product did not get rid of all the fleas, it deff. helped cut down the amount of them. It was crazy to see how many fleas this trap could hold. It was almost fun counting how many fleas got trapped. The only down side was the bulb died after the third day but then again it probably wasn't mean to be left on all day but I was desperate to get rid of the fleas. Overall I recommend this product!
