review/summary: Quiet. Listen for Yourselfreview/text: Length:: 1:01 MinsReviewers say it's "amazingly quiet," "insanely quiet," "not as quiet as I thought it would be." The maker says it's not as quiet as their $300 model.I made a video so you can listen for yourself.PROs:* Quiet* Plenty of grinding power- 4-year warrantyCONs:- none..- - - Pricing - - -The amazon price jumps around. Low tide is around $165 with rare dips to $150. There's an "Online Price Alert" that will email you whenever this or any amazon product dips below your target price. Google it. It's nicely done. Or try camelcamelcamel.- - - "Pro Compact" vs "Compact" Models - - -Amazon lists two models with no clear differences explained.There are some differences. Apparently it's to offer trade channels some protection from online competition. (Hmmm... Amazon offers both models. How's that working out?)InSinkErator email Oct 23, 2012:"The Evolution Compact is available through home improvement centers and plumbing stores while the Evolution Pro Compact is through plumbers, plumbing stores and wholesalers only. The Evolution Compact comes with 4 year warranty while the Evolution Pro Compact comes automatically now with 5 year warranty. The warranty for the Evolution Compact can also be extended but it has to be installed by a Procircle plumber from InSinkErator. Lastly, the Evolution Compact comes with a Quiet Collar Sink Baffle while the Evolution Pro Compact comes with Anti-Microbial Quiet Collar Sink Baffle"~~~ Comments & questions welcome ~~~
