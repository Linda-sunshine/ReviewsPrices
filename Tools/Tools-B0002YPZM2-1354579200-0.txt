review/summary: I love these glovesreview/text: I bought these gloves in the spring of 2012, in anticipation of some carpentry and painting that I had to do. I've worn these gloves through the spring and summer, for a total of probably a couple of hundred hours. Here's the good:-They're comfortable: They feel like a set of calluses on my hands (in a good way.) They were never too warm in the summer, and they seem like they would retain a bit of warmth in the winter, though I don't know yet.-They're durable: I've dug holes, moved stone, sanded siding, hammered, and sawed with these on. Except for being appropriately dirty, they're unmarred. The velcro is still fresh, and the fingers are still pliable, even though I did a lot of messy painting with them.-They're inexpensive: I can't believe these gloves are under twenty bucks. What a bargain.Here's the bad:I can't think of any bad things to say about these gloves. They're great.
