review/summary: Would Pulverize Granitereview/text: If you are the Tim Allen "Tool Time" kind of guy who likes powerful equipment, this is your unit. Surprisingly, it is also pretty quiet and the vibration isolating collar works well.I bought and installed one of these a couple years ago in a prior residence. Really liked it a lot. I purchased the recent one on a major sale even though I don't presently need it. However, my current property has three disposers that average 14 years old---so it's just a matter of time before I will have to deploy it.Don't struggle with one of those puny 1/2 hp cheapos. Get a big motor with the industry-leading warranty.
