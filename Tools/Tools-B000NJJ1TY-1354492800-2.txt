review/summary: AWESOME!!!!!review/text: This was SUPER easy to install, easy to program, and works really well. Schlage is well known for their quality and it shows. My previous door know was a piece of garbage Quikset. This blows it out of the water. The best part is, no more forgetting keys! That alone is worth the price I paid ($120.00).Get this - you won't be disappointed!!!!!
