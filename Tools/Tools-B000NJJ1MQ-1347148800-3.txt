review/summary: nice for forgetful old ladiesreview/text: I purchased this for my vacation house because. I was always walking out without my keys. it is a pretty place in the country and a walk before breakfast was special.....but a not if I forgot to pick up my keys. The Schlage works well and I like the idea of multiple codes for different people, then being able to change them. It was easy to install and easy to program. I feel that. I got a good price compared to what I saw ain the stores. this is a heavy, solid feeling lock and I hope it will continue for many years. Now I can give friends the code so they can use the condo and don't have to get the physical key.
