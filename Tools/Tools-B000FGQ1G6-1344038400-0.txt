review/summary: Fantastic mini-tool setreview/text: I just finished replacing the battery on a Garmin Nuvi 670 GPS (the replacement battery came without the replacement tools). Without this Boxer tool set, there is no way that I could have done the replacement. This is a very sturdy (for the mini size) set of tips and the handle contained a small magnet that not only held the tips in the receiver, but provided just enough magnetism to also hold the very small screws onto the tip. To do the job, I needed the T5 Torx, the small flat screwdriver and one of the small Phillips tips. I'm 69 years old and have most every tool imaginable (I also have a very tolerant wife), but this Boxer mini tool set has to rank right up there with my favorites.
