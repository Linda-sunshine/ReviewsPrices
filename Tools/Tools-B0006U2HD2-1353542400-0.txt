review/summary: Small and easy to installreview/text: We purchased this item to use with a small heater in our well pump house. It hasn't yet been cold enough for the thermo cube to necessitate turning on the heater but we are assuming it will work as described. We are reliant on our well and pump for all of our water so this product gives us peace of mind during the coldest winter months.
