review/summary: IS this thing running?review/text: I replaced an old Kenmore disposal that was down to the wooden spoon starting stage of its life over the weekend and I am impressed with this new disposal unit.Installation was a snap, although since I mounted it using the 3-bolt system that was in place from the old unti using the Waste King adapter I should have also bought the third hand option to make the mounting a bit easier in the confined space under the sink. Mounting was relatively painless. I did have to cut a couple of inches off of the disposal drain pipe but that was a minor side note in an otherwise simple installation. Start to finish it took less than 30 minutes.When I initially turned on the unit I had the water running full tilt and had to double-check that I had plugged it in because it was so quiet in operation. The old unit sounded like a 55 gallon steel drum full of ball bearings but his thing just gives off a quiet hum and chews through anything I feed it.Great product!
