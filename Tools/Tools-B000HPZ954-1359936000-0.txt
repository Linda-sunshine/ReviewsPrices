review/summary: With Geat Power...review/text: I bought this to replace my heavy duty monster cable surge protector that was 6 years old and buzzing so loudly, the neighbors could have hear it!I really like all the outlets and quality, although not metal like the monster cable one I replaced, it does have more outlets. I would have liked to see the back have a couple more mounting options, and it's odd that if you do mount it vertically as shown in the pic, the power cable is on the bottom, the cable management would be on top!?!? (Mounting holes are the kind that slip over the head of a screw, then slide down to hold.) Mounting on it's side or not at all is a better option in this case.
