review/summary: Easy to usereview/text: This comes with the necessary faucet attachment so that you can screw it right on. It's smaller and lighter than the Pur water filter. Just run it a minute and let the black charcoal water run through. It does create more pressure while running water and therefore higher pitch sound but nothing aggravating.
