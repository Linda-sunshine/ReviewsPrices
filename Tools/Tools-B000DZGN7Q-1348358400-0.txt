review/summary: Kitchen Renoreview/text: I recently completed a kitchen renovation that wouldn't be the same without this Waste King disposal. It makes quick work for cleanup after a meal as it grinds just about anything. I also found that the noise level wasn't bad at all. I've read other reviews where customers complain about this but the 8000 is quiet for what it can grind. Overall, well worth the purchase price. When someone asks me what the best feature of my new kitchen is, this ranks in the top 3. I highly recommend this model and have not been disappointed at all.
