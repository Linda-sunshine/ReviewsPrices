review/summary: This product does everything I could ask for.review/text: I love this product, it plugs right into my Harley without any adapters or extra hardware. I put it on as soon as I park my bike, it keeps the battery charged and then once it's full it flips into maintenance mode, maintaining that nice float charge that keeps it so easy to start my bike. I couldn't be happier with this product, it even came with some extra accessories so I can use it on my truck, lawnmower, etc.
