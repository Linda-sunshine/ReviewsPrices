review/summary: You'll Never Have to Buy another(buy 2!)review/text: For years I have bought drawerfuls of sharpening items, from stones to wands to an electric grinder with diamond sharpeners and everything in between...none of them worked very well or you had to be a full time master chef to sharpen a knife. This product is well made, sturdy. lightweight and a 3 year old could use it safely & successfully.I admit it, I buy cheap knives...I can't afford $300.00 for a set of professional grade knives. And I like to cook...alot. I de-bone chickens, turkeys, filet whole fish and buy large sides of beef to butcher and repackage myself. I took my dullest knife and it sharpened in FOUR passes to scalpel-like sharpness. I whizzed through my vegetable prep in no time. Not a tear from dicing an onion. I am in serious buyer love with this product. The price is ridiculously low for a product this good. Buy two before the secret gets out and the price skyrockets!
