review/summary: Great lock. Moved and just have to have another.review/text: This lock worked flawlessly the 2 years I had it at previous residence. I sorely miss it and will be soon installing one at new home.Love that you can temporarily put in a different code for pet sitter or anyone else you need to let in and don't feel like you have keys or potential copies of your keys floating around.For instructions to enter and delete new code etc. there is nice YouTube video also.Convenience can't be beat and in the dark it lights upon touching button.
