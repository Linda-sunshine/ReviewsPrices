review/summary: Not badreview/text: I have caught two mice in this and 3 in the old fashion traps. We haven't seen any more since. So either they are hiding for a while, there are no more, or they have relocated their residence! I would recommend this product. Just note in the instructions, just a little dab of peanut butter inside. They have great sense of smell, so you only need just a dab to get them in there. Too much to set off the sensors.
