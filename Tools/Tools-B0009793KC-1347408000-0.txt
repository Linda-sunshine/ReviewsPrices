review/summary: Very bad tastereview/text: I should have listened to other reviewers' comments. Before purchasing this item, I have seen some bad reviews about how bad the taste of the filtered water is from Amazon.com. But I ignored it because it is from "Whirlpool". But believe me, the taste is really bad. I am not even sure if it is harmful to my family's health. Don't buy it.
