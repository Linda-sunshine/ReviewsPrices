review/summary: InSinkErator Badgerreview/text: Replaced an older Badger unit with this new one. Product arrived on time and as advertised. It took less than 25 minutes to pull out the old unit and install the new with no trips to the hardware store (a first for me). I am very pleased with how easy it was to install and how well and quietly it works.
