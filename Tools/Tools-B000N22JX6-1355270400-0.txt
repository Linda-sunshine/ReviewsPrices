review/summary: As functional as it is attractive !review/text: I just love this little heater. which works as well as it looks ! It is the best looking space heater available on the market. by far.I've had it less than a day,but so far so good. I had no trouble programming it before even reading theinstructions. ( No heat re Hurricane Sandy !) The base is extremely solid both on carpet and on solid surfaces.and I am not concerned about it tipping over. I have just place an order for two more !
