review/summary: Worked great for 2 days then lightbulb burned outreview/text: Got this because I have a lil' baby at home and didn't want to use any funky chemicals to treat my beloved boxer's little "problem" with fleas. Warning: It's a pretty bright light. Not something you want to put in your bedroom, though that's where we have it b/c that's where the pooch sleeps. Made me kinda cranky sleeping "with the light on" all night but lo and behold, in the morning time there were some fat fleas stuck to the sticky layer. Success! Then the lightbulb burned out a day later. Sadness! They say you can replace it with a standard light bulb, which we plan to do, but shoot. I didn't expect the light to burn out after only 2 days. That was a bummer.
