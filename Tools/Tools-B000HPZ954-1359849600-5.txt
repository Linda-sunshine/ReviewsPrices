review/summary: Awesome valuereview/text: Does what you expect. I haven't (and hope I never) had a power surge with this device, but from what I've read it stands up fairly well. 12 outlets are plenty for everything I need to plug in. One strange thing is that I can never get the &#34;not grounded&#34; light to turn off (I wonder if my house is not grounded?). The build quality is superior to a lot of other surge protectors and I've already replaced my old one with this one.
