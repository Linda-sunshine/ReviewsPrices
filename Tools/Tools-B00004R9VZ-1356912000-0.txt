review/summary: Works Great, Feels/Looks Cheap Up Closereview/text: PRO -I bought it for moths, not mosquitoes, as I had quite the overwhelming population. It took a couple months, but this thing caught up to the population eventually, and it was such a relief to be able to go in and out at night without letting a moth in literally every time. The 1-acre coverage seems accurate for the model I bought.CON -Really big moths (and I mean REALLLY big, like tomato worm moths) don't fit inside, and thus don't get zapped.TIPS -Make sure you hang it reasonably far from anywhere you want to hang out or go in/out doors, as it brings the bugs to that area of the yard.It gets covered pretty quickly, but still seems to attract them in. Cleaning is pretty easy (I just shake it a bit, or tap on the outside), just don't be down wind when you do it!
