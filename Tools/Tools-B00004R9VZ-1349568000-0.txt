review/summary: Mosquito eaterreview/text: The grid spacing is a little over 1/4" and excellent for catching smaller fry like mosquito. Voltage is not too high such that it self-arcs when a bit dirty but more than enough to get the job done. As will all zappers I've seen, the plastic finger guards need to be snipped off to make things more inviting and ease cleaning.Construction quality is better than other branded units. It's not a sealed high-precision unit but certainly more durable and with less open space (bug entry) than the stingers.I've had better luck with two of these than one mega-sized unit that only catches large moths.
