review/summary: I got five years out of mine, 3 years longer than my badger 10review/text: Spend a little more and get a better disposer. I got five years out of mine and then the cast iron grinding chamber collapsed. Since I only got 2 years out of the replacement badger 10, I consider myself lucky. My latest disposer is a Waste King. Bye bye Badgers....
