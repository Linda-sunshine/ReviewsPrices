review/summary: Killed only moths but no mosquitos!review/text: I live in a heavily wooded suburban area in the suburbs of Philadelphia. In the summer, the mosquitos are so bad that you can't even sit outside during the day. My dog spends a lot of time in the backyard in the summer, and due to his health issues (and my own), I didn't want to use any chemicals to try to help with the mosquito problem. Thus, I tried this device.Some important points...it doesn't have an On/Off button. As soon as you plug it in, it's on. It doesn't have a daylight sensor - it's on all of the time. This was problematic as I had to plug it in at dusk and then unplug it in the morning.Also, it is recommended that you do not leave this out in heavy rainfall. Again, this forced me to take it down and put it in the garage if it was going to rain that day which was also inconvenient. I could have solved this issue by moving it to another location which was covered, but due to the other issues with the product, I never got around to it.At night, the light is VERY BRIGHT. As if someone had a porch light on! The light is bright blue in color.Within a few minutes of turning it on, I heard some zaps. Yahoo, I thought! Kill all of those mosquitos! But, unfortunately, it only ever killed moths - I didn't see one single mosquito. Now, this could be because they were vaporized - not sure. But, in the two weeks that I had it running all night, every night, it made absolutely no difference in my mosquito population in my backyard. To be fair, they suggest that you use this for months and that next season, you should see a difference. Based on the issues noted above, I wasn't willing to dedicate that effort and took it down. I should have returned it - not sure why I didn't.In summary, I was not happy with the performance of this product and have stopped using it.
