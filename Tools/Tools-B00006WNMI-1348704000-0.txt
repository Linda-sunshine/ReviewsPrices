review/summary: Culligan water filter is greatreview/text: When we moved into housing on an army base, I was concerned about the age of the pipes and the quality of the water. I ordered this faucet filter after reviewing several brands. It arrived sooner than expected and I had it installed in 15 min which included reading the instructions. It was fast easy, required no special tools, and I had clean clear water. I would definitely order this product again, and the real beauty is both the faucet filter and the replacement filters are less expensive than other big name brands.
