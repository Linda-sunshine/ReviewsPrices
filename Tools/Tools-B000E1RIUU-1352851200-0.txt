review/summary: It works!review/text: Ordered one of these over the weekend. Device arrived yesterday (11/13) and I set it up to catch the mice that scurry around overnight in and around the kitchen stove. The next morning (11/14), I hear what sounds like a mouse trying to escape the device. When I check on it, the green light is blinking but there is no mouse and no peanut butter! To make things worse, a mouse peaks out at us from behind the stove before scurrying away! That afternoon, we remove a burner cover and find a dead mouse! Apparently, the mouse lived long enough to escape the unit only to die later. I reset the trap around 6pm. By 7pm, the green light was blinking again! Two dead mice in less than 24 hours! I agree with the other reviewers and recommend keeping the inside contacts clean. A tiny amount of peanut butter smeared on the back wall (with the holes) is more than enough bait.
