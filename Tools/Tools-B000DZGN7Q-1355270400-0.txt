review/summary: Easy to installreview/text: I was impressed with how easy it is to install. It is very quiet but only time will tell how well it will last.The one I replaced was a insinkarator with a 4 year warranty it lasted almost 5 years. Thats why I wanted one with a lifetime warranty. It lookes to me like they trust their product.
