review/summary: Now that's a ladder!review/text: I purchased this ladder a few days ago on Amazon because I was getting frustrated with living in the dark. We have some high ceilings and we have several lights over the stairs so I needed something that could be used in a variety of ways. Being an Amazon Prime customer, I ordered the ladder and it was at my doorstep in two days. This also fixed my issue of trying to buy a ladder at a local store and get it to my house...free delivery! The ladder is super easy to use. I just changed two lightbulbs over my stairs, one in my son's room and one in our living room. The other thing I like about it is that when it's folded up, it stands on it's own. One thing to consider is this is a very HEAVY ladder. We have two flights of stairs in our house that I just lugged it up and down. Not impossible, but my arms feel like jello right now.
