review/summary: Very Happy Father In-Law!!!review/text: I gave this 5 stars because when you can make your father in-law happy, you've have found the perfect product. We needed to get my father in-law ear protection. He is not a very picky man but after trying these out a few times, he was completed satisfied. The were comfortable to wear for the few hours it takes to mow, trim and blow 3.5 acres. Can't speak of quality but they seem sturdy and good built quality. I definitely recommend to anyone looking to get quality without spending a fortune.
