review/summary: I can SEE the difference!review/text: I bought this primarily to fill our humidifier because when the water needed to be replaced in it every 2 days, there was some nasty looking residue in the bottom that needed constant, thorough cleaning (gross, yellow-ish solid matter floating in the leftover water, and an orange-red ring around the water line - yuck!). I now use water filtered though this product and there is never any dirty residue in the humidifier any more! PLUS, the difference in taste is very noticeable. I shudder to think what I was ingesting before buying this.
