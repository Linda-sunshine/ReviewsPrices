review/summary: Top Flight & Reasonable Pricereview/text: These units are excellent if you just need a stand/alone unit. They do not interconnect, but I was putting them in areas that wasn't wired, so they were perfect. The batteries used in these units are three, AA batteries. So inexpensive to replace batteries on a regular basis. Very happy with this purchase and I could not beat the price. I bought THREE!
