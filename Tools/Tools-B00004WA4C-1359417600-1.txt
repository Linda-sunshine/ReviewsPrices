review/summary: This unit isn't Kiddie, it's great!review/text: Purchased these after reports of &#34;regular smoke detectors&#34; not being able to detect certain types of fires (particles vs heat/smoke). This unit feels quality, and doesn't take 9volts like most detectors. It's nice because it talks - it alerts of what type of event it's going off for, and when your batteries are low! We outfitted the house with these units and have been very happy. Hopefully we never truly need them.
