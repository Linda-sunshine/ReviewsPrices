review/summary: excellent toolreview/text: Works quickly on anything from butchers knives to katanas, this tool is easy to use and effective. My one complaint is that because the angle of the blades is fixed, you can't adjust for different edges. but for what i wanted it for, which was a quick resharpening, it worked like a dream
