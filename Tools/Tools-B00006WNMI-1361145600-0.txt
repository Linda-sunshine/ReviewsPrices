review/summary: Good product, not much to complain aboutreview/text: Pros:-Water tastes much cleaner. I live in a part of the United States where we have hard water and no water softener. This filter makes the tap water from my kitchen sink taste a lot fresher and cleaner.-Easy to operate-PriceCons:-Water comes out slow. It flows out of the filter about 2/3 slower than it normally comes out of the faucet.-A little squirelley to install. Manual recommended a &#34;trial and error&#34; method of installing using a combination of gaskets and caps on your faucet. It took me about 15 minutes to find the right combination for my sink.Overall a good product, would recommend.
