review/summary: My Whirlpool Water Filterreview/text: When I received my Whirlpool Refrigerator Water Filter, I liked the idea of not having to go to a store to pick it up and having the options of receiving a filter every 6 months or so as a second reminder (the first reminder is the amber light) and the cost is reasonable as well.Thanks
