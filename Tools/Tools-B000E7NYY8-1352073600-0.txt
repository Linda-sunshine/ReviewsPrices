review/summary: great productreview/text: I bought this for my oil filled heater. The heater I use doesn't have an accurate control on temp, but with the help for this product, it works perfectly. I use this for my baby's bedroom, you must know baby has sensitive feelings about temp, not too hot neither too cold. This proudct help me control the room temp perfectly, very accurate. And one more good fact that it save your utiltiy bill.
