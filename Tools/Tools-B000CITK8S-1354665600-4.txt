review/summary: Works flawlesslyreview/text: This thing goes on the battery and stays there, so you have an easy quick-connect when you need to use it. We leave cars unused for fairly long periods of time, and this solves the problem of the battery draining without unhooking a battery cable or removing a fuse.
