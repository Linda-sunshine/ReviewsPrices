review/summary: Powerful!review/text: This unit replaces an old Insinkerator unit. It has much more power and is generally quieter. Not sure why someone stated it grinds poorly, you can grind up chicken bones with this monster! It was professionally installed for a home remodel, so I cannot attest to it's degree of difficulty for installation. It is definitely a heavy and sturdily built unit, and I'm satisfied with the purchase!
