review/summary: Bug Off Screenreview/text: The product does well for people, but not for pets. The screen material is a bit too flexible and should be more rigid. The magnets could be a bit more powerful to pull closed when my dog goes through the opening. I believe thar the produce would be better if the opening met in the middle and not overlapped. As it is designed now, my dog goes in and out on the same side of the screen causing it to remain open at the bottom.
