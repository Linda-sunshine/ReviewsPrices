review/summary: AccuSharp revived our Ginsu knives!review/text: We bought a Ginsu knife set a couple years ago, but recently they were so dull that my wife was ready to throw them out and spend hundreds of dollars on a new knife set. I got this sharpener and spent half an hour sharpening our knives without telling her. Later that day, she was cutting some tomatoes to make a salad and I heard a loud exclamation from the kitchen. &#34;Uh-oh,&#34; I thought. &#34;I made the knife too sharp and she cut her finger off!&#34; Nope... she was OK but was SUPER excited that her &#34;same old knife&#34; was now slicing through the tomato so easily.I used around 4 passes on each knife the first time that I sharpened them, but since then I've only had to use one pass if a knife starts to look like it could use a fresh cutting edge. It only takes a few seconds per knife, and IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT! This little sharpener saved us hundreds of dollars and made my frugal wife VERY HAPPY. Highly recommended!
