review/summary: Excellent after 2 years of daily usereview/text: I did a lot of research before purchasing this system for our guest house. We have been using this daily (multiple times each day) for over 2 years and it works great. We still have not replaced the batteries. I'm not sure I even remember how to do so. I'm getting more for the rest of the house because who wants to carry around keys? I've put this into our rentals as well. Tenants love them. Excellent product.
