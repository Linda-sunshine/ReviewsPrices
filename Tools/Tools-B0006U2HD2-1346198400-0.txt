review/summary: Do Not Buy This from Anyone It Is Junk!review/text: I have bought two of these from Amazon.con in the past two weeks. One shipped from Amazon.com and one came from Farm Innovators who sells on Amazon.com. The first one that I received had the contacts inside the unit bent so that you could not plug an electrical plug into it. I decided that this problem was a fluke and that a second one would not have this problem given that it was coming from a different supplier. Well guess what. The second one has the identical problem! And forget about calling the importer - the number rings busy no matter when you call them. There is another report of this same problem in the reviews. Given that the contacts are so messed up I am worried about whether it really works and I can't test it until this winter.
