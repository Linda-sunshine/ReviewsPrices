review/summary: A must have to keep bugs OUT.review/text: Just replaced my old screen with this one and I'm happy. This is attached to the top part of a french door and it's very easy to mount. It's pressurized, so you just unscrew the rod to the length desired and it mounts by pressure. It stays up and does not fall down. It keeps the bugs away and it has magnetic closures so little babies will not venture out.Must have.
