review/summary: Great for the value!review/text: Great glove for the cost!..Great glove in general!As soon as I got these, I loved the way they fit. Snug but not too tight.I can grab and pick up things without worrying about dropping stuff, good grip.Love the extra padding on the knuckles!If you're looking for just a general use work glove, get these.
