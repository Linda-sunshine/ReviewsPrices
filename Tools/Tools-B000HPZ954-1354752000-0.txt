review/summary: Great Item and Pricereview/text: I have had 8's before and needed more outlets for convenience so I bought two of these 12's. Most of the outlets are only used periodically and I have several transformers, though they are rarely kept plugged in, it is nice to have several places for the transformers to fit. Highly recommended, especially for home theater.
