review/summary: Flowtron BK-15D Electronic Insect Killerreview/text: I bought this for our shop/office. We have a bad problem with flies, every morning coming in and finding hundreds of flies on the floor. I found it works best in the warm office vs the cold shop. I have the shades down on that end of the office so they are attracted to the light not the windows. Everytime I hear the zap it makes me smile!!
