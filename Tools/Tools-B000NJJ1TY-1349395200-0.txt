review/summary: Wonderful lock.review/text: This lock is the smartest thing we have ever done in the eight years we have lived in our house. Prior to this, we'd forever lock the 'man door' going into the house and have to use the garage door opener to open it or walk all the way around the garage.This friend, is a must have. It took about 30 minutes to read the instructions and install. It comes in a right hand open (the hand bar facing right) and we needed it facing left. Easy as pie to change the direction. They give you a little 'key/pin' and you just stick it in a clearly shown on the directions 'spot' and the handle lifts off, then you turn it around and push it on.If I had one suggestion it would be for the 'beeps' to tell you the code has been programmed in that you have chosen as your 'private 4 digit code' a little louder. Old guys miss the beeps unless I'm really close.The lock solves the problem totally. No other problems so far as another reviewer noted. If I remember, the lock itself is all metal so as long as the finish holds up, this lock is fantastic. It was on a Gold Box deal and about 1/2 price of 1/3 the price of list which is why I finally bought one.Easy to use and the lock autolocks about 10 seconds after you enter the code and turn the handle and open the door.Can't say enough good things about this lock. 10 stars if I could.
