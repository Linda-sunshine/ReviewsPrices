review/summary: Horribly madereview/text: Only gave it a star because it does work. However it is a pain to try to put together, the light is supposed to fit through a hole on the top of the lid which is hard stiff plastic and the hole is NOWHERE near big enough for that fixture to fit through there, we tried everything except trying to cut the hole bigger because we could not even imagine how that could be done, let alone done right. trying to put the sticky disc which curls up in the bottom is a nightmare. We finally go one in the best we could and just stuck the light through with the fixture that is supposed to push through and hold light bulb straight under there just laying cattywampus on the top which of course means the light bulb is doing the same and up against the plastic under there which is of course not safe. So just turned it on long enough to see if it attracted any fleas and it did, so we knew we needed to retreat. The only thing it will work for is just that if we are ever suspicious there might be fleas again we could repeat what we did in the test. Certainly even if it went together right that is all it is good for. No way it would be useful in trying to rid your home of fleas obviously. Makes me sick that I wasted my money by ordering two:op
