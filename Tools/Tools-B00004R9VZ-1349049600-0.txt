review/summary: A much needed backyard accessory!review/text: I live in southern Texas in a cookie cutter suburb. My neighborhood backs up to acreage plots, and also a water runoff area. When it rains, a couple of days later we get significant amounts of mosquitoes. There are so many sometimes that I cannot even go outside to water my plants at dusk as I would get bit a lot. At night time when I would let my dog out to relieve himself, as soon as I would turn on the porch light, swarms of bugs would flock to it. The light is right next to the back door so when I would go back inside, it would let significant amounts of bugs inside.I placed the Flowtron unit away from my home as described by the instructions. I have a .2x acre lot(really small!) and this unit keeps the bugs away from my back door. I can now let my dog out without being annoyed by the bugs that would come flying back inside with me. The Flowtron seems to be killing quite a bit of insects. Mostly moths, and mosquitos. I have had the unit for 3 days now and have already had to clean the bars once. Some larger bugs don't get into the unit. I have found some moths the size of humming birds(!) just hanging out around the light not able to get zapped.While reading through the documentation the came with my unit, I found that per Flowtron the bulbs will need to be replaced once a year even if they are still functional. This is because the UV portion of the light wears off. I didn't realize this when I bought my unit. Not a big deal as the unit does an awesome job of killing, but it's something the consider.TL;DR - It's awesome, kills lots of bugs(except humming bird sized moths). Bulbs have to be replaced once a year.
