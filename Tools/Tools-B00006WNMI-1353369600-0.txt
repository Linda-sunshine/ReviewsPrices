review/summary: So far its greatreview/text: I have only been using this for about a week. The installation was so easy a child could do it. I like it because its small and takes up very little space like my previous Pur did. I did not give it 5 stars because there is nothing to let you know when the filter needs to be replaced. The water comes out pretty fast and if you try to slow it down the little push button will go in and turn off the filter. It will take some getting use to and will give it a better review in a couple of months - just need to use it a little longer.After a few weeks: I do have a con about this filter......do not like the way the water comes out and if you turn the faucet to low it cuts off. It does not come out in a nice stream like the Pur, but this may not matter to you. I wonder if mine is malfunctioning or if this is normal. Anyway its not a huge thing, but I still like the smaller space this one uses. I had one of the taller faucets at my other apt., so this was not a problem, but now since I moved the faucet is standard height and was just too hard to fit even a smaller drinking glass under the Pur. This was the main reason I switched to Culligan. If this doesn't work out I guess I will just go to a filtered pitcher or bottled water.
