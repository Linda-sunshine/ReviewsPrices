review/summary: Need an outlet strip that let me use more of the outletsreview/text: This outlet strip does let me use more of the outlets than most others that I've tried but still manufacturers need to recognize that there are a lot of devices that use wall warts and their outlet strips need to be designed to allow more that 2 or 3 to be used. This one does better with 4 but still you can lose up to 2 outlets for &#34;normal&#34; wall warts.
