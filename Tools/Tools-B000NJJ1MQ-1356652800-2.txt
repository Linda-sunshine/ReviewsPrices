review/summary: Simple, solid function and looks good!review/text: I found that this lock performs as described in the description, and there were no surprises. It is easy to install depending on predrilled holes from your last lock. It is a solid lock and the function is clean and simple. Programming is also very simple when using the guide. One person that wrote a review gave information on how to disassemble the key function if you are concerned about picking/bumping. I removed a small piece in the lock and it worked.I was aware that this lock did not auto lock and open after the code is entered. Those features are nice, and I decided to get this lock instead because too many people mentioned that the electronic motor in the Kwikset lock either did not work correctly or wore out within a year (I had this lock and returned it).
