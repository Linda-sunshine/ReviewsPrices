review/summary: Easy To Installreview/text: Our previous InSinkErator Badger 5 was in our home before we moved in so I am not sure exactly how old it was. We lived in the house for 6 years so it was at least that old, but I think it had been there for quite awhile.About a week ago the sink started leaking and we discovered a hole in the side of the Badger 5 due to the metal being rusted through.I purchased the exact same model and it arrived quickly. At first we were considering paying a handy man to install the new Badger 5, but upon inspection of the instructions, my husband felt confident he could install it himself.The installation could not have been easier. It took him about 30 mins from start to finish with no hiccups or issues. The directions were clear and easy to follow. All hookups went smoothly and everything worked.One thing people should be aware of is that it did not come with the clamp for the electrical wire so we had to use the clamp that came off of the old one for this one. Keep this in mind and keep the clamp or purchase one from the hardware store.All in all it works fine. It has only been a few days so I can't place judgement on longevity. Can't beat the price either!
