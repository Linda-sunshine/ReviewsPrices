review/summary: Cheap, flimsy piece of junkreview/text: This tool looks impressive when you open the box but it truely is a piece of junk. It difficult to use if not impossible with one hand. It is hard to open and when it does snap open, you invariably drop the keys that it is attached to. That is if you don't cut yourself while trying to pry it open. The small hook that closes on the keyring broke on mine not 2 months after I got it. Don't waste your money.
