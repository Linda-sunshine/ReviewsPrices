review/summary: So far, AOK -- I'll let you know if things changereview/text: >Things I love: 12 foot cord. Flat plug that angles off, not blocking other outlet. Price. Fast delivery.>Things I don't love: my inability to look at the picture and realize that it's dark gray. I checked out other "white" surge protectors and my poor brain must've been clogged. Would help clogged brains if final order description included the words "dark gray".>Things that don't matter: the warranty. They are counting on consumers not to jump through their loops. If all consumers who experienced a loss carried out their claims, Belkin would need to charge at least $100 for this surge protector, or else go out of business, filing bankruptcy. However, they can offer you $200,000 replacement because they feel secure that your equipment will be protected.>Things I'm willing to do: jump through all the loops if my TV gets fried.>Things I don't understand: why I'll pay $1500+ for our new TV and not more heavily research surge protectors, too. Well, after 35 years of never having any electrical or electronic equipment get fried using simple wall outlets as well as surge protectors, I'll take my chances on this affordable, quality product.>Things Amazon (or Belkin?) could do: 1) Update description by describing color. 2) Make note that older reviews are of the product when it included 12 outlets. 3) remove the giddy review excerpt about "12 outlets!!!!" that precedes the reviews. No longer applies.
