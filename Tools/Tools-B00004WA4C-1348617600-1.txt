review/summary: It's battery changing time!review/text: This seems like it's probably OK at what it does, but I have to change the batteries every 5-6 weeks. That's really not acceptable.I'm not sure if it's easier to switch to lithiums than to throw this out-- maybe I can get 6 months out of lithiums. That will be about $11 per year to run this. Oy.P.S. to all those internet geniuses who reflexively tell people to get better batteries: my batteries are rated above-average for alkalines by Consumers Reports. So save it.
