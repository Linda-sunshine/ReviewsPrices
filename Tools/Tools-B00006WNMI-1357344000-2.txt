review/summary: Does what it should!review/text: This is my second time buying this filter as I was too beaten down during my last move to go back upstairs and remove the filter from the faucet...I know stupid! It only takes 1 minute to do so...Anyways, quick one minute install and just let it run for 10 minutes or so to remove the carbon. Does not fall down or anything if touched unlike Brita filters... I hated the Brita as they thread plastic! This is made of metal so very durable and snug fit. Buy it without hesitation!
