review/summary: Comfortable and stylish.review/text: It has been quite a pleasure wearing these. They are easy to put on and are comfortable on my hands. Quite handy for the occasional need to wipe away sweat from my face, too. That said, I find it a small inconvenience that despite the overall tight fit, they cannot cover my finger tips tightly. It is really difficult to open a can of drinks while wearing them and I would sometimes have problems pressing certain buttons on my DSLR camera. Regardless, these gloves are indeed worth it.
