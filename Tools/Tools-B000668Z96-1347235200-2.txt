review/summary: Victor Ultimate Flea Trapreview/text: I live in the country where we have a big problem with gnats, fruit flies and grass fleas. I was quite happy with this product. I put it on the floor and turned it on at night. The next morning there were 4 fleas and several gnats stuck to the sticky paper. I left it on from that point 24/7. The fleas were attracted to the heat from the lightbulb and got stuck to the paper, no problems. It is not unattractive and can be set up in a corner or out of the way place, but has to be near an outlet. I wish the cord was longer though. Also, the nightlight sized bulb burned out after just one week. Other than that, I will be ordering several more of these to put in other rooms. Unless you have a big flea outbreak, I think the sticky paper that goes in the light should last for quite awhile till its all filled up.
