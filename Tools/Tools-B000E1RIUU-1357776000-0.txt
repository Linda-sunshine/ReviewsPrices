review/summary: Much quicker, less chance of going wrong.review/text: So, after reading CF's fantastic review I decided that this product was, indeed, for me. I hated snap trapping mice and only getting their legs or their tails. Felt cruel to me, and then the whole having to kill them by hand. So, I wanted a product that was safe for use around my cat and dogs as well.I searched a bit, and found this product. I set it up last night in two locations, one with heavy mouse traffic, and one with light mouse traffic. The one in the heavy mouse traffic area has already caught a mouse! The little green light flashed the way it was supposed to, and I checked, and yep! A mouse tail! I picked up the box, flipped open the container, and then dumped it in the trash. No cleanup! Just a dead mouse! I reset it, closing the lid again, turning it on so that the light blinked once, and machine buzzed very softly, and it was ready to drop rodenitan death once more!Over all, I'm pleased!
