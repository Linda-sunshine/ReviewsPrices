review/summary: Great for opening Macintosh laptopsreview/text: I bought this product so I could open a 2010 MacBook Pro & a 2004 PowerBook G4. It opened both with no problem. The smallest Phillips head bit is the right size for the 2010 MacBook. All of the bolts were in quite tight & I had previously ruined a small Phillips head that I had that wasn't small enough. The set also has a star shaped bit that worked for the 2004 PowerBook G4.
