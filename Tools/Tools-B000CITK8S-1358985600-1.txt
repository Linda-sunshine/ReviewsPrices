review/summary: Good buy!review/text: This saved my lawn mower battery and my car battery. It won't charge if the battery voltage gets too low like my lawn mower battery did, but I just charged the lawn mower battery for a minute with my car's jumper cables do get the voltage up over the minimum and then let the tender do the rest. It's worth every penny.
