review/summary: Do Not Buy - Cheap plastic nozzlereview/text: The nozzle broke on only the second use. Unfortunately it was after the 30 day return policy so I am stuck with it. I should have listened to the countless other reviews on Amazon that said the same thing. The compressor itself seem alright, but it is useless when the nozzle breaks. I can't believe Black and Decker would make the most integral part of the unit out of such cheap material. I will never buy another Black and Decker product again. I couldn't be more dissatisfied with this product. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. If you are depending on this pump to fill your tires on the side of the road in case of an emergency, you couldn't pick a worse pump. It is highly unreliable.
