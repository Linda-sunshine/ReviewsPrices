review/summary: Worked! Once...review/text: The trap worked just as described... once. Discovered a dead mouse in the trap, emptied it, reset it... nothing. No blinking light, no buzz to let you know it was active. $20 for a disposable trap is pretty terrible.Update: I decided to hold onto the trap to see if I could get it to work again. I toggled the on/off switch several times, replaced the batteries, toggled the switch a few more times, and magically the trap came back to life. I have no idea what caused the issue. I put the old batteries back into the trap and it works. So far, I haven't seen any further issues. I've changed the rating to 4 stars, as it appears to be working nominally now.
