review/summary: Works great!review/text: I bought this during a lightning deal. We have a Schlage front door look so I figured the quality would be good as well. It was easy to install (~ 10 minutes). I like the optional inside lock so that you don't always have to enter the code to get inside the house. Color is pretty true for antique brass.
