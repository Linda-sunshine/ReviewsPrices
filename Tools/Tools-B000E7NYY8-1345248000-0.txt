review/summary: LUX Programmable Thermostat Outletreview/text: I purchased this in January 2012. I use it to control a heat lamp for a bird that likes to be outside as much as possible. When the outside temp goes below a threshold, the light plugged in to it comes on; goes off when the outside temp goes up. Works perfect.I would recommend this item for similar applications.
