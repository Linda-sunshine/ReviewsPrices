review/summary: It was effective while it worked!review/text: This Victor M2524 Electronic Mouse Trap worked for just 3 weeks and now has failed. Over the 3 weeks the unit worked it killed about 20 mice. Sometimes the bait was gone, with red light blinking but no mouse. Other times I would set the trap in the early evening, check it before bed, remove a dead mouse, clean and rebait the trap and catch another by morning. However, three days ago the unit failed. I wiped out the trap with a paper towel as usual, baited it with dry dog food and turned it on, the green light came on, the unit hummed (while the capacitors charged) but then the red blinking light came on immediately. No more dead mice! I checked the batteries with my battery tester and they all tested in the green zone - good! This trap did not come anywhere near to killing 100+ mice on a set of batteries as it prominently advertises on its lid. I figure it cost me about $1 per mouse killed, - not very cost effective! No, I do not recommend this product and will not buy another one!
