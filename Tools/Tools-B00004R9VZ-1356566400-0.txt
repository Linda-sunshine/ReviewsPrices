review/summary: SUPER STRONG BUG KILLERreview/text: Well, just to redneck it out we actually removed the plastic protecting covering off of the bottom so that only the electric part was exposed. Words can't describe the "4th of July" like scene that it produced. I'm talking thousands of bugs every night. Come one, come all with the same result. The only problem was that I had bulb to fall out because that part helps to hold in the bulbs. So, I plan to put that piece back on and just cut the slits out of the side so that the bugs and find the electric bars easier. Great purchase and super strong!
