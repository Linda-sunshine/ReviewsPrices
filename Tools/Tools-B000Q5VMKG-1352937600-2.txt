review/summary: Early Days but good so farreview/text: I have only opened this today and installed it (plugged it in) but it seems like a lot of well thought-out features, and is a well made product for the price, or for that matter for twice as much. Some I looked at in Lowe's and Home Depot were trash. The content of features in this particular model is unexpectedly good. The warranty is good, too. I have had to install these as a result of a mortgage refinance (I guess I could have just forgot about it as there was no inspection) but I now I wish I had done so long ago. The technology has progressed a long ways in the 3 to 4 years since Consumer Reports tested and reported on them. This unit also got good reviews from purchasers. Early Days but so far so good.
