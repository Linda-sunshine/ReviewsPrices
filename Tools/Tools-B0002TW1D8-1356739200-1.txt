review/summary: Extensionsreview/text: If you need that little extra reach, this tool has give it too you. they seem wit be working great and work well with my drill and survive my impact driver in usage. Definitely a must if you do anything that you need a reach to access. they fit sockets and other extensions snug enough that they work but not too tight that its hard to get the tool off. overall an effective tool.
