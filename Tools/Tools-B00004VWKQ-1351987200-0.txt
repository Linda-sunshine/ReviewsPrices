review/summary: Totally surprisingreview/text: Ok, I admit it....I was a knife sharpening snob. I had worked my way up to a nice, relatively expensive Chef's Choice electric sharpener, and the results from it pretty much never failed to please me. And then it died. SO, I began looking for a replacement...and what serendipitously arrives, but a review of knife sharpener's in Cook's Illustrated (a very fine cooking magazine!). And what do they recommend? OMG...it's an under $10 sharpener from AccuSharp. My doubts were all over the place...I knew these sort of sharpener's worked, but also had heard they destroy your knife. Well, I decided that rumors are rumors, and apples-to-apples product reviews might be a better source of info...so I bought one. What a terrific product! It sharpens very well, and incredibly fast and easily. A few pulls across the edge, and it's sharp. C'mon steak knives...the whole set. C'mon little paring knives (that, BTW, on which I previously could only reach 2/3rds of the blade w/ the electric sharpener)!I actually bought this one for my girlfriend...I personally bought the combination set for also sharpening shears. The second tools sharpens all of my scissors very well...including the heavy shears I use in the kitchen.Oh, and saving the best for last: The sharpening blades are reversible (so they last twice as long) and are replaceable. I know I sound like a commercial, but I just love finding a cheap, great product. And, believe me, I am not hesitant to totally attack a product if it doesn't measure up!
