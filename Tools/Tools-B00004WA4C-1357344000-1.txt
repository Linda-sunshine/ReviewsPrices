review/summary: Eats batteries!review/text: I bought this talking alarm specifically because I thought it would be easier for us to react to it if it does go off and boy was I right. It has been up for 1 month and has gone off in the middle of the night 5 times for a test and low batteries. This smoke detector has eaten 12 lithium batteries in a month! It is completely ridiculous and is now going in the trash.
