review/summary: Great and powerful little lightreview/text: This is a great light. It is super powerful and the neck is extremely flexible and easy to position. When the electricity went out, this little light calmed my 3 year old son as it was small enough and light enough for him to hold. I ordered a second one for my husband who likes to read at night. It is really super powerful and such a great price. You won't regret ordering it!
