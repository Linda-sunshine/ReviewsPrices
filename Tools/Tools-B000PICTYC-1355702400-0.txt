review/summary: Ok hawkreview/text: This sog hawk is very intimidating tough as carbide, but the heat treat and steel suck...... Took me 2 hours on 3diffrent papers to sharpen it, the spike and main blade won't keep an edge. I dulled it after 7 swings onto soft pine.. Friends dad had it lying around...the blade rolled and it wouldn't stick in the side of a Barn wall... A real barn wall. Just kept bouncing off. I don't recommend this hawk. If your gonna buy a massed produced hawk for under $30 I would go with a cold steel hawk.... They have a really good heat treat on there edge.. I lost both key to my gun safe. It was a stack on 10 gun Cabernet and it took less than 1 minute to break the door open and shattered the brass lock. The blade is still sharp and there is no damage to the head......
