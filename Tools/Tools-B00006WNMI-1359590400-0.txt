review/summary: Great filter but impossible to replace filter cartridgereview/text: I was very happy with this product until I tried to replace the filter cartridge. I could not unscrew the old filter from the unit. I asked someone with stronger hands to help, and he couldn't budge it either. I called Culligan, and was told hard water buildup was the problem and that soaking it in white vinegar for two hours would do the trick. Well, I soaked it and soaked it and was never able to budge it. I'm not the only one with this problem -- I saw comments online from others. Someone suggested using tools, so I tried hitting it, prying it -- I tried 3-in-1 Oil -- nothing worked. I decided to buy another one instead of trying another brand because I already had the replacement filter. I was going to unscrew the cartridge from the unit as soon as I got it and put a little Vaseline on the threads (as suggested by someone online) to prevent hard water buildup. I got the new filter unit yesterday and absolutely cannot unscrew the filter cartridge. It will not budge, and hard water buildup obviously is not the problem. I'm not sure what to do now. I hesitate to try another brand because they're not very highly-rated. Why can't someone make a decent water filter with a filter cartridge that's easy to replace?
