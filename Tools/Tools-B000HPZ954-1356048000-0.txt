review/summary: Another Great Warehouse Deal!review/text: We got one of these Belkin surge protectors awhile back and really like it. It's extra wide, so it's got plenty of room for those over-sized outlet hogging devices. It's also nice and flat too, and easy to mount. So when we saw Warehouse Deals had a bunch of these at a steal, we picked up 3 more for just a little more than 1 at regular price. Gotta love Warehouse Steals --er-- I mean Deals. Great surge protectors! Great price!! Thanks to all who keep sending perfectly good stuff like this back to Amazon -- we appreciate the discounts!
