review/summary: Wow, inexpensive and worksreview/text: Reads some reviews but picking this up and ended up getting several for friends. A staple for every kitchen drawer and you'll always have sharp tools around with this near by. It's a little scary to use the first time as you're working with the sharp edge of the knife, but follow the instructions, go slow and you'll have a nice sharp edge.I also have a professional machine sharpener but this handy for a quick tune up.
