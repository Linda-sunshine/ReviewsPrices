review/summary: Satisfied.review/text: I ordered the battery tender hoping to have it mounted on my van. I hadn't read the specifications while placing the order and realized it was not portable only after I received the shipment. Anyhow, I now have it plugged in my garage and use it as a battery charger for the lawn tractor. I am more than satisfied with the efficiency it works.
