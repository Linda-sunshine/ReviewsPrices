review/summary: Great lock and durabilityreview/text: I have owned this lockset for about 5 years now and it is still working like new. I did not have to change the batteries for about 3.5 years which was great! There's nothing better then not having to fumble with your keys trying to unlock the door. I just purchased a second keypad for my in-laws since they loved mine so much! I highly recommend it!
