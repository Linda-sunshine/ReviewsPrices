review/summary: Great for convenience, add a high security schlage primus cylinder if your still worried about security.review/text: I bought this lock for my detached garage and I love it. I don't have to fumble with my key each morning. Also if I find myself outside during a cookout or chores its great to be able to just step in the garage for a tool or something. If you are simply swapping this lock for a deadbolt that is already in place you should not have a problem. I was pretty much doing a fresh install so do what I did and pick up a door install kit from Home Depot or Lows, it cost about $30 but will make the job much easier. Everything has functioned correctly. I am still using the factory battery so I cannot comment on how often it takes replacement. If you are concerned that it can still be picked then I would recommend taking the lock to a locksmith and requesting a high-security cylinder(I don't any reason one could not be swapped out with thie standard one) Schlage makes a high security line called schlage primus which I assume is compatible.
