review/summary: Does it's jobreview/text: Some of the negative reviews perplex me. 1.) It's a flashlight, and a 2.) $25-30 one at that, 3.) It does its job effectively for home and office use, 4.) I've been happy with it. For no more than you're spending this is a handy little light. We have no complaints and are pleased with the product -- it comes as advertised and the LED has that nice blinding effect. :)
