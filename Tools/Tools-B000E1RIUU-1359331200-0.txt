review/summary: Product did not workreview/text: Sorry, but for me, this product did not work. I even used gloves to put the peanut butter in the trap, and batteries, and no mice. Maybe perhaps because the mice are below in the crawl space, and I put this trap up in the pantry where they had gone before a few years ago. At any rate, this trap did not work for me in the pantry. And again, part of this reason could be because the mice are confined in the crawl space.
