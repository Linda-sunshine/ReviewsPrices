review/summary: Great keypad lock for a great pricereview/text: I had been eyeing one of these for a long time, and when Amazon made it their deal of the day it was a no brainer to pick one up. The lock was easy to install and I really like the fact that you can program multiple codes. My only complaint would be the keypad does not light up making it very difficult to type in the numbers at night. If it had that feature I would have given it five stars. Schlage should look at adding that in the next model.
