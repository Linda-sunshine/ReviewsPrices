review/summary: Great Sharpener, Great Valuereview/text: Sometimes you make those little surprise purchases that you couldn't be happier with. What a great knife sharpener. The advantage of this little jewel is the tungsten carbide honing blades, which are much harder than the knife blade. This is commercial grade material in a handheld product.I've gotten several of these sharpeners, now. The first was for my college son who has taken a liking to good food and isn't afraid to cook it. Last time I visited him at his apartment his knives were a mess - not one sharp one in the bunch. I pulled out the knife sharpener I bought for him less than a year ago, but that sharpened didn't help at all (no wonder his knives were a mess). I went onto Amazon and found great reviews for this sharpener and the price was right. The next week I asked my son what he thought and he said "Amazing". He couldn't say enough good things about the sharpener, that it took pitiful knives and made them sharp again in a few swipes.I ordered one for myself, even though I have a $50 motorized sharpener and two very good honing blocks. The first knife I sharpened was a Hoffritz that couldn't quite go through a tomato. Three swipes later and the tomato was like butter. It's never been this easy to get a knife this sharp, this fast. This is great for my wife, too. Now she doesn't have to wait for me to sharpen the knives - she can reach into the drawer and in a couple swipes be ready to go.I found the sharpener works best when the knife is held on the counter, blade facing up, then drawing the sharpener across the knife. The alternative is to hold the sharpener on the counter and drawing the knife across the sharpener. But I found by pulling the sharpener across the knife I have better control and more consistent pressure. Also, it doesn't take much pressure to get the job done.
