review/summary: You get what you pay for...review/text: The first time I tried to use this the ground plug broke off in the extension cord. Not sure if my extension cord tried to eat it or if this device is just a piece of junk. Going to try a more substantial device. Would not recommend for freeze protection given the number of negative reviews and my own experience.
