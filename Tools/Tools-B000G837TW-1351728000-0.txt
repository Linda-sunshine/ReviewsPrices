review/summary: Rusts in 18 months!!! Yes, works awesome, but you'll need a new one!review/text: All the good things you'll read about this are true.But did you notice that all the reviews that are positive are from recent buyers?Anyone who has had this for a while will tell you the real problems that come about. With MINIMAL use, the turntable is already rusting--which means that in a couple of years, it will be leaking. The rust is also preventing one of the lugs from moving.That is because they are using 400 grade stainless steel, which is not really rust-proof. So they get to say it's stainless, but that does not help you. Just run a search on the type and you will see. They needed a 300 grade one to be fine.But as the other reviewer said, it's designed for obsolescence, even though the motor is really good.After 1 hour of haggling where InSinkErator told me(a) rust is not covered--FALSE: the warranty does not cover "cosmetic rust" whatever the hell that means (actually, it means the rust that will emerge during warranty but will make your machine leak just after warranty expires)(b) I would have to pay for installation--FALSE: the warranty gives you IN HOME repairthey agreed to send me a new one and to pay for the plumber.So now I have to wonder: will they send me a refurbished one? And why bother with the same model when the material is the same--and thus the problem will be?Ah, consumer culture...what a waste.
