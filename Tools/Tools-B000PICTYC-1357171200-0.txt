review/summary: It is what it isreview/text: I gave this 4 stars because it is a good product out of the box. It is sharp, everything fixed into place tight. I chopped up the old Christmas tree with it, cut fine. The reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because durability seems to be a possible issue. You pay for what you get and this does not look like it can take a beating from heavy use. If you plan to use this only a couple of times a year for camping, might work great. If you want more reliability, you should look to spend more than $30.I plan to use this for emergency kits taken on long trips. It will do the job just fine for my occasional use but I do plan to upgrade, always good to have a backup.
