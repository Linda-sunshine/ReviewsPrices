review/summary: Perfect for my sonreview/text: I bought these for my son who is on the autism spectrum. We were getting ready to go on his first plane ride and he is very sensitive to sound. He put these on as soon as we got to the airport and had no problems whatsoever. He wore them until we arrived at our destination, so he had them on for just about 5 hours. I've tried them on a few times around the house just to see how they work and they block out all background noise. I wish I could find a pair that wasn't so bulky for sleeping at night. :)
