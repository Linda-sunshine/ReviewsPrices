review/summary: Looks fancy but really really poor qualityreview/text: I bought this after nearly 2 weeks intensive investigation.I just want a heater which be long lasting, not much noice, and not bring too much dry.Thought it might be good fit, after all, the review seems like perfect.But it was immeidate disappointment when it arrive. Noice was not low, and the room willbe very dry after one night use.Decide not to return it after all, too much hassel to wrap up and bring to the post office.I thought it should at least last a long time. Wrong again, after 2 monthsthe on/off button stop working, and after half a year, it just cannot be turned on,even I push the button very hard and get it successfully turned on, it still automaticallystop working after half an hour.Yeah, this product may look fancy, and seems cheap for the price, but it found it just wastemy money and trust.I won't get into any of Lasko brand anymore, trust me, I bought a lot of stuff from amazonover the past 5 years, this is the first product I feel the need to post a review to help others tomake a correct decision. Do not be fooled by the good reviews, it just doesn't fit the reputation.
