review/summary: Very quiet and works perfectlyreview/text: I looked at many different disposals and was debating between the wast king and Insinkerator. The Insinkerator looked better so went with it. I just installed it last week after purchasing and was amazed by how quiet it is. It works extremely well and very happy. I was even happier when I was able to save almost 40 dollars by ordering from Amazon versus purchasing it in Home Depot or Lowes. I would definitely recommend this and if you want a little large one. They have a normal evolution but not sure its worth the extra money. It is the exact same except the size of the unit.YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!
