review/summary: Great product and is made in USAreview/text: I've been needing to sharpen my knives for a long time. I have tried several types of sharpeners, but have had only so-so results. I read all of the great reviews for this sharpener and figured that I would give it a shot. I would only be out 9 bucks if it didn't work. To my surprise, it has done a great job of getting my knives razor sharp. I can slice thru a sheet of paper with ease with my sharp knives. I have a 10X magnifying lens and looked at my knives' edges before and after. It produced a smooth, consistent bevel along both sides that created razor sharp edge. It's pretty cool to look at how good it looks under magnification. Of course, the knives all have a superior cut now. I am very excited to start cutting with them. The best part is I'm glad this product is made in the USA. Great product.
