review/summary: AC plug doesn't work anymorereview/text: I got this compressor specifically because it was AC/DC. The fourth time I used it the AC plug just quit working. There isn;t any reset for it, it just doesn't work. The 12 volt works fine but I'm apprehensive that will fail too.Airs up quick but I don;t think the pressure gauge in accurate. There was an 8 and 9 PSI difference from this gauge and two seperate tier pressure gauges.Save your money!
