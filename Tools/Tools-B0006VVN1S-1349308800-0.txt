review/summary: Easy to install - Works as expectedreview/text: Installation literally took 15 minutes. It does come in an annoying plastic packaging that you have to cut open. Besides that, it's great. I do wish there was some sort of way to tell when to change the filter besides estimating how many gallons of water you've used since the last filter replacement. Perhaps a color-coded sticker that wears out and changes colors? Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I think you just have to guess at when to change the filter.
