review/summary: Caught a mouse within 24 hours!review/text: I put this trap out lastnight and this evening I checked it and YUP the light was blinking! I hate rodents and it was scary thinking about opening it and dumping it out. But it was easier than my fears.I used peanut butter where the instructions said too. Just a smear was all I needed! I hope that was the only one but either way I wiped the plates and put it back.I will buy more because the colder months bring the rodents in.
