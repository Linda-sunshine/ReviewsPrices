review/summary: Nice hawkreview/text: I have never owned a tomahawk before, but this is a sweet weapon. I do not believe in Zombies, but this would be great weapon to have if you ever did run across one. It would also be great to split some small branches or small pieces of firewood, etc. I would not use it to try and cut down a tree. The handle is plastic and I would not expect it to last very long under those circumstances. I also do not know if I would throw it up against many trees, but if you use this for what it's meant to be used for and realize it's not meant to cut down trees, I think it will last a long time.
