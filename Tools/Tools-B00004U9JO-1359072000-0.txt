review/summary: No Problems Whatsoeverreview/text: This was a replacement for the same exact unit we have had in service for the last 14 years. It does not like paring knives which caused us to have to replace it. The unit went in just as easy as it came out and we were back in business with the new one in about a half hour. We look forward to at least another 14 years of service from the new one. No more kivies of any kinds down the drain. lol
