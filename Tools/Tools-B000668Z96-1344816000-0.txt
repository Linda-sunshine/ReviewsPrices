review/summary: 2 days 5 fleas one moth and the bulb burned outreview/text: 2 days 5 fleas one moth and the bulb burned out also instead of 2 disks there was only one in each box. I bought 2 traps.I am not sure these are a good deal but as my wife says it did get 5 fleas out of action. The light lasted 2 days and I know there are still fleas in the house. I went down to Lowe's and bought a set of 2 appliance light bulbs 40 watt for 3.98 to see how they last and if the trap will still work. I will update this review if I am allowed to.One Week Later: Installed 40 W appliance light from Lowe's and have caught about 18 fleas so far. Looks like this is a good system as not having to use poison in the house. The fact that the bulb is so cheap and they shorted me a disk is rather upsetting but the system does work.Another week has gone by and we have replaced the sticky Flea trap as it was full of fleas. We are on our second trap it is filling up with fleas and a few moths and the bulb from Lowe's is still burning. Only complaint is the packaging says you get 2 traps and we only had one in both packages. Changed stars from 2 to 4. We love the idea we do not need to use a poison on our animals or spray around our house to catch the fleas so we are happy.
