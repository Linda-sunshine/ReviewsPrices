review/summary: Satisfied long term userreview/text: I have used the Kill-A-Watt model P4400 for almost 10 years - it was bought when it first came out on the market. For me, it has proven reliable and very accurate for consumer appliance measurements. I've had it plugged in for a month, even up to a year, on some appliances. I've found it handy to monitor power output and frequency on my emergency generator outlet; it seems rugged enough to take the constant vibration for hours. Measured against my Fluke VOM, the voltage and current measurements were +/- .5 volts, which is pretty good for this type of device. When the frequency is measured on my oscilloscope, the Kill-A-Watt frequency measurement is right on.Yes, it does cover up the other socket on an outlet; many reviewers suggest using an extension cord. Yes, the display is not backlit. On the other hand, without the Kill-A-Watt, the alternative is to first measure voltage then the current, and do the math - so the small drawbacks are more than mitigated by the convenience. To be able to directly monitor the line frequency on a generator without an oscilloscope is tremendously helpful for those of us ham radio operators. It is presently being offered for $18 on Amazon and, to me, this is a bargain; I'm about to order two more.
