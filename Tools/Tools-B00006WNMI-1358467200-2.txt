review/summary: So Far So Good... And Affordablereview/text: I've had a PUR filter for the past three years and recently it's been leaking all over the place. Honestly, I was going to replace it with the same brand, as I had an extra filter, but after doing some research online, I opted to go for the Culligan FM-15A. Why?1) It's cheaper. (Both the actual unit AND the replacement filters)2) While it doesn't have a filter indicator on it (LED or digital) like the PUR, I easily signed up for a filter "subscription" on Amazon. So, when I get my new filter every 2 months, I will change it. Easy reminder (though the filter comes with a "calendar sticker" as well.)3) It's smaller.4) It "turns off" when you turn off the faucet. When you run water and choose to use the filter, you pull a "plug" on the side. When you turn off the faucet/water flow, the plug automatically moves from "filter use" to "faucet use." Nice!Install was extremely easy. Note: If you can't get the faucet connection to "tighten" using your fingers, just rotate the entire filter unit to the right, hold the faucet connector with your fingers so it doesn't move, and rotate the filter back to the left. Kind of like using the filter itself as a wrench.
