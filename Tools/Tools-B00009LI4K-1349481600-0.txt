review/summary: Very effective protection & comfortablereview/text: Got these for yard work & the gun range. I tried these for 3 reasons 1st the 30 NRR (Noise Reduction Rating) near the highest, and I saw them on the show Sons of Guns where the staff use them, and I generally find 3M products very good. I found these very effective protection. Nice seal around the ears & comfortable on the top of the head. I have a larger hat size and have had problems with others not being able to fully seal around the ear lobes because of the head top foam protection. These have a material to protect the top of the head from the wire assembly, it's thin but more than adequate & a good tradeoff for the good seal around the ears. I highly recommend them.
