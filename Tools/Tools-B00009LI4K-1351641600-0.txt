review/summary: Great for use in a cube, using machinery or even on a plane.review/text: I bought these several years ago when I used to go pistol shooting at an indoor range, for which they worked perfectly. Since then I have also used them during flights, both on their own, then with normal earbuds underneath and then some in-ear "noise cancelling" earbuds, for which they also worked extremely well.*I work in a Dilbert style cube environment built into a 'modern' warehouse style building (no suspended ceiling) and these now reside by my desk for when I really want to cut out the HVAC noise and cacophony of coworkers who insist on shouting to each other, and concentrate on getting through the day.Finally, they were great when running the ShopVac in my echoing basement during Superstorm Sandy, allowing me to keep the sucking up the water on for extended periods without getting a headache!Highly recommended, comfortable aural protective equipment!* Yeah, it's not a Bose set up but then it's 1/10th the cost... :o)
