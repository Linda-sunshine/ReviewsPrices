review/summary: Seriouse safety issuereview/text: This is was a good idea but it has a major design flaw. To open it you have to really pull to get the &#34;legs apart&#34; but notice that one of the legs is an extremley sharp semi-serrated knife. Does anyone not see the issue this poses? If you want to use the can-opener your grabbing the knife blade as a handle... Seriously? If you buy this thing please be careful so as to not cut your fingers when you use this thing.
