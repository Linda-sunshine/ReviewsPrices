review/summary: Very cool, usefull at those random moments...review/text: Multiple screwdrivers, including a flat screwdriver, Phillips screwdriver, and micro-sized screwdriver works wonderfullyI haven't been able to use the bottle opener properly because it was a bit awkward. The knife assisted in, eye opening conversations etc. I keep this on my set of keys just in case :3
