review/summary: it's okayreview/text: We've had this trap in the past and it worked great, until my son dropped it in the toilet. I was so excited to get these and for the first few days they worked great, and then they quit. I have tried wiping the metal plates with a q-tip dipped in alcohol, changing the batteries and nothing has helped. While I have had good results in the past i'm not very happy with these. I have gone back to the nasty snap traps and they work great.
