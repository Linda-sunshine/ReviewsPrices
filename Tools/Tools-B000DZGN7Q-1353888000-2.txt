review/summary: Installationreview/text: After reading some negative reviews on installation and noise, I wondered about the Consumer Report rating and self-installation. I read and re-read installation instructions, took it apart and put it together a couple of times as a dry run. When I finally attempted it, it came together very easily/no problems. Noise seemed minimal to me; but then this is first disposal for me and it is mounted to heavy porcelain sink. Only rated it a 4 star because I need to run it a year or 2 trouble free before it warrants a 5 star.
