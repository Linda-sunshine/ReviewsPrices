review/summary: Solved the problem vwery wellreview/text: We needed a way to turn the fan near our woodstove off once the fire had died down. We put this termostat up on the wall by the fan and set the temp to match when the fire is out (for our needs-around 65 degrees) and it works great. Cuts down on electricity, and on pushing cold air around the house unecessarily in the winter.
