review/summary: Best lightreview/text: This light is to replace my daughters old reading light. It is perfect. The flexibility makes realign in bed (on her side usually) easy for her. The light is bright enough but not too bright. The cushioned clamp is perfect for her kindle and gentle on books. I have already recommended this light and would over and over again (especially for the price!)
