review/summary: Traps cockroaches, too!review/text: The bulb burnt out a few weeks in, most likely because I handled it roughly and have faulty outlets. However!! This magic light with sticky paper not inu kept my kitty happy while I was at work, because it was a warm, sunny glow, but it seemed to suck the fleas right out of my carpet and her fur! The bulbs are easy to replace, the sticky pads are cheap and work WONDERFULLY! I bought refills right away, because members of my family have ones in there houses :D
