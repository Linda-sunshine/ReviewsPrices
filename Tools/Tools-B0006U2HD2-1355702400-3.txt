review/summary: Wintersreview/text: Winter in North Dakota tends to be pretty cold. I bought this to operate my truck's battery pad heater and block heater. I've had problems with the truck not starting in temps below 20. Since I've started using this I've had no problems at all. Truck is kept inside and once temps inside drop below 20 this unit turns on. No problems so far!
