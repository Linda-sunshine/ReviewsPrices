review/summary: Excellent (Registration is Easy)review/text: Belkin is an excellent manufacturer, it works well with little light flicker when turning on devices. One of the best things about this product is that registration takes about 2 min on the Belkin website. Despite what others say it is really easy to register, you just have to create an account, then go to my products-register. Enter the type power- then surge protector-model number-and where purchased.Very easy registration, excellent quality, highly recommend.
