review/summary: Nice Lockreview/text: This unit installed quickly and works well. I am considering buying a second for the rear door. I used to get locked out of the house by other family members that didn't realize I was outside when they came through the door. Now I don't have to carry keys with me while walking the dog or visiting with neighbors. The lock looks nice and seems well built.
