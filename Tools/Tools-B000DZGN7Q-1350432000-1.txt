review/summary: Wow! Easy and Quick!review/text: Was ready to replace my Badger with another one - it lasted 10 years so not terribly unhappy about it. Then looked online at Consumer reports and saw the Wasteking rated much higher ( and much more $$) than the Badger. Just for giggles went to Amazon - and got this for $5 more than the Badger! Snap to install - did take about an hour - including removing the old one - and having to install an outlet under the sink as this comes with a plug/cord. Not a big deal - and I could have hard wired it - but why bother...just do it right :) It's been installed about a month now and runs like a champ.
