review/summary: fine but not quite as describedreview/text: The screen was easy to set up and keeps the bugs out for most of the part. But it does not close back automatically like description of the product suggested and some bugs crawl between the two screens to sneak inside. (i.e. screens do not shut tight). It is fine but not great.
