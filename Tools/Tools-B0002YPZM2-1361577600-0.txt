review/summary: XX ???review/text: Gloves are good and would be great IF they were XX as advertised. Granted, I have meat hooks for hands and puffy with arthritis but other xx gloves have always fit.I had to struggle to get them on. Once on, they were very tight. I cant return tham because I had to cut the card connecting them together. I am hoping they will stretch some.In my view, they are at best, a small x glove.That said, they seem like they would be good, sturdy stiching reinforced where it is needed. I would recommen them for pople with &#34;large&#34; hands but not X or XX
