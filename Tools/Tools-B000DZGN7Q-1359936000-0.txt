review/summary: So far so goodreview/text: Installed a few weeks ago and everything works great. It does make a fairly loud clicking sound when starting but instructions say that is normal and it's no big deal. Overall quieter than my old disposal. I previously had an InSinkerator disposal that was a little less expensive but it was less powerful and not stainless steel. My previous disposal lasted about 10 years (I live alone and don't use it that often). When I removed it it was rusted and clogged. This one feels like it will last longer.
