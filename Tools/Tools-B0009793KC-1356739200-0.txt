review/summary: Fits the fridge, but water still has same odd tastereview/text: This product does fit my fridge, but unfortunately, I noticed absolutely no difference in the taste of the water coming out of the fridge. Also, after I installed this product, it seemed like the water would never stop running from the dispenser the first time I activated the dispenser. I ended up with a bit of a pool of water in front of the fridge. I'm not sure if this has happened to anyone else, but just be aware that you might want to have a small bucket or a bunch of cups ready just in case the water dispenser doesn't turn off right away the first time you use it after replacing the water filter.I may have to try to slighly more expensive unit to see if that makes any difference on the taste of the water.
