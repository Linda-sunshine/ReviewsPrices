review/summary: Best Surge Protectorreview/text: I bought this when going off to college. I knew I'd have a lot of electronics that I'd be plugging in and wanted a durable and expansive surge protector. I didn't want to settle with one of those cheap $5 at the local store. This worked great. I am still using it to this day and have never had complaints with it. The design is great since it allows for power bricks yet has plenty of room for normal plugs. Belkin never disappoints.
