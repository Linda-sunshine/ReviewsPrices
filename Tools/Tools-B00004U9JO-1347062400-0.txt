review/summary: Another cracked housing complaint. Lasts just long enough to outlive the warrantyreview/text: Back in October 2002 our builder put a Badger 5 disposer in our new home. Today as I write this review my husband is replacing the Badger 5 for the third time. Three Badger 5 garbage disposals in less than ten years tells the story. Each disposer lasts just long enough to outlive it's warranty. After purchasing this third Badger 5 I stopped to read the Amazon reviews. I now wish I had read the reviews before buying this third disposer. It appears we are not alone in the housing cracking complaint. Let me warn all current Badger 5 homeowners that this time the disposer crack leaked enough water as to totally destroy the sink cabinet floor and sides of the cabinet. We had standing water over an inch deep when the leak was discovered. Now we have a major kitchen cabinet mess to fix not just replacing a dead garbage disposal. Would I recommend a Badger 5? Not knowing what I know today. If you purchase a Badger 5 expect to be replacing it every three years. Next time we switch to a different brand disposal even if that means calling in a plumber to install it.Let me also add that I found a product called Sink & Vanity Protector (Google it because sadly Amazon doesn't carry anything like this product). It is made to fit under the sink and protects your cabinet floor from water leak damage. I wish I had found this product BEFORE our leak. If you own a Badger 5 disposer you need this protection and I encourage you to buy one to prevent a mess like ours. Best tip is just don't buy this brand.
