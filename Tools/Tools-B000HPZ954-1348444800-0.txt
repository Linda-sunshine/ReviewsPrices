review/summary: Met all Expectationsreview/text: I purchased two of these to protect my computer as well as my TV and home theater. Designed very well with the plugs spread out for AC adapters. Have protected my electronics thus far, and that's all I could expect/ask for.I researched for a couple of days, and in my opinion, this is the best surge protector you can buy for the price. Comparable ones are in the $35 price range and this one costs half as much. If you go to the store, the only ones in this price range are the single power strip with 5-6 outlets that are difficult to use if you have multiple AC adapters.
