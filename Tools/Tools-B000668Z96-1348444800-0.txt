review/summary: I have been using this for 7+ yearsreview/text: I have had and used this off and on for about 7 years, I LOVE IT. It is not the end all be all it is only a tool to add to the whole arsenal needed to get rid of fleas. I use front-line but have still gotten fleas, from my neighbors maybe? Also every year buy nematodes (a microscopic bug? that eats the flea larvae) to sprinkle in the back yard. As well as comb my dogs often with a flea comb. I like that it is simple but most of all I really like that this product does not use chemicals. It works great it does take some time and could see a small child finding it interesting. But it only really needs to be on at night where you suspect you have fleas if you don't catch any in 48 hrs move it. It works because a flea only sees heat (the light) you can do the same thing with a nightlight and a pan of water. The flea jumps to the heat and lands in the dish of water if you want more add rubbing alcohol to the water.
