review/summary: Dont throw away those old knives!!!review/text: This item was purchaced on a whim as i decided to sharpen the old knifes before buying a new set. I was shocked to see how sharp my old chicago cutlery set became. They are by far sharper then they were out of the box originally, and they now serve my needs as they never have. This sharpener is the "cats meow" and when used properly will bring any old knife back to life. I would suggest that you only use the sharpener in one direction, as it seemed to leave a cleaner edge on my knifes. I am happy my "whim" led me to this purchace. It also works on serrated bread loaf knives, but takes patience, I would do several straight knives first to get the "feel" for the sharpener before moving on to the bread knife. Happy cutting!!
