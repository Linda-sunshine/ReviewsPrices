review/summary: Great little inexpensive battery tender.review/text: I have a large battery charger but this little thing actually does a better job. If the battery is quite low it takes many hours to recharge it but once charged it won't overcharge. I use it on our boat and two personal watercraft. I'd like to have one for each of those and may buy a couple more to do just that. I leave the battery tender on the boat battery all winter long.
