review/summary: This + Sanyo batteries = long lasting multi-use portable lampreview/text: I use it for reading obviously, on hardcovers, paperbacks, and my kindle touch. On the kindle touch, I have it on the top left where I can grip the clamp with my thumb, making the kindle just a little more ergonomically friendly. It also helps to pin back my kindle leather cover which otherwise flaps around.
