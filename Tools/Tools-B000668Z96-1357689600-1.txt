review/summary: This kicks butt!!!review/text: Was extremely dubious about this product, but I gotta tell you, it kicks serious flea butt. We recently adopted a shelter kitty and in addition to an adorable new member to our family, we received a pretty good dose of flea friends that came along. Combing and spot treatment were helping of course, but drawing these pests out of the carpet was another story. I bought one of these traps; and yes, the construction does seem a little cheesy, but if the product works-- who cares? I put this down and caught only two fleas during the 1st couple of hours or so-- underwhelmed to be sure. Turned off the bedroom light, leaving only the trap light on; then went to bed. Next morning, got up went into kitty's room and Wow!! It just keeps getting better-- more and more of those little buggers are meeting their nasty parasite end in my "new best friend" :) I'm gonna get two more to put in my other carpeted rooms in the house, I'm very impressed with the product.
