review/summary: Great Value For the Features and Pricereview/text: If you're searching for a showerhead that effectively filters water and is under $35, this is the one for you. The showerhead is easy to install, and the replacement filter (sold separately) is also a pinch to pop in and out. The showerhead has different settings on the main unit and the secondary showerhead. The chrome finish looks nice and is easy to clean (a damp cloth to remove water spots).Overall, this is a good value for the product features and price. If you want a filtered showerhead with a few more features than the basic, this is your answer.
