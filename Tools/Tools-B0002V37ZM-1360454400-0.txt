review/summary: Works, But Tricky To Usereview/text: I had one of these already installed in an apartment I moved into. I was initially happy to see it, helpful to use for extra storage. However, I had thought 3 of the 'joints' were already broken; the loose balls that would grip the handle were jammed into the main unit, and would not slide down to grab the handles. I recently figured out how to fix it, by simply working at the rubber ring that had come loose and get the ball joint out again, then replacing the rubber ring into the slot it belonged in. Not sure how often this will happen, but now that I know it can be fixed, it's not a big deal. It WOULD be nice if it had the ability for short, wider handles.
