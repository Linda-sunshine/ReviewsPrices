review/summary: Swiss+Tech Utili-Key 6-in-1 Keychain Multi-Toolreview/text: The Swiss+Tech Utili-Key 6-in-1 Keychain Multi-Tool easily goes onto a key ring and is ready when needed in a pinch. It doesn't add any bulk to the key chain and it's a handy item to use. I've used the screwdriver on kids toys, especially some of those battery compartments with that little screw... The bottle opener has been used several times and works without fail too. All in all it's a nice compact item to have on a key chain.
