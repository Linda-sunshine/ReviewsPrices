review/summary: Does not fully work as recommended with dimplex electric stovereview/text: I would have rated it excellent, but I ordered it for the dimplex CS1205 electric fireplace stove(no built in thermostat included) in order to control the temperature. It was recommended by Amazon that I purchase this with the stove. It works great, however when it shuts off the heater at my set temperature, it also shuts off the flame. This should be mentioned in the recommendation because it does not work like other electric stoves with a built in thermostat that leave the flame on for ambiance.
