review/summary: WOW - this thing is quiet - Much better than the badger 5 that lasted 12 yearsreview/text: I replaced a InSinkErator Badger 5 that was 12 years old and all rusted out with this one. The old one was way too loud and kept getting jammed up. This one is so quiet I first thought there was a problem with it, but then I realized it was just that quiet. The install went pretty smooth, the hardest part is geting the wires connected up, the wires from the switch on mine were super heavy duty gauge and were a bitch to manipulate through the hole and get connected. The drain pipe on mine needed to be trimmed down slightly to fit since this one is a little fatter I guess. Once I got everything installed it worked like a charm. I love it. I'm looking for stuff to grind up now. I hope this one lasts as long or longer than the last one that was the el-cheapo model
