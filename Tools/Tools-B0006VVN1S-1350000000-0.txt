review/summary: Nice shower head.review/text: This is a nice idea - combining a shower head and a replaceable filter. Using a separate filter and shower head put the shower head too low for me to comfortably shower. This head solves that problem. It also offers a nice selection of spray options. I especially like the brisk massage setting. When selecting the spray settings, there is a definite feel of the selector clicking into place. But it is not so stiff - you can easily change the settings with wet hands. Adjusting the position of the head is easy, but stiff enough that it stays in the position you put it in.Installation is easy. It is just a matter of removing the old shower head, removing the old tape, putting on new tape, and screwing this one on. They even include the Teflon tape. Changing the filter is also easy, and does not require any tools. The shower head is nicely designed with griping surfaces to aid in unscrewing the head to replace the filter. The filter is a standard Culligan filter, so finding a replacement should not be a problem.
