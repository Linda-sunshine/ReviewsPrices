review/summary: It works! Unlike its predecessor....review/text: I use these in my work. My clients need surge suppressor strips to protect their electronic phones. I do NOT recommend this 12 outlet strip in most homes, unless the homeowner understands you can't use all 12 outlets at the same time! But for parking your equipment in waiting, ready to use one at a time, this is great.I know we're supposed to unplug our transformer devices, but who does that?! I do, however plug everything but the cordless phone into this outlet, and then unplug the strip when leaving the house for an extended time. I've long used a less comprehensive strip for my computer and printer, etc. and unplugged that when not in use for long periods. Why unplug? Because that way lighning strikes can't hit the equipment through the power outlets. I live in hurricane alley. This is necessary.This is one outlet that allows plenty of room for those big boxy transformers. The middle strip is fine for small, standard plugs. On the negative side, there is little room for using that middle straight strip when you have the big boxy plugs in use. They crowd space a bit. And have you noticed. the smaller the device, the bigger the transformer?
