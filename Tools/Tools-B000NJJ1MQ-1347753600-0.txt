review/summary: Quality Safety lock with keypadreview/text: Easy install once I got a locksmith to change key to match rest of house. Installation is easy. One minor problem issue was the unmatched screw used to hold interior cover. Just throw it away; the two matching screws to use are in the parts kit. Had to reach a supervisor to explain why I could not find matching screw; the single screw used to hold parts in box has no matching screw to find. She apologized and said she gets the same confused call many times a week...
