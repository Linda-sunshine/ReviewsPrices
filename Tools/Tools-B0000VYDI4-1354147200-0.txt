review/summary: One ladder to do it all!review/text: The Werner MT-22 is a great ladder, and the only one you'll ever need! It's easy to configure to whatever style and/or length you need. The wide feet add to the stability.It breaks down easily into two scaffold supports as well, but I didn't buy it for that. I need a ladder to get on the roof, hang a picture, or trim some tree limbs. This one is perfect for that. No need for two ladders now!It is well built and beefy. The only downside is that it is heavier than a typical step ladder, but not too bad due to the aluminum construction.
