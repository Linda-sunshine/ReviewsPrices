review/summary: works like it should.review/text: i keep my livestock meds in the well house in the summer. cool in the summer but too cold in winter. i normally use a heat lamp in the winter to keep water fittings from freezing even though it is insulated. with this device i save energy and can keep meds at prescribed storage temps as well. worth the money
