review/summary: I've owned several of these sets - I like this one the bestreview/text: I'll compare this set to theMaxtech 16521MX 32-Piece Precision Bit Setwhich I bought a couple years ago. That set was OK, not great, and I became even less satisfied with it over time. The bits, I think mostly because of their "shiny coating" didn't seen to grip well and the smallest slotted bits were to thick to fit in screws where they should.I finally got fed up and bought this one. I like it a lot better. Here's why:- This set does have two less bits but the 30 it does have work a lot better.- This set doesn't have the "extension". However, I never used it in two years and it was mostly an inconvenience to have to attach it every time I took the diver from its box.- This set has a more convenient case; it keeps the bits organized and allows me to remove a bit easily with one hand.
