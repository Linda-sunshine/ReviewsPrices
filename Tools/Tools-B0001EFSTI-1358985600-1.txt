review/summary: It is so handyreview/text: I loved my swiss multi key. It fits on my keyring, so I know whenever I need a useful tool -it is right there at hand. It can tighten up the screw on my glasses arm, open a bottle, cut the tags on parcels, cut cardboard on a package. So very useful- I even gave them out as Christmas gifts to people who have everything- they didn't have this, but they do now.
