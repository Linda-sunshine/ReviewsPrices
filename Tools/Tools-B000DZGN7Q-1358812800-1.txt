review/summary: ...made in Chinareview/text: Ordered this to replace my 7-year old 1/2 hp Insinkerator. One of the reasons (not the major reason) I bought this is one of the other Amazon reviews said that this was made in the US, and I was feeling patriotic, so it influenced my decision. Well, right on the outside of the box (and the WK label) it clearly states made in China. Although Anaheim Manufacturing may be a US company, like many, it imports and distributes the products that are made overseas.The WK was about twice the size and half the weight of my old unit. It was quite apparent that the WK makes significant use of plastic, whereas my older unit was more metal. Specifically, the entire housing is plastic, as is the drain kit. I don't know if this is a difference in models or the fact that my Insinkerator was made a few years ago. I kept the WK as it would have been expensive to return. Installation was pretty straightforward once I figured out the complex instructions. They basically give multiple methods of installation for multiple models, but don't tell you the sections that are irrelevant. The only snafu was that the instructions called out using plumber's putty to rim the sink drain, and the putty says not to use on plastic. Turns out that's only because it could discolor it. Just be careful and keep it away from the visible plastic. Operation is good - large pieces of food go in, and then are gone. I assume they're getting chopped into smaller pieces before going down the drain. Noise is about the same as my older unit. I did notice that when I turn it on, the torque is so great that the disposal twists a bit and moves the drain pipes. I hope it doesn't fatigue them or loosen the threaded connections over time.
