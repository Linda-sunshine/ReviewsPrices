review/summary: It really works!review/text: Im so happy I took a chance on this thing. Its so much easier than the old manual mouse traps or the glue traps. You dont actually have to see the dead mouse until you empty the trap but I have the hubby take care of that part. I literally caught a mouse a few hours after I put the trap out. I get better results when I change the bait regularly. Everytime I put fresh peanut butter in the trap, I catch a mouse within hours!! Its like they cant resist. I plan on buying two more to put in other rooms in the house. I would definitely recommend this item.
