review/summary: Amazing knife sharpenerreview/text: I&#8217;m a stickler for keeping my knives razor sharp so I did a lot of research before buying this sharpener as a gift. It is amazing! It sharpened some incredibly dull knives - one of which even had several nicks in the blade. It took some time and effort but I was able to smooth out the nicks and put a decent edge on the blade. It feels a little awkward at first because the blade is held upside down on the counter or cutting board and the sharpener is drawn over it but I soon got used to it. One word of warning - don't try to sharpen a dirty or wet knife. You might ruin the abrasive sharpening surface. I had another sharpener similar to this and someone ruined it by sharpening a wet knife. It lost all its abrasiveness.
