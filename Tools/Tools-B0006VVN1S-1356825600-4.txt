review/summary: So far so good!review/text: Ordered this shower head 3 days ago and got it today. I love Amazon's quick delivery. This shower head came packaged nicely and was in brand new condition as stated in the product details. It was a very quick and easy installation process too. I used it for the first time today and I could tell an immediate difference in my skin. Before we installed the shower head my skin would have that tight dry feeling shortly after getting out of the shower, but not today! I have very fair and sensitive skin and for me to feel that it's already made a difference is pretty good. The water pressure is also great, and the shower head itself looks very nice. Overall, I'm very satisfied thus far. I would recommend this product if you have sensitive hair and or skin.
