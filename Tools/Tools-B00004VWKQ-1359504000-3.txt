review/summary: So easy, it's scaryreview/text: The AccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpener is by far the easiest and fastest way to put a super sharp edge on any knive. I sharpened a ten piece set of Wustoff knives in less than fifteen minutes and ten Gerber steak knives in another 5 minutes. The carbide sharpening blades quickly remove a small portion of the knife edge and put it to the correct angle in seconds. Sharpening takes only a few LIGHT passes. The directions on the package are very good and the company has a video link on their own web page. This is the third one that I have purchased. The other two were gifts. No tackle box is complete without one. I will probably keep one in my car for times when I am away from home. It will come in handy when helping out in the kitchen in a friend's house and having to use a dangerous, dull knife. I'll just leave it behind and buy another. I have a wonderful set of diamond sharpening stones that can put a finely honed edge on any knife. I may use them to polish the edge of an Accusharp sharpened blade. Then again, that may be just a waste of time.NOTE: In all fairness to those that believe that using progressive sharpening stones and a leather belt to hone a perfect edge, they are right. I ended up smoothing out the edge of the knives that I sharpened with the Accusharp with a fine diamond stone and also a few passes with a diamond sharpening steel. My knives now have a better, smoother edge than with the Accusharp alone. The Accusharp puts a great cutting edge on the knife and your blade will be very sharp. It just isn't a pretty edge for anyone that cares. Sharp is what most people want and the Accusharp delivers.
