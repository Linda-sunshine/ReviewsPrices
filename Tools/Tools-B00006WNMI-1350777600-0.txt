review/summary: Pretty Much What I Expectedreview/text: I bought this to install in two of my bathrooms for things like cleaning my toothbrush, electric shavers, and even just my hands. I wanted something to filter out that white residue that always builds up and I'm pretty sure this is doing the trick. Was always running to the kitchen before but now this is much more convenient. Some folks said it was difficult to install but I had two of these up and running in about 20 minutes (10 minutes each and that includes the 5 or so minutes of letting the water run to clean out the filter). I deducted one star because I thought the flow pressure could be better.
