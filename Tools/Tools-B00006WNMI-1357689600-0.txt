review/summary: Great Filterreview/text: After reading about the downturn in quality of Brita and Pur faucet filters and reading that the Culligan FM-15A filter was highly rated by Consumer Reports, I decided to purchase one. I'm very happy that I did. It totally got rid of the chlorine smell and the water is absolutely crystal clear. It was very easy to install and the quality is what you would expect from a Culligan product. The price is great as well. The only thing that could be better is the flow rate, but that is because my water pressure is not at the typical 60 psi like most municipal water supplies. I'm sure that the flow rate would be much higher if it was. With the lower pressure it takes about four and a half minutes to fill a gallon container, but since it filters that water so well, it is worth the time. Much, MUCH cheaper than buying bottled water and you don't have to return all of those empty bottles to get your deposit back. I purchased the filter because I got a Keurig for Christmas and it recommends using bottled or filtered water.I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting clean, great tasting water.
