review/summary: Awesome product!!!review/text: This is a great buy. I was skeptical because of the price but was very surprised at the quality. I purchased this to charge the led gel-cel in my airplane. I like how it charges for approximately 15 minutes, disconnects and meters the level and either goes back to charging or turns off for a while. This is how the really expensive airplane certified chargers work. I saved a lot of money.Eric
