review/summary: Old School Zapper!review/text: This is the King of bug zappers. I have tried other brands that discount retailers sell (WM) and this brand is the old school zapper I remember as a kid that would always give a great zap and sometimes a great light show. It really attracts mosquitoes and moths. Every once and awhile a stupid horse fly will fall victim to the lovely light as well. Good product, have had for two years and never replaced the bulb but plan on buying a replacement just in case. Nice to see Amazon carries this great product.
