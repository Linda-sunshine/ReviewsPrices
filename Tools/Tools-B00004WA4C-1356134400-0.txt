review/summary: Great Servicereview/text: I have been very pleased with the three of these that I bought but one of them started beeping every 30 seconds or so. I tried thee sets of batteries but after about 15 minutes, the beeping would start again. I called Kidde and after asking a few questions and having me try a few things, the customer service rep said that they would replace it and it should arrive with a week to ten days. I had it within that time and it works perfectly, I am very pleased with Kidde products and customer service.
