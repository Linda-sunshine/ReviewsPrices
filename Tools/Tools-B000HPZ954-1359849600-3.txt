review/summary: Does what it's supposed toreview/text: Arrived quickly, does what it's supposed to, my only complaint is that the cord is closer to 7' than 8' and since there are very few outlets in my apartment I was hoping for the full 8 feet. Other than that issue, it works well, has plenty of outlets and the cord holders are handy to keep the cords out of the way.
