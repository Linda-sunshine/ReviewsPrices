review/summary: Overpriced replayment partreview/text: I purchased this item late 2011. The plastic tip that connects the air hose to the tire snapped while I was trying to add air to my tire. This was during an extremely cold day in winter. I tried to replace the part, but BlackandDecker wants $8.00+ for the part, and $10.00+ to ship it by standard mail. $20.00 to replace a part the is cheaply made. If you live in a cold area, I would advise you the purchase another type of unit that has a brass connector.
