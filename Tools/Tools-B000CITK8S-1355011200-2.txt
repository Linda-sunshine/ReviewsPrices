review/summary: GET CHARGED UP AND SAVE MONEYreview/text: For 30 years, I have been fighting with dead batteries on seasonal vehicles like ATVs, mowers, tractors and emergency generators. In spite of my best efforts, I always managed to miss at least one battery when making my charging rounds every month or so.Batteries can be stubborn. They only turn up dead when you need them the most.A life span of 12 months for a 12V lawn and garden battery was acceptable. After all, the warranty is only 3 months.Some motorcycle and ATV batteries cost as much as a car battery and 12 months was about the best I could hope for.About 4 years ago, I began using the Battery Tenders on all of my seasonal and special use batteries. My 12V lawn and garden and ATV batteries are lasting between 3 and 4 years now.The big 12V, 72-month generator battery might last forever. It went out of warranty in 2010.Lawn & garden batteries cost about the same as the Battery Tender Junior which means that I'm saving about $48.00 every 3 years on each piece of equipment that uses such a battery.If I'd been using Battery Tenders on my ATVs for the past 30 years, I could have retired much earlier.
