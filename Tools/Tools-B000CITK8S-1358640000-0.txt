review/summary: Lasting battery tenderreview/text: I use this on my r1 during the cold days in winter or when ever i put the bike in to storage. Still working till now and this includes a spare wire to place a dis-connectable connector from your battery to the battery tender (which can be routed from your battery to your backseat compartment) Highly recommended.
