review/summary: Battery Tender Juniorreview/text: The battery tender was very easy to install for permanent hookup to the battery, and so far after a few weeks of use, appears to be working perfectly. I used one of these in the past on my motor scooter and it was excellent. This one I am using on my riding mower.
