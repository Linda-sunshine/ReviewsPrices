review/summary: Way more quiet than expectedreview/text: Bought this to replace the junk Badger 1, as installed by builders everywhere. The Evolution is very quiet, and attached to the same sink connector as the previous Badger (circa 2010). The electrical cord was also reusable. Grinds quickly and quietly. Can't yet say how long lasting it will be. One minor negative compared to the Badger 1, it does not seem to pull water/food down the sink hole with the same vigor. You have to push more stuff down the sink hole. Mine came with tail fittings for connecting to a dual sink waste trap, or for a single sink waste trap. The splash guard also detaches for easy cleaning. I think that *maybe* this splash guard is not as flexible as the old non-detachable one, and perhaps this is why waste food needs a push to get it down.
