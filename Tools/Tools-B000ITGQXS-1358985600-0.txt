review/summary: Works extremely well!review/text: I live in a dorm with a roommate, and have been looking for a light that is bright enough to read and get ready for bed by, but not so bright that it keeps her away. This light works better than I had hoped for! After reading reviews about how bright it is, I was a little nervous that it would disturb my roommate. I decided to purchase it anyway, because I tend to need a good amount of light in order to read. I was pleasantly surprised when I turned this on. It glows like a mini spotlight! The more you lift the lamp in the air, the bigger its cast is, thus the brighter it shines. This is great for when I need a lot of light, and I discovered that bending the light close to its base and pointing down greatly reduces the light. It's bright when I need it to be, and subtle when I only need a little light.
