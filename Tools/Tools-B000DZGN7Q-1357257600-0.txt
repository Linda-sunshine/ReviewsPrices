review/summary: Installed easily, seems to be working well, but...review/text: When I turn it on, there's a sort of super quick &#34;grind/chink&#34; sound. Never heard this before on a garbage disposal but also never had a Waste King before. I wish the dishwasher inlet and power cord could be relocatable in some way because not everyone has their dishwasher on the right side of their sink. It seems to power through food well. It's the quietest disposal I've ever used. For the initial test (for leaks and what not), when the unit was on, I poured nearly a gallon of expired milk (was on vacation) down the drain and it seemed to bog down a bit with all of the liquid running through it. Haven't had any problems with food, though, and it crunches through ice without any issues. No leaks from the unit or my plumbing work, so all is well.
