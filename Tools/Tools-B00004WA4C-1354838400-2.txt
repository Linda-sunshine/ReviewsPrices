review/summary: Safe so farreview/text: I love these combo alarms. I have vent-free natural gas heaters that heat my entire home, so carbon monoxide detectors are a must. However, my home is very large & very old, & electrical outlets are hard to come by. In the past, we always used the carbon monoxide alarms that you had to plug into the wall, & they are an eyesore. Large box shape with a long cord, impossible to hide. And then on top of that, we had to have regular smoke alarms all over the house as well. This product is great. Half the amount of alarms hanging all over the house. We haven't had a smoke or carbon monoxide scare yet thankfully, so no word as to how they perform in an emergency yet. They test just fine when you push the button though. I have 5 so far in my home. Plan to buy 3 more.
