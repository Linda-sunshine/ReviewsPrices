review/summary: Doesn't leak, annoying to replacereview/text: I have tried other faucet filters (Brita) that leaked, so I really appreciated the metal-on-metal attachment which is sturdy and doesn't leak. HOWEVER, every time I had to replace the filter, it was a bit production as it would get thoroughly stuck in the housing. It was such a pain that I finally threw the whole thing in the trash. Back to a filter container in the fridge.
