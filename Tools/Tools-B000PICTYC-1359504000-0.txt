review/summary: Stevereview/text: Oh, my gosh. When this tomahawk arrived I was so happy to go outside and use it on some unlucky trees. It's sharper than a razor blade but can dull if not kept attention to. I use a rough rock to sharpen it when needed. I named him Steve and he will help me build a home in the summer.I love Steve.
