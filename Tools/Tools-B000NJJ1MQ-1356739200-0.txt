review/summary: Great for those who like to carry everything from car in one load...review/text: I got this in satin nickel. It looks good, its easy to install. Instructions are easy to follow. I've had it over a year and the batteries have not run out. When my roommate moved out, I didn't have to get new keys. The price is good. I can't find anything wrong with it.My favorite part is that For some reason I just hate making two trips to unload my groceries. I always wind up completely overloaded, fumbling around for keys with my arms overloaded is a pain and having to put down the groceries, defeats the purpose. Now, I can just press a few buttons and turn the knob. Love that.
