review/summary: Works Great.review/text: I was able to install the filter on my laundry room faucet in about 10 seconds. And after 10 minutes of letting the water run through the filter - I had a glass of great water. The water in my town tastes awful and so I have been buying drinking water which is an unnecessary expense. I feel good about this purchase.
