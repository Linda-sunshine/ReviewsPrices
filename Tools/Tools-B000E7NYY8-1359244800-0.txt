review/summary: Great concept, and it works.review/text: The bottom line for me is that the thermostat is a great idea and it works well. You can program it just like you do for a programmable thermostat used for central heating. I recommend it. However it has a few small issues that may or may not be problems for you.Issue 1: It displays both time and temperature, which is good. However mine is plugged in a wall outlet only several inches above the floor, so I have to get down on my knees to read it, and I have to use a flashlight to read them when the room is not bright enough. Their display is an LCD. However, now that I have determined it is working to my satisfaction I don't read it very often. If it is convenient, you can unplug it to read it. It holds its programming when unplugged.Issue 2: It doesn't have a convenient override switch. It would be nice to be able to press an ON button for temporary heating then press it OFF when done. You can achieve this by opening the cover and pressing the up/down arrow to temporarily set it higher/lower, but I have to be on my knees to read the setting values. There is also a HOLD button to hold an override setting.Issue 3: You don't need a heater with its own thermostat (obviously), so it costs more than many heaters you may use with it.
