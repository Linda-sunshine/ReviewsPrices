review/summary: Quiet and fairly easy to installreview/text: Just received and installed yesterday. The installation was moderately easy, the directions were not the best including the fact that there was a plug in the dishwasher drain opening that they failed to tell you to remove! Luckily we noticed the undrained water in the bottom of the dishwasher and looked into the cause before it became a disaster. Otherwise it is quiet and holds a ton of food. I think it is built to last many years... hopefully.
