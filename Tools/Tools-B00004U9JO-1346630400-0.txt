review/summary: Piece of Cake to Installreview/text: My old Badger 1 broke down; the metal bit that "threw" the food on the top plate came loose. Per badger support, it was a single piece so couldn't be fixed.Purchased the Badger 5 and it installed easily on the former mounting. Took less than an hour; biggest problem was just dealing with the existing water in the drain (yuck; make sure you have a bucket underneath).Have been using it for a couple months now and it works great. Based on the price of the 5 vs. the 1 on Amazon, it's well worth the upgrade for the extra horsepower. It is only a pound or so heavier.
