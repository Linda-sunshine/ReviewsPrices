review/summary: Not your Father's Mag-Litereview/text: I've got many flashlights include Pelican 7060, small Streamlites, Duracell, Mag, and this is a HUGE improvement over the old Mag's and much, much brighter than their LED upgrade bulb or even the LED of a few years ago from Mag. Biggest complaint is that the adjustable beam will not provide a super smooth light when opened up to the wider settings, you'll get some gaps in the center, etc. The Pelican 7060 has the best combination of smooth coverage and very bright (rated 160 lumens) but is very expensive and does not have an adjustable beam, this new Mag (3D model) beats the Pelican by a small amount in terms of brightness when focused to the narrowest beam. The almost comparably-priced Duracell Daylite C-size is rated at 160 lumens (overrated), does not come close to this Mag (or Pelican) in terms of brightness, but they have achieved better optics which creates a smoother blend of light when going from narrow to wide, it can create a smooth, wide beam. If Mag were to improve the optics/reflector so a smooth, wide beam could be achieved, they would not have the ideal flashlight. Overall good value, for a well-built, very bright flashlight.
