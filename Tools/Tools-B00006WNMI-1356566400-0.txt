review/summary: Stood up to chemical testsreview/text: I purchased this filter for home use, as we were buying and recycling cases of store bought bottles each month. I also bought it to help my son out with his college-level science project for his environmental science class. He tested and compared our (NY) tap water with our Culligan filtered tap water, a store brand bottle water and 5 different "name" brands of bottled water. Without going into the scientific test results, know that the filter removed all the things from our tap water that we wouldn't want there. Comparing remaining contents and Ph levels found that the filtered tap water was comparable to "Fiji" brand bottled water. Not as part of the science project, we did a blind taste test among our family members. The taste test was inconclusive as no one picked the filtered water as their first choice nor their last choice. But we all find the water palatable. After the test, I bought another filter for my parents.
