review/summary: Handsome, well constructed lock setreview/text: I purchased my lock set from Amazon. Installation of the lock set was not difficult. Make sure you understand and follow each step as described in the photos. Excellent customer assistance is readily available on a toll-free number. It is a rather handsome lock set and very well constructed at Class 2 security. It was very easy & quick to program new codes. Two codes are supplied. You can have up to 19 codes so a temporary code can be given to specific individuals and can then be deleted if desired. The 9 volt battery is supposed to last for 3 years or more. The handles can easily be adjusted to either a left or right hand door opening. Make sure the latch is mounted in the correct direction for your door. The digital keypad is illuminated when operating which is great when operating at night. There is a lifetime warranty on the mechanical & finish on the lock set. The electronics is warranted for one year. The lock set can also be operated with the supplied key (2). So far I am very happy with this purchase and I highly recommend the product.,
