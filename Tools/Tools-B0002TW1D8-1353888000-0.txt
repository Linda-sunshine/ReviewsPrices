review/summary: nice to have for your electric drill.review/text: I bought these because I thought it would be nice to be a will to attach it to my electric drill and use my socket set that way. It does come in handy to use in some instances. The product seems very strong and I haven't felt like I was going to break anything any time. I would recommend this to anyone.
