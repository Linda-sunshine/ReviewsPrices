review/summary: Excellent Lock for my Garage Doorreview/text: This lock was easy to install and easy to program. I like the fact that you can add and delete codes for temporary house guests or workers to have access and then delete them. It is much easier than fumbling for a key to get into the garage and it works reliably. Just a turn of the inside knob unlocks and locks the door handle for easy passthru if you are home and are working outdoors. I don't know why it took me so long to buy one.
