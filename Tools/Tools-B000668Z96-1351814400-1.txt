review/summary: worked well for 2 daysreview/text: This was wonderful for the first two days, then the lightbulb died. I know I can get a replacement bulb, but I was hoping for more than 48 hours of activity before having to go shopping again. In the first two days, however, it was very effective, with fleas happily throwing themselves into the volcano of sticky death.
