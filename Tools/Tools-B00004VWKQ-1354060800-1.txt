review/summary: get one soonreview/text: be it any knife, branded or local.. it needs sharpening. this is a very handy and affordable sharpening tool. it gives the basic sharp edge. had to use to sharpen the famous wusthoff knives which was a disappointment out of the box. thank god that i gave one this as well along with the knife set to my friend. it makes it complete.
