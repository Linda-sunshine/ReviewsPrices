review/summary: Dose not lastreview/text: I have only had this shower filter for two months and it is already out. The filter inside in small so fits in their very loose. Not like others were the filter is the size of the entire unit inside. It says it is suppose to last for 6 months and didn't. Started again with itchy skin and dry hair it worked for the 1st two months and that was it. Will be looking for a new shower filter. Buying a new shower filter every 2 months is two much to spend it need to really last at least 6 months.
