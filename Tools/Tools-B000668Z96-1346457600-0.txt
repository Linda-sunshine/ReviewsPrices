review/summary: Worked better than my $200 exterminatorreview/text: We don't have pets, but after coming home from a summer vacation, our living room was bombarded with fleas. My wife got over a 100 bites in her foot and ankle areas, and my poor 2 yr old was getting about 6-10 bites a night. I bombed all the rooms in my home, with no luck. I called a $200 exterminator, no luck. He came back to retreat 2 more times, no luck. I purchased these traps, and within 3 nights, I killed 24 fleas in just the living room trap alone.I used this in conjuction with some flea powder treatment for my carpet and I finally think my home is in the clear.The bulbs do seem to burn out quickly, but they are cheap at home depot.EDIT 9/10: Well, after two weeks of being flea flee, my wife and son both got some more bites. I plugged one of these units on each end of my sofa, and just overnight, another 4-5 fleas were killed. If these traps need to be a permanent fixture to my living room, sobeit if that is what it takes for my family to be flea free.
