review/summary: Very happy with thisreview/text: Got this for the deer butchering knives. I ended up getting a second one for the kitchen knives and my pocket knives and just about any knife anyone brings over. I have an electric knife sharpener but it scuffs the sides of the knives and this one does not.It probably is not getting each knife razor sharp. However, they are sharp enough and this couldn't be easier. It also doesn't take much metal off so they prolongs the life of each knife. It also works very well with small knives and my electric knife sharpener does not.Really, at this price it deserves 10 stars. Made in USA too.
