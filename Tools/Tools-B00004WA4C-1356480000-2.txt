review/summary: Arrived with factory defectreview/text: This product was ordered to replace an identical make and model that gave up the ghost after 7 years. When it arrived, the base would not twist off of the smoke alarm. Finally had to force it off. There was no getting the alarm back onto the base that came with it, so I would have been in big trouble if I didn't have the non-defective base from the previous alarm to use.
