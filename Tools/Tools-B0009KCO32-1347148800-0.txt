review/summary: Good screen.review/text: I ordered this screen for a summer cabin to help solve a ventilation problem. It arrived very quickly. It was a good choice because the bar that holds the screen at the top of the door is easy to install and adjust. It's exactly as described, with the magnets holding the panels closed. In the end, I solved my ventilation problem by tackling the lack of ventilation in the attic and decided I didn't need this. Smarthome was good enough to accept the return even though I was late in contacting them. I'd do business with them again.
