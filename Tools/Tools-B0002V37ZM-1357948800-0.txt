review/summary: It's alrightreview/text: This is a pretty good idea, but the pegs are too close to each other. If you have blucky brooms or shovels or other items than its a little hard to keep them all seperate. Also, it doesn't hold that much weight before you're worried that its going to fall. But other than that not a bad idea and/or tool.
