review/summary: Excellent!review/text: These were some of the best earmuffs I have ever used! I am an avid shooter and when I am at the range, I have no worry from ear damage as these muffle sound from even the biggest of calibers (30.06, .300 WIN MAG, .50 AE, etc.) I would definitely recommend these to anybody looking for a great pair of earmuffs!
