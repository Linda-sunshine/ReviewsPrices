review/summary: Works well on our Craftsman garage door openerreview/text: We needed an additional garage door opener remote and this seemed to fit the bill. It is simple and straightforward. It has only a single button and a metal clip on the back for attaching to your sun visor of your car. Transmit range is good and it can be used for programming the home link transmitter in your car.
