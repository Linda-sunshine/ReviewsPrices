review/summary: Whoever designed this has a problemreview/text: The power cord is ridiculously short, so the unit must be used with an extension cord unless you are just inflating a football on your workbench. Confusing and inconveniently placed switches. Unit has a tendency to shut off or blow fuses if You connect and push buttons in the wrong sequence. I like the feature to set a pressure then have it shut off automatically. Noisy but it does do the job.
