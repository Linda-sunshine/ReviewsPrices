review/summary: I like it for the piece of mind. AA's provided lasted 103 days.review/text: I enjoy the piece of mind of both the smoke alarm and the carbon monoxide detector along with the verbal warnings. The cheap looking AA's provided in the original box lasted 103 days. They just stopped working last night...the morning after Christmas at 2:30am. I just knew it would "pick" an odd hour to let me know the batteries were dying. It just started beeping, but it was beeping about every 30 seconds it seemed like. I didn't count the frequency. I just found a chair, pulled it off the wall, yanked out the batteries, and went back to bed. Good thing I didn't install it where I needed a ladder. That would have been fun at 2:30am. I'm anxious to see how long lithium AA's last. That should lengthen the replacement intervals.I'll try to comment back on this once my next set of batteries run out.
