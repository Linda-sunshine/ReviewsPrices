review/summary: Good dealreview/text: This is worthy of 4 stars and I'll save 5 stars for something more than a light, but that being said, this is a nice little task light and I appreciate the wide beam on it. I tend to use it for late night reading and it is just what I needed. I like the fact that it can stand alone as well. A fair price for what you get.
