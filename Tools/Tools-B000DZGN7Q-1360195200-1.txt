review/summary: TOO MASSIVE FOR A NORMAL SINK!review/text: Ordered the unit in November and finally got the plumber out for the install in late January. He had renovations being done all the while so there was a reason for the wait. This unit is the largest garbage disposal I have ever seen in my life. If it were installed, it would have a 1-inch gap between the bottom of the disposal and the bottom of the kitchen cabinet under the sink. What's worse? Since the unit is so large, you will absolutely have to re-route your plumbing. If I had mine installed it was going to cost another $400-500 in plumbing to correctly hook it up. This unit should only be used in extra tall cabinets and commercial applications.
