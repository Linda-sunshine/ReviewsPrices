review/summary: Works great for my snake enclosurereview/text: I've been using the Lux WIN100 for at least 5 years now non stop, and it's awesome. I actually cut the sensor wire and extended it about 4 feet. This way the sensor is inside the enclosure, while the unit is outside and on top of the enclosure. I'm using it with a 250 watt heat lamp. The unit is very accurate, and simply always works. It has met and exceeded my expectations.
