review/summary: Not the greatestreview/text: I ordered this product during a heavy infestation in my house. I hoped that using this, along with treating my animals, vaccuming daily, and having the pest control people spray, that the problem would be solved. That was three months ago. I am still seeing fleas. My children are being bitten. And the trap has not caught one single flea.
