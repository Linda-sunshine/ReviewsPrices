review/summary: perfect temperature from Amazon.comreview/text: When I bought this item I did not have immediate use so the review is belated. When I used the product I was unsure what to expect. That did not last long when I notice that it was precise in keeping the temperature very close to what it was set at. I checked it out with other thermometers and it maintained very well. I now depend on it.
