review/summary: Don't Expect Miraclesreview/text: I'm giving this item a three star rating for several reasons. First the size is both good and bad. It's good because of the extremely compact size but bad also for the same reason. I have big hands and it's difficult to use the screwdriver for anything without almost cutting my fingers from the blade. That brings me to the second function, the blade. It is extremely sharp, cuts very well for it's size and seems like it will hold an edge. The blade is definitely the best tool on this "key". Third, the bottle opener is useful and works well. Lastly, the medium and small flat head screwdrivers are basically useless and seem to be there as an afterthought. The cost to value quotient is slightly above average on this because of it's size and the blade.
