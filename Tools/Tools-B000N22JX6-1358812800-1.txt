review/summary: Very Nice Heaterreview/text: We have only had this heater over the weekend. So far, it's a great little heater! Our master bedroom gets very cold in the winter. The only reason I gave it 4 STARS was because after ordering, I found this same heater local for about 8$ cheaper. My fault for not shopping smarter. BUT, the product is a really good one. Would recommend. Our master bedroom is 14X16, and this works great.
