review/summary: One of the best purchases I've ever made.review/text: This, coupled with the key-less push-button start in my car, allows me to live a virtually key-free existence, where I can lock up my house, unlock my car, start my car, drive to work ... return from work, lock my car, and unlock my house door, all without having to ever take keys/fobs out of my pocket. Not having to fumble with keys at any point during your day is simply awesome. I like that you use your own mechanical force to turn the deadbolt once it is engaged through the keypad- this feels more secure, and seems like it would have less opportunity to wear out (as might be the case with deadbolts that have a motor to drive the bolt). I like that the mechanical key can be utilized as a backup in case the battery ever wears out (I'm about 6 months in and still on the original 9V). I like that I can program temporary codes for house guests or the pet sitter, and can delete them again when no longer needed. I honestly think this is one of the most useful things I have ever purchased, and is well worth $100 bucks.
