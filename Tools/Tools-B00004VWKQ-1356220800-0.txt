review/summary: Reliable, Easy-To-Use Sharpenerreview/text: Never in my own experience have I used a knife sharpener that is so effective and simple. I have put wicked edges on knives of all sizes, and also on a few machetes. Surprisingly, this sharpener powered through a chewed-up edge on one of my machetes, and in the end, left an amazingly sharp, shiny, and crisp edge. It's very easy to use--simply gripping it and running it down the length of the blade ensures a safe hand, an even edge, and time left over to do something else. On top of that, once the tungsten sharpeners start to dull, they can be flipped for twice the sharpener life. Overall, it's a great sharpener, and I recommend it to anyone who wants something simple and effective.
