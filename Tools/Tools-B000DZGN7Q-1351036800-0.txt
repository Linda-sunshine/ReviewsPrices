review/summary: Plastic and flimsyreview/text: I bought this because Consumer Reports rated it highly. My plumber went to install it today, and said that he'll never install it again. It's plastic (instead of stainless steel) and flimsy, and a pain to install. He said that Insinkerator is a much better brand.It's a good reminder to let the trade professionals buy the fixtures and equipment -- they'll select the ones that are good, simple to install, and won't require callbacks on warranties.
