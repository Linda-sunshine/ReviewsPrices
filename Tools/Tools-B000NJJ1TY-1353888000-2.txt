review/summary: Schlage Door Lockreview/text: Schlage door locks that use keypads instead of a key are great. The problem concerning this lock for me was that it is not a deadbolt and for this reason only, I returned it. This particular style of Schlage lock (no deadbolt) is perhaps meant for an apartment or other type of dwelling that doesn't seek out a higher level of security.The quality of Schlage keypad locks is very good: construction, mechanism and is attractive. I bought a Schlage deadbolt style lock over four years ago and absolutely love it--especially the keypad feature--no key needed and the keypad lights up and make opening the door simple. Whether you want a non-deadbolt or deadbolt lock, Schlage is worth considering.
