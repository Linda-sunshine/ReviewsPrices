review/summary: &#34;cheep&#34; but worksreview/text: product is made in anti-democratic China, and the spelling errors ON THE BOX indicate a low attention to detail. Product makes a loud metallic &#34;snap&#34; when engaging, but a CSR (and the directions, which seemed to have been written by people more familiar with English) say this is normal.Was easy to install and hasnt leaked in 2 weeks of service. I will buy an Insinkerator next time because it's made domestically and they don't ship boxes of misprints.
