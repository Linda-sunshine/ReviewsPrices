review/summary: Really like thesereview/text: One of the ranges I shoot at requires digital noise cancelling headsets, which are a LOT more expensive than these. I spent 4 times as much for the digital set. These are much better at dampening the noise of gunfire than the pricey ones, and I can still hear someone speaking to me. The digital ones require batteries and I still need to put foam plugs in my ears to shoot without going deaf.These earmuffs are comfortable, adjustable and not too hot to wear for a couple hours at a time.
