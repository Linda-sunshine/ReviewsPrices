review/summary: Poorly made product. Do not buy.review/text: This product is not well made and you shouldn't buy it. I used it maybe 10-15 times in the last few years to fill up my car tires and just last weekend it broke. Sounds to me like the ball Barings inside broke down. Also when it did work it didn't work very well. It took a good 5 minutes per tire to add a few psi to one tire and made a lot of noise in the process. Also the air pressure gage was small too hard to read to put an accurate amount of pressure in the tire. You basically had to guess where in-between the line for 30 and 40 that 32 or 34 might be. Would have been helpful if they had at least put lines every 5 psi.I would not buy this product again and when I called Black and Decker to complain they basically said that its past the 2 year warrantee so bug off. Am I really supposed to expect a product like this to only work for 2 years and break are you kidding me? When I suggested that they could send me a coupon or something to make up for their product breaking with moderate use the CSR acted like she didn't care and again referenced the 2 year warrantee. I don't think I will ever be buying anything Black and Decker makes anymore.Don't buy this product unless you only think you are going to use it a few times and then expect to throw it away. And certainly don't buy it if you think you might ever need to count on it in an emergency.
