review/summary: Nice product, needs better edgereview/text: No complaints about the quality. It appears durable, has a good feel without being very heavy. Long enough to generate some chopping force, but not too long as to make it difficult to carry in/on a pack. My only issue is the edge. I don't expect an axe/hatchet to have a razor sharp edge, but the one I received I would classify as blunt. I don't mind putting a better edge on it as it meets all my other requirements, but this should be improved.
