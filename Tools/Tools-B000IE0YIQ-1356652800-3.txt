review/summary: Does what it says it would doreview/text: The option to use your car 12v plug or wall outlet is great. The wall outlet cord is extremely short so you will need an extension cord but the 12v line is plenty long for my Explorer and VW. I also used it to blow up an air mattress on a recent camping trip but the attachments did not work well for the approximate 1&#34; blow hole; had to use the smaller blow hole which took about 20 min to inflate. Don't know the accuracy of the psi gauge but seems pretty good or on point.
