review/summary: yep, it sharpensreview/text: For so long I've used a wet stone to sharpen my knives, and then I found this. It works extremely well. For that extra little honing, I suggest stropping your blade on the back of a leather belt after you use the accusharp on it. If you're sharpening a cheaper knife that needs a lot of metal removed, but a dab of oil on the blade edge to assist that.
