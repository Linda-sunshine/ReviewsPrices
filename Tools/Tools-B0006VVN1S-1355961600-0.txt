review/summary: Not my favoritereview/text: While I like this showerhead, I will probably end up buying another one. The coverage is not that great, leaving the &#34;outside&#34; of your body cold. I'm a small person at that. I do like the different functions, but it is difficult to twist the head to change the setting to your favorite. Sometimes I just go with whatever it has been left on rather than mess with it. If I were you, I would keep looking. This showerhead is functional, but not the best.
