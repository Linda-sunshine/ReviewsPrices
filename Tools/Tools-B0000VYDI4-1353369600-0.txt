review/summary: versatile, compactreview/text: This ladder is great, it can be an adjustable height a-frame or extension ladder, comes apart & makes 2 a-frames for plank, it's compact & light. Most of the ladders I use are not rated for my weight (290) this one is, as an extension ladder the center pivot point wobbles a little making me nervous at first, but it does the job. I usually only bring one of these ladders to work now, rather than a couple of different height a-frame & extension ladder
