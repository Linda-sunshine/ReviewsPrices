review/summary: neat little toolreview/text: Been through TSA with this and they didnt even know it was a tool or have a blade. Very useful in a pinch when you're travelling and need something to open a plastic package or something you cannot easily rip open. Fits on my key ring and up to this date it has not come loose and fall off.
