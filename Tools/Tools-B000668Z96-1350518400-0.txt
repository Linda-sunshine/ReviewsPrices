review/summary: A GODSENDreview/text: Yes I am doing EVERYTHING I can, to get rid of the fleas -- applying Frontline on the kitties, sprinkling food grade diatoms on the rugs and fuzzy furniture, and then vacuuming rugs and furniture. Spraying lemon-vinegar-water mixture and cleaning out lots of extraneous papers and stuff. THIS is all being done in tandem to wipe out the fleas, which is a big project. It WILL take some time --but I feel ALOT better knowing that these Traps are sitting around in specific areas (where I think the fleas are still congregating the most) and already on the first night I saw liiitle dots gathering on one of the traps that I placed in the most "flea-likely" place.Time will tell as to their total efficacy. They are an adjunct to the total flea eradication. The traps are easy to assemble. The cords provided are long enough to be able to place the traps in areas that are not near an outlet. I don't want to add an extension cord to this. I only plug them in when I am home, but I would bet that the sticky pads will continue to trap even if the light (which I BELIEVE is a common night-light bulb) is off. I will change the sticky pads (which are very easy to install in the traps) every 2 weeks or so, as recommended. The traps come with an extra pad, and I also ordered the refills.Once the flea situation is really under control I plan to keep using these as a preventive.UPDATE Nov 14 -- yes, they are working- I see a few little dead bodies, having placed three traps in The Room Where The Fleas DO Lurk. Now it is time to (ugh) change the pads.
