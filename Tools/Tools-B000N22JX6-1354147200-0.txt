review/summary: This is a sweet little heater!review/text: This little heater is just what the doctor ordered. Okay, I live in Florida, so it doesn't have a lot of work to do, but after using it for a couple of days, I'm pretty sure I won't be turning on my furnace at all this winter. I keep the door to the balcony cracked open for kitty-kat, and it can get chilly inside - in the high 40s to 50s at night. The thermostat is adjustable, the timer is VERY handy so it will turn off automatically in case I forget, and the remote control makes my life as a couch potato that much easier. It looks nice and it even oscillates! I highly recommend this item for a small apartment.
