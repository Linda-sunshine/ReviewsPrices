review/summary: Arrives Broken. No Refund.review/text: I just opened the Bug Zapper and one side was broken in the Box. It is completely non-functioning. I ordered it in July and waited until our mosquito time in August to open it and missed the return date by 3 days. I have no way to contact them with a complaint, so I simply have to take the loss. PLEASE if you order this frail, shoddy item check the contents immediately!!!!
