review/summary: Warranty Not Worth The Paper It's Printed Onreview/text: I've had this surge protector in use for my home theater system for several years. A recent electrical storm and lightning strike came through this "surge protector" and fried 3 pieces of equipment. I submitted a claim to Belkin and received a letter stating that there was nothing wrong with their surge protector and denied all claims.If you think Belkin will stand behind its "Warranty" and actually fix or replace your equipment, I've got a bridge to sell you in NYC. BTW, another company's surge protector (Trip Lite) was hooked to my fax machine which got fried during the same strike and they (Trip Lite) reimbursed me IN FULL for the cost of my Canon printer-fax. Buy from Trip Lite
