review/summary: Immediate Results.review/text: I was a bit skeptical about all of the other reviews, thinking that it was too good to be true. The trap is very easy to assemble and the initial kit came with 2 stick-pads. I ordered additional refills also, they're pretty inexpensive so no problem there. After assembling the trap and plugging it in, not 5 minutes passed before the first little bastard flea jumped in to his death. I'm having fun watching them jump in there. I consider it revenge for torturing us and our cat. This is not a one-item fix for the flea problem though. We're also spraying our carpets and using Frontline on our cat, but as other reviews stated, this is great for detection and killing any that survive the aerial carpet assault. I'll probably be ordering one more for the bedroom.
