review/summary: Multi purpose excellencereview/text: I've recently been putting together a bug out bag, so I needed an axe or hatchet of some sort. I chose this one because it's fairly light and has the pick on the other end for breaching, digging, etc. I have been trying to select items that serve more than one purpose to reduce the weight and bulk of my pack, and this one met my needs. It's well built, and sturdy. Comes with a nice sheath, and if you have MOLLE loop attachments on your pack, this fits nicely in those. Warning, this thing is razor sharp right out of the box. When it gets dull, it's easy to sharpen. I like that factor, as hand saws are basically useless once they lose their edge.
