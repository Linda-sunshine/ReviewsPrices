review/summary: These units replaced our furnace!review/text: The furnace in our newly purchased home died on December 20th. As we live in New York, this was VERY bad news. We decided to buy some space heaters until we could figure out how to proceed. We have one of these in each bedroom, and two larger Lasko units in the living room and kitchen. We couldn't be happier with their performance. It's been very cozy in the house, except the cold floors, of course. The temperature can be selected in five degree increments from 60 - 80, high or low fan speed, and oscillation mode. It's tiny, but it sure does the job. Have used these four units as our only heat source and our electric bill was a whopping $4 higher for the month. That's FOUR DOLLARS, people! Plus, they look really cool. Kind of like a little patio chiminea in my bedroom. Highly recommended.
