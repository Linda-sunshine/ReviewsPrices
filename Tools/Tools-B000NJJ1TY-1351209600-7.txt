review/summary: Easy to Installreview/text: Received it in well packaged box. Instructions were pretty clear. I had a bit of a trouble aligning the two halves at the door but once they aligned, it was fairly easy to install. Watch for the wires from the battery to the electronics. I wish they had done a better job of routing the cables. Works like a charm. Scan the codes in to a PDF. Or else, the codes are also available inside the lock itself.
