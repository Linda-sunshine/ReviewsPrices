review/summary: . I purchase the the detectors because they were rated well on amazon. JDreview/text: This detctor had good reviews on Amazon. I purchased two of them as we have a long ranch style home with a furnace at one end of the house in the basement, a gas dryer, and gas fireplace at the other end of the home. I really don't know much about these things, but we have had no warnings of carbon monoxide. I purchase the the detectors because they were rated well on amazon. JD
