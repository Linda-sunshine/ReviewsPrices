review/summary: works great!!!review/text: this works great! very accurate! glad it has the triple prongs on both sides. reads herts, watts, voltage, and amperage up to the tenths. tested fridge and fans and other things that turned out to be drawing electricity that i didn't know where. will defiantly be unplugging many things in the house hold. hope to save some green on the electric bill.
