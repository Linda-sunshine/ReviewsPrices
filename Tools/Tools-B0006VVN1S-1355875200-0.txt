review/summary: Great Filter and Showerhead in One!review/text: For the past 6 months I have used theCulligan RDSH-C115 RainDisc Showerhead with Filter, Chrome Finishand it was time to replace the filter (recommended every 6 months or 10,000 gallons). I decided I would try this model and buy a replacement filter for the other (Both use same filter). So I have to say they both do a great job of filtering the water. The water feels softer and has no odor. I have to admit I am glad I bought this model because I find it much better than the RainDisc.+ Easy Install+ Teflon Thread Tape Included+ Filter Included+ Different Spray Settings+ Softer Fresher Feeling Water+ Awesome Pressure Compared to the RainDisc+ Easily Find Replacement Filters+ Inexpensive- No cons yet I will update if there are_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this to a friend it works awesome, it's inexpensive, and the filter lasts a long time. Replacement filters are easy to come by and are inexpensive as well. If anyone is deciding between this and the RainDisc do not hesitate and buy this one! They both have the exact same filter but the other one has poor pressure and feels cheap and is plastic. I now own both and I am happy but this new one is in my shower and the RainDisc is in the guest bath! Easy buy, easy 5 stars!
