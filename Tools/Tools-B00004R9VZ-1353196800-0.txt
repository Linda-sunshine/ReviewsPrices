review/summary: Great Productreview/text: This is a traditional bug zapper, the first one I had was the same type only a bit larger. That one gave us two years of full time service before the lamp went out. The price is very good and the unit holds up very well killing many bugs! The unit arrived in good condition and right on time.Thanks!
