review/summary: Better than Brita and PUR by a milereview/text: My Brita filter for the faucet would often spring a leak and then it would eject like a torpedo from the faucet, causing a mess. It just wasn't that sturdy. This Culligan filter is a lot sturdier...the piece that connects to the faucet is metal, not plastic. It also lasts a lot longer than a Brita. The Brita light starts blinking after a few months and then the water slows to a trickle, probably by design...such that you are so annoyed that you have to replace it (conspiracy theory). It's like they purposely make a bad product such that you have to replace it when it breaks down. Based on how I use it (I'm single), the Brita should last like 6-9 months...but only lasts a few months. It's a rip off in my opinion. The Culligan filter is a much much better value.
