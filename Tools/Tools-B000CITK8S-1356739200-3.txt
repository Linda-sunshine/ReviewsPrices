review/summary: Battery Tender Juniorreview/text: I already have two of these Battery Tender JuniorsI never had one go bad and they are connected up all the timeI needed six moreThese chargers don't have to be babysatJust hook them up and forget about themThe price was good and they came in a few daysI would recommend these chargers to anyone who has motorcycles,tractors,generators etc...that may sit around waiting to be usedThey can also extend the battery life by keeping the charge up
