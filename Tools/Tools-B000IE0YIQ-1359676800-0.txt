review/summary: It didn't last very longreview/text: After a year of light use the unit would no longer work when connected to an outlet. It still works when connected to a car's lighter outlet. Trouble is I needed both. Some Black & Decker stuff is champion, like my battery mower and drills. Some of it is crap, like my power washer and this air station.
