review/summary: Can finally be key free!review/text: I hate carrying keys and usually get in the house via the garage door. However, there have been a couple of times when my garage door wouldn't open (1st time power failure, 2nd time spring broke) and as a result I was locked out of the house. Since then, I've always been a little paranoid of something going wrong with the garage door again so I finally went ahead and got a keypad lock after seeing it on Amazon's daily deals.Today I just installed the lock and it was a breeze to put together! Works flawlessly and it's so easy to use. The best part is, my in-laws aren't tech savvy so they can continue using a physical key to get into our house!
