review/summary: Did the job for mereview/text: We needed a filter to trap some odor and taste from an algae bloom in our rural domestic water system caused by drought conditions lowering our reservoir level much more than normal. Price performance on this product was the best. It worked as advertized and even though we don't really need the filter any longer (sub zero temps and algea don't get along well) we leave the filter in place for refilling bottled water bottles. We considered this a great buy.
