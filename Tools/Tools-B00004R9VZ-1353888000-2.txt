review/summary: worked fine-for a whilereview/text: I have 20ac in the northwoods of wisconsin. about mid may the misquotes got REALLY bad so I put up 2 of these they worked fine, and contrary to what people say they did kill thousands of bugs- my complaint is that after only 4 months one of them quit. Don't know if it is a bulb or what, but I am tired of china made sh-- that either doesn't work at all, or only works a couple of months before it breaks.
