review/summary: Really usefulreview/text: The LED light is lightweight, the head is flexible, and the light is brilliant. It takes three triple A batteries (which are not included) and the clip is really nifty. The light covers an area that fits a full marble notebook (open to two pages). It's really handy for doing late night work, when you don't want to disturb your roommate, or bed mate. For college, it was recommended that I bring a desk lamp, but I think this little light provides sufficient lighting for a desk lamp, without taking up much space. I don't think I'll need a desk lamp, after all.
