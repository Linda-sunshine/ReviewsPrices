review/summary: Good product...review/text: Have just recently replaced our old CO detectors with three of these First Alert CO615. I must admit, didn't realize they had to be replaced every 5/7 yrs. Our old ones must have been at least 10 yrs. I love the LCD screens on these new ones. The old ones didn't have LCD screens. The features I like on these: 1) Battery backup, doesn't come into affect until there's a power outage, and the battery usage indicator on the LCD. 2) The memory recall of CO levels within the last 24 hrs. Installation was easy, and the initial test was simple. The price on Amazon was much better then what I could find in retail stores. All-in-all a great buy...
