review/summary: works wellreview/text: The little wheels work well and capture the poles of the brooms and rakes well. My only (tiny) concern is that the screw holes to attach the device to the wall aren't spaced 12&#34; so that they each attach to a stud. I ended up putting a middle screw into the stud, the others are just in the dry wall. I hope it can handle the weight.
