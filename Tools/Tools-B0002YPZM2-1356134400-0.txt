review/summary: Great work glovesreview/text: Great gloves with padding at areas that needs them the most. Fit my hands very well and allow them to maintain decent dexterity. I use these gloves for all my yard works and repairs around the house. These gloves are not water or wind resistant so don't go using them as bike gloves.
