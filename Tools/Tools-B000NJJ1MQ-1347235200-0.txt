review/summary: So much easier!review/text: This lock is something I have been wanting for a long time. No more carrying around keys and dragging them out when I get to the door. Just a quick code and I'm in! I also love being able to give others a code while they need it then remove their access. I had a lock in the past that retracted the deadbolt automatically but it would sometimes stick and leave you locked out. The manual turn after unlocking is much better in my opinion.
