review/summary: A Must Have Itemreview/text: The Battery Tender takes out the worry of a fully charged battery. Just hook it up and leave. It keeps the battery fully charged while not over-charging in the mean time. I keep it hooked to my camper battery so I'm always ready to go with a full charge. The indicator lights let you know the status of the charge so there is no guessing. The compact size makes it easy to keep out of the weather.
