review/summary: Great all around ladder!review/text: I purchased this ladder recently at Lowe's, and I couldn't be happier. There are a few things I could see that might make someone not be so thrilled with it. First off, yes, it's a heavy ladder. It's all metal and extends up to 20'. I don't know why anyone would think it's the same weight as your typical 6' fiberglass ladder. I've been able to haul this ladder around by myself with no problems. Second, there is some potential for "finger damage" in the extending and retracting of the ladder. It took me some time to mess with with it & take extra caution so I didn't hurt myself. Finally, I've seen some people not too happy with its stability. I have not yet had to use the ladder as a scaffold, so I can't comment on that function. But for regular use, I've put the ladder in many awkward positions and never once felt that stability was compromised. I'm definitely happy with this purchase!
