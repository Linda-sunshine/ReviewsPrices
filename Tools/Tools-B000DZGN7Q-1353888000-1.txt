review/summary: You Get What You Pay Forreview/text: I have a handyman business. My customer bought one of these for me to put in. After the installation of this product, it leaked like a sieve through the bottom of the unit. I've never had that experience before. What a piece of junk! We went to L**wes and got a top end unit and I reinstalled it. I felt bad the customer had to pay me for twice the labor. I would never buy this line of products and will not install one again for anyone without warning them.
