review/summary: I like the automatic cutoffreview/text: I've had this compressor for only a couple of months. I like that it can operate on house current as well as from the car's accessory plugs. The best feature for me is the automatic shut off when the desired pressure is reached. I acquired this item after I burned up my previous compressor when I left it running.
