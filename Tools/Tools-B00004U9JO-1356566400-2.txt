review/summary: Good low cost optionreview/text: If you are replacing an existing in-sink-erator brand, the install lakes 20 minutes. Remove the old one. Pop out the dishwasher drain plug, move the power cord from your old model to the new one, install the new one with a simple twist, connect dishwasher drain and primary disposal drain into existing sink plumbing. Was a snap. This is a cheaper/low cost model, and it is not super quiet. We replaced a higher end model that died, and can tell this is a bit louder... but we don't use it very often so we didn't care.
