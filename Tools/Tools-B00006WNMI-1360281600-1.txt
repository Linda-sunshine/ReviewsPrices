review/summary: Culligan FM-15Areview/text: I couldn't get it to work. I hooked it up and the water would spray everywhere.Maybe if you have a newer faucet or plumbing experience you will have better luck.The refill cartridge is hard to pick out since the model numbers are almost the same-so make sure you are actually purchasing the right refill if you do get this to work.
