review/summary: Carbon monoxide detectorreview/text: Doing wellness at work and carbon monoxide level was high. Not a smoker and not exposed to 2nd hand smoke regularly. Was curious about furnace & gas stove. Bought detector to check this out. Have 2 small boys also. Have detector plugged in & everything checked out good! Now have a piece of mind on a daily basis.
