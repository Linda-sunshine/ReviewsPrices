review/summary: Don't waste your moneyreview/text: I didn't have a bad infestation of fleas, but I had found a few around my house. After reading the other reviews it seemed this product would be perfect for us. I have a young baby who has just begun to crawl so I really didnt want all the chemical residue that most flea bombs leave behind in my carpets and around my house.I did not catch even ONE flea. I caught several other bugs who were attracted to the light. I made sure to mostly use my traps at night, because most stated in other reviews that was when it seemed to work the best. Only one of my traps actually came with refills. which is just a cheap sticker really, you could but some double sided tape down across the carpet, essientially its the same thing. I received my traps last week, and already the bulb in both of them has burnt out. I cant say I am surprised as soon as I opened the box i was surprised how cheap they seemed.
