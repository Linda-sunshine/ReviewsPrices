review/summary: Saved my batteryreview/text: This the winter as cold as it has been this year I figured it was finally time to purchase one of these for my motorcycle. Previously I would go and run the bike for a while every week but by the end of winter I would have an almost dead battery. With this Battery Tender Jr. I was able to not run the bike for over 1 month and she turned right on when I went to try it out. A must have for any motorcycle owner!
