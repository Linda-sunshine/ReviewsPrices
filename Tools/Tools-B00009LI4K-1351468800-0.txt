review/summary: Very impracticalreview/text: You can't tell from the photos because there's no other object to give perspective, but these things are HUGE. Especially in the width of the ear cups. I mean, these things extending out more than you would ever imagine. It draws attention as if you have antlers. But even if I wasn't concerned about appearance, I would not wear them because they are so width that they become a safety hazard by catching on nearby objects. Also heavier than I would like. I can't see these being practical in any situation. Get the yellow ones instead.
