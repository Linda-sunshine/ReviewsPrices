review/summary: A perfect fitreview/text: This was an exact replacement for the one I had previously and it went in in about 15 minutes. It works great and handles everything it should. However, don't use a plunger on it. That's how I killed the one before it that this one replaced. It blows out the rubber seals inside and leaks water terribly. But that was my mistake.
