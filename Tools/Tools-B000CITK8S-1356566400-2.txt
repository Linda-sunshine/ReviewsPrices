review/summary: love em!review/text: Bought one for each quad, plus a Plus for more versatility (and when I need a quicker charge). I connected the cords to the batteries and zip tied them in place so I just have to plug them in when home. Don't see why this wouldn't make my batteries last longer, not to mention will cut down on the surprises.
