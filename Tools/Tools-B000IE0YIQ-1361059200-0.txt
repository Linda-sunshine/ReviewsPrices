review/summary: Fuse blown after second usereview/text: AC fuse blown after second use. Internet search and you'll see this is a common problem and cannot be fixed. The fuse is soldered onto the circuit board.Unfortunately, I am 2 days out of my amazon return window.Do yourself a favor and don't purchase this air-station.
