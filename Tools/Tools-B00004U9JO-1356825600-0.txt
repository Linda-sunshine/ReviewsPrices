review/summary: A Perfect Replacementreview/text: My 12 year old Badger Disposer began making terrible grinding noises, and I gave up after several attempts of trying to repair it, so ordered this unit as a replacement. Although a slightly upgraded model, it fit perfectly and I had it installed and running in about an hour's time - no leaks, and grinding quietly. It was considerably cheaper than at Lowes and I received it quickly and with free shipping. I would recommend it to other customers.
