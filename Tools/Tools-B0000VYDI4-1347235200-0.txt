review/summary: Not "multipurpose" enough!review/text: Materials and build are good, price is indeedWerner MT-13 300-Pound Duty Rating Telescoping Multi-Ladder, 13-Foothigh, but most importantly this shelf only works with the MT-13 ladder in its stepladder configuration, that is, set up like the letter "A". If the ladder is used straight-up, even at the identical angle (about 70 degrees from level) the shelf sharply slopes and is unusable. Since it is when one is up a ladder that a shelf would be most welcome, this is a bizarre design flaw. If the shelf's support brackets had been made adjustable there would be no problem. Back mine goes.
