review/summary: Outstanding product - this is my 2nd purchasereview/text: Hello all. If you're looking for a dependable and VERY easy to install keypad lock, this is an absolutely great choice. Here are the reasons:1. The finish is perfect, no flaws like scratches or dents2. It really comes in 3 pieces (bolt and assembly, internal locking lever, external keypad and lever) so aside of the screws and all that, it's very low on parts3. SUPER easy to assemble and install, AS LONG AS YOUR DOOR IS STANDARD4. Comes with additional parts, like a heavy duty reinforcement plate, which is bigger and stronger than the standard plate (but requires that you dremel the plate part of the door more than how it likely current is5. So easy to program, unbelievably easy as long as you take just 3 mins to read that part of the manual (it's on a poster, actually)The only thing I would change would be to allow 5 or even 6 digits to be used, right now you can only use 4 digit codes.
