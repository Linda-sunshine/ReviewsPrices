review/summary: Great little heaterreview/text: I have a large livingroom and it heats the room with no problem. I actually have to turn it off or lower the thermostat. It looks nice, not like a typical ceramic heater. Not sure about the cost because I haven't gotten a recent lightbill, however, I believe it will help b/c now I do not have to turn up my heater and heat my entire house if I just want to warm the livingroom or a bedroom. It's very light and easy to move around. I love the oscillating feature. Definitely a good buy!
