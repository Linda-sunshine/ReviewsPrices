review/summary: Excellent Systemreview/text: This lock and latch system is a perfect application for my needs. The combination lock means I can get into my new garage without having to find the key, and the lever allows access with both arms full...just open the door with my elbow. And, with Schlage quality, I know I've got an excellent product that is going to serve me well for years to come. I also rekeyed it to match my other locks (a free service at Home Depot). I couldn't be happier!
