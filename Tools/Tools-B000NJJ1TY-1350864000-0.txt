review/summary: Love it. here are some helpful tips thoughreview/text: Okay, I just learned from the pictures on this website that I can change it from an auto lock to manual lock. I love being able to walk out the door without locking the door. I just check it each time to make sure it is locked. One of the biggest problems I had with the installation is that immediately upon removing the handle set from the box I inserted the key for fit. DO NOT DO THIS! I HAD A HELLUVA TIME GETTING THE KEY BACK OUT OF THE CHAMBER. IT SAYS IN THE SMALL PRINT THAT YOU CAN ONLY USE THE KEY ON A DEAD HANDSET. I am a landlord and have changed tons of lock sets and I am sorry, but it is just human nature to test the key. I would appreciate a better dissertation from Schlage on this issue since the stuff I read about actually using the key, further muddied the issue of how and when the key works and how exactly you do get the key out if you do like I did and put it in the lockset after hours when schlage is not there to answer their phone. I think schlage needs to put the keys in an envelope with a warning. This added about 2 hours to my installation time, since I wasn't going to be able to install a handset with the key on the outside still in the door. PROBLEMATIC AT THE VERY LEAST. The other thing that schlage could do to make installation easier is to color code the electrical connection. perhaps white on one side, and black on the other. THis would alleviate any anxiety about trying to connect backwards and damaging the pins. The unit itself is very easy to install. There is a screw that they have installed that is supposed to make for handsfree installation. I simply taped the outdoor side to the door because that screw being extended did not really hold it into place very well for me. ONE OTHER BIG TIP. MAKE SURE THAT YOU SAVE THE CODES SOMEWHERE THAT YOU WILL NOT LOOSE THEM. FILL OUT THE PAPERWORK THAT COMES WITH THE LOCKSET ABOUT THE CODES YOU ADD AND THE PROGRAMMING CODE. KEEP A COPY IN YOUR SAFE DEPOSIT BOX AT THE BANK IF YOU HAVE TO. THESE CODES ARE SERIOUSLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE COMPANY CANNOT GET THEM FOR YOU IF YOU LOOSE THEM. PUT THEM IN A FILE, SEND THEM TO YOURSELF. KEEP THEM AT THE OFFICE. PUT THEM WITH YOUR WILL. I AM SAVING MY CODES TO MULTIPLE PLACES SO THAT I CAN RETRIEVE THEM FROM MYSELF IF I NEED TO. LABEL THE KEYS AND STORE THEM IN A SAFE PLACE ALSO. I HAVE CONSIDERED HAVING ONE MADE AND ACTUALLY CARRYING ONE BUT DON'T SEE THE NEED SINCE I HAVE TWO OF THESE LOCKSETS ON MY HOUSE AND CAN'T SEE THEM BOTH DYING AT THE SAME TIME. IF BATTERY LIFE IS NOT LONG I WILL BE VERY DISSAPOINTED.
