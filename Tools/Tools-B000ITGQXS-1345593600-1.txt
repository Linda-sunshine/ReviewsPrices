review/summary: Disappointingreview/text: I bought these for my daughters to use for reading in bed. But these are tiny--much smaller than I expected when I bought them--and the light they throw is very narrow. That means they don't light the whole page, only a few lines at a time, and my daughters had to keep moving the book around in order to read. Not surpisingly, they stopped using them very quickly.
