review/summary: Victor Flea Trapsreview/text: The traps work as expected and they would be even better if they were a little bigger. The sticky paper discs should have a sticky dot on the bottom to help them stay flat. I had a couple that buckled and I had to tape them down with Scotch tape. I have birds and conventional chemical flea sprays can kill them. I also have asthma so did not want to cause further breathing problems by spraying chemicals in the house. This natural method of eliminating fleas was very helpful. I also used a natural flea Spray to help get rid of flea eggs and larvae along with the traps. These traps also attract gnats and other insects.
