review/summary: L-O-V-E These Gloves!review/text: Buying a pair of gloves online for my needs was not something I was particularly fond of doing. These Custom Leathercraft Handyman Flex Grip gloves were hard to gauge. I didn't want gloves with a lot of bulk to them. Looking at the photos and video didn't give a keen sense of how thick or thin these gloves were. I mean, look at the backside of the glove and it seems that there's an abundance of thickness along the back of the hand and knuckles. The last thing I wanted was something heavy like a winter glove. The pictures almost make it look as if it were.So, a little about what I do....I work for the Post Office sorting mail inside a processing facility. It's the kind of work where you are always grabbing rolling equipment or stacking inventory. For that kind of job, you need a tough glove that will weather the kind of daily abuse you put your hands through. However, since I also sort mail, I need a glove thin and flexible enough that allows me to grab thin letters without effort.I was amazed at how these gloves are perfectly suited for both kinds of work. Best of all, dirt does not pass through these gloves so my hands always stay clean no matter what I am doing.These gloves are remarkably thin, but you can see that they are built to be durable. They are comfortable to wear, and a velcro strap around the wrists ensure that they stay in place. I have medium sized hands and bought the same sized gloves, but I think in the future I'll go large. These mediums seem to be a bit too snug but they do stretch, and I would bet that with a little more use they will break in a bit better. Still, perhaps the best recommendation I can give is to go one size larger than you think you need. Fortunately, Amazon has a return policy if they don't fit right.
