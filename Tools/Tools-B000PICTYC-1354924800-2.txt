review/summary: Amazing... Second most tool in my pack.review/text: I bought this tomahawk as an addition to my pack mostly as a weapon. I thought it looked cool and MIGHT come in handy as a self defense weapon. It quickly become my go to for almost all heavy bushcraft work.It throws VERY well. I can get it to stick, on target, 9/10 times. The edge holds very well and takes one heck of a beating. The pick on the back works great for breaking up hard ground and rocks if needed. I dont even carry a shovel anymore when out and about in the wild.This thing has dropped rather large trees with relative ease (if you know how to fell a tree with an axe then you can do it with this). I have built several shelters, some simple and some quite complex housing 4+ people using only my SOG hawk, a machete, my Mora Knife and some 550 cord.It cuts, chops, splits, digs, picks and throws. It is a must have for anyone who spends a good amount of time in the wild.The only downside is that I wish the handle was a tad more comfortable but my hands are already pretty beat up so not worth losing a star. GET THIS PRODUCT!!
