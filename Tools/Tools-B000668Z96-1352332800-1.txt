review/summary: Worked great while it lastedreview/text: I received my order of three traps about Oct 2, 2012. They caught a lot of fleas and other bugs. This is Nov 7 and two have already stopped working. The first one that died only lasted about a week. I changed the bulb so I know it didn't just burn out.
