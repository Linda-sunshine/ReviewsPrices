review/summary: Tiny, Easy to install, and so very quiet!review/text: After my old garbage disposal developed a crack which turned it into an under-cabinet fountain I decided that it would be a good idea to get a new disposal.I chose this model over other models mainly because I have an extra-deep kitchen sink and this is one of the shortest garbage disposals I could find. I have an extra-deep sink in my kitchen and the low distance between the bottom of my sink and this unit's out-flow plumbing connection meant I didn't need to change any of my existing pipes.The instructions were clear and installation was fairly straightforward. I think the most difficult part was re-attaching the retaining ring and even that wasn't terribly difficult.When I had the unit fully wired and installed I initially though that something had gone wrong, but it turned out that the unit was functioning perfectly and was just unbelievably quiet! As a quick experiment I quartered a small lemon and ran it through the disposal. The disposal chewed through the lemon flawlessly! My old disposal always had problems with lemon peels and I'm now looking forward to never needing to fish one of those things out again.I just wish my old disposal would've broken before Thanksgiving. Having this new disposal around would've been a big help.
