review/summary: My new best friend.review/text: Since I bought this cool multitool, it hasn't left my side. Literally.I keep it attached to my keys which stay with me all day.It's come in quite handy for various tasks at work when I didn't feel like going back to my toolbox or looking for a pair of scissors to cut something open.I love it!I was initially worried about it staying closed, but it's not given me any trouble yet.
