review/summary: Easy to Install and Operatereview/text: The install was straightforword. I already had an existing deadbolt, so I didn't have to cut a new hole. I really liked that the inside panel installed with a screw top and bottom. Very easy. When the inside handle is engaded on the inside it has a solid feel unlike my previous deadbolt. The number pad is lighted on the outside...great for when the kids get off work late. Great lock. Looks good and operates nicely.
