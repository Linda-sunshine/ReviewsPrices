review/summary: Great little filterreview/text: My wife has eczema and we were recommended to use a shower filter. I decided to get this product as an experiment based on reviews. The results were instantaneous and her eczema symptoms have reduced by 90%, so it seems like this filter is doing it's job.The results may vary for different people but we are really happy that we installed this filter. It's very easy to setup, construction is not bad either. We have been using it for a few months now and structurally I don't see any issues with it so far. Definitely worth a try for the price.
