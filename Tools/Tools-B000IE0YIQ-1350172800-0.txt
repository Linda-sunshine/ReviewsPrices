review/summary: Had betterreview/text: This item works well on tires and balls. Air gauge is fine. But it's not at all good for pool pillows and floats. It took more than an hour to inflate the pool pillow 4'x8' size and it wasn't fully inflated. Doesn't enter the hole all the way leaving access to the air to be released while inflating. Not a lot of pressure to blow air. No plug for large openings. Got tired of waiting. The electric cord is too short. only about 12 inches in length.(maybe there is a reason for that) But the car plug is very long. Understandable. On and off switch is located on the end behind the car charger, not convenient. My old one inflated the pillow fully in 15 minutes. I probably should have looked for an air mattress inflator. I will keep this product since it blows up my wagon's wheels perfectly using the air gauge so not to overfill and pop. Also since it works on electric current and car charger. Haven't tried it yet on the car charger though.
