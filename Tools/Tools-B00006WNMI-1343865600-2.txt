review/summary: Love it!review/text: I live on a boat and my tap water smelled bad. I didn't even want to wash my face, let alone drink it! The faucet filter installed easily with one of the adaptors and the difference is incredible. No more unpleasant odor and the water tastes great. I'm ordering a second system now for another sink.
