review/summary: Regular flies ignore this devicereview/text: House flies like the ones currently plaguing Boise this summer are not attracted to this device one bit. While my porch was consistently being invaded by an army of a few dozen small black house flies, this device could not convince a single one of them to enter its electric cage of destruction. Perhaps the attractant in it is not suitable for house flies, but if that is so the product should clearly state that in its description. The UV light itself also doesn't appear to do any good. I caught a couple of moths later at night, but those guys fly into anything remotely luminescent, so no points for that.For indoors, I had a similar experience withFly Web Fly Trap, which also didn't catch a single one of these flies. Summer is coming to an end, so nature will take care of the flies soon enough, but if you live in or around Boise and think either of these products can help you rid of the flies, think again.
