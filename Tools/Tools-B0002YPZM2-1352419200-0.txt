review/summary: Great feel nicer than my mechanix glovesreview/text: Thanks to the earlier reviewers I bought these. Heck if the hold up to our service men and womens abuse, they should work for a long time in my shade tree mechanic garage!They feel great, the sizing seems right, they are a nice sturdy design. Liking them!
