review/summary: Better mousetrap #2 - the shocking truthreview/text: Evidently I had two mice, one was smarter than the other.! One got the axe with a traditional trap. But the second was snootie, took the bait but avoided the axe. Walked on sticky paper but escaped. This shock treatment worked just fine, adios to smart mouse.
