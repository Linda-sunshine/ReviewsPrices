review/summary: Easy installation, good results, great price.review/text: I wanted to try a water softener which evolved into a filtered shower head. Full on water softeners are a few hundred for a good product and I'm not willing to invest. This Culligan shower head was cheap and had positive reviews. The installation was very easy. Wrap the pipe coming out of your wall and assemble the few pieces of the head (ie: the neck swivel attachment, the filter cartridge) and screw it right onto the pipe. Sure it isn't metal but it went on and works like a dream. I'm very satisfied it lasted six months before I had to replace the filter media cartridge. It reduces the chlorine that makes my hair brittle and my skin itchy. It doesn't remove iron -- I don't think it does anyway. It has some good flow settings as well but I don't change them over too much. It is just plastic after all and might break.
