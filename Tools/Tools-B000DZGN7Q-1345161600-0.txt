review/summary: quietreview/text: We ordered this disposer when we had our kitchen remodeled. Our new sink is a 9" deep undermount, and we were concerned that the disposer may be too big to fit under it. While it takes up some space under the sink, we had at least a few inches clearance from the cabinet bottom.Our previous disposer was at least 15 years old and quite loud, so we were surprised at how quietly this runs.
