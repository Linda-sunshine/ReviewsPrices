review/summary: Changed our lives for the better!review/text: How nice to have this beautiful keypad lock to replace one (another brand) that has malfunctioned for years. It is sheer delight to go for a walk or bike-ride without a key, to return in the dark and push a button to light the easy to use keypad, and to have an opportunity to use 19 different codes. Each of our adult children has their own code. If we are out in the yard we have the option to have the lock off, but we will never be locked out again. There is a key slot as well.
