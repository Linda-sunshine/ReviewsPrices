review/summary: Don't be stupid and buy a standard (non-adjustable) ladder ever again.review/text: I am currently renting a house which i am responsible for all the maintenance for. It is now winter time and i needed to clean my gutters and investigate putting up x-mas lights.I did not have a ladder prior to buying this one, but i am one of those people who buy quality, buy once when concerning tools and other items similar in nature.I drive a VW GTI and while i can fit a ton of stuff in my car i didnt want to deal with going to lowes or home depot and picking up a regular ladder that i only need SOMETIMES, but i have to store and waste space on 100% of the time.realistically i only needed an 8ft ladder to do the work i was planning to do, but this 13' works perfectly. By comparison, a standard step stool is about 2/3 the size of this model when it is all collapsed up. Without adjusting it and only opening it, it is basically a REALLY amazing and STURDY step stool/ladder. More than enough to work on most things in the interior of your house without extending it (light bulbs, cleaning fans, painting, etc)...that is assuming you have roughly standard height ceilings and not vaulted ones.Extended up to its highest setting (but still not flipped like a standard ladder) allows you to reach most single story gutters and do any kind of roof maintenance you would need. If you want to safely climb onto a single story roof you just fold the ladder 180 and you are all set.If you are viewing this, you are at least considering this ladder. I highly recommend you get one of these werner models which will fit the height you need.These are amazingly overkilled engineering. I am a heavy guy and most ladders aren't exactly rated for my weight (most are 220lbs or whatever). I have full confidence in the build quality in this ladder.If you buy a regular ladder and its within the height range of what these telescoping ladders can reach you made a poor decision. If standard ladders are VCR this is blu-ray.The clear exception is if you need a fiberglass ladder for safety reasons, which in that case please don't buy this ladder :)
