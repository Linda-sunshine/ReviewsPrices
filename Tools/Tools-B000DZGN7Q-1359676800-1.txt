review/summary: Best Garbage Disposalreview/text: I've had about 6 garbage disposals in different houses, and I've replaced a couple of those myself as well. This is the best that I've had. The remarkable features for me are that it is very quiet running (it hums rather than rattles) and that it takes a lot less time to clear the food than others.The key to quietness seems to be the rubber coupling between the unit and the sink. It is quite isolated and really makes a difference.Another nice feature is the output pipe is captured positively and cannot come out on its own. Other designs rely on indirect rubber compression to hold onto a glossy plastic pipe which can work free over time, with the vibration that is inherent in common usage.One downside... something that they call out in the installation manual is that it has a sharp sound when it starts, by design to prevent jams on start-up. It can be startling, but easy to get used to. For me it is not bad so long as the ongoing sound is so quiet.
