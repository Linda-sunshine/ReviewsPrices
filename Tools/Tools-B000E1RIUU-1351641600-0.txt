review/summary: Product review of Victor M2524 Electronic Mouse trapreview/text: This worked great for the first 4 mice. I had to change the batteries three times during that period. After that, it quit working. It just made a continuous buzzing sound after the new batteries were put in the last time. That is a lot of batteries since it takes 4 AA at a time. Wish it lasted longer because it really zapped them good.UPDATE: Well, after writing this, I tried once more to use it and it quit the constant buzzing. I got another mouse with it. I guess it just needed a rest. My husband wants me to order another one so I guess I will. Other than the battery issue, it is actually pretty good.
