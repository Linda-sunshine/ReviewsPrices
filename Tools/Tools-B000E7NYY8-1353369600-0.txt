review/summary: I envisioned this thing and was happy to find it existed!review/text: I use this for an oil/electric rad near where I sleep.I don't use the timer but rather just switch it off when I wake.I would recommend adding degrees Celsius for us Canadians, preferably in at least 1/10 of a degree.Still I feel that in the spring and fall and times when you are running the real furnace, this thing should easily deliver savings.
