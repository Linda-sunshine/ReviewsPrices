review/summary: Schlage Camelot Keypadreview/text: I bought this lock because I'm tired of changing the locks on my house due to a teenage son that is irresponsible with his key. It has been the perfect solution, now I just have to change his key code and it doesn't cost me a dime!The deadbolt was very easy to install, I did it myself, and programmed the new key codes all within 20 minutes.My only complaint is that it isn't the most attractive lock ever. The "handle" that you turn to open the deadbolt is rather unsightly, as is the turn knob on the inside of the door, but the ease of the lock overrides its looks.I would definitely recommend this lock.
