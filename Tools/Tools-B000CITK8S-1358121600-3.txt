review/summary: Just about Perfectreview/text: I really love this thing. I go on long trips, and I've twice had my batteries die on me within the three year warranty period. Since those warranties are pro-rated, and it's a huge pain to drag them back to the store, wait for the test, etc., there's really no advantage to having your batteries die. I love the permanent ring terminal to plug set up that I can use to make it easy to hook up the battery charger to my vehicle and then know I don't have to worry about it anymore.Like another reviewer, I have an older BMW with the battery in the trunk. I just put a small piece of 1 x 2 under the light switch so that the light turns out when I close the trunk. Since I have waterproof electrical outlets in my garage (for washing cars), I cannot hook this up directly to the wall (because the outlets don't allow it), so I use a thick, outdoor, flat extension cord to go into the trunk, which also eliminates the possibility of damaging the charger's cable. I can still lock the car doors with the trunk open.I forget the rating, but I have an unusually large battery in that car, and the first time I hooked this charger up, it took more than 24 hours for the light to turn green (which was okay with me).
