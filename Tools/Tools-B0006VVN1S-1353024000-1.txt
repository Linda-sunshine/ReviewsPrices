review/summary: great product for a great pricereview/text: After checking a couple of shower heads, I decided to go with the Culligan. The price to function was the main purpose behind my choice. The product came in a timely fashion with free shipping. After a couple of uses, I am very happy. I live in Las Vegas, where the water is horrible so I instantly felt the difference. I don't know how much better the more expensive shower heads are, but you can't beat this product for the price.
