review/summary: Good-looking and functionalreview/text: Pros: Long cord, 12 outlets, 3 phone line, 2 coax, and 2 ethernet (didn't notice the ethernet until recently, since they were hidden under the cables).Starting with functionality, I never seem to have enough outlets to plug all my gadgets in so the main selling point for this unit was the availability of 12 outlets. The six outer outlets are spaced out perfectly, I've yet to find a wall wart that does not fit this power strip; this includes both vertical and horizontal transformers.The 12' cord also allows me to plug the strip into the next outlet to open up the closer outlet for more devices. I've not experienced any power surges, so I can't speak about that function, unfortunately (or fortunately). I also like the flat plug at the end, which allows me to plug this in behind objects.For aesthetics, I personally am a fan of the flat surfaces and 90-degree bends. Some may call it boxy, but I appreciate the clean, simple look. Transformers also sit better on the flat surfaces; no exposed prongs and no falling out.Cons: (Even) More outlets please.
