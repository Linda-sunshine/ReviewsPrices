review/summary: Jus' walkin' the dog...review/text: I have several MAGLITES. This is the best. It was bought as a replacement for one ruined by the alkaline batteries leaking. The light is bright and has a good spot without a black hole.I hope it lasts longer than another brand of LED with 220 lumens that I bought. After the first set of batteries it keeps getting dimmer.
