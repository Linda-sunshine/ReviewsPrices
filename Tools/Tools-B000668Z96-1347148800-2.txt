review/summary: Caught my dog instead!review/text: The only animal that this contraption caught was my poor miniature schnauzer! He managed to get his paw stuck in it, and we had to cut his fur to detach him from it! It didn't catch a single flea and that didn't surprise me. It was very cheaply made.
