review/summary: Holy cow!review/text: This was a Christmas present in 2012. I was really happy to get this, but when I got home to our small farm I was stunned with how bright it's focused beam can be! I shined it at a tree by the road, and could see it quite well. That tree is 309 yards away! Wow, this is a wonderful tool!!
