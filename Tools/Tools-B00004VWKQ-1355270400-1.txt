review/summary: AccuSharpreview/text: I have used this on many knives and believe that it sharpens better than any other brand sharpener of this style. A dull 420 stainless will shave a little after 10 pulls. If i have a little time I like to use this and then smooth out the edge with my compact leather strop. This leaves me with a good working edge for cutting rope to field dressing a deer. The angle isn't so steep that the blade wants to bend or chip easily but it is still plenty sharp for any job other than barbering. You can buy a better sharpener but they are all complicated or expensive and most of the time both. I own 5 other brands of sharpeners that are designed like this but they all truly can't come close to this one. They will all become extra gift this Christmas. I have some expensive sharpeners and will continue to use them on my most treasured blades (because they remove a little less metal when sharpening) but on any stainless or cheaper carbon blade I will now stick with the AccuSharp.
