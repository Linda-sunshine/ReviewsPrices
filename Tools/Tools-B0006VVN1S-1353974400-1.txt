review/summary: Wonderful Shower-headreview/text: This Shower-head is exactly what i wanted. I really only use the one setting as far as the water pattern but for me it has the perfect pattern.I read one review that said it was too narrow but i think its just fine for me. Also i believe the flow rate with the flow-restrictor in is plenty. I cant see myself ever wanting more flow. It also saves water this way.The filter keeps my shower cleaner longer as there are less deposits from everything in the water and my skin doesn't seem to dry out as much as it usually does but i cannot verify this.It was a since to install, filters last a while, and replacements are cheap, and the unit itself also has an attractive price.I would recommend this
