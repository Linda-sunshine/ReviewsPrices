review/summary: works well, good value, perhaps not as useful as hoped forreview/text: Everything was great from start to finish about this product. The only disappointment was that despite the rotated spacing of the outlets and seemingly useful design, it wasn't really different from a normal power strip. I tried changing plugs for different devices in an effort to free up an outlet that was hidden but to no avail. Good product though.
