review/summary: Keeps my battery alivereview/text: I use this to Winter my 2009 Harley Davidson Street Bob. I have yet to replace the battery in the bike and have had it since February 2009. I actually just put it on this evening because it is supposed to be Winter here in Wisconsin starting tonight. All I had to do is plug it in. My bike has a line off the battery that matches one of the ends on the Battery Tender. I just recommended one for a friend of mine and i heard about this exact item from a seasoned motorcycle rider. 5 stars
