review/summary: I REALLY wanted to give this 5 Stars...review/text: I purchased this Schlage Keypad door lock the day it was the Gold Box deal and I loved it at first because my wife has a tendency to leave without her keys and I've locked her out a few times. I saw this as an opportunity to stop doing that for good, unfortunately it hasn't turned out that way at all. I have had to already replaced it once for the keypad failing after some rain, and now, during hurricane Sandy, I am again in need of a new keypad. I can't keep replacing it like this every time it rains with a little wind! Soon enough Amazon is going to get tired of sending me new ones, and I can see it in my wife's eye, through the french door, that she is tired of trying to input her code with no results while being beaten by the howling wind, and tree branches. She's soaked, covered in debris, and fruitlessly trying to open the back door as I type this.I suppose I could get up and open the door for her, but the point of this stupid lock was that I wouldn't ever have to again! Should I abandon my principals every time it rains? Nay. I'm sticking to my guns, and come hell or high water, I will not be disturbed...and now she's banging on the windows. I think she's screaming, but I can't hear her over the wind, rain, and generator. The TV is a little loud right now too. I wonder what she's on about?Update 11/5/12: Shortly after Sandy blew her last puff, the lock has resumed normal operation without any issues so far. So since I didn't have to replace it this time, I've returned a star to my rating, and if the lock continues to work I will continue to add stars as my confidence in it returns.P.S. to the down rating individuals: what information did I not provide that you were looking for? Please leave a comment so I can either correct my review to be more thorough, or belittle you for being petty.
