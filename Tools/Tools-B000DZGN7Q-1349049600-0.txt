review/summary: Waste King L-8000 Garbage Disposalreview/text: Installation directions are very clear so it installed very easily. It comes with the necessary drain elbow & splash guard which is not clear from the on-line description. I replaced an old Insinkerator unit & was concerned about it fitting the existing plumbing. But, no problem, it went right in.So far it has been flawless. It seems to handle all recommended waste items without a problem. It is relatively quiet for a unit of this size & speed. Only time will tell if it holds up to its claims. I purchased this specific model because of the Consumer Reports recommendation.
