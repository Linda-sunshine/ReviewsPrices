review/summary: Works great, inexpensivereview/text: An excellent value for the price - 1HP for the cost of 1/3HP in the stores.The only issues I had were around installation. It uses a plug and so that required installing a GFC outlet box (you can take it apart and hard-wire a connection also). That said, any future replacements (heaven forbid) should be easier with the outlet, and having an outlet under the sink is likely to come in handy when doing repairs/etc. I also had issues with torque and the mount. The EZ mount was very easy to install (contrary to other reports I read), but the unit does tend to turn somewhat freely on it (not much friction holding it in place). That means that every time the unit starts the pipes tend to rotate (the drain is almost directly under the disposal, so the whole pipe assembly can rotate on a compression fitting). I ended up bracing a bit of the drain pipe against a piece of wood to keep it from slowly rotating around a few mm at a time lest that create a leak down the road. A piece of extra gasket rubber in the mount also added a tiny bit of friction which helps.I'm very happy with it overall. Just be sure to check your vertical clearance - I had to rework my pipes a bit to fit it in.
