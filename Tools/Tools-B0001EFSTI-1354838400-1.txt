review/summary: USELESSreview/text: This tool, while well constructed, is impossible to open without using a knife to pry it apart...and if I have a knife to open it, why the hell do I need this tool??? Maybe it will loosen up with use but then you'll have to worry about it inadvertently opening up and falling off your keychain. I'll stick with the Gerber mini pry bar thing I bought here.
