review/summary: Amazing knife sharpener for a great pricereview/text: This knife sharpener works very well. It is very easy to use and gives my knives a very sharp edge. I like how small and compact this sharpener is, easily small enough to throw into a kitchen drawer. I also have an electric sharpener, that also works very well...however, it was much more expensive than this and also takes up valuable cabinet space in my kitchen. Also, with the electric sharpener, it always seemed like a whole process to sharpen my knives. With this handheld sharpener, it's very quick and easy to sharpen. Personally, I can't really tell the difference between knives sharpened with this or my electric sharpener...they both give an extremely sharp edge, but this one was only a fraction of the cost. If you need a knife sharpener, then this is the one to buy...I can't imagine you would be unhappy with it.
