review/summary: Good for chlorine; not for hardness.review/text: I was suckered in by this showerhead's showing up in the search results for "shower water softener." I thought Well, it seems to work for a lot of people... But those people appear to be sensitive to chlorine, not hard water per se. For me, calcium is the problem, and carbon filters do approximately one nanosquat to reduce calcium levels. For that, you need ion exchange. (There is apparently only one ion exchange shower system on the market- see my comment on this review.)Nevertheless, there is nothing wrong with this head. It certainly does reduce chlorine levels, though I can't vouch for sulfur oxides or scale. So it performs as advertised, but not always as it's been reviewed. If your problem is hard water, this will not solve it. If you're sensitive to chlorine, this is the best carbon filter showerhead for the money.
