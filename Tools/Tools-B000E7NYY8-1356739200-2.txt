review/summary: Plug-in Setback Thermostat Solves Sunroom Draftreview/text: Despite assurances from the contractor, our sun room turned out to be under-heated. Supplementing the gas heat with an electric space heater was expensive, as SOMEONE always forgot to turn it off at night.Control-by-timer was choppy. The room was always too hot or too cold.Choosing a plug-in setback thermostat was easy... It came down the Lux WIN100 or nothing. Luckily, the folks at Lux did their homework.Installation is stupid-easy:1. Open the back and remove the ribbon that separates the batteries.2. Set the day and time.3. Straighten the temp sensing "antenna".4. Set the inside round dial to "RUN".5. Set the inside slide switch to "HEAT".6. Turn the heater on, set it to max heat.7. Plug the heater into the WIN100.8. Plug the WIN100 into a wall socket.9. Set the t-stat switch to "ON".If you walk away, the pre-sets will take care of changing the temp 4 times a day. Of course, the instructions lead you through adjusting times and temps to taste.All-in-all, the WIN100 does everything a 5 day / 2 day thermostat ought to do, with the added advantage that it requires no wiring or the cost and inconvenience of hiring a contractor.Brilliant!Just make sure you get a heater big enough to heat your space.
