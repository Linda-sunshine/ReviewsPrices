review/summary: Wonderful, but needs an extra clipreview/text: We previously tried a couple of Magic Mesh screens on our 72x80 french doors. They served the purpose for a while, but the magnets continually fell off and the lines/edges of the mesh really obstructed the view. The Bug Off screen is MUCH better quality than Magic Mesh and installed more securely. With an active family of four (2 adults work at home, 2 kids homeschool) and a large dog we use this door constantly. We've had the screen for about 6 months now and really couldn't be happier with it. The one suggestion I would have is to provide more of the metal clips, which are attached to the top of the door frame to support longer tension rods. For the 72" doors, I would have liked 2 more clips to supplement the tension rod and think this would prevent the few problems we've had with kids accidentally pulling the screen down.
