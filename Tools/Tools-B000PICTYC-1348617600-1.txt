review/summary: Axetastic!review/text: This is a great axe for the cost, its light, and is sharp to cut through just about anything a regular axe can cut. Turn the axe around and you have a fairly strong piercing point. Keep in mind this is a tactical axe and will dull with excessive cutting on rough or hard surfaces, its not a blunt force axe those are from hardware stores... So far I have sliced my way through a wooden panel fence, door knobs, pierced aluminum frames of vehicles and bikes, this is all done on my yard which i keep old abandoned things to later experiment with or destroy.
