review/summary: The best and the price is right!review/text: Our $550.00 Viking died after 5 years. I spent several days calling around to upscale kitchen stores (they are the only ones that sell Vikings locally) and found that the price of the Viking was still that much.Finally... I got smart and went on Amazon. This is where I found the Waste King and I am glad I did. The price was 1/5 the cost of the Viking and we have had this disposal installed now for two months. I am so please that I purchased it! It was easy to install and it is so quiet. When I turned it on the family was in awe of the low, quiet sound of the motor.I have put lots of food in the disposal (probably shouldn't) such as orange peelings, potato peelings, onlions, carrots, etc in large quantities. It works like a well oiled machine. Never againn will I pay the price I paid for the Viking when I have Waste King!
