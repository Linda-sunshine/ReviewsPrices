review/summary: Excellent Multi-Tool Productreview/text: The Swiss+Tech Utili-Key is a must have for every keychain. Several times before, I used my car key as a flathead screwdriver with unsuccessful results each time. Not anymore. This is a sleek, low-profile multi-tool that's extremely useful when you're in a pinch, and you need a phillips screwdriver but can't get to your toolbox.Big things do, in fact, come in small packages. I received mine via standard shipping in about 24 hours. Great little gadget for the price.
