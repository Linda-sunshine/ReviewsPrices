review/summary: Much better water taste - water pressure...not so good.review/text: Water pressure is greatly reduced, but the improvement in the taste (and smell) of the tap water makes the lack of water pressure something I can live with. I could not locate any filter indicator, letting me know when to change it. (Nothing in the directions, either.) I wish there was one on the unit. If I had any negatives with the product, those would be the 2 things I'd mention.
