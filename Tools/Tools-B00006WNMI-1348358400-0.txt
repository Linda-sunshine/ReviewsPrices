review/summary: It's Purple!review/text: Am I the only one who received a purple, not white, water filter? What the heck is going on?Obviously purple doesn't go with anyone's kitchen so I'm returning it. This is the strangest thing I've ever seen. Box is white, filter is purple.I have no idea how it works because I sent it back right away.
