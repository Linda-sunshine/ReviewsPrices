review/summary: For the Price, the Best Knife Sharpener Aroundreview/text: As a frequent home cook, I have tried pretty much every tool for sharpening knives. I've used both Chef's Choice electric sharpeners and a whetstone at various times. For my money, there is no better sharpener per-dollar than the AccuSharp knife sharpener. With a few quick strokes of the tool, it simply and easily sharpens both straight edge and serrated knives. Best of all, it is both inexpensive and completely portable. There are few tools I've found that compare.
