review/summary: Good Overall Work Glovesreview/text: I use these gloves for just about anything. Yard work, car work, electrical work, etc. They are good fitting and flexible. Also the tips of the fingers have a minimal amount of fabric. I would not use these for fine working (small wires, small buttons) but for most things around the house they are great.Note: It could be my particular hand shape compared to the shape of the glove but on the left glove a seam ripped near the thumb. I was able to stitch it back and has not been a problem since. Since the right hand is fine, I figured it was just my particular hand shape.
