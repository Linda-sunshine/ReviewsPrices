review/summary: Buy it!review/text: I'm glad I purchased this flashlight (MagLite ST3D016 3-D Cell LED Flashlight, Black). Until recently I almost never used flashlights. I got a dog a few weeks ago and walk her on trails at night before bed. I had been using my 12 year old incandescent 3D cell MagLite, but it just wasn't bright enough (to be fair, it has old batteries in it). But I knew I wanted to upgrade to a LED light and I like how the MagLite doubles as a club if needed, so after some research I landed on this one.To compare the two flashlights I removed the batteries from the old incandescent maglite and put them in this new LED one. I was amazed at the difference. This light is blindingly bright and goes so much further than the incandescent. There is no comparison between the two, I can't believe I didn't upgrade to LED sooner. When set to beam focus, there is still plenty of surrounding light to the point that I don't need to adjust it to flood light setting. However, if you do set to full flood light, there is still the black hole in the center as with the old maglites, but it's negligable compared to the incandescent. Also, the black hole seems to be smaller. But again, it's not necessary to use the full flood setting.After reading the other reviews there seems to be some question about which model or generation this LED is. For what it's worth, I received the one that says 131 lumens on the package. I think I'll buy another to keep in the car.
