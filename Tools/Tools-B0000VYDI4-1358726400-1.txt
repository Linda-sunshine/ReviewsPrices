review/summary: Does everything it promised and I can carry it by myself with no problemreview/text: My husband is a fix-it guy. We were using an inadequate ladder and borrowing a good one from the neighbors when we needed something bigger. I almost got him one bigger than the 17 foot but I'm glad I didn't. I can carry this one easily and use it when he's not home. He replaced a long flourescet fixture in the closet recently and I was able to stand on one side of the ladder with him on the other. That way I could hold it in place while he did the hard work. It's easy to work and very sturdy.
