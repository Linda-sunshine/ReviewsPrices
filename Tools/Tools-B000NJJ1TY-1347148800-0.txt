review/summary: Great Lockreview/text: This is the second Schlage keypad lock that I've added to my house. I absolutely love the convenience of never having to remember a key again. We can leave the house to go for a walk and have to worry if we locked the door because the door is always locked, (unless you turn the tumbler). Highly recommended to anyone looking for a high quality keypad door lock.
