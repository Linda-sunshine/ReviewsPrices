review/summary: Very Helpful, not 100%review/text: This bug zapper was effective. I saw a marked decrease in the number of mosquitoes around my yard since I put it up. We were in the midst of one of the worst plagues of mosquitoes I've seen in 30 years of living in Florida, and now I see a lot less. It's not like I can go outside and never see a mosquito, but I would say there's probably 5-10% of what there was before. I would recommend this product.
