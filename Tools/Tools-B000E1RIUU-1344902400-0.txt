review/summary: Kills Micereview/text: This thing works great. Put a dab of peanut butter inside, arm, wait. No poisons, no squished mice, no fuss.I am using this outside, so I put it into an open ziploc bag to prevent moisture from getting in it. Mice don't seem to care.The alarm light (mouse caught!) doesn't really work as far as I can see. That's a bit of a drag. Maybe I missed to check right after the mouse got in. If you don't check the trap regularly you might end up with a decomposing heap of sticky something which spoils that clean fun a bit. In my case, when there is a mouse inside, after a little while ants start to frequent it, that's a sign for me that I should have checked earlier. Wish it had some sort of red warning led that stays on when a kill is made. How about send me an email??????? :)Edit - wanted to add that the alarm light DOES work, the interval is just a bit long so you have to wait a few seconds for the blink. I have murdered so far about six mice that lived in my compost heap. Pretty soon there will be no more. Yummy peanut butter, can't resist...
