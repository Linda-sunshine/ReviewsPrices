review/summary: Easy installation and seems to work well.review/text: I followed the instructions and was able to install it without a lot of trouble. Initially I put the gasket too high so the disposal would not click into the collar. Should have practiced more before installing like the instructions tell you too. The connections for the dishwasher and drain were both easy to connect. I have not put much down it yet but so far no problems.
