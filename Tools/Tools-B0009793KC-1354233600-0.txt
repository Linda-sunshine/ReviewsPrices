review/summary: One minor flawreview/text: The filter seems to work well with my model refrigerator but there's one minor flaw that may be due to the product but may just be error on my part. Each time I change the filter (once every six months or so), I run the water dispenser to prime the flow like the instructions say. Then, when I remove my cup from the trigger that starts and stops the flow, the flow gets stuck on and keeps shooting water out even though the trigger is no longer pressed. It eventually sputters out once the air bubbles in the line have flowed through, but the minor annoyance (again, possibly my own fault) keeps the product from getting five stars.
