review/summary: Versatile, butreview/text: This is a well built ladder and very versatile, but it is very heavy. I thought once I bought this ladder it would be the only one I needed, but it is so heavy that I only pull it out when I absolutely have to. I ended up getting a small cheap aluminum step ladder and a hand me down aluminum extension ladder than I use for most things. I give it four stars because it is a great ladder, it is just to big for me to haul around to change a light bulb.
