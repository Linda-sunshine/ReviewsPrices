review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I've had nothing but problems with the Waste King L-8000 Garbage disposer. Based on the ratings on Amazon and the life time warranty offered by Waste King, I purchased this model in Jan. It was installed by a professional plumber. It started leaking from the place it attaches to the sink in about 2 months; I called up the plumber. After a while, he came over and re-attached it. He told me that this would again develop a problem and suggested that I replace it with the insinkerator from Home Depot. I disregarded his advice. After 3 months, the unit again started leaking from the same place. I called up Wasteking and they said that this is an installation issue and they can not help. I called up another plumber. He found that the installation was not done properly, the disposer was sort of leaning on the drain pipe and over a period of time, it became loose. The second plumber changed the position of the pipes. He also advised me that I should just change to the insinkerator. Now after a few months, the disposer is leaking again from the exact same place. The third plumber I called up advised over phone that I should replace this disposer and that this particular model would not attach properly. I'm giving up now and am buying an insinkerator from the Home Depot. I've spent more than 400$ on the product+installation+re-installation over last several months. I'm tired of it now. But I must say that the Wasteking disposer seems to work okay. The attachment from the sink keeps coming loose every other month..
