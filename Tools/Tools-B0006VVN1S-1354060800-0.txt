review/summary: Aesthetically appealing and usefulreview/text: I'm going to start with the only con I can think of, then I'm going to gush about this thing.When it arrives it will come with a filter, but that filter will have stickers on both sides that must be taken off. There are no tabs to grip the fully sealed stickers. You will be frustrated because after the battle you go through getting off the first sticker, you get to repeat the process on the second sticker.Everything after that initial battle will be enjoyable though. Installation couldn't be easier.First, I squirted some CLR onto steel wool and cleaned the shower pipe, Then, I wrapped the Teflon tape they give you around the pipe 5 times (you'll have a lot of extra Teflon tape). Make sure you leave the last few threads without tape. If Teflon tape is too close to the end of the pipe it can cause water flow issues. After that just twist the shower head on, and your done. Simple as that.I recommend getting a filtered shower head because all public water has chlorine in it, and even though there's far less than in a swimming pool it still has a slight drying effect on your skin. This filter eliminates most of that chlorine leaving your skin healthier. Even if you don't have issues with dry skin you'll likely notice the difference in your hair.
