review/summary: Nice Heater but Expensive to Runreview/text: PRO: This little oscillating heater is really quite nice. It has a cool look to it and delivers a good amount of heat. It has multiple heat level settings and can be set to shut off automatically if desired. The remote control is a nice touch. I thought it would be one of those nice-but-unnecessary accessories, but I actually found it useful to lower or increase temperature without getting up.CON: The only negative thing is that is uses a lot of electricity. That is to be expected since it is an electric heater and it has been unusually cold here. We blew circuit breakers when we used a hair dryer at the same time as these heater. We rarely blow circuit breakers under normal circumstances, so this occurrence pointed out just how much extra electricity we were using.
