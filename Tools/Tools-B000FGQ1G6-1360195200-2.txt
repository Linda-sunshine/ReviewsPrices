review/summary: Must Have Pro Grade Tool for Torx T-5 Screwsreview/text: Purchased this originally to open up my Dell XPS laptop. At first I didn't think I would have any other uses for it and it would just collect dust however as soon as I received it I needed it for some other projects that came up. The actual tool is exceptionally designed with a swivel top allowing the tool to be used with a single hand in tight spots. The interchangeable bits are magnetized which is a must. The quality of the product as well as the case and layout of the bits is exceptional. Better than expected with so many bits it can be used for any electronic item I foresee coming across any time soon. My only very small suggestion is improving the locking mechanism on the case latch however that is a very small caveat for an overall 5 star product. Did I use the word caveat in previous the sentence properly? Anyways, get this tool for any small screw type including t-5 torx and you will be satisfied. The 30pcs cover all the different sizes of screws ive come across ensuring no stripping.
