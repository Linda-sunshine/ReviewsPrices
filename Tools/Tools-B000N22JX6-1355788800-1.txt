review/summary: Heats up a room quietly and seemingly efficientlyreview/text: I can't say I can track the cost of using this versus an existing fake 'fireplace' electric heater. All I know is that the fireplace type would be running on high hour after hour and not doing the job this one does. Based on when it shuts off (comparing to the house thermostat in the room), it seems very accurate.It is relatively quiet and is somewhat stylish.... Has the 5 degree increments for the temperature setting, with a high and low switch (fan speed) to adjust for heating speed or room size.
