review/summary: LIGHTNING DEAL!review/text: Perfect for light duty use. I seriously have doubts about product longevity if one were to inflate a full size car tire from 0psi to 35 psi. This unit is relatively LIGHT weight! So I don't trust the quality of this compressor to withstand heavey duty use.Finally AC/DC plug, yes the AC cord length is extremly short, so for outdoor use you will need an extension cable. This is so that the cord can fit in the box.This unit is realatively loud, its a compressor.Auto shut off, you set the max psi on the illuminated guage!!I had added this in my cart awhile ago and I had noticed a price drop, expires in a few minutes, was 60 on sale for 35!! Now only if I can land a deal in the Amazon Vine program other than free books and other misc crap.Glad I got the deal, at retail price kind of pricey, at 35 bucks great deal, but again I dont trust it for heavy duty use. Inflated bicycle tires in less than a minute, I use my scuba tank to inflate my car tires 0-60 in less than a minute, whisper quiet (sure its more on the bulky/heavy side but its cool to inflate car tires that fast, this BlackDecker is more convient to inflate bicycle/balls with than dragging out my scuba tank ;-)
