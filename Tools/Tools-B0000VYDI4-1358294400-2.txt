review/summary: Werner MT-22 300-Pound Duty Rating Telescoping Multi-Ladder, 22-Footreview/text: I initially wanted the 17' version of this ladder, feeling it would be tall enough for my use. Then after reading other comments that the 17' really doesn't let you get to that height safely so I went with the 22'. Yes it is heavier than the 17' but not as heavy and awkward as my 28' extension ladder. The fact that it folds into a compact size is one of the main reasons I made the purchase. Additionally the cost was less than the17' which was even more important and Amazon free shipping made it a worthwhile purchase. I have already recommended this product to friends and family. Something consumers should be aware of is the first few times I used it, retracting the locks and extending the ladder does take some getting use too, so I recommend taking it outside and practicing the operation until you are comfortable you can use it in the house without knocking things off the walls or dinging up the walls. My wife prompted me to add this to my product review.
