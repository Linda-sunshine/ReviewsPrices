review/summary: Excellent Surge Protectorreview/text: After setting up my entertainment center and desktop pc on a pair of these I easily made my money back on my next power bill. Granted, any surge protector could serve that function, finding one with enough outlets lead me to these.I was a bit worried about connecting my cable modem through these as I wanted to keep a signal available even with the surge protector switched off, but it actually still transmits signal regardless of its power status.
