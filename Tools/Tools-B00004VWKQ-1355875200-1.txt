review/summary: Well worth buyingreview/text: I'm no knife expert, but I do like to cook and I also want sharp knives to chop with. I had been sharpening my knives on the little sharpener on the back of my can opener, but that wasn't working so well so I invested in the AccuSharp. I have a large Rada chef's knife, a Farberware santoku, and a Kuhn Rikon paring knife that I've been using it on and it makes them really nice and sharp. Actually, the santoku was quite pathetic...I had quit using it. But now it is very sharp and gets used every day. I know, they are very inexpensive knives that I am sharpening. The first time I used the sharpener on my knives, I did notice some metal shavings coming off of them. But that no longer happens.
