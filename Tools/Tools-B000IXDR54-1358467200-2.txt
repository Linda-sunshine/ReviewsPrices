review/summary: Great Flashlightreview/text: This is one of the best flashlights on the market. For the price you can't duplicate. I did not want a rechargeable because the batteries don't last too long. I replace the batteries every six months and never have a dead flashlight. Would highly recommend this flashlight for a good one to have around the house. Tested the light distance and was very impressed.
