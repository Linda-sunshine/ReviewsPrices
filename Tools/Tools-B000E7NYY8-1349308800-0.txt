review/summary: Doesn't work well with kerosene torpedo heatersreview/text: I give this a 5 star rating because it is a nice product. My problem with it was I chose to use it with a kerosene heater instead of an electric heater. I bought this to use with my 125,000 btu kerosene torpedo heater in my garage. Even if I programmed the setback differential to the max setting, it still only allowed a 8 degree temp spread. Meaning if I set it for 70, it kicks on at 62, then heats back up to 70 and shuts off. My garage isn't insulated and the too frequent cycling causes too much kerosene fumes. This isn't the thermostats fault, it's the heaters by design. Every time a torpedo heater fires up or shuts off, they put out fumes. Instead I just started using a remote 120v switch made for christmas tree lights. Works better for me, as I can just fire up and shut down the heater anytime I want from the remote which I hang from my belt loop. Run it up to 80, then let it cool back down to 50. There is enough air leakage to clear out the little fumes I get.
