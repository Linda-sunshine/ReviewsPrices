review/summary: Happy I had it for sandyreview/text: I live in Jersey and with the storm that hit I volunteered for rescue. At first I was comtemting leaving the tomahawk home, but I took just in case. Well the case presented itself when a big steel door couldn't open and 12 people were stuck inside. Instead of having to go all the way back for tools. I just used the spike and busted the lock and hinges. Those people were really happy not to have to wait two more hours for us to come back. Great piece of equipment. A true multi-tool.
