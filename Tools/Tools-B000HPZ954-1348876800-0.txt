review/summary: Great surge protectorreview/text: I love this thing, 12 plug in ports, 6 for the bulkier a/c adapters, 6 for straight through plug ins, coaxial and phone line connections included as well. Sliding safety covers on all the plugs prevent any mishaps (just make sure you open them before stashing it behind a giant entertainment center so you don't have to grab a flashlight every time you want to hook something up). Attached is a massive 8 foot cable to snake however backwards way you need to get your system up and running. The connector on the cable is also a right angle plug in so you won't have that jutting out from the way thing going on. Comes with a lifetime warranty and warranty for connected devices. Not a thing bad to say about it.
