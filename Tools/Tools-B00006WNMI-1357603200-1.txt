review/summary: Worked great until the 2nd replacement filter was addedreview/text: I purchased and installed the filter and it worked great. I replaced the filter cartridge after 3 months. Again - great for another 3 months. When I went to replace the filter cartridge at 6 months, it leaked. I thought it was the new filter cartridge so i returned it. I tried that filter & it leaked. I took it off and tried the old filter that had worked. It too leaked, so I sent back the entire unit. I hope that works! Product is great when it works, but a hassle to replace.
