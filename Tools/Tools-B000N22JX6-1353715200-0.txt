review/summary: Quality and Beautyreview/text: I always hold my breath whenever I order online a product that I've not seen in person but I can tell you that this is a winner. It sits on top of my toilet tank as a bathroom heater and looks like art. The curvy shape is attractive as is the color. The unit has quite a bit of heft to it giving the feeling of quality and stability. It puts out plenty of heat in a small room and is very quiet. I really like that it has a timer on it too so that it shuts off in 1,2 or 4 hrs if you wish. It is such a pleasure to discover a utility device that is also decorative. Love it!
