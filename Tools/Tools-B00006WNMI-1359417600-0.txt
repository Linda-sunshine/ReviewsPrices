review/summary: Culligan filter a waste of timereview/text: I bought this because of the ratings and would filter more gallons. Spent a whole day looking for an adaper that would fit a Peerless/Delta faucet with external threads. Never could find one. Funny, the Pur one fit faucet perfectly. Sent this back.
