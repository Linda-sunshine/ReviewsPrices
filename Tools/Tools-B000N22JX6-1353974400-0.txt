review/summary: cheap plastic, mediocre heatreview/text: I'm really not sure who all these happy reviewers are unless their version of this heater is somehow magically different than mine.Starting with the superficial: It is NOT, despite the claims here, an "attractive" heater. A unique shape and a stand does not equal attractive. It is made from a very cheap looking speckled plastic. Very tacky.I haven't experienced the technical issues others have and I have had it well over a year. But if you intend to heat a space larger than a closet, this is not the option for you. You have to place the heater right by your feet, set it on max, and huddle yourself over it in order to actually experience anything resembling heat. Only when the air is blowing (wafting?) directly on to you will you feel anything from this unit.The size in the description is a typo that hasn't been fixed since amazon has carried this item, by the way. It is a very small unit, puts out a small amount of heat, and has very little charm. If style, design, and functionality are important in your heater purchase, this might not be your ideal choice.
