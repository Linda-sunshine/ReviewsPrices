review/summary: The installation instructions are incorrect!review/text: I've read most of the comments written on the Waste King L-8000 and I came to this conclusion, whoever wrote the comments on this item either work for the manufacturer or just don't know what they are talking about. I read the directions several times and they state that you place the mount ring on the sink flange and then place the cushion mount on the flange, making sure the groove on this ring fits into the bottom ring of the sink flange. You then place the disposer up onto the mounting ring and turn the ring which locks the disopser in place. I re-read the direction and tried to place the diposer onto the lock ring, impossible, there isn't enough room between the ring and the diposer. After trying for two hours I went on UTUBE and a woman stated she had the same problem and the correct way to do it is to place the cushion mount onto the flange, but don't push it up into the grove on the flange, I tried it and it works, The directions should have stated this and it would have saved alot of aggravation. The other problem is that the diposer makes a very lound noise as it is first turned on. I would not buy this product again.
