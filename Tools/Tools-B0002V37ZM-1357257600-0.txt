review/summary: Stops working after a few yearsreview/text: This item is nice looking and easy to install. We installed it behind a door to the back stairway and when you open and close the door the brooms will swing and bump into the door, so it's better off against a wall.It does not work well with thin, metal handles such as swifter, etc.Our back stairs area is not weathered and gets very cold in the winter and very hot in the summer. After 4+ years the rubber on the balls just stiffens and stops working as designed. The brooms will slide off and block the door from opening properly.I guess replacing it every few years is a compromise given the circumstances but just be aware of that.
