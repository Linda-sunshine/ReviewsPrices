review/summary: Nice gadgetreview/text: I bought this to monitor the power consumption of different appliances in the house particularly the computer and big screen tv. Also was able to see the wattage of a regular 100-bulb christmas light which sucks up almost 60 watts compared to 4.5 watts for an LED type. Will never decorate outside of house using non-LED lights again.
