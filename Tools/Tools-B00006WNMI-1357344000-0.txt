review/summary: Instantly cleaned up water taste; so easy to installreview/text: We had some foul tasting water in one of the suburbs of Philadelphia. The filter installed on our faucet in five minutes or so. We let the water run for ten minutes to initialize the filter, and then drank some. The foul taste was gone, and the water was just like it should be, tasteless.Yesterday, the water coming out of the normal faucet looked cloudy, something in the water that dissolved eventually. Just pull the pin to switch to the filter, and the water was crystal clear.
