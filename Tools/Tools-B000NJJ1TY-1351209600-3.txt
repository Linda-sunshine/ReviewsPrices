review/summary: Ease of usereview/text: I bought this product after seeing it in a local store. The product arrived in perfect condition. The instructions were a little hard to understand but I worked through that. I was not able to use this in the location I wanted because it requires a 3-1/2" spacing between the dead bolt and the new lock. I don't remember that measurement being mentioned any where in the literature. Installation was easy and programming the codes worked out fine. I will buy another one for a second location in the hoiuse after I check the clearance between the dead bolt and lock
