review/summary: Sharpened my Victorinox Fibrox to like newreview/text: What is there to say other than this knife sharpener seems to work fine. I sharpened my dulling Victorinox Fibrox on this following the helpful instructions and it came out good as I remember it when it was new. The angle isn't adjustible, so special angle knives wouldn't be suitable to use, but it's set to 22.5 out of the box and does it well. The device is light but the parts that need to be stable and secure are and I definitely feel in control when using it.
