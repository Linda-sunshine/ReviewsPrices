review/summary: Great, but easily lostreview/text: I just lost my third one of these. I am not sure what is going on, but they seem to just fall off. I have a few other Swisstech keychain tools that have been with me for years. Seems this one comes loose in a few months at most. Otherwise it is a great tool.
