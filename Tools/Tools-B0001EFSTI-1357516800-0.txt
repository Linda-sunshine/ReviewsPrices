review/summary: Almost Perfectreview/text: I've had this tool for a couple weeks now and it's wonderful. I've mainly been using the knife, though at one point I was happy to be able to tighten an annoying loose cabinet handle with the screwdriver. My only complaints, and they're really more suggestions to achieve perfection, would be that it's just a touch difficult to open and I wish that it stayed on my key ring when it was open. I keep dropping my keys.For $9 this is a must have for anyone who could fathom needing to use any of the tools.
