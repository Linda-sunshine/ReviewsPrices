review/summary: The ultimate flashlight!review/text: I had very high expectations for this flashlight, but I didn't expect to be grinning like a kid on Christmas when I used it for the first time. This thing is built like a tank and the LED lamp is amazing. I compared to my regular incandescent bulb flashlight and it was so dim in comparison I changed the batteries to make sure. The beam is adjustable and when I focused it and shined it out my bedroom window, I was lighting up all the windows on the neighbor's house across the street! Hopefully they didn't get too alarmed!This is a big flashlight. It is about a foot long. It's a very simple time-tested design. I feel like this will last as long as my last 20 $5 plastic energizer flashlights combined, which makes it a good value. Also, in comparison to the 2-D model of this same flashlight, this 3-D version gets 10x the battery life (80 hours!). That's a huge savings in batteries which easily pays for the upgrade cost from the non LED model and helps the larger size become easier to swallow.Anyway, if you are here looking at this you already know you want a high quality, bright, and long lasting flashlight. This is the one.
