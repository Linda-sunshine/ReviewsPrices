review/summary: Semi-Effective at Bestreview/text: Living feet from the ocean, we like to keep the doors open all year 'round, unfortunately our little traditional Mexican bungalow doesn't have screen doors.First of all, the thing looks terrible. I mean, I know it's not going to be great looking, but I was hoping for something a little less Boy Scout Jamboree Chic. Secondly, flies seem to have no problem getting around or through the magnetic closure. In fact, I think they have an easier time of it than I do.A terrible purchase. Look elsewhere!
