review/summary: It Grinds, It Chops, It Dices and Blends!review/text: I bought this to replace a 1/3 Badger disposal that got locked up after grinding up golf balls and nails... or something like that. None the less, I picked up this off Amazon as a replacement based on the reviews. The device itself was easy to install. The only issue I had was that I did need the power cord attached and it was difficult to take it off as there is a rubber butt end that I had to stab out with a steak knife. This task took as long to do as the rest of the install. Once I got the plug-in cable removed, I was able to wire up the cable. Everything was very easy to do and a couple of YouTube videos helped. The one thing I did not do was tighten the coupling to the sink tight enough and it wound up leaking. Since it comes with a rubber gasket, no plumbers putty was required... although I wonder if I had used it, if it would have even leaked. I tested it by throwing in some ice cubes and it chopped them up just fine. Golf balls and nails are not recommended but marbles were turned into sand. Highly recommend.
