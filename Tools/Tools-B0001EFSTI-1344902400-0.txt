review/summary: Interesting little gadgetreview/text: This is an interesting little gadget to carry with you. It is a little larger than a car key (the kind with the plastic end). It is a little difficult to get open, but that isn't a bad thing seeing how a mini knife is in my pocket.It will open 90 degrees or 180 allowing you to use whichever part you are trying to use.When you open it comes off the key ring so you don't have to thread it through each time you want to use it and again when you finish using it. You just clamp it right back on.
