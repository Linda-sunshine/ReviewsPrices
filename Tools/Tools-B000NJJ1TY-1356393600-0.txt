review/summary: Just love thesereview/text: I bought 4 for my home. You can change codes, lock codes, delete codes. I can't imagine going back to regular knobs. The handle is easy to open when you have hands full. It is solid. Nice to have a key backup. You can hear the lock engage... nice to be able to hear that. When battery gets low, sometimes it doesn't throw the lock all the way, though. Which isn't bad, cause this is a sign you need to replace the batteries. I love these.
