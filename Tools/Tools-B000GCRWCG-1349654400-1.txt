review/summary: Life saver?review/text: This is another item you should have plenty of. Put them in your vehicles, bail out bags, get home bags, emergency kits, and camping gear. They could be a life saver as one can die in 30 minutes due to exposure in the wrong conditions. The last one i used was to cover an accident victim to keep him from going into shock, it seemed to work well.
