review/summary: Great, comfortable gloves.review/text: Bought these for my step-father. He had duck taped gloves that were probably older than me. I found these gloves online and figure I'd try them for him. I was afraid they wouldn't fit (he has stubby/fat fingers)--the stretch is really accommodating! They are made of a comfortable material and are padded around the joints.
