review/summary: Perfect to have for an emergency!review/text: We recently had a major late-season hurricane here (Sandy). We were without power for a week and it got down into the 30s a few of those nights. I had bought a 10-pack of these a couple of years ago to keep in our cars and with camping gear as a &#34;just in case&#34; thing for if the car broke down in cold weather or we got an unexpected cold front on a camping trip. They are quite small when in the package. Easily fit into a glove compartment or even the storage compartment inside the car door.During the recent power outage, these things saved our butts. They were each big enough to wrap around a normal sized adult. We put them around us, over our clothes or pajamas, and then put blankets on top of us. They kept us warm enough to be able to sleep in a 35 degree house. The down side is that they make loud crinkly noises whenever you move. Like sleeping in a giant chip bag. But I'll take noise over freezing. I wouldn't leave a baby or small child unattended with this because it is mylar (plastic) and could pose a suffocation threat. I ordered more right after the power outage because I don't ever want to be without these. For the price, they are well-worth it. One of those things you hope you never have to use but are glad when you need it and it's there.
