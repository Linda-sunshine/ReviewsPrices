review/summary: Did what I needed....review/text: Got this because we were treating our indoor dog for fleas and didn't want to treat whole house with unnecessary chemicals. Wanted to see how significant our problem was. Put a trap in bedroom where she sleeps and one near litter boxes where our dog doesn't go and caught a couple fleas in each. Once we got the indoor cats treated we haven't noticed anymore fleas in traps or on animals. But I left them out for awhile cause they were also catching small gnats. Definitely worth buying because it saved us from buying and using a lot of chemicals. Wouldn't expect it to solve a large problem but definitely helped in &#34;monitoring&#34; our flea situation.
