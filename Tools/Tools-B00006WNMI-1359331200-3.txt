review/summary: Too slow (update: Impossibly s-l-o-w)review/text: Just installed this filter. The obvious plus is that it is easy to install, and as noted by others it's a nice touch that valve/ switch automatically returns to tap water after filter. On my previous filter I (or others!) would forget to switch it back.The water tastes good -- gets the heavy chlorine taste out nicely.My main complaint, and a deal breaker for me, is that the water is just too slow through the filter. I timed it and it takes 50 seconds to fill 1 pint (=2 cups = 500mL). So it would take 1'30" to fill one of my regular bottles or 7.5 minutes to fill my five water bottles? That's just nuts.The previous filter i had, Purenex SS-1 Countertop Water Filter, is much bigger and but water could come through much faster. The reason I got rid of that was that I lost the little device you need to get it open to change the filter.Not sure there's a perfect filter out there, but if flow rate matters to you then avoid this!Update: I've had this filter about 2 weeks now and the flow rate issue has become impossible. It took 5'04" to fill a 620 mL Sodastream glass bottle. This not an exaggeration -- actually I took out my iPhone to time it after it had started filling. It would literally take me 25 minutes to fill 5 bottles? Or if I want to fill a glass of water directly from the tap to drink 2 minutes? Nuts. I should mention I have perfectly normal water pressure directly from the tap so that's not it.I will get rid of this as soon as possible and would never recommend to it anyone else.
