review/summary: Review for 22-foot versionreview/text: The MT-22 (22 foot) ladder is absolutely perfect for my needs and I am glad I settled on this model.Upon receiving the ladder, I took it outside and gave the unit a quick once over to ensure it worked as expected and had arrived undamaged. I first extended the ladder to the largest "Step" position and climbed the unit to the higher rungs. I was quite amazed how solid and sturdy the ladder felt - much better than any other ladder I've ever used. I then laid the unit down and extended it up to the "extension" position then laid it up against my home, (with help from my wife). I felt confident climbing high on this ladder, as again, it felt more than able to support my weight easily without any disconcerting "bounce" as I moved. I've not yet tried the ladder on a stairway with each side of the unit at different heights, but already know there will not be an issue should I ever need to.The spring loaded J-Locks to control the extension are a great innovation and make extending and retracting the ladder a very simple and safe process. The push knob mechanism to turn the ladder from a step to an extension ladder is also very well designed to make the transition simple.To conclude, this ladder is exceptional quality and I am very happy I bought this model over any available alternative. I would recommend this range to anyone in the market for a multi-ladder. It really is the only ladder I'll likely ever need.
