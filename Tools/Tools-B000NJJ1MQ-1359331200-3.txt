review/summary: Trick to bump proof itreview/text: I was looking for a digital lock that wouldn't have the key override option, so it couldn't be key bumped. I couldn't find such lock for less than $200 and decided to go with this lock and just jam the key hole with some aluminum foil. But as it turns out - there is simple modification that can get me where I want to be without damaging the lock.Watch a video on YouTube called "Removing the Cylinder from the BE365 for Re-keying". At 1:20 narrator is talking about removing the block and the washer. The modification I came up with is to swap those two - this way the block can't be pushed into the the cutout and thus can't engage the deadbolt - simple and efficient. As a result, you can't open the door from the outside even with the proper key, so key bumping is rendered useless.Granted, you should not do this if you have only single door in your house/apartment, because when the battery is dead - you have to break something to get in. I have front door, back door, and garage door, so there is no chance that I'd be locked out in case battery goes down in one of the locks. And even if in some crazy coincidence the battery goes down in both locks simultaneously - garage door is operating on AC and the battery for remote is replaceable from the outside.If you give everyone in the family their own code - buttons will wear out more evenly and it will be harder to guess combination.I hope this helps someone.
