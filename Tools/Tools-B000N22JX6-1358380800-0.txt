review/summary: Attractive Little Heaterreview/text: Odered this little heater beacause it wAS attractive and we could leave it out in the room instead of having to hide some ugly space heater. it doesn't send the heat very far but I didn't expect it to. Perfect for our TV viewing area in cornerof the family room in front of our recliners. Love the Remote control too. gets a little noisy at times so we just shut it off to cooldown.
