review/summary: Don't like this, I think it's a waste of moneyreview/text: I don't like this. I think it's a big waste of time and money. I had a reverse osmosis water system before this, so it of course could never compare, but I thought it might at least do something for me since some of the reviews were good. The water comes out of this very slow, too slow for me to stand and wait.Just invest in a reverse osmosis water system, that's the best in the long run and then you don't have to mess with contraptions like this.
