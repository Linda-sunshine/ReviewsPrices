review/summary: Good value for the pricereview/text: Battery tender works well and colored LED's indicate the status of the charger. It works as advertised and had the appropriate connection devices to hook to my motorcycle battery. I am very satisfied with this battery tender and will buy another one if needed for my snowmobiles.
