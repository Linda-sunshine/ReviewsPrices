review/summary: Good when you use it, but hard to change the filterreview/text: Before I change the filter, I will give 5 stars, everything went perfectly. I like the filter lock, every time you pull it up and it will go back after you use the filter. You will be surprised when you found it is so hard to open the filter to change a new one. Thus, you may need to buy a new set, do not buy a filter until you can open the filter cap and make sure you can put the new one in.:)
