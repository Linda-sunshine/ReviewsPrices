review/summary: Waste King L-8000review/text: After reading the reviews on this website and 'Consumer's Reports', I decided to replace our old Insinkerator disposal with a Waste King L-8000. Being a guy who hates plumbing projects, I felt the installation went quite well. After removing the old garbage disposal unit, I was able to install the new disposer using only the parts that were provided with the unit. (After installation, I did need to purchase a couple plastic pipes and elbows from a local store so that the pipes would match up to the old waste pipes.) The Waste King was worked well for a month now, and is much quieter than the old unit. I'd highly recommend this unit to family and friends... I'd also recommend they purchase this unit from Amazon who had the best price available when I purchased it.
