review/summary: The tool you've always neededreview/text: Put simply, this is the tool you always say you need to buy, and never do.I can't count on all fingers and toes how many times I've wanted to hook a socket up to my drill. You always have those small bolts you want to take off quickly, and socket wrenches make this a pain in the butt. These are really solidly built (albeit, this is a hard product to mess up) straight, not bent or anything like that, and work great in my driver.
