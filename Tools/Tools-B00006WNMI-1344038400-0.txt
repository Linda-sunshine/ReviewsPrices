review/summary: Culligan FM-15A Level 3 Faucet Filterreview/text: I use this filter and it worked nicely. I did not drink the water though I just cooked with it, so I do not know how it taste. I also washed my dishes and hands which where not as dry as before I used the filter. I made a household move so I have not been using one and my hands are dry, cracky and itchy again, now that I am settled, I am going to buy another one.
