review/summary: Add foam plugs for use with firearmsreview/text: I have had these for 10 years, they are superb (30DB is about the highest rating I could find) However, when used with 40 cal ammo, I still have some ringing in right ear after a month+. For shooting, even a .22, use with foam and make sure the foam seals off well before putting these on. At 130DB+ your getting 100db through your muffs. 80 is the supposed max, but I use these to vacume the house, or any noise, including hammers. Keep your ears as long as you can!
