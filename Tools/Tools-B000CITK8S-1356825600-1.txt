review/summary: 4th onereview/text: I now have 4 Battery Tenders, this being my 2nd Battery Tender Jr. I use the larger models for 2 cars I store each winter, and I use the Jr. models for my generator and my lawn tractor. Easy to use and work great, I've not yet needed to replace a battery after a storage season.
