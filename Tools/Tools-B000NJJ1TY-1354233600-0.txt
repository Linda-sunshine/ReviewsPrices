review/summary: Worked good for 7 daysreview/text: I received the lock promptly. Installation was good and was delighted with the preformance. After a few days it malfunctioned. I tried everthing in the directions, but was forced to call the 800 number. I was told that the lock was defective and a replacement would be sent.After 12 days no replacement had arrived. I rechecked the e-mail and noticed it stated it may take up to 18 days. The lock arrived today and was installed.The company stands behind their product, and Amazon is great.Maury
