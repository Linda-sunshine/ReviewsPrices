review/summary: Works like a dreamreview/text: I really needed a new shower head and upon my search, I found this one. When I finally bought it, I instantly began to install it, but it was a bit difficult because the base of the shower head was a bit too large for my shower handle. I tried different ways to make it fit but it would not work. I eventually settled on using the old shower head base and then attached the new shower head to it. Now it works and that is a relief. This shower head was a good purchase overall. There is also a filter that comes with it so that is a bonus.
