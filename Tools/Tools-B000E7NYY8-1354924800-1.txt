review/summary: Well designed useful productreview/text: Just a very nice, well designed product. Great for either a small window AC in the Summer or a space heater in the Winter. There are a number of similarly rated appliance timers out there but having having a programmable thermostat combines the best of a timer with the control of a thermostat.The manufacturer's described features are dead on. It does what they say it does. Pretty easy to program and nice that you can do it in hand without being plugged in.Lux makes some good products and I've used a number of them before. Always been happy with their stuff.Great that one unit works for heat or cooling making it versatile for different applications. I suppose 7 individual days of programming would be nice, but the 5/2 arrangement probably suits most applications. I use mine programmed the same through the whole week and just turn it off if not needed. Guess it depends on the application.Just a very well made product. Amazon's price is pretty good, I haven't found it anywhere cheaper.
