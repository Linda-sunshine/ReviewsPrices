review/summary: Much Better Than Old Modelreview/text: It's been years since we replaced our smoke alarm, and we have never owned a Carbon Monoxide alarm. Our new Combo alarm seems to be working fine. Has a LOUD alarm! We pray we will never need it, but we are confident it will perform for us, and wake us if we are asleep.Thank you for a great product.
