review/summary: Worked great, while it lasted...review/text: I have used this for a couple years to monitor my usage on several appliances including a/c units, tv's, stereos, computers and found it very informative and even educational. One day while using it simply as a voltage monitor in an unused outlet, I saw the reading begin to climb from 125V to 157V - I was able to confirm with several other meters that this was incorrect. There is no way to recalibrate the device - all the readings and measurement capabilities of the unit are worthless now. One could argue that I got $17 of utility out of the device.... but then it really should have lasted more than 2 years of intermittent use as well.
