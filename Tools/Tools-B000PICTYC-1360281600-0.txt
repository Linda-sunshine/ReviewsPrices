review/summary: Perfect throwing axe and a great multi tool.review/text: I was very happy with this item it came on time. Its a good quality tomahawk and for a good price. Came super sharp outta the box. Great balence for throwing stuck first time I threw it and almost everytime after that. I am stoked on this tomahawk!
