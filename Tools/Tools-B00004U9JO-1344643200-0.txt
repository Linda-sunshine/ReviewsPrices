review/summary: InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposerreview/text: I just replaced my InSinkErator Disposer,and I replaced it with the same make, model, and horse power as the old one. I did this because,the old one was old enough to vote! The original was installed in my house 21 years ago when it was built. I made this product a four star general based on it's past service. In all those years it never gave me a problem.The new unit was quick,and easy to install, with no leaks. If this new unit lasts 21 years I'll be 99 whenI replace the next one.
