review/summary: Indispensable for Can Am Spyder Ownersreview/text: I use this on a Can Am Spyder, and it's a must-have because those things use up juice just sitting there! I also have the Battery Tender Plus on both of our cars because we don't drive every day. Batteries are expensive, and these do a great job o keeping them topped-off!
