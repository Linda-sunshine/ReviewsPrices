review/summary: Good Product, Great Dealreview/text: The product works well with my Whirlpool fridge and saved me around $40 if I was to buy it directly from the manufacturer.I have well water and the prior homeowners waited way to long to change their filter, so all ice cubes would leave cloudy drinks and we wouldn't even dare drink the water. But once the new filter was put in, the ice and water are both clear.
