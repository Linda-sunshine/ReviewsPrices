review/summary: Saves you so much money!review/text: This has really saved me so much money! It works great! I also had issues with the battery but then I noticed that if it is not all the way put together IE: the top that covers the metal plates are not on the light wont light up to indicate that it is working. The trap has caught several mice and is still working great, doesn't bother the cats or dogs but if they play with it they can open it easily so be careful. My cats just usually ignore it tho! This will save you so much money on mouse traps tho so I would recommend getting this.
