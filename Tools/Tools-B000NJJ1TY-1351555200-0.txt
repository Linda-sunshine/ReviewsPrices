review/summary: Loved it for the first week - until it rainedreview/text: My whole family loved having a keyless entry lock - and it was easy to put in custom codes for various family members. However, after the first rainstorm it stopped working. Dried out after a couple of days and started working again - until the next rainstorm. Disappointed that a lock from such a well respected name brand performs this poorly.
