review/summary: Good Productreview/text: Product arrived in good packaging and included the 2 AA batteries needed for the back-up feature. I plugged them in, ran the test and they are good to go. I also took one out into the enclosed garage and it started beeping about 5 seconds after I started my car quickly for a test.Price was better of course at Amazon than I could find locally. I will also be purchasing another few for a rental property where CO detectors are required by law (WI).I would recommend.
