review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I've purchased one despite of some reviews about starter faulty. Mine has worked for only one night. On next night it didn't work. I've disassembled the top cover and found the starter starter was burnt smoke. I've taken out the starter and touched two wires together for one moment and light was on. Now I'm using the Flowtron by that way until I have a new starter.
