review/summary: Recommended if you have kidsreview/text: Works well and eliminates almost all chlorine (upper 90%). So, if you live in the city, chances are your water will taste much better with this product. Gets rid of a lot of stuff I haven't heard of in water. I love it for my kids because it DOES NOT FILTER FLUORIDE that improves teeth development and cavity protection. There is a different culligan filter that does filter fluoride if you happen to want that filtered out.
