review/summary: Bright little suckerreview/text: I purchased this book light to clamp to my Kindle when my insomnia acts up. It pretty much lights up the whole bedroom. I can control that to some extend by pointing it away from my wife. It is also so bright that it takes about five minutes for my eyes to adjust before I can start using the Kindle. It also creates a glare on the screen. That also can be controlled with slight adjustments. The adjustments are easy to make because the neck is extremely flexible. And I don't use it as a stand alone lamp, although I have stored it that way. The base is very stable. So, it is a bright, portable, flexible light that works well with my leather cased Kindle.
