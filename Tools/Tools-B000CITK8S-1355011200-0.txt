review/summary: Review of &#34;Battery Tender Junior&#34;review/text: The &#34;Battery Tender&#34; was easy to hook-up and has performed exactly as I expected. It's very simple to disconnect when I want to use the vehicle. I recommend it to keep a seldom used vehicle battery fully charged at all times, without overcharging.
