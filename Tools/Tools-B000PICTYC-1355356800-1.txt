review/summary: Love itreview/text: I was looking for something that could serve a couple purposes when I need it and this fit the bill. I wanted something to protect myself but as a woman (and this is hard to explain) I wanted something with a little more heft behind it, so I'm not relying as much on my own upper body strength. (I'm not sure if that's recommended, it's just what I feel most comfortable with. *shrugs*) I was concerned this might be a little too heavy for me, but it's just right. I should add that I have relatively short arms (I'm 5'2'') but the size worked okay for me.I've tried this out and I really like it. It makes a decent camp axe in a pinch, but the edge is rather small and it'll take a lot of effort to get through anything more than a few inches thick. I wouldn't recommend this for that purpose. If that's all you want this for, I would move on. I've been practicing throwing it, and it's easy enough to learn. After a few tosses, you start to get the hang of it. It's a little heavier than I expected, but that isn't a bad thing. It takes an edge well enough. The handle is really sturdy and I have no concerns of it breaking any time soon. The sheath isn't ideal, it opens on the bottom and the snaps aren't very strong. If I were to carry it in my belt or something, it would almost certainly fall out, but it works fine if you're going to keep it in a backpack.I hope to buy another one to keep in my car when my budget allows for such a splurge. I'd recommend this tomahawk... purchase it with confidence. :)
