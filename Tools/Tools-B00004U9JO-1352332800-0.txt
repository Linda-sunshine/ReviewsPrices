review/summary: Great Garbage Disposalreview/text: We bought this when the motor in our Insinkerator Badger died (after at least ten years). Got it installed in under an hour - just left the sink mount from the old Badger in place and this new one fit right on, very simple. It does take some arm strength to hold the incinerator up while you try to get the three flaps to fit into the mount. The rubber seal is a little in the way when you are trying to do this, but it is not hard, just a matter of trying a few times until all three flaps are secure, then twist and boom! It's on.I did turn off the wiring from the breaker box. Connecting the wires was very simple - just follow the instructions in the manual. They were very clear. Insinkerator does not provide wire caps, which I had but which would have been very frustrating had I not had them. Imagine having to drive all the way back to your hardware store for a .15 cent item!!The plumbing pipe provided did not connect with my existing plumbing piping (all up to date) so I am confused about that. It "works" but is basically resting inside my old pipe, so I need to figure that out. I do not know why their pipe is not threaded to receive a flange cover. That would have solved the problem.This product is VERY quiet. I can barely hear it. I guess I am just used to my older, louder model. But I see no need to buy the better model for something even more quiet, since this is almost inaudible as it is :)
