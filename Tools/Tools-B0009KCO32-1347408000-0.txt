review/summary: worked great for usreview/text: We live in Seattle so don't have many bugs. This worked great for us. We didnt even attach the strips to the door frame. It fit our door perfectly. Heavy enough to hang flat. Enough overlap in the middle for the magnet to seal out the occasional fly. Should last for many years. The screw rod lets you make minute adjustments. If we had this up year round and had a lot of bugs I would have tacked on a piece of trim along the vertical edges to prevent it from blowing around on windy days.
