review/summary: Great Ladderreview/text: I've had this ladder for a while now and used it numerous times. I'm a big guy... over 6 feet and over 250 pounds. I've used this ladder to get on and off the roof, put up Christmas decorations and some step ladder work indoors. At no time did I feel like the ladder was not supporting myself and the load I carried up and down the ladder. It's strong, easy to configure, easy to store and the price was very very reasonable. If I had to do it over I certainly would purchase this ladder again.
