review/summary: GREAT BATTERY MAINTAINERreview/text: Just got this a few days ago. So far so good. Easy to see at a glance which mode the unit is in. The quick connect plug is easy to plug in and unplug compared to my Schumacher XM1-5. The Schumacher XM1-5 switches between 6 volt and 12 volt and has twice the charge amperage but is also about 3 times the size of the BT Junior.
