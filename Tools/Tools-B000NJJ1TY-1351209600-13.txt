review/summary: Great Choice!review/text: I installed several mechanical keypad type lock sets at work and found out how convenient they are, so decided to purchase one for our home. This model came up as the daily special and perfectly matched our existing harware so I ordered it. It was easy to install compared to the industrial models and is much more attractive. The installation of the battery harness was a little tedious because of the tight space and the clip arrangement employed. Otherwise everything went together quite easily. The unit came with two security codes already programmed into the unit, but additional codes are very easy to program. The keypad can be easily illuminated with the push of a button, so it is very easy to see in the dark. I still find myself digging in my pocket for a key sometimes out of habit, but this unit makes entry extremely convenient, especially if you are carrying something. I cannot tell you how often the battery must be changed but so far would highly recommend this item!
