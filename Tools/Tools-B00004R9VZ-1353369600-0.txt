review/summary: Kills Bugsreview/text: I needed something to clear out the bugs that tend to gravitate around my front door. There's a pond close to my house so the area is buggy. I didn't use the chemicals that went with the product to attract the bugs, they came naturally. It kills off bugs! I actually have it sitting on a table on the patio with a timer. I notice a big difference the patio has fewer bugs. And a friendly frog sits close by every night for his meals.
