review/summary: Nice item.review/text: For years I've been disconnecting the battery of a car we leave idle for months at a time. Finally I got smart and decided to invest in a trickle charger. This little item turns out to be exactly what I was looking for. Clip the cables to the battery, plug the unit into an electrical outlet or extension cord, and smile at the green light telling you the battery is charged and ready to go. Just don't forget about it and drive out of the garage with the unit still plugged in!
