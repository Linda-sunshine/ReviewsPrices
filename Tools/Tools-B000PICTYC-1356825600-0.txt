review/summary: Amazing!review/text: I got this tomahawk for Christmas 2012. After reviewing all the reviews on here I told the wife I wanted it! I finally got around to testing it out today. Made a target out of 2x3's and first throw nailed it! I am a beginner and have never thrown one before. I watched some YouTube videos on how to throw( very helpful by the way) I was hitting the target 97% of the time. Came out of the box very sharp and was very impressed with the construction of it. After about 2 hours of throwing the hawk I completely destroyed my target. Guess I need to get a tree stump.. Hope this review helps. It's defiantly fun, will be taking it out hiking, hunting, camping, etc.
