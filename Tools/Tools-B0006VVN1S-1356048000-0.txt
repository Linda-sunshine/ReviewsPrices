review/summary: Does Not Fit Every Shower (Updated)review/text: Update 12/22/12I ordered a replacement, hoping that the previous defective showerhead was a fluke. Turns out it was, as this new showerhead fit fine. Install was a bit of a pain, because the screw-part of the showerhead is molded weird, but no water pressure has been lost. I can't comment yet on how well the filter works as it has only been one day. I have changed my rating from a 1 star to 4 stars. I took a star off because the showerhead was still not easy to install and the different spray settings are not as great (no clear difference between rain and soft, only three locked places, even though there are five settings) as the product description led me to believe.Original Post 12/21/12I was really looking forward to this showerhead, because of its high reviews on filtering chlorine and keeping high pressure water. But the showerhead would not install onto my shower arm. I have a standard 1/2" shower arm, so there shouldn't have been a problem. It seems the actual part that screws onto the shower arm was molded incorrectly. People should be aware that this product does not fit every shower arm, as it claims.
