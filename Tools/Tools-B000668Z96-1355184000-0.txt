review/summary: Gone Fishingreview/text: My husband talked like I was going fishing when we first got the first of four traps. He said it looked like I was fishing for the fleas. This is a good way to get rid of the fleas without smells or sticky stuff anywhere. Our problem was that we had three cats who belonged to our son who moved and said the cats could not go outside. Needless to say, after a month the cats had to go outside, or us, humans, suffer being eaten alive by the fleas they carried. We have closed off rooms and used these traps and have the fleas almost to a barely livable state. We have a long way to go to get rid of the problem, but now it is closer to see. We also have fish tanks and did not want to use the spray bombs.
