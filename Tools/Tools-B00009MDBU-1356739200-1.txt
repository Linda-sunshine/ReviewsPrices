review/summary: Works very wellreview/text: This product works fine. As most reviewers have already noted, it would be nice if the device didn't take up two slots in the same outlet. (It covers the whole wall plate.) Also, a short-term memory would help to read the time and power consumption when it has to be plugged into an outlet behind something like a sofa. Using a mirror and trying to read the inverse is not easy.
