review/summary: Tiny Display But It Worksreview/text: I have this controlling an oil bath type space heater in a mobile home. It does that very well. I programmed the device for 65 at night and for 45 during the day when no one is home. I've placed an analog thermometer on the wall to verify the room temperature. The Lux has been keeping the temperature right on the setpoint. Before I had this device I would have to constantly re-adjust the space heater control knob to stay comfortable. It also works great for automatically turning the heater off during the day. Before I had the Lux I would sometimes forget to turn down the heater when I left for work. The Lux has solved both of these problems. I would recommend this to anyone trying to precisely control room temperature with a dumb space heater. I haven't tried it with an air conditioner yet but if it works as well as it has for heating then it should be fine. The only complaint I have is the tiny characters on the LCD display. It is difficult to read for us old folks without a strong pair of readers.
