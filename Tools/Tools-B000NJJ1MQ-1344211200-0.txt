review/summary: Nice Deadbolt, No Hole Installationreview/text: I purchased this deadbolt kit for an old door that did not have a deadbolt already installed. This door was installed in the house back when they didn't even lock doors. It has always had a simple lock on it but not very secure.Since my installation was going to involve drilling all the necessary holes, I used thisIrwin Industrial Tools 3111001 Carbon Door Lock Installation Kitto take most of the guess-work out of it. The installation prep was pretty simple using the kit and the deadbolt installation was a breeze. The only steps that took much effort was the routing/chiseling of the striker plate areas.Once I had it all together the deadbolt operated just fine but my keypad was not lighting up when pressing the "Schlage" button. I noticed that the deadbolt has to be in the locked position for the keypad to light up but mine still would not light. I took the backplate off and disconnected the battery and the wire coupling and once I connected it all back up, the keypad lit correctly. That was a relief because I didn't want to have to disassemble and return the lock and have a hole in my door while waiting for a replacment.Bottom line: Keyless entry is really nice!
