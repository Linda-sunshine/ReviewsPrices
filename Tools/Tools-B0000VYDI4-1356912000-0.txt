review/summary: Fantastic designreview/text: I would recommend this -- it's very versatile, can be adjusted easily for both indoor and outdoor use. Storage size height is about 3 feet, which make is easy to carry. But the weight and width make it a little cumbersome but still quite worth while for its versatality. It can certainly be carried underarm without much trouble and tool bag in the other.The spring loaded adjustments are quite easy if you don't struggle against it. Rather allow the adjustments to ease into position rather than force. The pre-adjusted locking positions fall into place quite well and feels quite solid.In the straight position with the ladder supported agains a wall it is important to make sure it is placed as directed with the hinge bearing the weight outwards away from the wall -- this is labeled clearly. Regular ladders against the wall can be placed either side, but in this case due to the hinge placing it incorrectly could cause injuries.Overall very sturdy and flexible for a sub-$100 ladder. Kudos to the designer.For 5 starts it should also read my mind and lift me into position automatically. Room for improvment here.
