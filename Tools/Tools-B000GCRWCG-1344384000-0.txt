review/summary: Essential for emergencies! Blankets individually packed!review/text: The blankets come folded and packed individually in ziplocs that are small enough to fit in one's pocket. They unfold to be just big enough to wrap around a squatting adult, which is how they're intended to be used. They're sturdy enough to be reused many times.These are essential for any emergency kit. Even in the relatively minor emergency of losing power on a cold night, you'll be glad you have some of these.How they work:These blankets work by reflecting radiant heat back onto your body. Just like a fire radiates heat outward and you feel it when you stand near, your body is constantly radiating heat outward. This is how most of your heat is lost in a cold environment. The other way is by conduction. For example, when you sit on the cold ground you conduct heat into the ground and you get cold. These blankets will not protect against conducted heat, so you will need to minimize contact with the cold surrounding environment when you use these. If you lie on the ground, much of your body is touching the ground and conducting heat away quickly. Instead of lying down, one should crouch or squat when using one of these blankets and wrap it around like a shawl. In this way, only your feet are in contact with the ground, and they are likely insulated by your shoes enough that conducted heat will be minimal.
