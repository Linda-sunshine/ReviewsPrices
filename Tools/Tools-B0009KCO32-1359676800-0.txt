review/summary: Not just for keeping bugs outreview/text: Okay, I know this is supposed to be used for keeping insects out, but it also works quite well in keeping a nosey cat out of the master bedroom. I needed a solution where I could keep the door open for ventilation but keep the cat out. Gates, etc. wouldn't do. After seeing this I thought of giving it a try and it works beautifully. Installed in minutes. Cat hasn't even bothered trying to defeat it.
