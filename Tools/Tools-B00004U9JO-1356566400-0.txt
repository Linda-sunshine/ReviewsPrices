review/summary: Badger 5 Garbage Disposalreview/text: My Badger 5 garbage disposal froze up on me today after 19 1/2 years without any problems. I ordered another one today for the quality of the previous one and easy replacement with the same model. Some nice features are the electrical reset button on the bottom of the unit and the allen wrench fitting so you may turn the disposal if you get something lodged in it to free it up.
