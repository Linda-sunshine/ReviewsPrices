review/summary: A bit bulky, but very versatile!review/text: If all you need is a lightweight extension ladder, this isn't for you. If all you need is a single folding ladder, this probably isn't for you. However, if you're like me and often have need of both types of ladders and multiple sizes in each, you really need to consider this product! I've been really pleased with it so far as I've used it as a short folding ladder, tall folding ladder, extension ladder, and with the legs set at different lengths to reach over a stairwell. The versatility and build-quality are certainly its strengths. My only complaints are that the ladder is pretty heavy - probably 50% heavier than a conventional 17' extension ladder, a bit bulky if you're working in tight areas, and the steps could be a tad wider. However, as I said it is well built and leaves you feeling confident that it isn't going anywhere even with it extended fully. And for a ladder that can reach up to ~8' as a folding ladder, you have to expect that it isn't going to be tiny. The mechanisms for folding the ladder as well as extending it are extremely easy to use and are both secure and leave no doubt as to whether you have them locked in place properly. I'd say it's the perfect example of "jack of all trades, master of none." Not the best extension ladder (mainly due to weight), not the best folding ladder (weight and extra effort to extend it), but it sure beats having to purchase and store / transport 3 or 4 different ladders!
