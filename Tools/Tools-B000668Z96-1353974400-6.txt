review/summary: Upgrading Reviewreview/text: I originally gave this product only one star because the light kept going out so didn't catch fleas. I finally tried buying a new bulb...it stayed lit. It was the BULB and not the flea trap so I'm changing to five stars! Despite using Frontline on my two strictly indoor cats (no other animals) the flea trap caught about 50 fleas in a couple of weeks. Revolting...but so glad they are in the flea trap and not on me. I just ordered a refill. I now highly recommend this product.
