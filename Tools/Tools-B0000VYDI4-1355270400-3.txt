review/summary: strong ladder and you need to be strong to carryreview/text: Very well built. And with that comes the weight. Be ready to build up your muscles if you have to carry this very far.Folds down really small and fit in my shed great. Used it multiple times and I never feel like it will fail me.Getting it set up the first few times is a bit slower than a regular ladder like I'm used to but I'll take it when I have that added safety I feel now. For a larger guy like me that doesn't like heights it is a must.
