review/summary: Works well--very quiet.review/text: We redid the kitchen with new counters and sink. This disposal works much better and is much quieter than the old 3/4hp it replaced.Just be aware of the size--it's much larger than the typical builder quality units that come with the house due to the noise insulation around the body. Make sure you have room for the plumbing. It was tight for my application.
