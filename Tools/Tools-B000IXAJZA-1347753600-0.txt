review/summary: What's With the Big Black Hole?review/text: Ok, I only paid $19.86 for this flashlight with free shipping. It is strongly built by a company known for long-term durability. Sometimes you have to wonder if Mag-lite is selling a flashlight that is also a club or a club that is also a flashlight. Hopefully it will be as durable as previous models I've owned.The first time I turned it on at night I was amazed at the light output--and flabbergasted by the big black hole in the center of the illumination. It took me a second to figure out that by turning the head that you could adjust the beam. The narrower the beam the less obvious the mysterious black hole. At the most narrow focus the black hole disappears.I use this light at night to check out our property before letting our three dogs out to do their business. More than once I have been alerted to critters (raccoons, possums, coyotes, rats, armadillos, etc.) by their beedy little eyes reflecting back at me. Avoiding a major battle before bedtime has been advantgeous to the dogs, the wildlife, and to my wife and I.
