review/summary: ???Garbage Disposal or Wood Chipper???review/text: OK, so I'm being funny or maybe not.Anyone that has a "Waste King L-8000 Legend Series 1.0-Horsepower Continuous Feed Garbage Disposal", knows what I'm mean. This thing is so powerful it probably would make short work of my dead tree limbs, or take off if it wasn't nailed down.Now for my review: The delivery arrived earlier than quoted, always a good start. After I read the instructions, really I did, it was a snap to install. My old, rusted, leaking friend of many years just didn't what to say good-by. I swear that took the longest time, but alas, it's no more!! If you are trying to decide between the "3-Bolt" or the "Fast-and-easy mount system" pick the latter you won't be sorry!! Our new Waste King has performed flawlessly disintegrating all comers. The only non-flowering insignificant comments would be, a metal "Snap" sound as the destructor blades engage, and (as others have noted) a "Small-ish" opening.I highly recommend this product!!
