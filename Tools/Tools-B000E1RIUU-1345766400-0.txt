review/summary: This one is useless, tooreview/text: I bought the larger Victor M260 as well as this smaller M2524 and the smallest Victor electronic trap, the M250. I wrote a longer review on the M260 (mouse hotel), but both of the smaller units have had precisely the same success. Installed in two separate locations where spring traps have been catching mice regularly, we have not caught a single mouse in any of the 3 electronic traps.Don't wast your money. I regret this purchase.
