review/summary: Nice broom and mop holder at great pricereview/text: This item works well and is inexpensive. I like that hanging hardware is included. The only drag is finding an appropriately thin enough 'tool' to mark for the holes. A regular pen or pencil won't fit and a drill bit didn't make a mark on my plaster wall. What I ended up using was a mechanical pencil with the lead extended quite far and marked for the holes. And what the heck, there are FIVE holes for screws. This is residential, man, we're not holding up huge cloth mops here or anything! Suffice it to say, it ain't going anywhere.
