review/summary: Great giftreview/text: This was a great, cheap gift for all of my groomsmen. I even got some for my dad and other friends who helped with the wedding. It's handy in a pinch: the knife is great for opening boxes, for example. The Philips head is a little small to get good traction with an average screw. The bottle opener is pretty uncomfortable to use because you either have to hold the knife blade or pointy flathead. (Personally, I'd rather open a bottle with a lighter or drawer handle in a pinch instead of this tool.) All in all, though, this makes for a handy thing to have around on your keyring.
