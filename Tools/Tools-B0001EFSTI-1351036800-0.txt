review/summary: Lives on my key chain.review/text: Has lived on my key chain. you never know when your going to need a screwdriver / knife etc. The build quality is nice and tough I have not had the issue of it popping open on me. The one issue I have with it is that some of the tools can be a bit clumsy to use namely the bottle opener.
