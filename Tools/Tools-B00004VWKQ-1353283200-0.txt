review/summary: great sharpenerreview/text: I bought this sharpener to keep in my ranch truck its small and simple to use but I didn't not exspect it to work so well. To my surprise my favorite ranch knife was razer sharp in 4-5 passes. I was very exsited how well it work I grab my 15 or so hunting knifes and all were razer sharp in 4-5 passes then I moved on to my steak knifes and it still only took 4-5 passes. I highly recommended I just bought 2 more just incase I loss them.
