review/summary: Worked Wellreview/text: I was skeptical when I purchased these traps, but they really worked at our house. We weren't infested, we just had a few annoying fleas because we kept a close eye on our Westie and gave him Capstar pills at the first sign. But we found these traps to be very effective.
