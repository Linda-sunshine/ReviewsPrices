review/summary: Rating the culligan faucet filterreview/text: I choose the Culligan FM-15A 3 faucet filter after reading comparisons with other products. I am satisfied except the taste isn't as good as with water we were getting from a water treatment vending machine. It does make it a lot more convenient than stopping for 4 gals of water twice a week. Plus we save a lot of money.
