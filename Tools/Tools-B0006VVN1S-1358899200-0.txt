review/summary: So far it seems to be workingreview/text: Was having issues with itchy skin and dry hair. Was told it could be the hard water. Since I changed the showerhead, skin doesn't itch as bad and hair seems to be coming back to life. Will continue using but it looks like it is a long term thing.
