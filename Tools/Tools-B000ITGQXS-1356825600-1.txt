review/summary: neat little lightreview/text: i was curious if this was just another dim light, but i was very surprised when i turned it on and i lit up the entire cab of my big rig work truck. i love it. i have quit a bit of paper work to to in the early morning darkness. my truck light just doesnt cut it. this little light adds enough light to get the job done. money well spent.
