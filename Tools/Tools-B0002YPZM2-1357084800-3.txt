review/summary: Awesome Gloves!review/text: I bought these as a gift for my dad for Christmas. He loves them! They are very flexible, have a great grip because of the fabric on the palm and adjustable on the wrist. He prefers these over the thick, bulky leather work gloves he gets from Menards. Those feel like you have gloves on while these don't. These are great for handling wood, tinkering in the garage and doing outdoor activities. He keeps talking about these awesome gloves! So happy with this purchase and totally worth it!
