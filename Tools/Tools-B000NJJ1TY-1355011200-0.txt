review/summary: So far great!review/text: I got this lock for a vacation home so that I wouldn't have to give keys to family and guests who come and go on their own. I give them different codes to get in. There were a lot of keys floating around before. Not only is it convenient, it's fun. Installation was pretty easy but I expected the bolt to actually move when locking and unlocking the door. It does not move. The locking and unlocking is done electronically by a built in battery. I learned this when I called Schlage customer service during installation and they were most helpful.So far I'm really glad I got it.
