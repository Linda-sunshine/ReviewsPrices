review/summary: Quiet yet Powerfulreview/text: This is one pretty quiet disposal. Of course, it's my first "new" disposal, but I am certainly not complaining about the noise. It does it's work well. It was really heavy, but installing was easy if you have basic knowledge of connecting drain pipes to it. It took me roughly two hours as this was the first time I've even done a Garbage Disposal install.
