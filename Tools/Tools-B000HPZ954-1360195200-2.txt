review/summary: Not 'the one' in surge protectorsreview/text: I hoped this would solve my likely dangerous electronic cord mangle behind my computer. No such luck. Why? 1) is my fault, I should've counted my cords before ordering. I need more plugs! But 2) I consider a design defect. How many cords today involving computers and media equipment are just simple plugs? Not many. They have the boxes on the end of them. I see where they attempted to work with this fact by spacing some of the outlets out, but it wasn't enough. I think I have 4 of cords with the big boxes on the plug end back there. And even for regular plugs the holes on the end with four outlets right next to each other are very close, the edges of the plugs overlap.So, I still have a bit of an electronic no-no, I am using a splitter box on it, not really because I needed that other outlet (I did, but that wasn't the reason!) but because it stands up tall giving me room to plug the plugs that have these huge boxes on them.the product does its job. It is definitely higher quality than the $2 power strips, however, unless you have just basic computer, monitor, speakers I wouldn't get it because there's not enough space for the plugs. Forget trying to plug in the big box plug of the modem, router, and that cordless phone you like to sit on your desk. And then the printer cord. Maybe a lamp...
