review/summary: Let there be light!review/text: I can now see the green little men on that red planet, or the sphinx on that big dusty rock that spins around our planet, and this is during the day!!! At night, if you take a closer look at satellite imagery you'll notice that the East Coast is much brighter - well, now you know why!On a more serious note - I also have the 2-D LED one, and cannot see any differences in term of brightness or battery life (have the same batteries for 2 years now), so the choice is yours - compact one to use as a flashlight and occasional hammer, or larger one to use as a flashlight and occasional thief-deterrent-weapon, or, for roughly the same price you can get the 4-D, 5-D or 6-D and use them as baseball bat, tent pole, or support beam respectively... But know for sure that whichever one you choose, you'll get a darn good flashlight.
