review/summary: Same ol', same ol'review/text: Most people get water filters unnecessarily, fearing contaminants that aren't really there. Although my water had some sulfate contamination, I couldn't detect a difference by filtering it. For someone who gets straight unpurified water from a well, a filter is a necessity, but for most tap waters, the filter is only a placebo benefit.
