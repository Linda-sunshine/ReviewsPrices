review/summary: Very useful, but...review/text: I really like this item. Nice to get all my brooms, mops, etc. off the floor that were falling down constantly. The problem is only 4 out of 5 slots work! Not worth taking off the wall and sending back. Glad 4 is enough. Otherwise I would give 5 stars.
