review/summary: Excellent value for excellent productreview/text: I have like many folks hard water and because of it I have always had to deal with water spots left behind in the shower not to mention the white lime scale on the shower head. I researched this product and read many reviews on here regarding this product giving high praise. When it showed up on the Today's deal section of Amazon, I couldn't resist purchasing. This price was even better with the discount I received there. It arrived and installation was super simple. The first shower that my wife and I took we both couldn't believe the difference. Wow! The water was softer and felt almost silky. Overall a tremendous purchase and a super value for our household. I will change out the filter element on six month intervals. Anyone that suffers from the same situation as we do (hard water), you may want to try this product. It is well worth the investment.
