review/summary: Makes my water taste betterreview/text: I must say that this does an OK job. We have a water tester that gives us the ppb for whats in water. Before with regular tap it showed over 600ppb and with the filter it shows 500ish. With the water from the water stations we were getting it was less than 10, so it doesn't filter out everything but it did take all of the bad taste out of the tap. Was it worth it? Yes much more convenient than going to the water stations. And the water tastes fine. The tap is disgusting!
