review/summary: I love the keypad locks and this one is a winner!!review/text: I own a few keypad locks in my home and this one by far was the easiest to install and operate. I love the cool blue light it uses on the numeric keypad, its easy on the eyes at night and very helpful. The lock by far has seemed to keep a great charge over time unlike some of my other locks. Great buy for the interior locks in your home or office.
