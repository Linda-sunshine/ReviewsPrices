review/summary: How did I live without it?!review/text: I love this invention! So simple and such a life saver! This holds my broom, mop, swiffer, window cleaner thingy and kids broom perfectly. Mounts very easily, looks nice, and doesn't take much space. I am thinking of ordering a second one for shovels and gardening tools in the garage.
