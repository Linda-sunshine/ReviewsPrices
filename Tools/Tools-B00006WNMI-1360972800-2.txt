review/summary: Slow filter and lowers your water pressurereview/text: The filter generally works but is fairly slow. I've been using it for about an month and it takes ~5 min to fill a liter bottle of city water. It was a bit faster when I first got it but not by much.The other annoyance is the filter significantly reduces my faucets water pressure, even when not in use. Essentially design of the filter forces all the water in the faucet through quarter inch hole. I had good pressure before installation with a 2.2 gpm aerator, now the water pressure definitely feels lower.On the plus side the filter feels solid and sturdy and there hasn't been any water leaks.
