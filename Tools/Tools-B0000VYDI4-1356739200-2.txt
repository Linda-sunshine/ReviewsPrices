review/summary: As advertisedreview/text: I have found this ladder to be pretty much exactly as advertised. I love the versatility that it provides. We have a relatively small house, so space was a concern for me when purchasing a ladder. This unit folds up nicely and doesn't really take up too much space, certainly not as much as traditional sliding ladders. The unit is fairly heavy, so I only pull it out when absolutely necessary (I use a small, lightweight stepladder when I can) - but there are times when you simply need a higher reach and this fits the bill perfectly.
