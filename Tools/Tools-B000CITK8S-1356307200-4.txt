review/summary: Great Devicereview/text: I use this year round for my Vulcan Nomad 1500. I have had it for 2-3 years. Works great and I like the additional attachments (pigtail to leave on the bike and the alligator jumper clips) that came with it.I replaced my original battery after 8 years but not because anything was wrong- I just felt it was time.The light on the power cord indicates when it is charging vs. floating. I can't hear it so it must be quiet.
