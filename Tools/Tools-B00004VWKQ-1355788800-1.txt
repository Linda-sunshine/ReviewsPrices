review/summary: Works very well on knivesreview/text: I bought this after seeing the recommendation on Cooks Illustrated. I purchased new knives the other day and was very close to buying the rather expensive electric sharpener CI recommended when I saw this one got just as manygood reviews and was 150.00 less (woohoo!). It is very easy to use once you choke back the fear of having your hand awfully close to that soon-to-be-wickedly-sharp blade you are using it on. The design is definitely nerve wracking at first but you get used to it quickly. I have only used it twice in the last week or so and only for a few swipes each time. It gets the Voctorinox's blades incredibly sharp - I know nothing about regular knife sharpening so I do not know if it is normal for this to remove small shavings of metal whilst sharpening. I assume it is since that seems to be the nature of sharpening. It does remove very small shavings and I just wipe the knife off (carefully) with a clean cloth when I am done sharpening it. I have not used the sharpener on anything else and since I have only had it for a week I cannot speak to its longevity or continued efficacy. For 8.00 however, I have no complaints. I do not know that I would use it on a 200.00 professional knife but on my (again, CI recommended) Victorinox knives I have no fear and am very happy with my purchase.
