review/summary: No effect on mosquitosreview/text: Very disappointing. I have seen no effect on the mosquito population since I have been using this lamp. They are still everywhere, and seem to entirely ignore the lamp. Perhaps one or two have flown into it by accident, but the lamp certainly does not attract or kill them in meaningful numbers. Don't waste your money.
