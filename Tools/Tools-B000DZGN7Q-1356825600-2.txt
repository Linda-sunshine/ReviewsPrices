review/summary: quiet, powerful, & efficientreview/text: we replaced our old garbage disposal with this unit. it was a fairly simple replacement using the already existing plumbing. if you are comfortable replacing a faucet, then you can change out a garbage disposal. this unit is larger than the old one, the old one was also only 1/4 horsepower. however, all the existing plumbing lined up perfectly. it works very well, and is very quiet. it does have a &#34;click&#34; sound that it makes when it first turns on. upon reading the manual, that's normal operation of the blades (as part of the non-clogging design) flipping into place. we are very happy with this unit.
