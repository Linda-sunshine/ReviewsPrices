review/summary: Battery Tender Junior 12Vreview/text: I use this charger to charge and maintain my 75 amp hour deep cycle marine battery. I've had it for a few months now, and have never had a problem with this product. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. Although it takes a while (three days to charge my 75 amp hour from half to full) that's what I paid for. I'll probably upgrade to the 1.25 amp version soon, but for now, this model does what I need it to do. No major complaints.
