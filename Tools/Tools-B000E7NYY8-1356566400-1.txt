review/summary: Great Itemreview/text: Works as advertised on an electric oil filled space heater.I would recommend to anyone as this should reduce the cost of operating a conventional, not digital, space heater. I have not had this long enough to see the lastest electric bill but It does turn the unit off at the set temperture it restarts when the temp gets about 3 degrees below the set temp in a 3 season, now 4 season sunroom in NJ.
