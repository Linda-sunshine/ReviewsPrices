review/summary: Programmable plug thermostat for portable heaterreview/text: Works well with the ProFusion Ceiling Mounted shop heater. I am heating a garage (10 wide x 21 long x 12 tall) in Montana and it seems to be keeping it at the desired temp (63 degrees) without a problem. 1 issue I had was when setting the temp it seems to cut all the power for a short time and not turn on the unit right away, this was a pain when I was trying to fine tune the temp to what I wanted, have to wait for it to recover. I would still recomend and buy this unit again.
