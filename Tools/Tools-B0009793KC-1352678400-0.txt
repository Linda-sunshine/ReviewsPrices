review/summary: Replacement cartridge works great for well waterreview/text: Our Whirlpool side by side refrigerator, 2006 vintage, has a water dispenser that gets a lot of use. We have well water and without filtering there is a noticeable taste of iron in our water, especially for infrequent guests who notice the iron flavor right away. These filters do a great job and last a long surprisingly long time in our household. Although it is recommended to replace them every 6 months, in the 6 years that we have had our Whirlpool fridge, there was at least one time that we went almost a year and without changing the cartridge before even a hint of iron flavor was there. The only other comment I'd have is that you need to be SURE to run the recommended 3 gallons (or more) through a new filter before drinking/consuming the output. Use it on your plants or something...there is a definite odd taste until the filter is fully saturated and any remnants from manufacturing are flushed through. After that "break in period", the water tastes like good spring water to me...not sterile like distilled water.
