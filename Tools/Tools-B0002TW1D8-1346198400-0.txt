review/summary: Works, it's just hardware.review/text: What can you say, they are just adapters for my drill. I use it for my tool set with different size sockets. Works perfect for my needs. Make tighining and loosening nuts and bolts a lot faster. The materials seems to be of good quality. The packaging was also good too. I would buy again.
