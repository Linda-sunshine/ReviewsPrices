review/summary: Cool productreview/text: I bought this to monitor and check the power consumption of my gadgets and appliances, and it works!This device is very simple to use, it could be better if they added a small extension in case of plugging this in tight spaces, but that will add cost, so I don't mind the lack of extension and since I also have my own extensions at the house.Another this that can be improved is the addition of backlight, but that will add to the cost again. So I'm very happy that I got this device for less than 20 bucks.Highly Recommended!
