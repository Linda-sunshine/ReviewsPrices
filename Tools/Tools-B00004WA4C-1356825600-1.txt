review/summary: Kiddie Carbon Monoxide & Smoke Detector Saves Livesreview/text: Purchased two of these carbon monoxide and smoke detectors by Kiddie because we recently bought a new house and the detector we had in our apartment saved the lives of my family when we had a carbon monoxide leak in the middle of the night due to a pipe accidentally being bumped on our furnace when our daughter was moving a piece of furniture. Everyone should have carbon monoxide and smoke detectors! This unit works! Got them at a great price on amazon. It speaks... which they say is more likely to wake a sleeping person than a beep... especially children. Worth every cent!
