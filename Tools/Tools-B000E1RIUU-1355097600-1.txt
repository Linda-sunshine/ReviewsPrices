review/summary: Does what it says it doesreview/text: I had four other spring traps in the house for over a week by the time this arrived in the mail. I caught nothing in those traps. I set up this trap. In less than 8 hours I had caught two different mice. I have not caught any since. The other traps are still empty. Compared to the other types of traps, this seems more humane and it works quickly (I used peanut butter as bait).
