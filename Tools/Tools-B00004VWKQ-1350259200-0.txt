review/summary: Great for Stainless Steel blades. Not good at all for Carbon Steel blades!review/text: Great for Stainless Steel blades. Not good at all for Carbon Steel blades! I sharpened all of my pocket knives, & household knives with this, & it worked great! When I tried sharpening my old military (Carbon Steel) knives, I realized it seemed to be doing more harm than help. I think it simply isn't intended for hard steel. But with stainless knives, I'm very impressed!
