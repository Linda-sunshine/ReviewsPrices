review/summary: Works flawlessly to keep my fountains clearreview/text: I'm using this in conjunction with a battery heater under my fountain to keep it running during the cold winter months. It comes on at 35 degrees, goes off at 45, just like it promised. Fountains have been ice-free since I've been using it. Great product, great price!
