review/summary: SWEETreview/text: THIS IS THE BEST TOOL EVER FOR DOING VARIOS TYPES OF AWESOME THINGS!!!!!!!! But really this feels great in the hand and cuts way better than a normal hatchet. It is high quality for something made in China; but what isn't made there these days? Oh by the way, I wouldn't throw it because it's will wear it out quickly. (It still works fine for throwing) I also sharpened mine when I got it, although it was already pretty sharp out of the box. And after 5 min of using, I know this tomahawk will cut through anything!!! I also recommend this for all hunters for clearing small trees, and finishing off animals humanely. Over-all this is a great tomahawk for the price!!!!!!!!
