review/summary: Exactly what I needed.review/text: Build quality = superior.Programming new codes = Easy if youSetup = Easy if you can read and follow easy instructions.What not 5 starts then? Because of other reviews and what they had to say the battery life.I must admit I messed up the first unit by refusing to carefully read the instructions. Amazon gracefully replaced the unit.Overall, a 5 stars product.
