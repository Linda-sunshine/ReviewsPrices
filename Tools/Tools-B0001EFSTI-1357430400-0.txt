review/summary: Useful but not very practicalreview/text: The fact that it looks like a key is clever and that's what made me want to buy it. But after receiving it and using it a few times, I realized it wasn't very practical. I've only ever pulled it out when I need to cut something because the blade is very sharp. I've never used any of the other tools (phillips head, bottle opener, etc.) because they all require me to grab the tool by the blade, which does not seem like a good idea at all.You can get it and show your friends how cool it is, but in the end it's just a tiny pocketknife.
