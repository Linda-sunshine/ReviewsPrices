review/summary: Heavy and not easy to use.review/text: I give it 2 stars because it's way heavier than a regular ladder which you just open and use. This one require more steps to set it up to use. This is 1 of the worst item that I have purchased and felt regret. Stay away from this because the step required to set it up to use can snap your finger if you are not careful.
