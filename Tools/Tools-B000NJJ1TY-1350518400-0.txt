review/summary: Gets the job donereview/text: First thing to note is that the packaging ridiculous.Second thing to note is that if you look at the tiny screw in the lock, you need to unscrew it in order to get the lock out of the packaging. There is no need to destroy all of the packaging to get the lock out. If you note the screw first, you won't have to worry about the first thing I noted. :)The way the lock works is pretty clever. When it is "locked" the handle moves up and down freely without engaging the locking mechanism. As a result, the door cannot be opened. When it is "unlocked" the handle functions normally, so that when you turn it, the locking mechanism engages and retracts the locking mechanism so the door can be opened. (I had imagined that the locking mechanism would automatically engage and disengage when the code was pushed, but that is not the case. It is simply the handle that either works (unlocked) or does not (locked).I bought this for our side door. It was easy to install, simply replacing the old hardware and replacing the new hardware. The instructions are fairly clear. When you cant figure out what they are talking about after attaching the plastic plate on the inside of the door and they mention having something protrude from the door by 1/4 inch, just reach into the upper left of the hole, and grab what feels like the skinny end of a screw between your thum and pointer and unscrew it until it gets long enough to stick out of the hole.
