review/summary: Works ok!review/text: After about 3 weeks I was able to catch about 8 fleas on this. I wasn't too impressed with this, especially when I was battling fleas on my dog like crazy. This trap has been set up next to his bed for the last 6 weeks. It catches more dog hair then anything else.
