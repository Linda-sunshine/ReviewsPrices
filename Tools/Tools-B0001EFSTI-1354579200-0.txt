review/summary: Amazing little toolreview/text: I use this tool every other day or so and I am always glad that I have it on me. It is small, discrete, and effective. While most of the tools on the key can be a little awkward to use, it still makes an amazingly good back up when you consider the tiny size and portability. I can carry it on me without having to think about having a multitool on me until I actually need it.
