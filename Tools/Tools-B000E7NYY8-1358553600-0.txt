review/summary: Click On, Click Off, Click On, Click Off....review/text: Fresh out of the box, followed directions exactly including making sure I'm using a 3 prong cord. It just goes on and off, on and off whether or not something is plugged into it. Sounds like a clock ticking. I have written to the company and requested a refund. I'll post the outcome. In spite of all the great reviews, I give this product a negative.
