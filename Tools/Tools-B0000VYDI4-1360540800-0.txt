review/summary: my first ladder purchase everreview/text: i have not had the need to ever purchase a ladder in over 50 yrs until now. As a female whose experience with ladders has been only a step stool i was kinda worried i would not be able to lift this ladder or figure out the mechanics of it. I ordered it on a friday night , it arrived on monday evening. i read the instructions in 5 minutes and put it up and used it to change a battery in the ever beeping low battery indicator on the fire alarm on a cathedral ceiling. Now I have a ladder and i am very happy with the delivery and the ease of using the ladder.
