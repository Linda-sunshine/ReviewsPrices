review/summary: Convenient, easily clipped on and off, useful in a pinchreview/text: The snap design makes it easy to take the tool off your keychain and put it back on without having to mess with the key ring. Completely unobtrusive, never stopped once at multiple airports. I've mostly used the small screwdriver, you never know when it'll come in handy, and it has more than once!
