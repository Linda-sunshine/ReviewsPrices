review/summary: Wish I got one years ago, better price than elsewherereview/text: We had one of these at our last house, and when we were selling it, it was fantastic, no keys for the realtor or workmen, etc. You can assign temporary codes and then erase them. No more worrying about lost keys or security lapses. Works great. This is the second one we have bought, and will probably add one to a vacation home. Even better to use there, since renters, etc. would not need to worry about a key. If the battery starts to die it gives you a red blink. You can hide an emergency key if it fails, but we have never had to use it. Get one! You will love it!
