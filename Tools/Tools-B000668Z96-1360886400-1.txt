review/summary: Results were visible after the first night of using the flea trapreview/text: I've been using the flea trap for three days now and I'm pleased with the results so far. Results were visible after the first night of use. In the morning, there were fleas in the trap. Place the trap in the area of your home that your pet spends the majority of its time as per the manufacturer&#8217;s directions and it&#8217;s as simple as that. The flea trap is very easy to setup and is ready to use in a matter of minutes. The product arrived very quickly. Depending on the amount of fleas that you may suspect to be in your home, it may be wise to order some replacement discs to have on hand. The flea trap arrives with two discs which are good for 2 &#8211; 4 weeks only. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.
