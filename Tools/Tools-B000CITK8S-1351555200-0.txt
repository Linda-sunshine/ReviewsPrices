review/summary: saved my batteryreview/text: i have been using this for years and have purchased these for friends and family. In the winter time, my motorcycle (CBR 600RR) used to die when I didn't disconnect it. However, with the tender plugged in all winter, I never had trouble in Spring. I no longer have my motorcycle, but now use this for my Troy Bilt Riding Mower (Super Bronco). It works wonderfully and I keep it plugged in all winter, and when grass cutting season comes along, my mower starts right up. You simply connect the clamps to the battery correctly and just "forget about it". It's a smart charger, and won't over charge your battery.I highly recommend this if you own a Riding Mower or Motorcycle. Batteries aren't cheap!
