review/summary: Impressive Stylish Heaterreview/text: Purchased this in order to cut down on winter heating costs to heat the main bedroom (17' x 17' with Vaulted ceilings) and lower my thermostat. After a week of use, I can say that this unit works great.The design is stylish and you will be amazed by the ability of a such a compact unit to warm up a room. The fact that the unit has oscillation and a remote control are bonuses on top of the quiet operation of the unit (equivalent to the sound a of typical desktop PC) and really help this unit to stand out.I have other space heaters and this is the quietest and fastest to warm up a room....not to mention it isn't ugly.The controls are easy to use and there is a noticeable beep when you change settings on the unit but nothing that will scare you.They say this is rated for rooms up to 800 Sq. Ft. so if that works for you ....this unit is alot of bang for the buck.
