review/summary: Great Value for the pricereview/text: I replaced the same model with this one. We had installed the previous one approx 10 years ago and it had apparently rusted through and was leaking from the very bottom where the electrical box was. The new one seems a bit quieter and overall has been great. If I can get another 10 years out of this one, I'll be happy for this price it's fantastic.
