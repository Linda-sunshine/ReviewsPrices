review/summary: I like it, if only...review/text: A reorg of my laundry room prompted this purchase. I installed it and it was perfect! But then...it fell so I got my husband to put it up and a few months later it fell again. I do like this butit really needs to be attached to a stud and unfortunately, there is none where this will work. Iam looking for a way to make it work because I do like it.
