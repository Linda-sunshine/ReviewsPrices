review/summary: Strength Tipreview/text: I've just finished installing this unit and I am very pleased. I am offering the followingtip just in case you are not a good weight lifter like me. I had open heart surgery inAugust and needed a way to avoid lifting the 15# unit under the sink while trying tomanipulate the lock ring in place. I decided to sit down on the couch and give the problemto my processing center in my brain to come up with an answer. It gave me the following andit worked for me. Perhaps it will work for you too.I used a previous tip on this forum to put books under the old unit to remove it and alsofor installing the new one. However, I did not want to try and hold 15#s with one hand andtry to get it locked into place with the other. So I opted for adding another book that wasabout 1 inch too high. Then I loosened the lock ring under the sink holding the flange inplace so it would play upwards about an inch. Then I got the new unit up onto the books andheld up the flange, about the weight of a quarter pounder, till I could get the unit underand centered. Then I let the flange down to rest on top and manipulated the lock ring tillit engaged the projections on the unit and then turned it counterclockwise about 1/4 turnso it would hold everything in place as I hooked up the drainage and dishwasher hose.I said to myself, "This is just too easy." The part of the installation that bothered methe most was solved by changing a 15# lift into a quarter pounder. I then just had to turnthe lock ring all the way left till it locked up completely. Hope this helps.
