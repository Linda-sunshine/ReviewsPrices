review/summary: Love itreview/text: I just got this yesterday and i only set it up today, its been on half the day in daylight and i have caught atleast 10 fleas!! i have one in my living room and kitchen. i just love this i would recommend it to anyone. I think i got my moneys worth within a few hours of using this!!Update: this morning when i woke up my living room trap has about 40 fleas and kitchen has 30. i honestly didnt know i had that many fleas in my house!! when my pup was alive (sadly 3 days ago she was hit by a car) she had fleas from running into the woods. we would have fleas jump on us once in awhile but nothing bad. im not so itchy cause im allergic to fleas like crazy. considering buying another one to put out on the porch with my cats and see if i get any caught out there!
