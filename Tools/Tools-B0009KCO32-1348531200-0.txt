review/summary: Needs Modificationreview/text: Product just okay,but would be better with some upgrades. Hanger is hardly a tension rod as described. Once positioned I had to manually rotate the rod to have it tight from door side to door side. More magnets are needed to keep the center points of the screen tightly closed and to eliminate voids where the two side screens meet at the center. Insects are free to enter courtesy of the screens NOT held together by too few magnets.
