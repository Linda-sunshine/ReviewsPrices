review/summary: Worked perfectlyreview/text: I had a few rather intelligent mice recently. They managed to avoid the traditional traps and glue traps I set out. I set two of these electronic traps up Friday night and by Sunday they had already caught a few. Just don't overbait them because it's easy to get the peanut butter on the kill plates if you're not careful.
