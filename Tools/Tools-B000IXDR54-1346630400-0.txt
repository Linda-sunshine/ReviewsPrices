review/summary: The price is right and its brighter than the upgrade led kit.review/text: I have many old mag light packages and have upgraded them to led. I have used all types of upgrades but when this particular item came it is brighter than all the rest by a considerable amount. I am not sure if it is a matter of the kelvin scale of light color that makes it "appear" brighter or that it actually is. The old upgrade is LED is marked 3R1G06 on the housing module. It installs in the place of the old PR bulbs and is held on with a ring retainer. The new flashlight purchased here on amazon has some design differences The LED's seem the same at first glance but the screw-on retention ring is non existent on the new module I could not remove the led module easily. (ill have to see if there are any on line instructions and I must be missing something obvious as I'm fairly adept at disassembling things.)There is no spare bulb in the new module. Either these babies are indestructible for the most part or it was just to expensive to include a spare bulb...That is a bit uneasy of a feeling...However, my old upgraded module LED has survived with 4 years of daily use and abuse as well as camping/hunting trips...this includes drops to the rocks of 6 to 8 feet. and drops onto concrete of 8 feet and it has never burned out or failed. (its still going strong today after the 4 years since the upgrade to LED.) So if this new light holds up anywhere near my old one does... this is a worthwhile purchase and its a better/brighter design...or so it appears. Overall it is the kind of quality and function one would expect from Maglite. You should not be disappointed by the blinding brightness of this lamp.
