review/summary: The "Flex" is the best partreview/text: PROS: the long, flexible neck allows for tilting in almost any direction, the clip is large enough to clip to lots of pages in a book, the clip doubles as a stand so the light can sit flat on a table, the light is LED (long-life), it's small enough to carry for travel and because the neck is so flexible, it's easy to bunch up even smaller for travelCONS: the light isn't always bright enough (when reading in dark); I find myself adjusting the light often to get the whole page of the book visible, the on/off switch takes some pressure to switch on or off, and because the clip is larger, I adjust it often to clip more book pages in so they're not folding over such a bulky clip while reading
