review/summary: Not that goodreview/text: I thought this would be a the best option for our back door to stop the bugs getting in. It mostly works but the screen material is a little stiff (which means it will be less likely to rip it also makes it harder to get through, especially if you are carrying anything like a plate of food). Also, it only has 2 magnets and has to overlap in the correct way - which neither my son or dog ever do except by chance.We had a friend who saw it, thought it was a great idea and then went to Walgreens to get the "As Seen On TV" version. After seeing that one, we ended up replacing ours with that one for less than half the price. The screen material doesn't seem quite as good but it's more flexible and easier to go through and it seals *much* better. It has a row of magnets that always seal tight and also since it doesn't have the bar at the top, there is no gap for bugs to get in.tl;dr version: Get the "As Seen On TV" version from Walgreens instead.
