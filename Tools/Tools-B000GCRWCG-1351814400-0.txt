review/summary: Arrived quicklyreview/text: I don't know how to review these blankets without opening one of them up and checking it out. And maybe I should do that. I bought them for emergency use, and I was trusting the reviews that I read. I'm kind of thinking that once you open up one of these small packets and spread out the blanket that was inside, you will never be able to put it back inside the small package again. But maybe I should try opening one up, just to experience what kind of emergency blankets I have bought.They arrived in three or four days, don't remember which, even using the cheapest longest amazon shipping service selection.
