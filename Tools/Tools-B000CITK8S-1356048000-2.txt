review/summary: good battery tenderreview/text: i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have. i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid). i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable. it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging. i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good price
