review/summary: Good quality for good pricereview/text: For the money the accusharp provides a quality product. It is durable and lasts awhile for a reasonable price . Provides a nice sharp edge . I used it on some of my most beat up and dull edges and it did a good job restoring a cutting edge. Hope this helps someone!
