review/summary: BEAST!!!review/text: Easy installation.Don't forget plumbers putty, don't forget to remove the inside plastic cap where the dishwasher hose goes, and you have to re-use your old disposal power cord or buy one, the new units do not come with one. All and all, worth the price of most retail stores, GET IT NOW!!!
