review/summary: Nice product, EZ installationreview/text: First of all, the item was delivered promptly - early I think. After assuaging some concern that it might hit the hardware on my screen door (the "knob" on the lock does protrude about 2 1/4"), installation took a total of about 15-20 minutes with just a Philips head screwdriver. After satisfying myself that it worked (by using the default user codes) it took just a few seconds to program in my own codes. I took another reviewer's advice about writing the 6-digit programming code with a Sharpie on the inside of the interior casing of the lock. I think the passive design will work out well.
