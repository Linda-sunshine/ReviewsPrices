review/summary: Good for my needs, but...review/text: I ran into 2 issues mentioned elsewhere, plugging into a outdoor outlet in a weather resistant enclosure and an indicator light.I used 1 of a &#34;Stanley 31372 One-Foot Cord Max Extender, 3-Pack&#34;, plugged a neon nightlight into the secound outlet, cut the bottom out of a plastic bag and wound electical tape around each end of the clear plastic sleeve made from the bag. My pond heater works great and I can tell when it's under power.
