review/summary: Cheapreview/text: Thermo Cube construction quality is poor. The ground plug pulled out of the unit after I removed from a wall outlet on the very first use out of the package. Fortunately for Amazon replacement policy... although I am not too excited about getting another one of these. Look elsewhere. This is cheaply built / poor quality...
