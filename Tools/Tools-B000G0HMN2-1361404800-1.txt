review/summary: Bright and easy on batteriesreview/text: MagLite has always made durable, bright flashlights. I bought this as an extra to have around the house, and it is now my primary. It has to be 60% brighter than my bulb-style 3-D MagLite flashlight that I've had for 10 years. Water resistant, bright, and handy to have around the house, shop, camp site, or boat.
