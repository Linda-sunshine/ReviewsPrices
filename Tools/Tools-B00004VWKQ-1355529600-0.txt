review/summary: Sharpens knives extremely wellreview/text: This product does an incredible job of sharpening knives with just a few strokes and is extremely affordable as well. This makes it a great gift. My parents always have extremely dull knives, and I purchased one for them and got all of their knives back in great shape in a few minutes. Using one of these on one of your dullest knives about 3 times is enough to make it ready to carve through anything like a it was hot and you were cutting butter.
