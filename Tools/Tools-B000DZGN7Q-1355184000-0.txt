review/summary: This thing is a beast!review/text: I looked up garbage disposals on consumer reports and this disposal is has the highest rating. I really like that it has sound-deading foam around the outside of the unit. It was very easy to install and runs extremely well. I attached it to a granite sink and the seals worked great. The one spot that I had to adjust due to leaking was the elbow that comes out of the unit and attaches to the drain. You have to make sure that you center the flange and tighten it down really tight.
