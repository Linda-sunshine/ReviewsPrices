review/summary: Great little productreview/text: I bought two of these based on internet reviews. Have one on a classic car and another on my camper (deep cycle battery). Seems to work great...keeps batteries ready to "rock and roll" whenever these not-so-often vehicles are needed. And does not overcharge!
