review/summary: Performance good, usability terrible.review/text: The only pro to this pump is that it pumps like a champ.The cons are:Smooth exterior, no handle, relatively heavy and therefore easy to drop.Extremely short air hose and AC power cord.Cover for the short hose and AC power cord, but no cover for the DC power cord, it comes unraveled in the trunk.The power button is located inside the DC power cord storage area so you either have to take out the DC power cord to get to the power switch or you have to try to force your fingers into the compartment to get it to turn on.Useless "industrial" add-ons of faux nuts which are just little plastic pieces that fall off.
