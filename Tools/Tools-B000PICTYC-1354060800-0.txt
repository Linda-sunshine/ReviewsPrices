review/summary: uh. mazing.review/text: I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. Oh my gosh. I was so excited for it to arrive and give it to him! When it got here he got it early and immediately went to hacking at things in the garage with it. Super sharp, nice weight and he loves it. Really good quality stuff. So glad I made this purchase.
