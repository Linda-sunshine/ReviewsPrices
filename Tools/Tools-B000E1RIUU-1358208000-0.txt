review/summary: Very effectivereview/text: This trap is easy to setup and is very effective in catching and terminating mice. Within couple of months it was able to terminate 8 mice in my house.Only downside is the below average quality of the door above the &#34;capturing&#34; chamber. It is a bit flimsy and got detached easily when i tried to get a mouse out of the chamber. It still works but it takes a few minutes to get the door back on without the safety feature disabling the trap.Overall for the price it is a very effective device and would fully recommend it.
