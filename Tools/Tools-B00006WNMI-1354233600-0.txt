review/summary: This Filter doesn't do anythingreview/text: This filter is completely worthless. I tested it with a water quality tester, and it didn't change anything. Not only that, but the instructions require you to run your water through the filter for 10 whole minutes before you can even start using it. Who wants to do that? Talk about a waste! I'd save your money and not buy this piece of junk.
