review/summary: Awesome jeweler's screwdriver setreview/text: I originally purchased this screwdriver set for use on my iPhone. I came to find out that, even though advertised at the time, it does not have the necessary bit to work on iPhones. It has been very useful for working on my RC car and other computer products as well as mine and my wife's glasses. It is very versatile for anything with a small screw. It comes with phillips, standard, hex, and torx (star) head bits.
