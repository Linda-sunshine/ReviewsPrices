review/summary: Fun and informative!review/text: I sort of enjoy this thing. In some cases, like my kegerator for example, I'd rather not know what the energy use is... However, it is very handy, I have even used it to trouble shoot and make sure there is power and in another case, make sure the draw at the end of my extension cord was as expected. Good tool for every homeowner.
