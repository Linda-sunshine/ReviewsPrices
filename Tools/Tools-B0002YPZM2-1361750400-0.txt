review/summary: Terrific for Bikingreview/text: Bought these for my bike commute, and they're perfect. Nice and grippy - great for riding and for lugging the bike up and down stairs, on and off the train, etc.They keep my hands warm and protected from the wind without being huge and bulky. I don't know how well they'd do in freezing temperatures, but they're very comfortable in the 30s - 50s range.
