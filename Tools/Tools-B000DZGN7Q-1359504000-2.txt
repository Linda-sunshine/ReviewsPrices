review/summary: Read the instructions carefully!review/text: I had a horrible time getting the unit to install. My spousal unit and I even hauled in a floor jack to try to cram it into place. I finally read the instructions out loud to my wife and found that I had screwed up repeatedly in placing the infamous rubber ring on the top of the unit. Once I placed it on properly, the unit slid into place effortlessly. Boy, did I feel stupid. I spent 3 hours on what would have been a 15 minute job. I have had it for about a month now. It eats everything that my old one wouldn't (the worst being broccolli stems). VERY QUIET unit. I cannot imaging anyone complaining about the noise level.
