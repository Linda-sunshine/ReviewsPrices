review/summary: Wonderful!review/text: I love this reading light. The light is perfect, not yellow at all which is one of the things that bothers me about some reading lights (due to the LED). I have had it for over 2 years now and it is still working just as it was when I first purchased it. I am a very heavy reader so that says something about the durability of this. The flexibility of it works well and it is easy to clip onto furniture if you don't feel like having it on your book. It is light enough to not weight down hard on your arms if you are a hold-the-book-over-your-head reader (like myself). I would purchase this item again and would recommend it to friends.
