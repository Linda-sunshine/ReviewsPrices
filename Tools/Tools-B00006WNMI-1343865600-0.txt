review/summary: This is an excellent on-tap filter!review/text: I've used Brita on-tap water filters for years, then I switched to the Clear2O water pitcher, then back to the Brita on-tap system. I was sick and tired of the little green light not working (Brita on-tap users, you know what I mean) so decided to look for something else. I took a chance on the Culligan FM-15A and was blown away by how much better it is than the Brita alternative.Here's why:- It takes up much less space on your faucet than the Brita system as it sits to the side, not underneath. Finally I can fit my pots and pans comfortably underneath and easily fill up water bottles.- It's always set to 'unfiltered'. When you want filtered water you pull out the little knob. When you turn off the water, the knob clicks back into place and it reverts to regular unfiltered water. Personally, I love this. I use to hate always having to flip back and forth on the Brita.- The flow of filtered water is a nice solid stream. The Brita has this spray stream which I hated.- It's quiet in both filtered and unfiltered mode. The Brita in comparison was very noisy.- The water tastes remarkably 'more filtered' than the Brita. I actually noticed a marked difference between the two!The only con I have is that it doesn't come in Chrome which the Brita does. But for me, that's not enough to knock down my rating of five stars. It sounds like I'm a Brita hater or something, but up until I got this filter I was a long time Brita customer. I'm just shocked at how much better this system is and wanted to share my experiences.
