review/summary: emergency Blankletsreview/text: This was another stocking stuffer hit at our house. Santa must do all his shopping at Amazon. I will buy more to be sure to have enough for everyone in my car. Even gave one to Gram in case the nursing home loses power. They have a generator but it is mind over matter for Gram :-) These blankets are so compact...you could fit mutiples in your glove compartment. I will give them to co-workers next year!
