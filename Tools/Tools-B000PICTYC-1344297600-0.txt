review/summary: Sharp, Lightweight and Sturdy.review/text: I would like to start by saying that SOG makes some pretty good blades. This Tactical hawk is no exception and in my eyes worth EVERY penny. Mine came packaged wonderfully and it came two or three days early to boot. The head on this weapon is a bit small by my standards but all in all a good design with good steel. The twin torx screws and metal pommel are enough to keep me content and feeling safe the head wont come apart anytime soon. Granted this design will not last forever but will serve its purpose. I would also like to say that this particular item is NOT a self defense or camping tool. Go to home depot if your looking for a tool to go chop wood and bang down doors. The tomahawk is a weapon and it should be respected as such.
