review/summary: Waste King L-8000 vs 9980 - Easy installationreview/text: I was debating between the 2 and went with the L8000 due to a big price drop. They are essentially the same, just different ways to attach to the sink drain. I was replacing a Badger 1/3 HP that had cracked after 2 years (never buy a badger - loud and cheap) that had a 3 bolt connection which matches with the 9980. Getting the badger off was a pain, had to use a hammer, but once off, replacing the 3 bolt sink drain with the L8000 EZ connector was very easy. I did read the instructions before starting to understand the process, and then it took about 15 minutes, once I got the old badger off to have the new Waste King installed and running. Much more powerful and not loud with a lifetime warranty. Nice.
