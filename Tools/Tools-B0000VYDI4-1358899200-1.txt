review/summary: Pleasantly surprised...review/text: I was looking for a new step ladder after moving to a new house (it was too much of a hassle to take it with me). Not having much of an idea about what I wanted exactly, I decided to consult with my fellow netizens and find the most highly rated ladder on Amazon. Of course, I was led to the Werner MT series. What a pleasant discovery!Absolutely pleased with the design (which I learnt is a direct knock-off of the Little Giant and much, much more affordable). I gave up on the notion of owning a multifunction ladder after finding out that they are now banned in New Zealand due to safety reasons. This step / extension alternative is actually much more innovative in my opinion. It's simple to work out (I highly recommend checking out the Little Giant demonstration videos) and the construction is quite sturdy. The latter gives it the slightly heavier weight that a few other reviewers have pointed out. A great purchase for those like me who are clueless about ladders.
