review/summary: Wow...what a complete bargin!!!review/text: My whirlpool refrigerator needs this particular water filter. I ordered this filter and received it almost in minutes!!! It was easily installed and now I have another to install...without having to drive the miles required or contacting a sales person to help me. And...the price was amazing! The last time I bought this particular filter I paid twice the price!!!
