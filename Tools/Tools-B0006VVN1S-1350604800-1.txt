review/summary: I like it.review/text: I like this showerhead.*Plenty of plumber's tape included*Showerhead is decently built*Filter is easy enough to insert/replaceOverall, happy with this purchase. I can't tell you for sure that this does make a difference, but I do feel cleaner after showers & the water does feel silky.There's probably a more noticeable difference if you're starting with hard water, but my water was good to begin with. Still, I like it, and will be keeping it for life.
