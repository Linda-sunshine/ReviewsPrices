review/summary: Great fit, long lasting, easy to work withreview/text: I have been using the same pair of these gloves for a few weeks in my workshop, where I do a range of woodworking and carpentry tasks. These are the first gloves I have found that I can wear most of the day without the gloves getting in the way or just wearing through in just a few days.
