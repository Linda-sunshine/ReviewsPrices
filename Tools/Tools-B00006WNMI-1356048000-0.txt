review/summary: Worksreview/text: What I do like.It turns itself off after each use.It holds up and doesn't break.It is better priced than Purr or Brita.It Holds up better than Purr or Brita.What I don't like.It doesn't have a LED indicator to change the filter.It doesn't quit when it's time to change the filter.I have had several of all 3 Faucet Filters and Culligan is the best made and best priced. Purr and Brita break before I have replaced 3 filters. They just don't hold up. Culligan does.
