review/summary: Great trap!review/text: Seven mice in seven days. As much as I hate setting it up at night and then waking up to the green flashing light, I obviously have a mouse problem and this product has been very effective. I was a little nervous after reading the review of the women who found the mouse still moving after her husband disposed of it. I figure it's probably important to wait a full 10 minutes after you see the green light flashing before you deal with your mouse just to make sure it's been in the box long enough.
