review/summary: Great LED Flashlightreview/text: I bought 2 Mag-Lites to leave around the house in case of a power outage. These were great as we had lost power for 10 days during Hurricane Sandy. The LED light is very bright and uses less battery power. I bought a 4-D cell regular Mag-Lite and the batteries didn't last nearly as long and the output of that unit was not nearly as good. Definitely get the LED version.
