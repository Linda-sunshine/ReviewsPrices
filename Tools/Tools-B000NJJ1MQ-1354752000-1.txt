review/summary: Easy Install, Works Greatreview/text: Just a few notes we haven't seen mentioned in other reviews:* The (front) keypad side of the deadbolt is a little deeper than normal deadbolts; the part where a key would go sticks out a bit. Ours rubs against the handle of our storm door if the keyhole part is in the vertical position. Not a big deal as long as we rotate the key part to the horizontal position. Don't let this keep you from buying this lock.* To remove the lock from the packaging, you'll need to unscrew two Phillips screws holding the lock to the styrofoam.* The lock was relatively easy to install and easily replaced our standard deadbolt with no drilling needed. Very detailed, step-by-step instructions.
