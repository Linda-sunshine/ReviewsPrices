review/summary: EXCELLENTreview/text: This product is unbelievable. It was the only thing that worked. I had tried sprays, bombs, even the all natural crap...nothing took care of the long term infestation. Within two weeks of putting the lamps in my basement the entire infestation was gone. I keep one going all the time now in case my little furr ball decides to lick his frontline off again and gets infested with fleas. I would recommend these lamps to anyone!
