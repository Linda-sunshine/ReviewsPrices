review/summary: It actually works wellreview/text: I have tried several types of knife sharpeners and they all gave a blunt edge at best. This little guy has turned all my cheap and old knives into functional tools again. This thing actually takes slivers of metal off with each pass and gets you a nice sharp knife with just a couple passes. I probably would not use this on high end knives as it removes enough metal to notice but it works great if you don't mind.
