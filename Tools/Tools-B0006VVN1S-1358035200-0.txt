review/summary: Works like a charmreview/text: I've had dry itchy skin and scalp for a while and stumbled upon this product. Although skeptical of the claims, the filter works great. Hair immediately felt softer and silkier. I live in Florida and the water can sometimes have a sulphery smell that has also gone away. I can honestly recommend this product to anyone. I deducted a star because I wish it had the 1.5 gpm rating of the water efficient shower heads now available. They can save 2000 gallons of water a year over a 2.5 gpm.
