review/summary: Fantastic!review/text: After having tried several other brand filters over the years, I finally discovered this one on Amazon. It works better because the part that screws to the faucet is metal not plastic. Ours lasted 2.5 years, and finally it started to leak and I'm replacing it. Much better than the &#60;6 month average for my other filters. And the water tastes great!And I think ours would have lasted longer if we didn't have guests that thought you had to rotate the white part to get it to turn on (like other filters), ie they didn't notice the little pull out screw. I think this put a lot of unnecessary stress on the system
