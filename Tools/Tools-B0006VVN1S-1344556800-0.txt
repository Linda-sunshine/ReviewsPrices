review/summary: Day 1 and Very Pleased!review/text: Great filter, great price and got shipped standard, but arrived within 2 days. Installed it in less than two minutes. Knew this filter was my last hope for my long tangly hair I struggle combimg everytime after washing and even conditioning. Also attributed my chapped heels all my life (after using every treatmentover the counter, prescriptive and natural remedies) to the chlorine in the water I stand in every day I shower and clean my feet with. If chlorine in the culprit, can't see how ANY remedy would work. And my legs and arms in the summer and winder months just feel so cakey and itchy after showers...didnt even feel as lotion could penetrate. Honest, after only one very pleasant feeling water in my shower today I felt amazing. No intense itching of legs and arms all night while trying to sleep. Who would know, as there is no strong chlorine smell, but you can still feel like you just got out of a pool. Sure wish I wouldve known about the concept of a shower filter years and years ago. It could last one month and I'd be happy. The water pressure and stream choices are excellent. Better pressure and width than before! Day One...Already happy, couldnt stop touching my hair and hands and arms all day at work....soooo soft. I even want to fill buckets for clean up jobs around the house. I dont use harsh detergents, so more lovely water for my skin. I can only imagine when I do add one of my organic lotions to my skin. Love, love, love it! Best and least expensive investment EVER!
