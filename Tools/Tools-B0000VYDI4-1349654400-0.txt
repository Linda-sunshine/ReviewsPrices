review/summary: versatile without compromising stability or reliabilityreview/text: This ladder is very well built. Parts all fit together without rattling and shaking around. Al latches are make solid connections to their counterparts. I've used this ladder as an extension ladder and as an A-frame ladder.I have not used this ladder as a scaffold yet.
