review/summary: Intuitive and accurate enough; screen not always easy to readreview/text: The Kill A Watt is a great little device for measuring instantaneous power use, and it even has a basic logging function to measure total energy used since it's been plugged in. It has limitations on accuracy, especially around non-resistive loads, but it seems to be accurate to within 10%, which is sufficient for a consumer device.Pros: super easy to use - plug the Kill A Watt into an outlet, plug your load into the Kill A Watt, done. Small and portable. Measures full range of average parameters: voltage, current, real and apparent power, frequency, power factor. Logging function records total energy used since the device was plugged in, and the time since it was plugged in.Cons: Display difficult to read in low light, and from an angle. No measurement of peak or anomalous values. 0.2% accuracy is a stretch. Outlet very stiff - unplugging a load requires a lot of force.I leave a small power strip hooked up to the Kill A Watt, so I can measure multiple loads at once (stereo and subwoofer, for example). It's also much easier to plug things in and out that way.If you want lab-grade accuracy, spend (at least) ten times as much and get a Fluke meter. If you want to teach others in your household about the cost of electricity, or you're curious yourself, this is the device for you. It's fun to use, and practical at that.
