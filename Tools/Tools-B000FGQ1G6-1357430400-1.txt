review/summary: Exactly what I was looking forreview/text: A few weeks ago, I was installing a SSD hard drive to my lapto[, and I was using the only small screw driver I had that would fit the screws, a small eye glasses screw driver that was about 3 inches high. Removing the screws were easy enough, but once I swapped the harddrives, and started to put it together, that is when I wished I had this set. It took me twice as long to put the screws back into the laptop. First, the screws were really small, less than 1/2 inch and the hole was closed to the side of the chassis, and I had the hardest time try to put the screw in the hole, and having the screw stay there while I attempt to screw it in. Needless to say, after 10 mins of frustration, and finally getting the screws in, I went online to fine a screw driver set.After doing some research, and for the price, I picked up this Precision set. It comes with 29 different tips, and 1 driver. I was easily able to find the one that fits the laptop screws, and more importantly, the tips are magnetized so it made it so much easier to put the screws back in. I read some reviews where the tips bent under pressure but I haven't had that happened to me yet. Of course, the laptop screws that I dealt with aren't tightly screwed in and I haven't had the opportunity to try this on screws that are really on tight but all in all, this is exactly what I wanted.
