review/summary: Chinese junk? Not just a shipreview/text: Some things you can't tell until it arrives at your house: the part that connects the pump to your tire is made of plastic. Remember the bike pump you used as a kid? It's connector was metal. Good reason. This part failed (for me) broke exactly 30 seconds into its first use, rendering the whole thing worthless. Also, think about where the switch that turns this on is located. If you plug this into an AC outlet, you have to drag out the DC connector so that you can get to the switch. Now exactly where is the switch? It's inside the back of the unit. You can't see the gauge, and turn the thing on at the same time, well, not without getting on your hands and knees, if you are filling a car tire or something else you cant place on a table. It's what I would consider a design flaw. The gauge also is a bit vague, as commented on other reviews. The one I received was marked on PSI (10 pound increments) and &#34;atmospheres&#34; in case - well I'm not sure for what. Basketballs? So, I returned it. You may find it works for you.
