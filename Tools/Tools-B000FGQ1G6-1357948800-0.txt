review/summary: Cost effective for light usereview/text: While I suppose it would be relatively easy to strip or distort these screw bits -- especially on larger-sized screws-- since the metal in these bits isn't high grade tool steel, the fact the small screws most of these bits are designed to work on shouldn't require much torque. So, while I wouldn't recommend this set for daily use or on high torque fasteners, if you have yourself having to deal with one or more small/odd sized fittings on a project, this is worth considering. It offers slotted, Phillips, Torx, and hex bits in many of the sizes that are too small to be handled by heavier duty tool sets. Each bit fits securely into an interchangeable slot inside the case, and the case itself has a sliding lock on the side that should hold it closed if the set is dropped.In sum: this is a cost-effective way to get the ability to deal with a variety of small-sized fasteners-- as long as you don't have to apply a great deal of force.
