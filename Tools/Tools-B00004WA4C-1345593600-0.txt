review/summary: Cannot remove unit from basereview/text: Prior to installing the smoke detector I wanted to make sure I knew how to put it on and remove it from the plastic base that mounts to the ceiling or wall. It was very easy to put on the base, but impossible to get it off without breaking the base. Which is what I had to do to separate the pieces. I review the instructions to figure out what I had done wrong with this extremely simple process. I found I had done nothing wrong. It's just a poorly designed product.
