review/summary: Great Heaterreview/text: I have three of these heaters. That is a 5 star rate. The heater produces a nice dry heat. I recently bought a home in Flagstaff. We have gas heat, which is expensive. These work out just fine. I started with one heater for living room last year. Then needed one for my bedroom and my office. I like the choice of settings, it goes off when the desired heat has been reached. I can also set the heater to ocssilate, that is also a nice feature. I read other reviews and that promoted me to buy the first heater. Would recommend you try this heater. If you do not like it you can return it. It is great for snowy Flagstaff.
