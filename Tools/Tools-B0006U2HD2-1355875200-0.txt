review/summary: Dog saver!review/text: This is a great concept, and it works! I don't know how long it will work, but it is simple, so I think that it will. I use it with heat lamps for my dogs, and they seem to appreciate the extra heat. The heat lamps heat the surface and not the air of the room, so they are very effective.
