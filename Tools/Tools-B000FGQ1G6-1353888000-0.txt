review/summary: Really great product for the pricereview/text: I have a temperamental digital camera that I have to take apart occasionally and clean the interior lens. I was having to send it to the professional camera guy at about 50 dollars a pop to avoid the blob on my digital pictures. This little set allows me to get into it very easily. Those little screws are impossible without a kit like this.I found that this kit also allows me to adjust my glasses and take apart virtually any electronic gadget, particularly the back that holds the batteries in to a toddler toy. I have been pleasantly surprised by the number of used I have found for this set, which has a good number and variety of bits.An interesting feature is the way the handle operates. The little red top can be held stationary in the palm of the hand while the black body rotates the screw. This gives you a very good grip for tiny screws with more torque power than a normal tiny screw driver with a fixed handle. This is a feature I have not seen in other under-$30 jeweler screw driver sets. The case is also cleverly designed and easy to open and get the bit you need. I think for the money this is an excellent set.The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it does not have a few of the higher end security bits. For the average consumer, this is probably never going to be a problem, but occasionally you run into a security screw that is not a star bit or regular Philips head bit, which are mostly what the bits here are. Otherwise, this is a good set.
