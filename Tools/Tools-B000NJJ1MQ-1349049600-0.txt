review/summary: Schlage BE365review/text: The product was very easy to install. The major complaint is that it says "keypad illuminates so you can see it at night" when in actuality it is only the Schlage symbol that lights up. If I had known this prior to purchase I would have purchased a different lock. Should save tonnes of money from lost key replacement, however.
