review/summary: Ton of Connections and it does what it needs to !review/text: This thing has a ton of outlets. More than what I need. The outlets are also spaced out nicely that you can plug in adaptors, wires and everything with much space available. And for the 18$ I bought this for, well worth every penny !Save yourself some money, buy this instead of 40$ Monsters !
