review/summary: It broke after 2 months, BUTreview/text: Stopped working, would only hum, but was not jammed, and reset button did nothing. But one 5 minute call to the maker and a new one was sent without fuss and works fine. I have used these models for many years and this was the first with this problem. Since they did not want it returned, my son kept it to take apart, try to fix and used as a chum grinder. I have not heard how that worked out yet.
