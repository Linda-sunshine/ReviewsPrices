review/summary: No very effective against fliesreview/text: We have a housefly problem in our backyard and were desperate to make our picnic table useful. Reading all the good reviews made me have hope. The problem is not that it doesn't zap the flies. Its that the flies never go into it. I put some food to attract them, but they would rather just eat the food we had a few inches away on the table. I was under the impression that flies would be attracted to it. This is not the case.
