review/summary: electrical problem?review/text: I really wanted this to work. I had tried the nightlite + a dish of water method and while it worked for a while, the water always got spilled or dried out.I plugged Flea Trap in, found it gave out a nice non-disturbing light, I thought, yeah, I can live with this in my bedroom. Within 2 hours, the bulb was burned out. Replaced the bulb with a new one, within an hour, that bulb burnt out. Tried with a third bulb, same result. Each time, the bulb burnt out dramatically, with a black cast on the glass. I'm not going to try again.Oh, and also, while it was set up near my pet's area (with a burned out bulb), his tail hair managed to get stuck on the adhesive. Scared him.
