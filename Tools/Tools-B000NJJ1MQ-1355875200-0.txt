review/summary: Poorly manufactured deadbolt, Missing Instructions and Keycodesreview/text: The lock was a giant pain to install, requiring three separate installations to make it work. After the first install there was a burr in the deadbolt that prevented the bolt from coming out. I filed that down, and installed it a second time. Next, I went to program it, and the only place the programming codes existed were on THE BACK of the keypad, so I had to uninstall it all over again. Nowhere in the instructions does it mention to write down the codes first-- there was supposed to be a "programming guide", but that was not in the box anywhere.
