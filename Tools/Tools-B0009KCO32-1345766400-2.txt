review/summary: nifty doorreview/text: this is a great design & easy to install! The screen is durable. My only complaint is that the spring-loaded rod kept slipping and we had to install some shower curtain rod brackets to keep it in position. I like the looks of the curtain much better than the standard aluminum door and it works great for keeping bugs at bay!
