review/summary: Super quiet, very powerfulreview/text: Recieved in time and installation was fairly easy (what you would expect). Installed in a new solid copper sink with a copper collar that was purchased seperately from the sink to match.When you turn it it, the water running almosts masks all of the sound of the disposal. When no water is running, you almost cant tell it is even running. Of course, you must run cold water while using it. It does the job VERY well. Its size makes the the underside of the seek more roomy for soaps, etc.Very happy, high quality, quiet operation. Solid product.
