review/summary: Does the Jobreview/text: The water does taste purified. More like distilled, actually. It does reduce the water flow, especially if you have marginal water pressure to your home. I bought it to draw water for the coffee maker and reduce the use of bottled water. I decided the best place to install it would be the laundry sink, since the kitchen sink has a spray head type of faucet. I went to Menard's and found an adapter that had course threads like for a garden hose fitting. I then removed the internal fitting that was the default factory installed in this unit and screwed the filter on easily. The default adapter fit my upstairs bathroom sink but was in the way and hard to use up there. The laundry tub adapter cost around $7.00 with tax. Too bad it wasn't included to start with.
