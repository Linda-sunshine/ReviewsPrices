review/summary: Scary but coolreview/text: The "knife" must been one of the best combat close quarters device ever conceived. It has existed in various forms for hundreds for years, from the viking battle axe to the Native American tomahawk. Now to find that it has even been used at least as recently as the Vietnam Conflict attests to versatility of this weapon turned camping tool. It is a must have for the serious outdoors person.
