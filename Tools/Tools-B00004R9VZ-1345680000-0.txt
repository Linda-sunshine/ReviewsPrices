review/summary: Best Bug Zapper i have ownedreview/text: Recently bought a rural area home, the bugs kept us off the deck on warm nights. I bought two of these zappers, because of the reviews, one for each end of the deck.They just keep on zapping. I have had to take them down every couple of weeks and use my shop compressor to blow out the grids.As mentioned in previous reviews, this thing works you just need to be able to enjoy the ongoing zapping sound! The sound of success.
