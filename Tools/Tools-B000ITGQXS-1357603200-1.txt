review/summary: Just enough light to read in the darkreview/text: As you age, it becomes more difficult to read in low light. Sometimes a 100 watt bulb just doesn't give off enough light to make it comfortable to read. With this Fulcrum LED light, I have no problem reading in bed with no additional light. It illuminates the entire 2 pages when positioned properly with the adjustable, flexible arm.If it was just a little brighter, I would have given it 5 stars, but it is sufficient.
