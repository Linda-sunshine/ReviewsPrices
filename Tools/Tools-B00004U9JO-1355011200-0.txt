review/summary: Leaking from bottom of housing unitreview/text: We purchased and installed a Badger 5 in 2007. Now, after five years, it is leaking from the bottom of the housing unit. There's also a bit of corrosion on the top metal flange/latching mechanism. Based on many of the other posters' comments, it sounds like our unit lasted a bit longer; however, I still find the build quality disappointing. I wish companies would take more pride in their products and run their businesses with a long-term view rather than cutting corners to make a quick buck.
