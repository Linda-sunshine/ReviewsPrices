review/summary: Very versatile and stablereview/text: Having used light weight &#34;home owner&#34; ladders for years, this was a real step up (no pun intended). It's heavy but very stable even in the fully raised position. The only problem I've had is the lack of a tray for paint or tools. It's an add-on that I definitely need and will be purchasing. Would have gotten 5 stars but the finishing was rough on the top of the ladder sections with very sharp burrs where the metal was cut. I actually cut my thumb on one before taking a file to the sharp edges.
