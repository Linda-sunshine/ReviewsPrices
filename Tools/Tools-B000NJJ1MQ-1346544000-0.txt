review/summary: This is the one to buy!review/text: Had tried a different keyless lock. It was fancier with remote but it just didn't work well always would hang up and not lock or unlock. I like being able to turn the lock myself and the confidence of knowing it is really locked. It is super easy to install, maybe 15 minutes if you take your time. Now I don't need to remember to take my key when I go out to my detached garage. I like it so well I'm getting one for the front door too!
