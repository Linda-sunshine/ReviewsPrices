review/summary: diseaster in the waitingreview/text: Unfortunantly I am unable to use this product. Since I have 2 indoor cats of a courious nature, and I sleep upstairs, I was afraid to try it. I did set it up, where I felt I had fleas lurking about. After I observed my two curious cats circling it as though it might be pray, I then tryed to place it under an end table. Now bear in mind that my cats are not only curious, but very determined. I could see problems ahead if I had gone upstairs to bed. In the morning I probably would have had to cut the flea trap off both of them. Possibly one or both would have been electricuted.I thought about sleeping on the recliner in the living room, that would be right there beside the end table, but I wouldn't have got a wink of sleep. So I pulled the plug and put the trap away and I've never tryed it since.perhaps someday I might try putting soapy water in the base of it. Years ago I used a homemade trap with a rectangular pan and a light bulb on a cord above it and during the night with the lights off 'I got fleas in the contraption. It's the light and the heat that attract the fleas.I instead tried a treatment Front Line on both cats and the fleas seem to be gone. I'm not getting bitten either. Also it helps to vacume often because the vacume will suck up flea eggs and the fleas as well. Remember to empty the vacume canister immediately after vacuming so that the fleas will not escape into your carpets again.I would not recommend this product unless your cats are shut in the basement over night or unless they can be put outside when you are using it. If you put your in door cats in the basement they will haller the whole night. Remember! Cats rule the house! They only allow us to live with them in order to be their servants!
