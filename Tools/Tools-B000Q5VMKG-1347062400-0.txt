review/summary: Can this be your life saver?review/text: This is my second purchase of this product, the first having reached the end of it's lifespan. But before that happened, the first one woke us up in the middle of the night when the furnace exhaust pipe unexpectedly collapsed, and undoubtedly saved our lives. Just follow the simple in-package installation directions, and let this little wonder be your guardian angel. We sleep better knowing it is on the job.
