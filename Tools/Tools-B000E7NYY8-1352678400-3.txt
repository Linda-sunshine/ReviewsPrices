review/summary: Best buy.review/text: My oil heater control fried. Lucky I unplugged it as it stuck on. Then I plugged it into this beauty! I set it close to the heater so it controls the oil temp and not the room temp. Much better than the original control. Now the heat is much more gentle and only the hours of the day I use the bathroom. I'm buying one for the pets.
