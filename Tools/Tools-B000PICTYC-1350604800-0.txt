review/summary: Awesome, but not.review/text: So I went to my local sporting goods store and was excited to see the SOG Tomahawk in stock. I immediately asked the counter person to take one out for me. I couldn't wait to get home to check out so I took it out of the packaging in the parking lot. I got home and took a couple tosses at the log I throes knives into and it throws nice. BUT on my 7th toss the handle broke right off. I.am very disappointed. If you want a tomahawk buy the Battle Axe. That's what I should have done.
