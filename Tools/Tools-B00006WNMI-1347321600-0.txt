review/summary: Efficient Filter, Don't Buy the Replacement Cartridgesreview/text: Every two to three months for years now (with a short, ill-advised break), I have bought one of these filters. It works well, doesn't leak, my water tastes great- all the things I hope for in a filter.As I alluded to, for a spell we used a fancy under the sink filter, but I read that for a filter to be most effective it needs to be the last thing your water goes through before you drink it. So we switched back to this.My only complaint is not with the filter, but the replacement cartridges. We have tried multiple times to use one and it never fits correctly. Now we just buy a whole new filter system every 2 months. It's only a few more dollars and then I don't have to deal with a leaky mess every time I want filtered water. Of course you can't subscribe and save on that, but (again) for a few dollars, I'd rather not deal with leaking.I've read other review (in the past) of this filter that have stated malfunctions with the parts. In all the times we've bought this filter (which I'm thinking is at least 20) I have never had issues with the mechanics of it breaking except maybe once/twice we had one that lost the ability to automatically shut off the filter when you turn the water off (to me, not a big deal). Of course, those issues may come if you keep the filter for a long time and just replace the cartridge (with hopefully better luck than us), so my advice there is somewhat lacking.
