review/summary: Sharp and different.review/text: all and all, not a bad tomahawk. The sheath that it comes with is absolutely terrible. When it's on a belt, make sure not to move to quickly. I had to sprint with it on my hip and it came out, almost going into my knee. BEWARE! As a camping tool; worthless, just get a good hatchet or a tomahawk without a spike. As a self defense tool; useful but you will have to practice as to not drive the spike into your own arm, leg, or head. The blade is sharp and makes short work of kindling and small logs, but the steel is soft and has to be sharpened regularly. The hammer on the side was useful for driving tent pegs, but the back side of a camp hatchet would better serve that task. It is light and fast in the hand. I would recommend a lanyard tied on to wrap around your hand as the grip on it can get slippery with sweat or rain.
