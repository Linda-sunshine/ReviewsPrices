review/summary: Shinning Star!review/text: I bought this flashlight for the all around home, car, and security reasons. Primary because the 3D cells gives it great battery life and great throw (distance of light beam). Using recyclables (AA in D adapters) this will get to about 20hours on high beam or on 3 D cells alkaline it will get just about 70hours of useable light.I chose to use the adapters because it will reduce the weight of the flashlight by 138g (or almost half a pound) Total weight with regular alkaline is about 2 pounds. So it depends if you are carrying this around all day or just a few minutes.Spot beam is very bright, tightly focus with excellent spill (plenty of light for hallways or warehouse aisle about 6 feet wide)Amazon had the best deal of 20.XX and it was delivered within 2 business days to CA. Item came without batteries and no spare incandescent bulb on the end cap. For existing owners of the older generations, you can just get the LED upgrade kit and enjoy a much brighter light and longer lasting battery life =)
