review/summary: Is Barely More Useful than a Standard Power Stripreview/text: I purchased this power strip for use with a variety of plugs, many of which use the large brick style plugs. For Example: [IMG][...]This surge protector looks like it would accommodate the different plugs far easier than a traditional power strip, but the ports are still too closely placed to one another to be of full use. I end up being able to utilize only some of the ports if I arrange my plugs in a variety of manners, but never am I able to make full use of all the ports. I will most likely order this surge protector to better accomodate my needs. http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-BP112230-08-Pivot-Plug-Surge-Protector/dp/B000JE9LD4/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1347824977&sr;=8-3&keywords;=surge+protectorThe device is not faulty, it just won't support large plugs very well. If you plan to use traditional straight plugs only, I'm sure it would be fine, but for the extra 5 dollars I'll be replacing it with the one listed above.
