review/summary: Good but not Great!review/text: I got this for one reason...to open boxes and or cut things as needed. I work 5 days a week in a warehouse and do not like to carry around large knives or multi-tools. I have enough stuff to carry without the weight of a extra tool. I thought this would solve my problem. First off this is longer than any keys you have so it is constantly getting stuck on something. Second the blade is sharp and not well designed so when you go to open BE CAREFUL! I have almost cut my finger on several occasions. Basically I had to take this off my key chain and dump it.
