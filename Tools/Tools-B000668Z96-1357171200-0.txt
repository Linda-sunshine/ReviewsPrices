review/summary: Just okreview/text: This flea trap did catch fleas, many fleas in fact. Unfortunately the bulb burned out in the first 3 days of using the trap and I had to purchase a new one. The second bulb burned out a week or so after that. I understand that the traps makers are not responsible for the inconsistencies of incandescent light bulbs, but for a product to rely so heavily on something like those light bulbs (and to have it fail to accomplish its purpose because of it) is poor design.
