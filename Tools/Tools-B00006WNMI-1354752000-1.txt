review/summary: Good Filterreview/text: I haven't used a fauset filter before and bought this Culligan on the basis of published reviews. Water taste is vastly improved, and I would have given it five stars on this basis. But the water runs rather slowly even when the filter is bypassed. That may be normal with faucet filters, but I have no way of knowing that. The unit has been installed for only one week, so I'm unable to comment on filter longevity.
