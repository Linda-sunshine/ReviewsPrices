review/summary: My First Garbage Disposer Installedreview/text: The instructions are very well written. They also explain how to uninstall your old unit (if need be). It took me about an hour and a half to install and I'm not handy. I needed to pick up some plumbers putty, but, otherwise, everything was in the box. It's very quiet and there's no vibration. It's pretty small. About an inch smaller than my 10 year old 1/2 HP. Anyone who wants to save money on having one professionally installed should get this slightly more expensive unit.
