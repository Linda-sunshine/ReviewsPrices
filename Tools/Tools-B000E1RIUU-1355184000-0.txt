review/summary: finally a better mouse trapreview/text: I like the size of the trap. I gave it a good rating because it works very well. The best feature is that you don't have to touch the mouse. You just open the box and shake it out. The flashing light tells you when there is something in it so you don't have to open it to inspect it until you are sure there is a catch. I recommend it to anyone.
