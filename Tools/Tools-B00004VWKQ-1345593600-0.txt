review/summary: Very Goodreview/text: Worked very well on my folding knives as well as most kitchen knives.Very easy to use!I have nothing to compare this with,it's my first one.That's why 4 stars insted of 5.I'm going to get a piece of leather and make a strope,was told it will put a razor finish on knives!!!I would reccommend this sharpener to anyone that dosen't want to mess with a stone & oil!!
