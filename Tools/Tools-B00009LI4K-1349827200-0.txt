review/summary: Almost Perfectreview/text: I bought two pairs of these for my wife and I to go shooting. They fit my wife perfectly and me almost perfectly. The reason I knocked a star off is because they are not adjustable. I have a slightly bigger head than most people and although these fit it's a slightly uncomfortable fit. If I could adjust them just a little bit it would be perfect. They work very well for canceling out noise.
