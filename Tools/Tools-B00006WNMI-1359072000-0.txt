review/summary: My tap water scores lower on TDS than this thingreview/text: I bought this in hopes of getting cleaner drinking water. I have a water filter that i have had for 15 years i bought a water tester that test TDS or total dissolved solids suffice to say you want your water to score from 0-50 to be the best. My tap water is 230 and after testing my filtered water from my old filter it was at 229(water tastes fine but i would imagine the filter is no good anymore)So i purchased the culligan filter, it installs in about a minute and after running the water for about 10 minutes i tested the water expecting some great results and low and behold it was the exact opposite this water filter is putting out water at 280, you get better water out of public water fountains.Whats even worse is Amazon has raised the price on these twice in the last week.sure it goes on easy , and the water looks clear and may not taste funny, that still doesn't mean its clean or ideal drinking water. My 15 yr old filter that i never replaced the inside filter is proof of that. I decided to test some of the bottled waters out there Brita is not much better scoring 190.Fiji=121sparklett=12niagra=4kroger brand=5nestle's=50crystal geysers=79arrowhead 100%mountain spring water=229 (its tap water)Why would anyone want to pay money to get more poluted water than their tap puts out. This item gets a 10/10 for ease of use and gets a 0/10 for doing what its supposed to do-provide clean drinking water
