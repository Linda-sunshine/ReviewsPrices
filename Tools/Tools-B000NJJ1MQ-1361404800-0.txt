review/summary: Just Keep Dryreview/text: Bought two for front and back doorBoth installed with no problemsthe only cons are My back door when open will expose the backside to the elements and the design of my roof drips water directly on the rear housing causing the unit to get wet and not function at all but after a few days of drying and had the battery removed after getting wet the unit is working fine again will fix by adding a small gutter above door and silicone the backside just in case we get heavy rains and will silicone the front door as well.
