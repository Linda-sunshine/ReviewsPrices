review/summary: Excellent Fermentation Chamber Controllerreview/text: I purchased the Lux Win100 several months ago. I purchased a used refrigerator off CL and mounted the Lux Win100 in the door. I have an extension cord running from the wall, through a hole in the door insulation, and into the Win100. I then have the plug for the refrigerator running in through another hole and plugging into the Win100. Works like a champ and for $40 cheaper then a Johnson controller! Will keep two 5 gallon glass carboys within 1-2 degrees of ideal temp.
