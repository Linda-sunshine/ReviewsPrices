review/summary: Tough little critters but not to bright.review/text: This thing worked better than I could have hoped for. I had a stray cat that I thought I could just move into my basmt apt no prob. WRONG little guy was lousy with fleas and, he did not like to be touched because of it so I wasn't able to bathe him. I eventually had to trick him into a carrier and take him to the aspca near me, but the fleas refused to go. Months after I no longer had the cat I was dealing with an increasing flea problem. I tried foggers and sprays but the flea is a tough little critter. Bought 2 of these units and after the 1st week the difference was very noticeable. Maybe 3 weeks in and I had finally prevailed this is the right tool for the job of getting rid of your flea infestation. Depending on how bad your situation maybe I recommend getting extra sticky pads. Mine filled up pretty quickly.
