review/summary: Just wha i neededreview/text: I had a lightning strike near my house and enough static got into my wiring that several wired network switches and wired portion of router got fried. This product not only manages a lot of power adaptors with a great layout, but it has surge protection for phone, network, and cable all built in. Only downer is that the network connection is not CAT6 like the rest of my network. But now my network wires are protected as well.
