review/summary: Worked great for iPhone 4 repair.review/text: I have broken my iPhone glass twice. This first replacement kit I used the screwdrivers in the kit... I stripped the second internal screw I removed and then the screwdriver itself stripped. Luckily a neighbor had a real screwdriver I could borrow to finish the repair.If you are repairing your iPhone, do not rely on the the ones sent with the replacement kit. This screwdriver set worked for all the internal and external screws on the iPhone. I did not strip any screws, it's magnetized which is very helpful, and I didn't have any issues with the quality of the handle or tips.
