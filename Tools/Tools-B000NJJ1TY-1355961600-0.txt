review/summary: Schlage Camelot Keypad Door Lock is a Great Sturdy lockreview/text: I really like this lock a lot! It was easy to install and wonderful to use. No more fumbling at the door looking for a key to get in. It opens easily with a bump with my elbow when I have packages in my hands. I can shut my door when I go to the laundry room without worring that I may forget my key to get back in. It is very sturdy.The only bad feature is that I will need to remove the inside door handle to change the battery. They should have made a access door for changing the battery.
