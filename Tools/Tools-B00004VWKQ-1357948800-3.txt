review/summary: Great price for an above average knife sharpenerreview/text: This knife works great on non-serrated blades. FYI you can't use it on scissors. But I sharpened all our knives and afterwards, I could cut a sheet of paper with them. Before sharpening, they were dull, and would squish fruits & vegetables instead of cutting (e.g. slicing tomatoes was a nightmare). Now, however, I can cut things in the kitchen any way I want & I didn't have to replace any knives. Also sharpened my parents' knives. I know some reviewers complained about the life expectancy on this things, but it pays for itself after sharpening only a few blades. It's not made to last forever, but I've already sharpened maybe 25-30 knives already and got impressive results. Even my mom was impressed, and she has been guilty of keeping dull knives my entire life. I never knew why she sharpened her knives so rarely (maybe it's for safety reasons, I just don't know). I'll tell you what, though, she better be careful with her knives now, cause they're so sharp that I was able to cut through my dear sister's bulls***, I cut through the time/space continuum, & I was also able to peel sweet peas (not the pods, but the peas themselves, yup). 4/5
