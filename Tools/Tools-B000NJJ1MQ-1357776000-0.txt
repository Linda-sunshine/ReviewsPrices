review/summary: worksreview/text: Metal construction inside and outside of door. Easy to install. Easy to program. Never used the key and don't really know how you would use it without the code, since the bolt won't engage without it. Hardly needed the instructions, though I did follow them. A bit expensive but soooo worth not needing to take the keys out of my pocket! Now vehicle and house entry can be done with keys in pocket and I don't need keys to go for a walk with the fam.
