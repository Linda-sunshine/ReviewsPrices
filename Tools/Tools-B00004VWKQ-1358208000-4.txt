review/summary: Only home knife sharpener that works for mereview/text: I'll admit that I haven't invested in really expensive knife sharpeners or time in learning how to use a real sharpener, but for under $20, this one is great and pretty idiot-proof. If you just want to keep your cheap knives sharp, this one should do it.
