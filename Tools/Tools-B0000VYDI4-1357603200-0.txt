review/summary: Versatile, sturdy, easy to use ladderreview/text: I used this ladder to paint the rooms with cathedral ceilings and over a stairway in my house. It was easy to carry around, adjust and use in a variety of positions. I loved it so much that I ordered one for my daughter and her boyfriend when they bought a house. It is the ultimate house warming gift.
