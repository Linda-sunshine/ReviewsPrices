review/summary: Quietreview/text: this is a great product for first time buyers, like myself. I got these after i found out that i couldnt concentrate, in my schools library. students have slowly turned the library into a chat room. once i got my earmuffs, through amazons free shipping. i took them to school the very next day. this product worked wonders. i sat down put them on (with a noisy room) and began my work. All i could here where faint whispers. about half an hour later i took them off. every one in the library was quiet and looking at me. then the ones who knew me waved and said hello. i smiled back and continued my work in now a quiet library. My point is, it is kind way of saying shut up.
