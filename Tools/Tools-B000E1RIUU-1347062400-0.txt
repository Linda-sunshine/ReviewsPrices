review/summary: Amazed!review/text: My mice problem started with mice droppings scattered throughout my house and scratching heard up in my attic late at night. I started off buying the Dcon mouse traps with minimal success. I caught two mice over a weeks time using the product as directed even changing the bait. I went back on Amazon in hopes of finding a better resolution then I stumbled upon the Victor Electronic Mouse Trap. Almost instantly after setting up the trap, I caught a mouse. Over the course of three days the trap caught a total of 15 mice! Gross. Since then, I have not seen any new mice droppings. I had real great success with the traps baiting them with dog food. Good luck.
