review/summary: Great Product!!!review/text: I think this is a really great product and well worth the $$! I ended up getting fleas in my home a few weeks ago. Never had them before and was so grossed out! I tried some flea spray that I bought in the supermarket with no help at all. I had a man spray a few days later and then these came in the mail. I was a little skeptical at first having read some mixed reviews. I bought 2 of them and put set them up. The next morning I had already trapped a few fleas in them and continue to trap them! The light is a big on the bright side if that bothers you for sleeping. They actually make really nice light if you need to get up in the middle of the night. I'm very pleased with the results I've gotten and if the bulb does burn out it is an easy replacement from the hardware store or supermarket. I've also trapped a few spiders in them as well! Very easy to set up as well! Hope they help you if you have a flea problem in your home. Just don't touch the pad..they are super sticky!!
