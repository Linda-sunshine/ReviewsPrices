review/summary: Pleasantly surprisedreview/text: This is a nice set. I'm not an expert or a tool junkie, so for more sophisticated users, I'm sure this would not suffice, but for a not-very-handy DIY'er like myself, it's more than good enough. I bought this because I needed the T7 to swap hard drives out of a MacBook, and for $12 I wasn't expecting much. It's much sturdier then I anticipated and will be perfect for the type of light-duty use I'll give it. It has enough variety of bits that it should more than cover the typical uses I'll have. The handle is much more solid feeling than I expected, so that's a bonus. Feels nice in your hand and the magnetic bits are nice. Definitely a good value for me.
