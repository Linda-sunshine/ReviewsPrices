review/summary: Better, cheaper, and easier to install than regular bug screensreview/text: My dogs got used to it in no time and I was able to leave the door open for them to go in and out. I was sitting inside enjoying the breeze without any bugs!Make sure you have it exactly where you want it before you remove the adhesive stickers and stick them to the door frame.
