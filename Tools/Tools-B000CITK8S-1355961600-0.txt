review/summary: This is what you want for a Motorcycle, ATV, Jetski, etc.review/text: I was tired of other chargers that were cheap and did not actually float as advertised. I decided to spend the money on the original and best out there. I was pleased to see that the JR was less than most of the other el-cheapo options. For maintaining my motorcycle over the winter, it is perfect. Permanently mounted the plug to the frame, and now I just plug in and throw on the cover. Love it.
