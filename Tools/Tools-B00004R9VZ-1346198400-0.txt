review/summary: Awesome bug zapper!review/text: We have less than a quarter of an acre in town, but are in a small town, so all the farming around us brings tons of bugs. We had a cheap Walmart one before that worked ok before it died after a year. This one keeps almost all of the annoying bugs gone. I'm sure our neighbors like not having so many bugs. You can hear it zapping big bugs. We clipped out every other line in the grid so the bigger bugs could get through. We have had it for over a year and it's still going strong. If anything happens for some reason, I will come back to update. Make sure you keep it away from the house, though. Definitely recommend!
