review/summary: perfect for what i bought it forreview/text: I needed a thermostat to control a small 350-700 watts personal heater to heat a large doghouse i built for my 2 Doberman Pinschers and this works great. I programmed the heat for the whole week nice and warm during evenings and early mornings and set it low between 10am to 5pm as the sunshine warms the doghouse during the day. You can program different temperatures throughout the day and 7 days a week. My dogs are spoiled when they feel a little chilly they run into their doghouse. They love it and I like it because they sleep in their outdoor doghouse now so I don't have to wake up at 3am to let them out to use the bathroom. When my wife and i go out to a dinner and a movie and it's 40 degrees outside we don't have to rush home to take care of the dogs, they're very warm. Their doghouse is also double walled and insulated.
