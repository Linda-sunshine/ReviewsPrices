review/summary: Great little unit for maintaining batteriesreview/text: I got this for my motorcycle, ATV and boat to maintain the batteries in the off seasons. It is totally automatic so you can leave it connected for days. Be sure to get the extra harnesses to put on each vehicle that has a hard to reach battery for easy plug and charge connection.
