review/summary: Battery Tender 021-0123 Battery Tender Junior 12V Battery Chargerreview/text: I bought two of these battery chargers at the suggestion of my sons, both of whom are motorcyle buffs and keep their motorcyle batteries charged on these chargers during the off-season. They recommended this particular brand very highly and said I couldn't get a better one for what I wanted it for. I bought one for my ATV battery and one for my John Deere riding lawnmower battery so I'll know in the spring when they come out of storage as to how well the charger actually worked for me. I'm giving it a 5-star rating because I respect and trust my sons' recommendations! ;)
