review/summary: Lasted 4 Yearsreview/text: I am very disappointed with this product. I bought my home 4 years ago, with a new Badger 5 installed. I live alone, don't cook every day, and don't abuse the disposal. For a piece of equipment that was treated gently, this product is junk. I have spent the last two weeks dealing with leaking in my basement, a clogged up kitchen sink and troubleshooting how to fix the problem. I will research better products and replace my broken Badger 5.
