review/summary: Excellentreview/text: This screen is excellent and exactly as described. Works perfectly and installed in less than 5 minutes. The velcro is strong enough to hold with zero problems. We live in a very windy area of Arizona and when we have the full breeze blowing through the bottom stays open a bit but will be easily fixed by adding 2 more magnets. The screen material is extremely sturdy compared to the 'as-seen-on-tv' version. Already recommended to friends. My 2 German Shephards absolutely love it.
