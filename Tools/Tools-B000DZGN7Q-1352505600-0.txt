review/summary: very powerful, easy to installreview/text: Make sure your piping is able to handle the pressure output this unit can put on a drain! In a condo situation, my unit was able to power waste out faster than the &#34;swallow rate&#34; of pipes below.... otherwise know as a plug. Had the pipes cleared and checked - it really is just an overall drain problem at my location.Works great as long as everyone remembers to feed it slowly & with a lot of water.This should not be a problem in most locations.
