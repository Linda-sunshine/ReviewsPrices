review/summary: Excellent power strip/surge protector.review/text: I don't use the phone/Ethernet connections on this strip, just the outlets. But it is very well designed. The outlets are well placed, so even with boxy power cord plugs, most of the outlets are usable at one time. Highly recommended.
