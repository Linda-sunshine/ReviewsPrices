review/summary: Great Little Thermostatreview/text: I used this Thermostat with the Optimus H-9010 Garage/Shop Ceiling or Wall Mount Utility Heater. Worked pretty seamlessly. I wish the display screen was backlit, difficult to read in low light or in angles other than straight on. The thermometer is stiff and will not stay in exact position. Other than that, does as advertised. Served my purpose well! Will probably buy more in future.
