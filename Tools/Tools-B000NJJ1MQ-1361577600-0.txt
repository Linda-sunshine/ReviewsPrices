review/summary: Outstanding piece of hardwarereview/text: I can honestly say the ease of using this Schlage keypad deadbolt beats the pants off of Quikset or other cheaper competitors. This is probably one of the cheapest but best investments I have made--a lot of the neighbors have asked me about it and I have told them how much better this one is than the previous one we used on the garage entry-door. Unlike the Quikset, the construction is solid, I don't feel like the keys are getting ready to fall off or wear off. Installation was a breeze but I noticd in putting it in that the inner components are not made of cheap plastic or alloys - this thing is clearly built to last. Another very positive aspect of the operation itself is that there isn't a motorized deadbolt action that wears out or fails over time. You enter the code, this engages the handle allowing you to unlock the door yourself by turning the handle. God forbid the battery wore out on the Quikset and the lock failed to engage.Great Features:- Lighted display button at the top is nice in the evening when the porch light is not on.- Non-motorized means fewer components to wear out and fail over the life of this product- The Satin finish has held up flawlessly this winter. Have not had to replace the battery yet so I am impressed so far with the efficiency of this device.Drawbacks:- My only concern with this lock is that the key codes are 4 digits long. I would've preferred a 5 or 6 digit combination for greater security but I'm not that concerned about it. The deterrence factor with the current 4-digit setup is sufficient.If you're looking for a keypad deadbolt to alleviate having to replace your keys everytime one of yours is lost or somebody moves out, this one may be a little more expensive than some of the competitors, but it is my experience that it is a much better design and quality thus justifying the investment.As other reviews have amply noted,
