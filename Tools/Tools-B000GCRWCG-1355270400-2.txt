review/summary: There Thinreview/text: I won't know if they work yet until we have a disaster. But from the way they look. It's like thin aluminum foil XD. I've seen people in these when they were affected by disasters. So I thought this was a good idea to get one. Just following the disaster trend I guess. I'm still packing my thermal though, as I suggest everyone do. Just in case they don't work out.
