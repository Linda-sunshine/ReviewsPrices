review/summary: programable thermostatreview/text: Although a little expensive, it was worth the money. Fairly easy to program and set up. Just remember to turn the power switch on the side on. That feature I don't think is needed, because you already have a heat/cool switch.The only negative is the screen is a little small and the thermostat wire could be longer. But it works well and I will buy more again if needed.
