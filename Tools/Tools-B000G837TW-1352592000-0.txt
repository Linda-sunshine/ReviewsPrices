review/summary: Very good productreview/text: This is the first time I am replacing a garbage disposer.First, the install instructions were very clear. I had no difficulty understanding or following it. The product does NOT include a power cord. The description does not state anything on it though. I used the power cord from my old garbage disposer. You might want to do your homework on other accessories that will need to complete the installation. It would be helpful if the product description included what's in the box. Give about 30 minutes for installation.Second, the product is a very good quality one. It's now couple of weeks since I bought and installed it. It's way quieter than the old one (badger) that I replaced. I am very happy with the product performance.
