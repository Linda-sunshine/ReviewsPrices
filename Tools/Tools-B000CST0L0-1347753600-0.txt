review/summary: Great Remote for Craftman Garage Door Openerreview/text: For the Craftman garage door opener with rolling codes and 315 MHZ, this is a great replacement remote. Sears does not provide a clear instruction on its web-site, so it took me a little research before finding this product. It is compatible to my 3/4 HP chain driven garage door opener in a fraction of the cost. To help ya'll guys out, the learning code button on the opener should be purple to buy this one.
