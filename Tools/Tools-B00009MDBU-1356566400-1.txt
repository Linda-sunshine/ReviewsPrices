review/summary: Love It!review/text: Very very informative. The day I got it I was plugged it into everything in the house and calculated average monthly usage and cost. By knowing what I was spending I was able to cut back with the more wasteful appliances and drop my bill by about 40$ which is awesome!Also spent about 30$ bucks on some low-flow faucet aerators and a low flow shower-head and managed to cut my water usage to 1/3 saving another 20-30$. : ) Couldn't be happier!
