review/summary: Fantastic outlet. Worth every penny. 1improvement to makereview/text: I use this to turn an electric heater on in my bedroom at 8 pm during New England winter.. Gets the room up to temp and then maintains til I go sleep.!!PlusesProgrammable. 1 setting for weekdays and 1 setting for weekend.You have multiple sessions.. Ie morning, mid day and evening all controlled time wise by you inc temperature.Only negative I have is that it's slight ugly to look at. Functional looking.Otherwise does a great job and have not found anything like it!
