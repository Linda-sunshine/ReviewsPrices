review/summary: Used on five knives that see heavy usage.review/text: My knife using profile consists of heavy fruit and vegetable cutting and a fare amount of meat chopping and slicing. So far I have used this on three general kitchen knives, a chopping knife and a smaller slicing knife. All of the knives now have a nice edge with exception of the larger chopping knife. The blade is too thick for this sharpener. I read some reviews about how this sharpener stopped working after ten sharpening so if you read this review a month or so after 10/01/12, comment on it requesting an update and I will let you know how it's edge and ability to sharpen is holding up. For now, and considering the price, I recommend this for the kitchen. I would like to note that this is the first time I have used a hand held sharpener as opposed to a stone. This is far quicker.[...]
