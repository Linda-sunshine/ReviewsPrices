review/summary: Works okreview/text: I bought this hoping to leave it in place on my back door. It is easy to install and works ok (You do have to fiddle with the opening after you go through it to get the magnets to snap together. Also the open is very tight. The top of the screen doesn't open so you feel like you are squeezing through it everytime you use it. I am 6'2&#34; and about 225 lbs. I wouldn't recommend it for a door that gets used a lot. But it will keep the bugs out if you open the door.
