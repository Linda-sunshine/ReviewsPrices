review/summary: cheap but they workreview/text: These space blankets have been reviewed a ton of times so I won't restate what everyone else has said. They are pretty thin and can shred if you are not careful, but they are so inexpensive you can get 10 for the price of one name brand blanket. I you want quality I suggest the Adventure Medical Kits SOL 2 person survival blanket.Adventure Medical Kits Sol Survival Blanket, Two Person, 3.2-Ounce (pack Of 2)
