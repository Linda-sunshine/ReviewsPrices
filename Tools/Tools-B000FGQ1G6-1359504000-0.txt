review/summary: Excellent small-bit set for the pricereview/text: I've owned this screwdriver set for ~2.5 years now. There are magnetic bits small enough for eyeglass repair and just large enough for general repair work of electronics. The magnetic strength is good. The soft (silicone?) grip is easy on my hands. I especially like that the end of the screwdriver has a bearing; This allows the end to fit into the ball of your hand to provide downforce while you twist the driver to tighten/loosen a screw.
