review/summary: Cheap, quick, easy to store, replaceable parts and loads of positive feedback?review/text: This knife sharpener is not designed for Asian knifes such as Global, Shun, Mac, Hattori, Kyocera, Chroma, Kasumi, Bunmei, Suisin, Misono.... Japanese manufacturers will sharpen their knives to roughly 17 degrees. Most western knives are roughly 20 degrees. Therefore, except for my Japanese "Global" knife, which I sharpen on the MicroSharp plus 3, I sharpen all my kitchen knifes using this el cheepo knife sharpener. I have a Tormek Sharpener system too, which gives me pro-grade edges, but unlike the AccuSharp, the Tormek set-up takes more time. For the quickest sharpening (I didn't say the best), I still grab a simple sharpening rod.Sharpeness test:I slid each knife about 10 -20 times back and forth.Yes, I was able to cut an apple in two with a small potato knife, at the very first trial. Yeehaw!No, it didn't pass the butter slicing Steven Seagal Samurai sword test. I just could not slice that satin scarf in two.... in mid-air!I'm puzzled...Was I not swinging and slicing fast enough?Was the stormy wind through the open window at fault?Was I out of shape? I did get windy after 15 minutes...Isn't this sharpener supposed to change a $2 potato knife into a butter slicing heirloom Samurai sword?I'm sad. ;-(Verdict:Buy it, and just skip the butter slicing test. :-)
