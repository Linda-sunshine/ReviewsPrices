review/summary: 9 out of 10 mosquitoes still prefer the taste of human fleshreview/text: Hi, I'm a mosquito and I live in a shaded area of central Alabama. For many days I have terrorized the neighbors...well, technically my wife does the terrorizing...but I still like to hang out and enjoy the carnage. My family has been in this area for many generations, so you can imagine my surprise when one of the local humans purchased a great big nightlight for his backyard. Boy, that thing sure was bright.Thankfully, I'm one of the smarter insects (hey, even if most of us are dumb, we still make up 98% of all animal life on this planet!). I sat back for a couple weeks and watched all of my moth and gnat friends hover around this light, only to be zapped into oblivion by some metallic grill that surrounds the light itself. I guess they're not too bright! Bright. Get it?A few days later the primary male human attached some nice-smelling device to the bottom, but I wasn't going to be fooled. My gnat buddies all flocked to it, but I knew better. My family and I stood back and waited until just the right time to strike the humans, especially the little one who loved to play in the dirt. We bit him up nicely. Some of the time, he wasn't even covered in that harsh body spray, so that was the right time to strike.We knew to ignore the light, and it was a good decision. And I just learned that the human tried to return the product to Amazon...but they wouldn't allow it! Apparently it's considered a hazardous material. I guess the store named "Amazon" is in cahoots with my friends who live in the eponymous river region. Or at least I'd like to think so.
