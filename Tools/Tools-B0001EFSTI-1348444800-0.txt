review/summary: Great tool to never be withoutreview/text: This tool is so unobtrusive that it is actually smaller than my standard car key. The genius part of the design (although apparently frustrating for some) is that it quickly disconnects from your keychain. Although that is a bit inconvenient for a bottle opener, it is essential for effectively using a knife or screwdriver. This is clearly not the tool for major repairs, but I find myself quickly fixing things that I would otherwise put off for weeks, simply because I always have the tool in my pocket. The Phillips screwdriver is superb and straight screwdriver works quite well. The eyeglasses screwdriver is too thick for my glasses, so I might grind it down. The knife is remarkably sharp (dangerously so) and with the serrated edge it will cut through nearly anything. I have used it for everything from opening packages and cutting twine to slicing limes for my gin and tonic.It is not obvious from the pictures, but the knife edge cleverly conceals itself into a ridge in the Phillips screwdriver. This very effectively prevents it from slicing through your pocket and lacerating your thigh. This is a very well designed, tiny yet functional tool.I also highly recommend thePhoton Freedom Keychain Light
