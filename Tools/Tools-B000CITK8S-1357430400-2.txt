review/summary: Battery Tender 021-0123 Junior 12V Battery Charger for Motorcycle Batteryreview/text: I bought this to keep a wet cell battery charged during he off season. I began charring the battery in the fall and took a week to charge the battery. I wanted to drive a couple more times and wet to start the bike and didn't turn over and was pretty disappointing. The battery can be bad but it was new about 4-months earlier. I recharge the battery on the bench and noticed the acid level was low, After recharging, the battery was also warm.This item is well rated. I like the long cable set, the LED indication and the included clips. I do think my battery was the problem however I am going to try it again next year with a new battery and see how it goes. I think it is worth the price and useful for many 12VDC batteries including tractors and camper batteries.
