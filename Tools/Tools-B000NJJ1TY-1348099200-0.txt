review/summary: Great product. Easy installationreview/text: This doorlock has solved a big problem for me and my wife. Instructions were clear, installation painless. It's been in for a few weeks now, and it's working perfectly. I don't know how long the battery will last, but time will tell. To change the battery, it's necessary to disassemble the lock, which is not too hard. The battery is a 9V type. I also plan to re-key the mechanical lock within so it matches the other locks in my home, but I have not done that yet. I recommend this product to others. It's well-made, very solid, and seems foolproof.
