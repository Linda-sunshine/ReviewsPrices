review/summary: Awesome tool!review/text: If you have an itch that you just need to scratch, this is the tool for it. Perfectly weighted to give maximum force at the striking point. Once you start swinging it, there is no stopping it until it connects. The handle is nearly unbreakable and the blade is extremely sharp. Something I found out in an OOPS moment. This is not a toy, and should be handled with the respect you would give any weapon.
