review/summary: What kind of reviews are these???review/text: I wanted an axe that I could not only throw but could also chop trees and trim shooting lanes when I need to. I was to be using it at the deer lease mostly. I chose this one due to its good reviews but honestly the ppl who reviewed it have no idea what their talking about. The cheap metal blade comes sharp and the shipping is extremely fast but the blade bends and breaks with normal wear and tear. It's cheap metal. As far a throwing it is concerned... Don't even bother. I broke 2 of them in less than an hour. The handles are cheaply made and break easily. I've had plastic forks that were more durable. The best use is to mount it over the fire place and hope that all the weight from the dust doesn't break it.
