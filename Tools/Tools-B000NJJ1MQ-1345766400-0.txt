review/summary: great idea, great productreview/text: I bought this as a gold deal and am really glad I did. We put this on our back door, which is the door we most use to enter and exit our house. Now my teenagers and adult children can exit and lock the door without having to bring or use a key. No problems installing. Went right in. My husband was worried it might not fit, but it is made for the basic layout of doors/deadbolts. Install took less than an hour. Programing was easy. Highly recommend.
