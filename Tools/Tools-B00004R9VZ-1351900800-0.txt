review/summary: It works and worth the money.review/text: I have had the Flowtron BK-80 for about 3 months now. We own a half acre lot with another half next door. We were having a terrible mosquito problem here in the Dallas area this year and had personal experience with the West Nile virus. This zapper has really reduced the mosquitos on our property. After having it on for a month I turned it off during my mowing and didn't turn it back on. My wife started complaining that the mosquitos were coming back after being off for a week. Plugged it back in and the mosquito population went back down. It does not completely elimate all of the mosiquitos but drastically reduces the population. It is bearable now in the back yard where it wasn't before without spraying during the day and at night you would be drained of all your blood in a matter of minutes.It appears to be made fairly well. You have to clean it about every 2 weeks but it's not that hard to clean using a air compressor to blow the dead bugs out. Most of the bugs falls through the wire but some of the bigger ones get hung up. It's not totally maintenance free but isn't that hard to clean.I would recommend this unit.
