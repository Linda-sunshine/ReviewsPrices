review/summary: Powerfulreview/text: I LOVE my disposal. It is super strong, I have no fears or worries when turning it on because It works like a quality made product. I went through 2 disposals from a name brand (Insinkerator) company that is heavily advertised and neither lasted over 6 months. I would recomend this brand to anyone interested.As far as noise, It's pretty quiet considering the power it has. Did I mention I love my disposal?
