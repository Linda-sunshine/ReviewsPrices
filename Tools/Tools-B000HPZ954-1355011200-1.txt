review/summary: The plug has a short in itreview/text: If I barely touch or slide the surge protector across the floor I lose a connection and all of my appliances go dark. It makes a hissing sound and if you jigglet he power cord party, it usually continues to give power to the applicances. Hope it doesn't fry my computers. Now i just hardly vacuum or put my feet near the device.
