review/summary: Flowtron insect killerreview/text: I store firewood in the basement during the winter. (Wood has been my sole source of heat since the 70's.) I purchased this device to kill flying insects from the wood. It has been ideal for this application. (Small area, low power consumption.) Since using this, there have been no bugs in the house even with the basement door open to let the heat upstairs.This has been on continuously since receiving it in early December. Thus far, the lamp has not burned out. Perhaps I should purchase a spare just in case.
