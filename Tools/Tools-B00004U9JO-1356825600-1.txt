review/summary: Badger 5 food waste desposerreview/text: Got the Badger 5 Friday and installed it Sat. morning. It was a replacement for the 12 year old Badger 1 that still worked but had some funny metallic noises emitting from it so decided to retire it. The Badger 5 was installed in about an hour using the existing hardware and plug in wiring. It works great but is a slight bit louder than the older one was. Not a problem though, it's only on for a short time during dish washing time. Anyway, so far so good and the wife is happy, we all know that's what counts.
