review/summary: Miraculous, almostreview/text: It does what it says it does; I have a weak scooter battery and this keeps it going day to day, but here's the amazing part; I had a cut milk jug that I had drained my oil into. It was sitting in our breezeway. Somehow, the plug from this ended up in the oil WHILE it was still plugged in. It sat there for probably 1.5 to 2 days. All it did was blink red (basically indicated that it was trying to charge the oil but couldn't quite get there). That made me a believer.
