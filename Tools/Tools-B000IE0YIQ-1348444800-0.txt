review/summary: Forget it, don't bother.review/text: This thing couldn't blow the fuzz off a dandelion.The description says it can be used for camping mattresses, but in the time it takes to blow one up, you could weave an entire hammock.Buy it for blowing up bike tires if you can't operate a bike pump. Otherwise, a waste of $50.
