review/summary: Great locks!review/text: I have two of these locks, this one and the dead bolt one on two separate doors. This lock is on the door from the garage into the house, and get used daily. I have had it for 6 months, and have not had a issue with the battery... I did not get mine from Amazon, but either way they are a great purchase.Easy to install with just a screw driver and about 20 minutes.
