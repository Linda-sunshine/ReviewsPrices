review/summary: Simple and Easy Install.review/text: I bought this as a direct replacement to the installed unit that was begining to leak. The only part I was worried about was changing the sink portion as it involved using plumbers putty but in the end that was a breeze.The whole process took about 30 minutes with additional time checking for leaks. Beware as if your under sink space is cramped you will need strong and sturdy biceps to hold and mount the unit.
