review/summary: Great way to kill a good knife.review/text: Seemed too good to be true. It was. There is no easy way to control this thing. It removed and scored the sides of two very nice knives. If your objective is to put a relatively dull/sharp edge on a very abused knife, then you've found the right tool.
