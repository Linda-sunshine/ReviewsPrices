review/summary: Excellent for Home and Office use.review/text: I bought this power splitter as a replacement for the two smaller ones I already had. Product arrived on time, and had way more features that necessary. Easy use with long power cord; also comes with at 100,000$ warranty; so if the product breaks and the equipment plugged into it fails, Belkin pays for it. Only one thing; when agaisnt a wall, the transformer plugs become useless (for transformers).
