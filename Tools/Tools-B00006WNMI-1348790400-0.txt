review/summary: Better tasting waterreview/text: The water here smells awful and tastes terrible. This filter takes care of that. Now the tap water tastes just like bottled water. After several months, it is still working fine, although the shut-off valve sticks a bit. It works much better than the last two PUR filters I had, which started leaking after a couple of months.
