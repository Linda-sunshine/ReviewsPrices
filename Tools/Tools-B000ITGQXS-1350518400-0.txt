review/summary: Perfect for my Usereview/text: Received the Fulcrum LED Task light before the estimated delivery date. It arrived in perfect condition. After inserting batteries I found it to throw a nice wide bright pool of light and the flex neck allows me to direct the light exactly where I want it. The clip holds securely to the edge of my Puja table.I am a meditation practitioner and do my practice in a window dormer alcove and at night the room light is behind me and casts my shadow over my Puja text. This is the perfect solution for me.Though I don't clip it to a book I think it would be light enough for that. Overall I am perfectly satisfied with this product and recommend it highly.
