review/summary: Would buy it againreview/text: I like this surge protector over others I have had in the past as it lays flat, so it does not have a tendency to turn over.Additionally, the plugs are located sufficiently far enough apart so that it is easier to identify which plug is which.The product is of a very good constructed quality . I don't give 5's but it is very close .
