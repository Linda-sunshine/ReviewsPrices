review/summary: Works great and easy to install!!review/text: I had my previous InSinkErator Badger 5 for 8 years and it finally quit working. I read the reviews from other purchasers but my experience has been nothing but good. The disposal was easy to install because I had already put in the sink collar with my previous purchase. I took out the old one and had the new one installed in a 1/2 hour. It's relatively quiet and does its job well. I would not hesitate to buy this brand and model again.
