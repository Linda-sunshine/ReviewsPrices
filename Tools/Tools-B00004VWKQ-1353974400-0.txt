review/summary: Cheap, does the job wellreview/text: I have been using this sharpener for over a year on my home kitchen set and hunting knives, and it has been WELL worth the money vs the old sharpening stone I moved up from. The reason it has been so worth the money is the amount of time I save using this sharpener vs a sharpening stone. A few quick strokes and the work is done. This item is absolutely imperative to own if you want to prevent injuries due to knives. Contrary to what you might be thinking, a sharp knife is actually safer than a dull knife, and this sharpener does the job well enough to keep me safe from myself.My biggest gripe is that the AccuSharp sharpener doesn't seem to be able to get the *razor* sharp edge I often desire for items such as my paring knife or my hunting knives. This sharpener gives the blades a nice, even edge, but the blade doesn't get so sharp that I'm scared I'll cut my finger off before I realize what's happening. A little fine-tuning with a steel or a stone will do the trick to get me that razor sharpness I sometimes desire, but for the vast majority of the time, I just use this tool on my knives every month or so and I have a collection full of sharp, wonderful knives.
