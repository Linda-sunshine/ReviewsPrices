review/summary: Worth every pennyreview/text: After trying the humane approach to catching and releasing, I was beginning to think that it was the same mouse that was coming inside. I set this trap, and ZAP! had my first mouse within 5 minutes. It was easy to set up, and easy to dispose of the dead critter inside. Best money I've spent on a mousetrap.
