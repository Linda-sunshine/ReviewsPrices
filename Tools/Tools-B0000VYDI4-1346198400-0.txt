review/summary: By trying to be good for everything, good for nothing.review/text: I really liked the idea of one ladder for all needs, but unfortunately this one is incredibly difficult to use:1) It is HEAVY, and the weight is at the ends (like a barbell).2) It is very hard to adjust, with 6 latches that must be in the right position for each movement (and legs that like to catch on the bar at the bottom).3) As a straight ladder, it is virtually unusable. There is a lot of weight out 26', and unlike a normal extension ladder you can't get it upright and then easily extend. And there is flex in the middle due to the joint which adds sway you don't get in an extension ladder. I'm sure it's safe, but it makes it harder to control and makes it feel less stable.4) As a step ladder, it's better but still quite difficult to maneuver, and quite tedious to change the height.Unless you are well above average strength or work on a lot of stairs (and need to adjust legs to different lengths), I'd suggest you forego the multi-purpose ladder and get 2-3 purpose specific ladders. I should have gotten a regular extension ladder and an orchard ladder.
