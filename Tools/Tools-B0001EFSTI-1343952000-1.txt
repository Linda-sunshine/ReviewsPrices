review/summary: not greatreview/text: I feel this item is not great. it is a pain to open (prying both sides with fingernails of each hand), the bottle openner is bad because you end up having to use the leverage of your fingers against the flippn blade to use it and the curve is too tight (i have to almost parallel the tool with the neck to hook the lid). its not really a worry but its the principal, the blade against finger that is. also i wish that i could open it and still leave it on my keys but you cant at all. whenever i need it to open a beer i have to pry with fingernails from either hand, catch my keys with my palms, use it without cutting myself, and spend 5 seconds putting it back on my keys where i want it to be. basically i bought it to open beers and cut things and it doesnt open beers well. the cutting side is great but what tool doesnt come with a sharp blade.
