review/summary: Strange designreview/text: The product will inflate things, but I can't imagine what someone was thinking when they designed this thing. It has a covered compartment which holds a short AC cord and the air hose, and a separate "cubby" area that holds the power switch and the car adapter cord. You have to pull out the car adapter cord to get to the power switch. The power switch is awkward to use -- you can't really see it in the cubby -- not sure what someone was thinking when they put the switch there. The pressure gauge disagrees with another pressure gauge I own by more than 10%, I suspect this one is wrong.
