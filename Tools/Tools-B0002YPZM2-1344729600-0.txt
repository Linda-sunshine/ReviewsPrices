review/summary: Excellent for the Low Cost!!review/text: Excellent work glove for the $10! I work in the HVAC field and go through a pair a gloves in a months time or less (wearing them daily, 40 hours a week). These gloves last that long for me without breaking the bank. Very dexterous as well. I will be buying these from now on. I Highly recommend them.
