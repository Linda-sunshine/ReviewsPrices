review/summary: Perfect to work on Macbook Proreview/text: I was looking for a versatile kit that will at a minimum help me swap out the HDD in my Mid-2012 13" Macbook Pro for a new SSD, along with upgrading the RAM that came out of the box. This kit had the bits to help me easily open out the case on my Macbook effortlessly and put them back the way they were.The PH00 and Torx T-6 were the ones I used for my short term needs but I can see myself using the other pieces for various other tasks with my gadgets for a long time.This set is a great buy and I would recommend this time and again to anyone who is looking for a sturdy set of precision screwdriver to use with PCs and Macs.
