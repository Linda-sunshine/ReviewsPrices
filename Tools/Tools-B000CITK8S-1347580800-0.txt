review/summary: Battery Tender Juniorreview/text: Very convenient and versatile. Works well on 4 wheeler, motorcycle and tractor which satisfies my needs. Does not work well with high output batteries such as my GM car. Might need to step up to the larger version of the Tender for that. I have let batteries go dead because it was too much trouble to access, but not any more if plugging into a power outlet that is wired directly to the battery (must order SAE cigarette adapter separately) or pigtail connector (supplied). Amazon provided quick delivery at a good price. I recommend this product.
