review/summary: Maglite 2D LEDreview/text: In a world full of great Chinese LED lights. It's always a great feeling to know that here in the U.S.A Maglite continues to produce a high quality product. Being the owner of several Fenix, Streamlight, coast and LED lenser products. I went ahead and purchased the new maglite 2D led with the cree LED light. I have one xenon bulb mini mag and a first gen led mini mag that I've had for years with no issues whatsoever.Granted you don't have strobe or anyway of dimming the light but that's really what I love about it. This light is a no nonsense 8 hour run time, built like a tank beater that you can just pick up and go! No modes to mess around with no weird expensive batteries to buy. All you get is a quality, no nonsense American made. Regulated, zombie head busting light that you can always count on. Nuff said.
