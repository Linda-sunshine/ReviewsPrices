review/summary: Good value and performance but difficult to change filters and unscrewreview/text: I like the filter itself and the price, and the water tasted much better than straight from the faucet. However, I always had a lot of trouble getting the old filter out. The last time, I decided to remove the entire device from the faucet, thinking I might buy a new one and have better luck with changing the filter. However, I could not get the thing unscrewed from the faucet. I bought a pipe wrench, then a strap wrench - no luck (but much sweating and cursing). I finally had to call a strong-armed dude who was able to remove it. I'm not chancing all this hassle again. If they improve it so that there is an easy-grip way to remove the thing from the faucet, and an easier way to change the filters, then I'll be back.
