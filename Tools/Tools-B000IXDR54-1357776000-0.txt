review/summary: Great flashlightreview/text: I just got this new maglite the other day after my old one stopped working after 14 years. The new LED is incredibly bright and is a nice white color instead of the golden yellow color we got from the old ones. Not only is it bright, but it shines for a very long ways. I live in an apartment if I step out on my balcony and shine it across the football field across the street I can actually see it very well on the other side. another thing I was very impressed with is the durability. These flashlights just take a beating and keep on going. I would highly recommend this flashlight to anyone looking for a (relatively) cheap flashlight that performs and can take a beating.
