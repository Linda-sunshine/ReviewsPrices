review/summary: Good kit, but fragile case!review/text: I am giving only 3 stars to draw your attention - OPEN MANUFACTURER'S PACKAGING CAREFULLY! The kit itself is very good, nice selection of screwdrivers to work with almost any kind of small screw. The only complaint is that the case is a little delicate. The packaging material was tightly molded around the item and required cutting it open extensively (not a "frustration free" package). When I I forced the case out of the manufacturer's package, I was disappointed to find that both plastic hinges of the case were shattered! I do not know if the case was already damaged, or it was damaged when being opened, but I have to return this item to Amazon for a refund (I am considering buying a new one).
