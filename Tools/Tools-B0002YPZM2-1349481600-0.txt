review/summary: Excellent Gloves.review/text: 125L Handyman Flex Glove Size Large external dimensions:*end of wrist to tip of middle finger: 7.75" (This dimension does NOT include theelastic wrist band. The entire glove length including wrist band is 9.5")*across the knuckles: 4.25" (padding on top of knuckles)*girth around the knuckles: 9.8"My hand dimensions:*wrist to end of middle finger: 7.5*across the knuckles: 3.8"*girth around the knuckles: 9.3"I was surpised that these gloves actually fit me since most stuff made in Pacific Rim countries seems to run a lot smaller than advertised. But not these gloves. They do 'feel' tight when you first put them on and it does make you think you've ordered the wrong size. Not so. They stretch just enough after a few minutes to fit like skin. They're comfortable and I eventually found myself not even aware I was wearing gloves. The padding is in all the right places and these are, by far, the most comfortable and articulate work gloves I've ever owned - even moreso than deer skin. I'll trty typing eith them for a bit: retrieving a Leatherman from mu beolt ois nopt a big deal, typing is a little awkeward but I don';t intend to tyup in the woods with my chainmsaws.,These gloves are not advertised as waterproof or insulated. They are completely synthetic: 50% 'synthetic' leather, 30% polyester, 10% elastic, 5% foam padding, 3% PU, 1% PVC, 1% rubber. So, I can pass along two things in my experience: 1) these gloves WILL immediately wick moisture away from wet surfaces (they'll take a while to dry out too), and 2) the ambient temperature needs to be north of 45 degrees for them to be comfortable while working, (wet at 50 degrees is not good).Some folks might find the Velcro wrist straps annoying - I don't much care for velcro on gloves (wrist watch).I found these gloves to be excellent work gloves in dry, warmer weather.
