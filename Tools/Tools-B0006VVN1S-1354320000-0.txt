review/summary: Softer skin and hair!review/text: This product is well worth the price! Ever since I installed it I've noticed the water smells a lot cleaner. My skin felt softer after just the first use! And my hair feels in better condition, it doesn't feel so dry and frizzy after the shower.Also the five different settings is a really nice feature. I love this shower head! And I recommend this to anyone who has skin and hair problems, or aches and pains!This shower head comes with a filter that lasts for about 6 months so be sure and grab an extra filter when it gets close to that time. It really makes a difference!
