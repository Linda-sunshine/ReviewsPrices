review/summary: An inexpensive, yet effective essential in my kitchen!review/text: After receiving some pretty nice knives as a wedding gift, I wanted to make sure to take care of them properly. After some research on the internet, I found this knife sharpener as one of the most highly recommended. I was a little skeptical about its quality at first because it seemed so inexpensive, but I figured I would put it on my Wish List. After having it for a couple years, I can safely say that it is a great knife sharpener -- and &#34;out sharpens&#34; the other, more expensive, knife sharpeners we have had go through our kitchen.This is actually the second AccuSharp Knife Sharpener I've gotten -- this one is actually a holiday gift for my mother!
