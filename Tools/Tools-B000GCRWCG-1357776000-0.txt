review/summary: Great dealreview/text: I needed two for each vehicle we have. We live at 8500ft and it snows here so one can get stuck. My dad had a mylar blanked when he was snowed in on a mountain pass many years ago and it probably saved his life. We had an old one and I could not find it as we put together our winter car kits so I got these. Honestly, I hope I never use them.
