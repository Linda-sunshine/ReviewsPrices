review/summary: Easy to install and good valuereview/text: Took only a minute to install and tests perfectly, without a hitch. I bought 6 of these, for my house and rental properties I own. This is superior to combined smoke/carbon monoxide detectors since carbon monoxide comes from the floor of the room, not the top.
