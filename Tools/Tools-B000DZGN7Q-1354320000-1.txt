review/summary: Easy install, quiet, powerful and worth every penny.review/text: After much research on quality, function and price comparison it was clear that the waste king L-8000 can't be touched. I do have to tell anyone who is concerned about your own ability to do it yourself, don't fret, the ez-mount installation was extremely easy, anyone in my opinion can put this in themselves. The hardest part of my install was taking the old badger 1 disposal(piece of junk) and the 3 bolt mount off, once they were off though, it took probably about 10 minutes to install the the waste king and the ez mount system. I personally wouldn't waste the money on the 3 bolt adapter kit, the ez mount was much nicer and easier to use, and everything lined up perfectly with no adjustments. I also recommend to check out amazons open box like new products, i got this disposal, open box, for a better price than ANYWHERE, including people bidding on ebay. When it arrived I couldn't see how it was considered an open box because it was factory sealed and in every way i could see brand new, but at a crazy low price. It is quiet, smooth(very little vibration) and POWERFUL.
