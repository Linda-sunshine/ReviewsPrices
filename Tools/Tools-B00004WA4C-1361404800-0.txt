review/summary: Kidde smoke & c/o talking alarmreview/text: The local volunteer Fire Department as a service to our Senior Community install smoke alarms & if you need one they will give it FREE!They came out & installed mine, tested it to hear the voice alarm & I am good to go!Great guys & keeping us older folks safe!!The best feature of this alarm is that a voice issues the alarm for either fire or carbon monoxide by yelling: Fire, fire, get out...........or.......Carbon Monoxide, get out! Much better than just analarm sound. Very impressive feature & you can rest assured you will NOT sleep through it!You made it so easy for me to purchase with a click of my mouse, then offered FREE shipping too!I appreciate that more than you can know.Thanx, Blondie
