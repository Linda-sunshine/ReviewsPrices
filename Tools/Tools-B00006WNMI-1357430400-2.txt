review/summary: Now my water doesn't taste like a poolreview/text: I got sick of tasting chlorine in all of my food that was cooked with water. This thing really easily mounts, and really stays out of the way. The mechanism that engages the filter is SOLID. It's a little metal bar you pull out which stays in place from water pressure.Have had it for 3-4 months probably - no leaks at all. I've had a few other types of faucet-mounted filters, and this one is superior.
