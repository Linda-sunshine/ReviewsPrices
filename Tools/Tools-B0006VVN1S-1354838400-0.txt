review/summary: Fantastic Upgrade-- water flow, water quality, installationreview/text: It took me a while to realize the my current shower head was terrible-- my hair was dry and barely rinsed due to hard water and poor water flow. This shower head is a fantastic upgrade.I wasn't sure if the water pressure could be increased by getting a new shower head, but now I know it sure can. It distributes water perfectly-- not too hard, not too soft-- and I now feel completely rinsed off every time I shower.The water that comes out of this shower head is much cleaner than my previous shower head too. My skin and hair are both softer since using it. I don't know if it's actually &#34;softening&#34; the water, but it is definitely decreasing the chlorine which is helpful.Lastly, it was super easy to install. The hardest part of the process was getting the old shower head off (who knows how long it had been there!). You just wrap the tape around the pipe, smooth, and screw on. It couldn't be simpler.I will say that a shower in a home with a full water softener is better than with this shower head, but for the price, this was perfect. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, and I highly recommend this shower head.
