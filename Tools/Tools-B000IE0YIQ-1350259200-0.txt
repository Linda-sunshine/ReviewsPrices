review/summary: Works well, so far.review/text: I hate paying $1 at the gas station for air (it's air!) so hopefully this lasts at least 47 uses. Actually I didn't buy it, it showed up at my house in a magical Amazon box after I complained to my father about refusing to pay $1 on the principle of it all. Anyways...So far it's worked well and I've had it for about a year. I've pumped bike tires, sports equipment, and my car tires. It worked well for all. I like that dial function saves time from stopping, checking the pressure, then redoing it all by getting close to the general psi. It is not super accurate if you are looking for that feature. The AC plug cord is really short, but the DC is long enough to be connected inside the car and reach all the tires (at least on my small car, Mazda 3). All the cords fold up snuggly into their designated compartments, but it was stupid of the design to put the power switch into the back section where the cords are stored. You have to pull the DC cord out if you want to turn on the AC cord.
