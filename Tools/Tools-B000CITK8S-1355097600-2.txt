review/summary: Seems to work as advertisedreview/text: I bought this for my full-sized John Deere Diesel tractor because every winter after setting for a few months I would have to recharge the battery if I needed it for plowing the driveway. So far it seems to be working very well because every couple of weeks I go out to the pole barn and check the battery with an ohm meter and it is fully charged. Saves me a lot of headaches.
