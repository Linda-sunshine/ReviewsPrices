review/summary: Could be strongerreview/text: Purchased this when it was a gold box deal a few weeks ago. The shower head is nice quality.. has a nice strong stream plenty of settings to find the perfect setting for you. The strongest pulse setting is nice to help loosen up the knots in your back. When I purchased this on a whim I didn't realize that it also filtered the water. I never had an issue with the water needing to be filtered but I do notice a difference. The water is noticeably softer and more refreshing.I just the shower head would spread the water a little wider. Even on the outermost setting it's still a little narrow
