review/summary: Compact, Quiet, And Works Perfectlyreview/text: The InSinkErator Compact Evolution 3/4 Horsepower (HP) garbage disposal is a welcome addition to my kitchen. When I remodeled my last house I installed a good InSinkErator and never had any difficulty with it. Recently the disposal in my current home abruptly seized, so it was time to replace it. I researched the different models available and decided that the combination of compact under-sink footprint, quiet operation, and power made this the right model for my needs. I feel after looking at the disposal and the instructions that I could have installed it, however I elected to let a plumber do it as there were a couple of other things he had to do in the house anyway. Of course he's a trained professional, but he had it installed and working in maybe 30 minutes (I wasn't timing him, so it could have been a bit more or less) and it is amazingly quieter and stronger than the old 1/2 HP model it replaced. Given the layout of my plumbing, the compact size was important (or several pipes would have had to be relocated; this was the primary reason I wanted a professional to install it) and this unit is about 1/4 inch shorter than the old unit, so pipe clearance was no problem.Although I have not had the unit very long, it's amazing what a difference it makes in routine kitchen cleanup, and I cannot emphasize the amazing difference in quietness and vibration from this InSinkErator versus the older machine. Based on my experience with this disposal, and the fact that my last InSinkErator lasted many years with zero problems, I have no qualms recommending the InSinkErator Compact Evolution 3/4 Horsepower garbage disposal: it is a great value and I am completely happy with my decision to buy this model.
