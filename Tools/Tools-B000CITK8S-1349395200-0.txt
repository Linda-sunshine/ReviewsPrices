review/summary: Almost perfect...review/text: I have a custom-built trailer with built-in battery to power emergency lights that I tow behind a motorcycle; it's been fitted with a harness so that, hooked to a 117VAC outlet, either the internal U1P-7 battery or the motorcycle battery can be charged. The trailer was originally fitted with a charger which I had very little confidence in; I've substituted the Battery Tender Junior which both frees up space (it's much smaller, about 40% the size of the original) and gives me some confidence that neither of the batteries will be "cooked" by overcharging. The Battery Tender Juniors have a deserved reputation for reliability and durability; battery-charge cycle tests over the past 24 hours have confirmed my opinion that the Junior is the right choice for this application. I do wish that the manufacturer had provided a way to anchor it to a wall or floor so that I need not concern myself with making sure that it's properly mated to the outlet before I begin the charging cycles, but I can live with that small shortcoming.
