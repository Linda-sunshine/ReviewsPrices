review/summary: Hands down great dealreview/text: The best ladder in size/type category I could find at a great price. Saved ~$50.00 vs. purchasing same day at my local Lowes when it was on sale and with tax yet to be assessed on it. Via Amazon was able to have ladder delivered 2-day free (Prime) to the Phoenix valley area. Considering the ladder type it is very versatile and I was able to hang my Christmas lights no sweat on my two story structure.
