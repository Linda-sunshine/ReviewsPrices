review/summary: Not easy to use.review/text: I wanted this item to compare electrical usage between different appliances. I am not an electrical or mechanical genius, but I thought it would be easier to use than it is. First of all, since it has to be plugged into the wall outlet, it can be difficult to get in place, & then difficult to impossible to read. We made a "pigtail" to eliminate this problem, but I still don't always know what the results are telling me. No instructions to speak of doesn't help. It may work for contractors, but not for everyday people
