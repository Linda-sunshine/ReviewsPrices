review/summary: Great ladder, very strong and versatile!review/text: I have used a buddy's little giant ladder a bunch and liked it a lot so I went on the search for myself one. I had looked on line and in the stores and I wasn't gonna give $300+ for a ladder that's nuts! I found the Werner ladder online and really liked the look and the weight capacity of 300lbs because I'm a big guy at 6'6" and 285lbs and little giant ladder rated at 250lbs made me very nervous watching it flex while I'm on it. This past Christmas the Home Depot had this ladder on sale for $129.99! So I go to the Home Depot and look at it in person and wow this is a ladder! Heavy gauge aluminum, nice wide rungs, this thing is awesome. When you extend it out the rungs are doubled so you have nice wide step to stand and you won't find that on the little giant. I gladly purchase and go home and put it to work. The first thing I did miss about the little giant ladder was that it had wheels! So looking further at my new ladder I am convinced that the wheels off a little giant ladder will fit mine! With my trusty iPhone 5 I go to amazon and order a set of little giant wheels for $29.99 get them in slide them on drill 2 holes per wheel and I have created the greatest ladder ever they fit like a glove! I don't know why Werner don't do this but if the Werner folks are reading this it might be something to check into installing some wheels! I strongly recommend this ladder it's very heavy built, strong, sturdy. Buy this ladder!
