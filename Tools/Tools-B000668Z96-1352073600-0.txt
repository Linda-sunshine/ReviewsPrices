review/summary: Don't botherreview/text: Not worth the money, time or effort.From the time I set this up Friday evening to the time the bulb burned out Sunday afternoon, there were 8 fleas caught by the trap. I caught and killed many more in several minutes just by standing about a foot away from the trap and using Scotch tape to catch the buggers.
