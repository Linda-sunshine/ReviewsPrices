review/summary: It works fine.review/text: Neighbors of lowest caliber, walls of paper! If you live in NYC in one of those so called apartments, then you will probably need one of these if you spend more of your time to reading/studying as opposed to your neighbors who spend their time with watching their loud tvs or by hitting the walls etc. These should be provided for free to NYC residents!
