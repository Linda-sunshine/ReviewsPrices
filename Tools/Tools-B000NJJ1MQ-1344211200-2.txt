review/summary: One of those items that you say, why didn't I get this before?review/text: This is something I had thought about for a long time and finally decided to try. My family and I are very glad we did. I am pretty good about remembering keys so that was not an issue. I wanted to ease of not having to reach for a key, fiddle with a key with arms full, etc. Also the peace of mind of when going out on short walking neighborhood trips not having to take any keys at all.I didn't install this. A friend who works in construction did in just a few minutes. He said Schlage was a very good brand and it was no problem at all to install. As for code entries; very clear and well written instructions. Super easy to delete the 2 codes it comes with and enter new codes. When you exit, you just push the top 'Schlage' button and you have around 5 seconds to lock it. To unlock it you enter your code.One thing to keep in mind is it sticks out a bit more than some locks. It sticks out more than our old lock. We happen to have a screen door and the handle of that door now butts up against the lock. Not a huge deal though. Also and this isn't clear at first from the box there is a 9 volt battery included. So no need to buy one right away. Lastly the lock seems very secure. More secure than the lock it replaced. Bottomline quality product, that just makes life a little bit easier. Highly recommended.
