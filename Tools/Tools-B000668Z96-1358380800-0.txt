review/summary: flea trapreview/text: I have a dog and a cat that were having some flea issues so I purchased this since I had tried everything under the sun to be rid of them. I really can't say how I liked it. You plug it in and the light is on which is fine.. and I'm not sure if I'm happy that I didn't see any fleas on it or not! However, I did get a couple fruit flies!
