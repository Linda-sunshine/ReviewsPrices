review/summary: Fleas were more attracted to us than these trapsreview/text: I was excited when I first set up my flea trap, as I had one flea immediately come out and inspect it. Unfortunately, he never jumped in. In fact, of the 100 fleas that ended up in the trap, 99 of them were ones I caught and put in there. For that purpose it was helpful, as even rinsing them down the drain wasn't a guarantee that the fleas would stay down (Some would climb back out!). At least they'd stay stuck to the sticky paper.I finally gave up this time and had Terminex come in and spray the carpet. That took care of the fleas. There was no odor within a short time. I wish I had done it from the start.I forgot to mention that one of the bulbs that came with my order didn't even work.
