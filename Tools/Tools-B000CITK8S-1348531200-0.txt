review/summary: Good productreview/text: I have a pickup truck, new, that will be sitting in a garage for 4 months or more while I am on a trip. The newer vehicles have a lot of electronics that do not like having power interruptions so I really didn't want to disconnect the battery like I have done with older vehicles. The battery tender fills my needs perfectly.
