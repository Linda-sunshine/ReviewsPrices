review/summary: Have fun getting the filter out to replace it!review/text: We have been using this filter since December 2011. We have no complaints about the water and the replacement cartridges are not expensive. However, TWICE when we attempted to change the filter we had to beat the heck out of it and perform major surgery to get the filter piece off. We even left the last one on so loosely that we were certain it would come right off when it was time to change the filter again -- but no dice. After using every tool in the toolbox and every bit of strength we can muster, this third attempt to change the filter has failed -- it's just not coming off. It's totally fused shut for life. We cannot change the filter so we just had to buy another one from Amazon. If these weren't so darn cheap to start with, we would be looking for another filter. We still may look for another filter but we have three replacement cartridges for this and figured it was worth getting the filter again since it's well under twenty bucks. We will try greasing the threads/teeth of the screw in cartridge area and see if that helps with getting it off next time. Maybe this is just a lemon and not an issue with all of the filters. We'll soon find out if this problem is universal and report back so that this info may help future buyers.
