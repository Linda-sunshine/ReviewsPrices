review/summary: Just what you need for a computer work station!review/text: I was fighting having enough outlets for my computer (and television set and desk lamp) with two five-outlet surge protectors, and trying to put those large transformers-typle plugs in next to each other. This surge protector gives you more than enough room, with only two more outlets, I now have four empty outlets available where before, I had none. Way to go, Belkin!
