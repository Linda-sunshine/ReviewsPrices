review/summary: Thermostat creates constant tempreview/text: I used my Lasko all winter long in Virginia as the only heat source for my 1,000 square foot apartment. The thermostat kept energy bills at a minimum because of the ability to control the temperature; I find it too easy to let the temperature of a room get much higher than needed without the thermostat. It is lightweight, so I took it from living room to bedroom easily. Economical. Doesn't look half bad either. Cord did not get hot.
