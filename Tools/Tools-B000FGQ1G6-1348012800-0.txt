review/summary: One of the Best Toolkits!review/text: Hi All,I am an IT Professional by trade, and I used one of theseBoxer 30 Pcs 4mm Precision Screwdriver Setkits at my first job. The kit was so perfect and had exactly what I needed ALL THE TIME for computer repair (excluding Macintosh computers -- look up "Torx"Silverhill 20 Piece Tool Kit for Apple Productsfor these!). The kit of screwdriver bits has been bulletproof with regards to the amount and size of the bits, and the quality of this kit. It always seems to have exactly the right size I need for the job!My only complaint was that I just dropped the case and it broke the hinge and the case/lid no longer closes properly (or stays on). So, just don't drop it on any hard surfaces... Other than that, Boxer makes a quality repair toolkit for the IT Professional, and I will be buying my SECOND one of these kits. Yes, it's just that good.Best,-- Morris
