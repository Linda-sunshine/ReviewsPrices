review/summary: Do not buy this!!!review/text: This product is the most useless thing I have ever purchased...it does not attract fleas at all! I've had it set up in a flea infested area in my home for nearly 24 hours now, and the only flea on there is the one I grabbed off my cat and put on there, to see if a flea would actually stick. The box claims to attract fleas up to 30 ft away and will actually draw them out of carpet and upholstery. Hah! I bought this because i needed a way to get fleas off of a litter of kittens who are too young for chemical flea products. Don't waste your money...I'm returning this product ASAP!
