review/summary: This product should be called the "master blaster"!!review/text: I am usually the skeptic, and as usual, I was with this product, it was mostly made of plastic and I had my reservations about it.I set it up on a pole 30 feet or so from my patio, as so as it started to get a little bit on the dusk side, this thing starts blasting everything that will go near it(which, apparently was everything), the electrical storm started, I didn't realize we had that many flying insects. I took my dogs out that night around 2am, it was still drawing in victims. So far, it has run solid for about 3 weeks, killing bugs by the bucketful.The bottom line, for an economical bug zapper, this works well beyond my expectations. I give this one 3 thumbs up.
