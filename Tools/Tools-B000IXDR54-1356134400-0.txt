review/summary: It's a lemon...review/text: First of all, there was a bit of miscommunication between us which was resolved resulting in the package getting here sooner. The packaging was in order and the flashlight was new but, after putting in batteries (two different kinds) the only way it would work is if I held the thing facing straight up. The second I faced it forward or down it stopped working, not to mention it sounded like the LED light was rattling around inside. I'm quite sure that it's not purely Amazon.com LLC's fault because the same thing has happened far too many times going to local stores.I will find out soon enough how they handle returned items, but until then...Happy Holidays Everyone...
