review/summary: Amazingreview/text: This works great even if you don't have fleas!! My daughter is terrified of spiders and this product is a must for her. We are not over run with spiders by all means but everything is attracted to this thing. She has woken up to find lady bugs, mosquitos, gnats, a fly and yes spiders trapped. After a few months throw away the sticky lining and replace because eventually dust and fuzz makes it less sticky. If it gives her piece of mind then it is well worth it. I have since bought another and keep it in the basement. Although I only run it during the summer months from everyone running in and out of the house. My mother has also borrowed it when she rescued an abandoned kitten and became flea infested. It certainly did its job.
