review/summary: Works greatreview/text: Works great and was $5 cheaper than Walmart. I have used this flashlight on a daily basis since I got it and the batteries are still holding up strong. The light is so strong that is it literally blinding if directed into the eyes. I carry this flashlight with me when I take my two small dogs walks in the evenings and it actually came in very good use 3 nights ago. A very large dog was off leash in someones front yard as we approached down the side walk. It was dark on the street and I know the dog probably could not see us very well and we just looked like scary dark shadows to him. He charged me and my two small dogs but when I shined this light into his eyes he immediately stopped and ran back to his house (where his owner gave him a good swat on the ass for not listening to all his shouts). If I had not had the flashlight I probably would have had to kick the dog in the head before it attacked my two small dogs so this purchase has already validated itself to me.
