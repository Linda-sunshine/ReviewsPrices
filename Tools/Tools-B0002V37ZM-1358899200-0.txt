review/summary: Works As Advertised. Just be Aware of Mounting Hardwarereview/text: First the product works well, holding our broom, Swifter, mops, etc. There only issues I had were the screws and anchors that came with it were not strong enough. Since I was mounting the organizer into drywall, I had to use the anchors the enclosed anchors and screws. After few days of normal use, the anchors were not strong enough to hold the organizer in place. I had to purchase stronger anchors and bigger screws to securely install the organizer.
