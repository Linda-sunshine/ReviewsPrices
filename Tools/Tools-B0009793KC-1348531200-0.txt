review/summary: Change your referigerator's water filterreview/text: The ice cube maker in my side-by-side refer was frosting up; the little ice it was making was "hollow" and melting into a big iceberg. I thought I would need service.But first I decided to replace the water filter. The big box store wanted $45; Amazon had the same filter for $25. I opted for the free shipping since it wasn't an emergency; it arrived in 5 business days. Saved $20; more when you consider time and gas money getting to the store.I installed the new filter and problem solved! Solid loose ice, no frost!
