review/summary: Nice nightlight and trap for dog hair!review/text: I bought this since it's non-toxic and seemed like a great design concept. However, it has caught a great deal more dog hair than fleas even though I've moved it to various locations for several days at a time to see if it'll work better. I definitely don't recommend it!
