review/summary: loud as metal grinding metalreview/text: Bought this item based on the review here. But the when it starts, it sounds like metal hitting/grinding metal, raelly really loud. This only happens when it starts when the motor is still, when I turn the machine back on when the motor is still spinning, there is no sound.Is it normal?
