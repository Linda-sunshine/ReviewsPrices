review/summary: Best brand but would not fit all the way into my fridge.review/text: Unfortunately, this particular filter did not fit my fridge filter tube. Had used same brand in past but it must have been different model #. Had it way too long to send back. Appliance store now charges $40 for one of the Pur water filters. Wish co. would idicate exactly which of their filters will fit which models. They don't seem to offer the filter I used to buy any longer. Sears costs even more than local store & we have to order by mail & pay shipping charges.
