review/summary: Great Amazon Service - Poor performing productreview/text: Based on larger quantity of good reviews I opted to purchase the Culligan FM-15A faucet mount water filter from Amazon.com. I should have paid more attention to the review that said this filter was like placebo... Amazon service was great as usual - no complaints. The filter on the other hand is disappointing and definitely a waste of money.I bought this filter in the hopes of having an easy to use filtered water source for cooking, making teas, etc.Regardless of whether I run it with low, medium or high flow - there is absolutely no difference in taste in my highly chlorinated and alkaline tap water.Determined to understand if this filter was actually doing anything, I went to my local hardware store and purchase a TDS tester and color strips for testing various other common potable water contaminants. Initial reading on TDS (directly from tap) was 298ppm. Reading when filtered through FM-15a (rate of flow made minimal difference) was 291-288ppm. All color strips (6 different ones testing things like chlorine, alkalinity, lead, etc.) showed no color difference when comparing tap water to the filtered water.Thus far the ZeroWater pitcher based filtration system has delivered the best quality and taste of drinking water, however the short life (&lt;30 days in 1 person house) and cost of their filters ($12-15 depending on how many you buy at a time) may not be pratical for homes with multiple people, or for combined uses of cooking, drinking water, etc.
