review/summary: Can't go wrong for $8review/text: I just got one of these about a week ago, and I'm really happy with it.People have expressed concerns that they might accidentally cut themselves on this, but I don't think it's a real issue. The key opens up 180 degrees, and locks at BOTH 90 and 180 degrees. So, if you want to use it as a saw/pocket knife, it will lock out straight. It you want to use the screwdriver, it will lock at 90 degrees so you'll have a sturdy handle. This locking feature also means that it is easy to close the key without cutting yourself.The tool feels very sturdy. It's apparent that a lot of thoughtful design was put into this product. Highly recommended.
