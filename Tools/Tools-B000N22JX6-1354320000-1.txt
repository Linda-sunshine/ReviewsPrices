review/summary: Powerful little heaterreview/text: This little heater is powerful and also very quiet. It actually heats up a large room (26 x 20) in just a few minutes. The remote control makes it easy to adjust the temperature or rotation from across the room. I have only had this heater a few weeks, but I'm very happy with this purchase.
