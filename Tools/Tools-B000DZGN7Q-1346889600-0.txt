review/summary: Noisy as heck, sounds like total junkreview/text: We had this installed when we put on new countertops. Selected this model as it seemed to be excellant rated with 1.0 HP motor. Problem #1, when you first hit the switch to start it, it sounds like a big motor throwing out a little blade. Sounds like it's going to break. Problem #2, running noise, it isn't just a little loud, it is horriable and sounds like it is going to tear itself apart. Replaced a 20 year old 3/4 HP insinkerator model. I wished I would have kept it, this one would come out and I'd put the old one back in. Plus it is huge in size and takes a lot of room under the sink. Don't believe the statements that it's "a little louder". Sounds like you have a Harley Davidson under you sink, DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL.
