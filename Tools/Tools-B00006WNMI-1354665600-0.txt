review/summary: Love this, so easy to installreview/text: I must say I was surprised at how easy this was to install. With my faucet, all I had to do was screw it on after I had removed the fancy looking end of the faucet that revealed the spirals that I screwed the filter to. I didnt even need to use any of the attachments. The water tastes pretty much as good as my $300 double filter that we have downstairs. With a new baby on the way, I love that I can just go into my bathroom to get water now instead of going downstairs. Im giving this 5 stars!
