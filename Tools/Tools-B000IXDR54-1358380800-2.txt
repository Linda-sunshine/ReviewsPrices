review/summary: EXCELLENT VALUEreview/text: This flashlight is great. It's heavy-duty and is extremely bright. It is perfect to use before letting our dog out into the backyard at night...it's bright enough for me to check to make sure there are no racoons roaming the yard. For the price, I would definitely recommend.
