review/summary: Perfect for the jobreview/text: Bought this to keep my broom, mop and swiffer off the floor of my laundry room. It was very easy to install, although would probably use better anchors than what it comes with if needed when not installing to studs. I currently have a swiffer wet jet, broom, mop, and 2 other long handled dusters on it. No problems holding the items. Easy to remove and put back up. Highly recommend. Will likely be ordering another for the basement supplies soon.
