review/summary: Won't grind food very well and smells badlyreview/text: We moved into a brand new house six weeks ago and it came with this disposer. I don't like it at all. It won't handle anything unless it's pretty well chopped up before I put it in the unit. It seems to get stuck and turn off automatically about every other time I use it, especially if there's anything 'chunky'. I can't even put a half of a lemon down it without it stopping, then I have to put the wrench in it and restart, which is a hassle to have to do so often. Besides that, there's a terrible fishy odor that comes from the part of the unit that is underneath the sink. We've tried hot water, baking soda, disposal tabs, etc. and doesnt seem to help. the odor intensifies when we are disposing of a larger quantitiy of food. We had an insinkerator at our old home that was at least 20 years old, and never gave us one problem. Since it's a new house, there wasn't anything put down it before we moved into it. It seems like a cheaply built unit and I bet there are better models out there. I will be looking into the warranty before it's up.
