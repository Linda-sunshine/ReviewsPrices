review/summary: Wrong Specs on Productreview/text: "Outside assembly - 6.84 inches tall, 3.01 inches wide, 2.74 inches deep" is incorrect.Without even removing it from the packing the depth measured just over 3 inches to the deepest part of the handle at the widest part of the outside curve. Unfortunately that 1/4 inch made the difference in whether my glass storm door would close. I had two other people verify there was not anyway it could be installed in conjunction with secondary glass door. So if you have any clearances less than 3 inches deep, you won't be able to install this lock.I can't attest to the rest of the lock's quality due to the fact it never got installed. But, based on the other reviews I read before my purchase I assume it would have been a good lock.
