review/summary: So far so good...but it's a monster!review/text: Needed a new disposal to replace a broken one. I replaced the last one myself so I was feeling pretty confident (although my body is now twelve years older and doesn''t fit under my sink as well as it used to). The price of this unit went on sale just as I needed it and the reviews were great. I received it fast, gathered my tools, watched a few YOU TUBE videos and took the plunge. It went pretty smoothly except it was almost too large for one person to hold while attaching it. It also fills up a much larger space under my sink. It attached alright but seemed to drip for a bit until I realized that I had not turned the unit tightly until I heard a &#34;click&#34; signifying that it was all the way on. Then, no leaks. Now, it seems to work well but when draining a full sink of water, it really picks up speed, gets loud and vibrates the whole kitchen. When just emptying a few scraps it hums along pretty quietly. I expect I will get many good years out of this monster of a disposal.
