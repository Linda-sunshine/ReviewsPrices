review/summary: Excellent product!review/text: I only have 2 complaints---1) There isnt a local retailer for refills for the product2) I had a unit that shorted out after 2 months. Customer service did a excellent job and sent me a replacement free of cost.The bulbs are easy enough to find at the local hardware store.This thing is insane for flea infestations. Usually I would use chemicals but being a new mom, thats pretty much out of the question. Aside from spot treatments on our animals. No sprays or any of that jazz.The first night, we placed 2 in our house, the next day there had to have been over 100 fleas caught. A lot of them big ole "bout to lay me some eggs" looking fleas. After a week all the fleas in the traps were tiny. It has not cured our problem but it has definitely helped.If you need replacement glue pads, order them, but while waiting, put a bit of water in the bottom trap and dawn dishsoap. Works well until you can get more refills.
