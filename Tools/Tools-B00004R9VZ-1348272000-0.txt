review/summary: Flowtron insect killerreview/text: This bug killer is lightweight for easy installation, but it's very effectivekeeping down the mosquitoes at our rural home. Positionedseveral feet away from our entryway, it draws insectsto itself instead of them whooshing in the doorwhen we do. Fitted with the dawn to dusk attachment, it providesan outdoor light when we arrive home after dark. Very pleased withit and just ordered another for the barn.
