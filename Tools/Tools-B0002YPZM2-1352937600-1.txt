review/summary: Feather weight contendersreview/text: These gloves look much bulkier in the photo then they actually are. In fact, except for the padded areas, the palms, knuckles and the proximal interphalangeal joint they are but a scant single layer. I Bought them for ridding and just for a hoot I did a stint with just one glove. It really didn't seem like the gloved hand was perceptibly warmer. They will help protect your knuckles in mechanical operation and because they are so thin they offer good retention of dexterity. The padding will also help while holding cold tools and parts, so, while you'll still feel the wind on the back of your hand while working they are worth having. For lightweights they seem reasonably well made and you can can pick up and manipulate small objects like screws and washers or operate and adjustable wrench or a ratchet.
