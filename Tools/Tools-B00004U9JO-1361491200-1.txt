review/summary: Bager 5review/text: This badger 5 was just what I expected. Easy to install and plenty of horse power for a family of 4.Our last insinkerater lasted for about 11 years before it started to leak and was just a 1/3 horse but for the same price on line we switched to the badger 5 1/2 horse.Wow these are great products.
