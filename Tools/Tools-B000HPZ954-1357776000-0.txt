review/summary: Great Power Strip at a Great Pricereview/text: This type of power strip would have been considerably more expensive had I purchased it at a local store such as Best Buy / Office Depot / Office Max. Works great under our entertainment center to give us plenty of plug-in options for all of our equipment. The sideways plug that connects to the wall outlet is a great asset as well, as we have limited space around that wall plug-in to get anything plugged-in there... a shelf comes near that wall outlet. Item arrived in perfect condition and on time. Would order this item again.
