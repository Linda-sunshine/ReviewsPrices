review/summary: Terribly engineeredreview/text: It inflated a tire, so it gets a star. But, this has to be the worst piece of engineering I have seen in decades. No handle nor any way to carry it, except to wrap both hands around it; short 120v cord and air hose; a switch that can only be reached by removing the 12v cord; and the switch is located inside the case. Just awful all the way around.
