review/summary: I collect more fleas than it does!review/text: My poor puppy has been plagued with fleas that the cat keeps bringing in. Despite almost every flea collar, powder, etc... the fleas keep coming back.....so I bought this, hoping to make a dent in our flea population. So far, after trying a variety of locations, I collect more fleas just by sitting on the couch next to my dog than it does. It seems like a good idea and the lining is super sticky--even after several weeks--but it doesn't seem to attract fleas very well. As one reviewer put it, "it makes a great night light, but not a very good flea catcher."
