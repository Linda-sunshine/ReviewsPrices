review/summary: Great unit and Great Peace of Mindreview/text: Replace my old smoke detector with this dual unit that detects smoke and Carbon Monoxide. Installation was easy. the Kidde unit works when tested. The alarm has a loud beep and a voice telling you if it is smoke or carbon monoxide detected. there is a green led that blinks every 30 sec to tell you it has power and is working. you test it like any other alarm with the push button on the front. Best of all it offers me peace of mind. Very satisfied.
