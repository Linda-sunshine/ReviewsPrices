review/summary: Nice tool setreview/text: Good quality tool set.I am a handyman by trade and own hundreds of tools and I have learned the hard way not to buy ones that lack in quality. As soon as I opened the bit set package, I knew I had made a good purchase and that the set would last.I bought this set with one small 10 minute laptop upgrade job in mind. The laptop upgrade went smoothly and I have used these tools a couple of times since. These bits have all fit the fasteners properly and don't give when a fastener is being a little stubborn.This is not an everyday professional set. I'd put it in the mid-level category.For my purposes, I am very happy with these tools
