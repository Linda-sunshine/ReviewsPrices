review/summary: Did not really workreview/text: This item did not really work for me. I put it near the dogs beds (where they sleep most of the time) and in about 3 days caught about 2 fleas in total.Also the lightbulb went out after one night (I left it on overnight).Overall, I would not recommend this product as it is also an eyesore and did not really work.I'd suggest getting some shampoo for your dogs and getting a flea comb and some house/dog spray and doing that method, albeit more laborious, much more effective.
