review/summary: Just What i was looking forreview/text: I don't know why things like this are so hard to find. I find it hard to believe that i am the only one who wants something like this. I checked a number of local major home stores and they did not have anything like this. well one did, but is was nearly $50. So I went shopping on Amazon, and ran across these. Price was Right, Size was right, Shipping was right. so I gave them a try. These were exactly what I was looking for. I have now been able to turn my power drill into a socket driver. I've used these for a number of different projects. They do what you expect them to do. They attach to your drill and connect a socket.The only down side is that these extensions can be a little short. For that reason, i paired this purchase with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V3TQP2/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&me;=&seller;= which are extensions for a drill. Now I can get to nut and bolts that I could not before. Yeah!In summary - these are inexpensive, and do what you expect. Stop your looking and order these :)
