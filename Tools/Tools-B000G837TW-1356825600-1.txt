review/summary: Very Important, A review you must readreview/text: First of all I will rate this product by each feature individually.Design - Five stars - The design is sound, a lot of thought was put into it. In fact it, it is over designed. It contains features that should be incorporated in all Garbage Disposer. This my third disposer,and for me they are not easily uninstalls and reinstalled. The corrosion that occurs from minute leakage around the sink will be virtually eliminated, the plastic linkage system is sound and well designed, and it is not hard to couple the disposer to.Appearance - Five stars - It is (at least the one hp unit) is large. The diameter and length larger than any other disposer that I have had. It is entirely gray plastic.OK, so why the one star rating. This is where I think the unit was over designed, the motor is a high torque motor and when it starts, it starts with a "LOUD CRACK", like a rife shot. This was unacceptable to me and I disassemble the unit and returned it. There are only two of us in the family that use it. May be, if the disposer was full, the garbage would cushion the start up sound. Once it gets started it is acceptably quiet.
