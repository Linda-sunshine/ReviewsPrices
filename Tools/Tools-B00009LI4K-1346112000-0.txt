review/summary: Super-comfortable. Awesome for noisy offices.review/text: I tend to wear big earmuff-like headphones at work to drown out distractions, but I haven't found any that have serious noise reduction compared to real earmuffs. These are insanely quiet, and much more comfortable during long periods of wear than any headphones I've found, due to the cushy surface and large amount of open space for my ears (they don't even touch my ears when I wear them).Tip: By default, the ear cups press pretty firmly against the head, which might be uncomfortable for some. The wires that run over the head can be safely bent outwards to reduce that pressure to whatever level you prefer.
