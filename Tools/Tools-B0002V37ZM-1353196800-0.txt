review/summary: Very functionalreview/text: This hanger does a great job of organizing my tools that have handles. It is easy to use and the price was fair. The only thing that I would ask for is to have the spacing for the mounting holes to be 16 inches apart so as to catch a wall stud on each end of the hanger in the event that I hang something heavy. I do plan to buy another one of these Evriholders.
