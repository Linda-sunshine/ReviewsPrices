review/summary: Works, but a bit unhandy.review/text: Good day to all. This Product is well made does what it says but a bit unhandy as it goes form my garage to house. You go upstairs from my garage with groceries to the screen got to reach through to open the door from house and then go inside. It works best when left alone you put the only two magnets together, and the air comes your way without insects. But it works quite well then. Frank
