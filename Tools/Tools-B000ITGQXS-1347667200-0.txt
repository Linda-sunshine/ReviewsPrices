review/summary: flexible but disfunctionalreview/text: The flexibility is great. And you can make this work with most books other than the lightest paperbacks. The flaw? Very shortly into using it, it started flickering and wouldn't provide a constant, high light. The light would dim and I would have to hit it to get full light. Changing batteries didn't make a difference. It is great in concept, but in execution very disappointing. I don't want to have to buy one every month to keep it working.
