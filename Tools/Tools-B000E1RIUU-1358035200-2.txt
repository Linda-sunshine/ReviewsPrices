review/summary: Niiicereview/text: First night didn't catch any mouse. The second night caught one. Third night caught two little ones. On fourth day I heard a mouse in my room while I was sleeping and put the trap by my door and crumbled a small cookie by the traps entrance. Five minutes later I hear the mouse walking inside and zap! It was a huge mouse compared to the others. So far it's been 3 days and have yet to catch another. Ether they got scared or we don't have anymore. Next time I'll remember to close the basement window .
