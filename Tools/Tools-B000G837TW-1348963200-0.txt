review/summary: Good Valuereview/text: Looked at several garbage disposers at brick and mortar stores. Once we settled on the one we wanted, we realized that Amazon's price could not be beat. It delivered in two days and my husband and I installed it. It was a replacement disposer so electrical and plumbing was already in place. Old disposer was an Insinkerator Badger 1/3 hp which had never been up to par.The most difficult part was removing the old disposer. The screws that held the collar in place had become loose over time so when we tried to twist the collar to remove the old disposer, everything turned. Once we realized the problem and tightened the screws, the old one came off easily. New one was easy to install. Just took a little time and patience. The old one was hard wired in so we had to wire the new one while under the sink which was a bit cumbersome. No electrical wires come with the new one, so if you are doing a new install, you will need to purchase wiring. I recommend getting one with a plug on it and installing an outlet under your sink. It will make the job simpler.Disposer is amazingly quiet. We were shocked at how quiet it is compared to the old disposer. So far it has taken everything we have put in it without any problem.
