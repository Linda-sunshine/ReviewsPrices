review/summary: Works Great. Fast In And Even Faster Outreview/text: The lock will require a 4 digit code in order to be able to unlock the door. Otherwise the lock just spins free doing nothing from the outside. The inside works light any other door requiring you to just turn to the right to lock the door. The feature I really like is just pressing the top button when I leave and locking the door. No code required. And in a few seconds it disengages and your house is secure. Very Nice Lock and great solid built design.
