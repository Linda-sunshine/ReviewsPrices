review/summary: I really like it Made in the USA!review/text: 5 stars as Works great and Made in USA!! You can see the shavings coming off as you sharpen! It has pictures and is really easy to use. I tested my knives before and after. They were razor sharp after 3 passes. I had not ever sharpened them. You can also switch the cutters if they ever wear out, you just reverse them.
