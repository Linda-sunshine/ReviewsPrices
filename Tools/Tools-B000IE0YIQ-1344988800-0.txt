review/summary: Works Great and No Recharging Neededreview/text: This is the second tire inflator I have purchased. I chose it for the Black and Decker name. My previous unit from Campbell Hausefield failed after only 20-30 recharges, and a replacement battery was almost as costly as a new unit.This inflator works fine, turns off when the desired pressure is reached, and is reasonably quiet. It can be plugged in for home use and it doesn't need to be recharged like other "portable" units. The cord could be longer. Since my garage only has one accessible power outlet, I needed two extension cords to reach all 4 tires. I've only used the unit once, but didn't find the valve attachment to be flimsy as some have written here, though metal rather than plastic would be more reassuring, even if it were to cost an extra buck or two.So far, this seems like a good value.
