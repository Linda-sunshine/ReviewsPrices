review/summary: Amazing... "torch"review/text: This is awesome.The flashlight is very bright, has a great grip, and weighs almost nothing [even with the 3 (D)-cell batteries.]I now know why the British refer to some flashlights as a "torch." Here's why: In a pitch black room, turning on the flashlight and pointing it directly at the ceiling... the room is bright as day. Just like an actual torch.I'll eventually get more since this one is so amazing. I figure, 1 for the car and some for the house.It truly is an amazing... "torch."Thanks,Chuck McK.
