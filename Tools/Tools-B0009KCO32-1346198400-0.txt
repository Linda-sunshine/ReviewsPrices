review/summary: Can finally leave French Doors open!!review/text: I've seen the ads on TV and finally after reading the reviews on Amazon, decided to give it a go. I'm glad I finally bought it. The nights in Ohio are starting to cool down and being able to leave the French Doors open to get a nice cross breeze is GREAT. The product was easy to put up and took less than 5 minutes. I'm not sure how long it will survive the two dogs going in and out but if it develops issues, I will definitely get another to replace it.
