review/summary: Nice product.review/text: Good location on outlets, allows 6 large packs and 6 regular size plugs. Used for desk in home office and have a few of each type of plug left over.Only complaint is I wish the plug was able to rotate, as the cable to the surge protector comes off the wall outlet at 135 degrees, and I would have preferred 225 degrees as the outlet is to the right of my desk, and not to the left. A minor complaint, but would make the unit a 5 star for sure.
