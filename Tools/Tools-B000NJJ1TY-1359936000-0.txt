review/summary: Great Lock, Lockouts are a thing of the pastreview/text: I purchased this lock for my basement door after purchasing and installing another lock for our main door -http://www.amazon.com/Schlage-FE365-CAM-716-ACC/dp/B0028BU91Y/ref=cm_cr-mr-titleI love these locks...I would never go back to a standard keyed lock again. We'll never be locked out again. I never liked hiding a key outside but it is almost a necessity with a standard keyed lock. When the kids were young we had one hidden outside but we came to find out that everyone in the neighborhood soon knew where it was because the kids locked themselves out so often when they had friends over. To make sure the house was secure we ended up rekeying or replacing all the locks. Theres no no need to do that with this lock...If someone does get access to your code simply delete it and set another. Love it.Install was fairly straight forward with reasonably clear instructions and since this was my second install of this type of lock only took about 20 minutes including the time it took to remove the old lock.Things I love about this lock- I will Never be locked out again- Fit and finish are beautiful- Heavy quality feel- Easy to program- Easy Install- Easy Operation- Ability to program multiple codes (I programmed unique and easy to remember codes for everyone in the family)- Auto lock feature ( can set it to auto lock after 5 seconds by rotating the thumturn to the horizontal position or remain unlocked by rotating the thumb turn to the vertical position before closing the door)Bottom Line - Quality product that is easy to install and operate. I highly recommend this lock
