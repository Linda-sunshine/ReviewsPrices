review/summary: Easy to set up and use.review/text: I found the setup to be very straight forward and intuitive. It is mostly easy to change but I wish there was a light on the display so it could be easier to adjust buried behind furniture a the outlet. I have found that the temperature tends to read high by a couple of degrees, it could just be that its next to the floor but don't be surprised that you need to set it higher then what you really want in the room.
