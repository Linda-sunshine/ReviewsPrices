review/summary: useful but not a solutionreview/text: I like the reviewer who described this as part of an "arsenal" of weapons. Our dogs are on Ivermec year-round, front lined year round, wear flea collars, get flea baths, get powdered with diatomaceous earth, and flea combed frequently but still have fleas. They live outside, but we still got fleas in the house and can't get rid of them. We tried bombing it twice with no noticeable impact. I try to vacuum everyday. We have tried sprays for both the animals and the surfaces. This sticky trap does catch quite a few fleas and other insects so it works, but so far it hasn't eliminated the problem. I would give it 5 stars instead of 4 except the light bulb that came with it burst the minute we first plugged the brand new unit in, and we found they don't sell the recommended 7watt nightlight bulb everywhere. Many stores only have them in 4watt which we tried but doesn't generate enough warmth to be attractive. I say give it a try but don't expect this one weapon to win the war.
