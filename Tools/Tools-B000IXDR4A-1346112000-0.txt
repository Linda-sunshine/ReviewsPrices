review/summary: This is not your father's glove-compartment flashlightreview/text: This review is for the Mag-Lite ST3D016 3-D Cell LED Flashlight. I believe the technical term for its performance is "insanely bright". I also have the older model with the krypton bulb -- this is significantly brighter. I contemplated upgrading the old one, but the LED module costs about 60% of the Amazon price for this one, so I kept it as a spare. It really is an amazing price and value.
