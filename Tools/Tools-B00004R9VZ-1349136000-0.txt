review/summary: Reliable, good bug zapperreview/text: I have gone through many electronic bug killers over the years. I feel this unit is the best of all the ones I have tried. I have had to replace bulbs periodically, but the zapper continues to work well. Not the easiest to clean, but none of them are. Would buy this one again if the current one stops functioning.
