review/summary: Schlage BE 365 V CAM 505 Keypadreview/text: Product arrived as advertised, in original manufacturer's packaging, unopened and complete. The installation of the deadbolt required me to purchase a hole drilling kit in order to expand both holes in the existing door, as the deadbolt and lock mechanism required larger holes. Once the problem of drilling larger holes was resolved, the installation was fairly easy when following the directions provided. Lock combinations were entered into the keypad and there have been no issues whatsoever during the four months of use with entrance and exit of the door up to 25 times a day. The ability to lock the door with a twist from the outside is a plus, especially when you have stuff in your hands.
