review/summary: Did what it said it was going to doreview/text: It only took a two days to get rid of the mosquitos and I do not regret buying it and I would recommend it to anyone else wanting to get rid of mosquitos. The blue light is very bright but if it is not facing your bedroom window then you are fine.
