review/summary: Works greatreview/text: My apartment in Las Vegas faces West. When the sun sets, the heat is very intense. I used these mylar blankets in my window as poormans insulation. Now my air conditioner does not run constantly and I am able to leave it off during the day when I am not home. Without the blanket and my A/C off, my apartment would reach 90F by 8pm. With the blanket, it stays about 78F.You get a bunch of these blankets, and they are very large. I would recommend these as both poorman window insulation and as an emergency blanket.
