review/summary: Im blindreview/text: These flashlights were purchased as emergency lights for my home. Put one in every closet on ea floor. These lights loaded with Duracell 10 yr shelf life batteriesoutperform my hundred dollar Stinger by a wide margin. They are cost effective and extremely bright. Very pleased. Highly recomend.
