review/summary: love to organizereview/text: I have been looking for a system of helping me to keep the four main household tools that I regularly use from their usual position of leaning against the laundryroom wall. I got tired of bumping or tripping over them so I was thrilled to find the wall organizer. I actually bought it for a Christmas present for myself. My husband put it up in minutes and as soon as he was done I place my tools in the slots. I am so happy!! No more tripping, they are off from leaning against the wall and my laundryroom is neater.
