review/summary: Excellent Noise Killerreview/text: I plan to use these at the shooting range. The fit is firm and very good. The adjustment is a bit limited but they fit my big head fine. As I write this I am sitting in front of a television watching some political talking heads. And as is the norm with these shows, they are all talking at the same time. I have my earmuffs on and it has all gone away. I am sitting here in blissful silence.Whether your noise reduction need is guns or TV, these will do a great job for you.
