review/summary: Difficult to installreview/text: These are very difficult to install. I had to get my big brute of a husband and he couldn't get it to turn. He had to go get channel locks to get the thing to turn. Had water running all over the floor. Very expensive, and they recommend you replace these every 6 months. Not necessary, the last one we had for over a year and my husband broke it up and he said it was clean inside. I would only replace once a year. Too expensive otherwise.
