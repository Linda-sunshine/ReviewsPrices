review/summary: Great Productreview/text: The layout of the outlets on this surge protector are perfect. It has room for the large plugs on the side and all the normal skinny plugs can go in the middle. I haven't had a power surge at my house since installing this product, but so far I am very happy with it. If I ever need another one I will buy this one.
