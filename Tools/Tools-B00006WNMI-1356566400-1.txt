review/summary: filter works fine, but faucet hardware is not greatreview/text: I do not think you will regret buying this filter, for the price I think it is worth a shot, it does its job and cleans your water. But you will most likely be disappointed in the quality of the faucet mounting hardware and the functionality. The knob that activates the filter does not reset itself automatically very long before it gets rusty and gets stuck, it lasted only a few months. It can still be pulled and pushed but over time it gets more stiff and harder to work with. The plastic housing will wear out over time and crack. We are near the end of the life of our first one. We've had it about a year, it is just a $5 mount so no real gripe, but the top of it is showing a bulge and cracks when the water pressure is on.
