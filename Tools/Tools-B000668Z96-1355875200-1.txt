review/summary: Really just for houses with LOTS of fleasreview/text: It says inside the package that if you don't have a ridiculous number of fleas (and yes, I am paraphrasing here), then you may not catch any with this - they aren't kidding. Getting the sticky pad insert into the flea trap itself was a nightmare and the sticky pads were all warped and curved because they had been stored, rolled up, inside the trap during transit. I am not sure if that was something the seller did or something that the manufacturer did. Now, did this thing catch bugs? Yes! I had two little gnats stuck in there in about a week. But fleas? No. I have three dogs, all had fleas pretty seriously off and on during the summer, and the trap had nary a flea in there. If you have lots of animals with lots of fleas and a place to put this where it will be within a ten foot radius of them though, should be great.
