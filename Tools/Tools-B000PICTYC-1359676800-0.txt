review/summary: Great toy.review/text: This is an incredibly well built piece of hardware. Solid construction and light weight. The blade is nice and sharp and the balance is great during use. The pick end doesn't really serve a purpose that i have found, maybe digging, breaking something open or self defense, and a hammer would be far more useful in my experience.Overall I recommend this for anything from car camping to back packing... Except that when weight and space is a concern, i often leave it behind.
