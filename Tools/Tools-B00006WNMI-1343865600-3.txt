review/summary: Better than the "name" brand faucet filtersreview/text: I've just ordered my second one of these. I've used the Brita pitcher and also the faucet filters by Brita and Pur. This is much better at removing the tastes from the water I get where I live than the other two. Less expensive and easier to use as well. Also highly ranked by Consumer Reports and I can now see why.
