review/summary: Excellent Weapon!!review/text: What can you say about this awesome weapon. It is solidly built. It's composite handle is perfect for the ax and adds very little weight. It is very well balanced and can be thrown accurately with ease. Both ends can be used to do damage or to break glass in case of emergency. The handle cannot break unless extreme force is applied (more than wood). I recommend this tomahawk to anyone looking for a decent weapon to add to their collection.
