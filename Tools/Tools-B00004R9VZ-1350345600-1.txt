review/summary: Not built to last - it is just a pretty bug magnet now!!review/text: Oh the joys of watching bugs large and small fly into their quick electric death.At first the family would gather around and watch the carnage. We would call over the neighbors and take pictures for Grandma and Poppi. However this joy was short lived. Within a couple of months of buying this killing machine it stopped working. I did not notice at first, it was not until my little girl came to me and said, "Daddy the zapper is not zapping, I want to see it kill...".After an initial investigation and noticing that we did not have the normal pile of the bugs we would normal have, and the familiar sound of ZAPPPCrack!! was missing we were devastated by the fact that the Flowtron BK-40DFlowtron BK-40D Electronic Insect Killer, 1 Acre Coveragewas a victim of Karma or just poor manufacturing quality.I cannot recommend a product that does not last more than a couple of months - Do not buy this product find one that will work and give you years of bug killing excitement - to the people at Flowtron: Hire a new quality control guy, your current one sucks.
