review/summary: Great Shower Head, Great Bargainreview/text: This shower head is absolute bliss. I keep it on the "full spray" for the majority of my showers because it has such nice pressure. The rain setting is pretty weak in my opinion, but more settings means more pleasing. I enjoy the filter on the head, it leaves my skin softer and my body wash seems to now have a stronger smell. I do wonder how long the filter will last, it says 10,000 gallons of water before replacement. I could see the purchasing of many filters over time to be unnecessary spending.
