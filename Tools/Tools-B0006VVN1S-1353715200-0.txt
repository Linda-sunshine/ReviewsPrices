review/summary: Not too sure it even worksreview/text: We have terrible hard water in our area and it has dried up my hair, skin etc! I was so excited to read about these and after much research I purchased it thinking it was going to be a great solution to our hard water problems. I can't say that it is terrible as far as a showerhead but it did not do what was promised. I didn't notice any difference in my hair, definitely not on my skin and the &#34;smell&#34; as everyone described was the same too. The water pressure is good and its just an ok plain old showerhead. I will not be purchasing a replacement filter and will likely just put our old showerhead back on. Very disappointed, especially since I saw such a huge amount of rave reviews! :(
