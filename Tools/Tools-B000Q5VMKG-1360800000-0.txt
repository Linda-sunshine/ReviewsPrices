review/summary: Possibly saved our livesreview/text: Our shop was having boiler (furnace) issues...just wasn't running efficiently. It started worrying me and I thought I'd pick up a couple carbon monoxide detectors to be sure we were safe. My brother thought I was being silly. :) Anyway, plugged both in and within an hour I heard an alarm go off! We switched that one out with the other in the front room and the other went off shortly thereafter. I immediately called for service on our furnace and as soon as the serviceman walked in and hit the back production room, his alarm went off. The furnace was shut down (it was about 8 degrees outside) and space heaters kept us warm until the replacement boiler was installed. Granted the carbon monoxide was a very low level, but it had probably been poisoning the air for three-four weeks. My brother (who works in the backroom) was going home with headaches and extreme fatigue...I don't think he'll ever think I'm silly again. Thank you.
