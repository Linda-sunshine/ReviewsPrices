review/summary: Worried at firstreview/text: After reading reviews I figured the odds were in my favor that this thing would work. So first night one hour after setting it up I had a blinking light. Went to chk and no mouse. Bait was gone also. So I reset, rebaited and let it sit there all night. Checked again in the a.m. and what do you know. A mouse after the first night. Probably the little sucker going back for seconds. Was worried a little at first but now I feel good about the purchase. Well see what happens when I go home. Seems like trap I can have for years but time will tell as to the durability.Update: Three down in two days. Wonder how many more are shacking up with me. I'm about to order another
