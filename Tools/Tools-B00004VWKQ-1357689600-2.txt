review/summary: Easy, fast and sharp.review/text: I bought this product to give new life to dull knives. I think for the money, ease of use and quality of the outcome this product is amazing. I have an extensive knife collection and I use knives every day for everything from cutting rope to opening packages to prepping food to be cooked. This product sharpened knives I had recently purchased to sharper than received and also sharpened some knives I use for cooking to better than ever. Product is fast and easy to use and effective. If you need to sharpen a knife for use this is a great product. I know others feel it is an inferior product to using stones or having them professionally sharpened but as a product review this Knife Sharpener does what is needed. I mean when you can slice through a sheet of paper with a camping hatchet after using this product you know it is good. I would not recommend using this on a blade with any nicks that are fairly deep because I tried and it seems it would eventually work but takes too much time. This is where you would use a different method to get the blade nick free and then use this product to keep it sharp.
