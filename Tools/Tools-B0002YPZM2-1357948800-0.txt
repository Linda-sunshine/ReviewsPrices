review/summary: Great product, Excellent valuereview/text: These gloves are an excellent alternative to the more expensive Mechanix brand. I have used them for unloading pallets at a grocery store for the last 2 months and they have been perfect for the job. They fit nicely and even provide a bit of wrist stabilization when securely fastened (the velcro seems very secure). They have shown no signs of premature wear. I like the padding on the knuckles and they are in general very comfortable and not at all bulky. I will definitely buy again when mine finally wear out.
