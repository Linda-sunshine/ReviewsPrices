review/summary: Work nice out at the range.review/text: Good ear protection for a good price. Definitely, all that I need out at the range. The shooting range training video where I go mentions using both foam ear plugs plus an ear muff like this if you want nearly double the protection (30db + 30db = 60 db noise reduction). Good idea when shooting something really loud.
