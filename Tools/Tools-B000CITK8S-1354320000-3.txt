review/summary: AWESOME !! You will love it!review/text: I bought this model as well as a 021-0156 Battery Tender Plus together, and they are awesome. Can't say enough good about them. I had a charger from Wal-Mart for about four years. It made moderate noise from new, but kept getting louder and then started making a funky noise, then quit. In fact, I am 95% sure it fried the battery in ny C6 Corvette.These BT's make no noise that I can hear, and they use like no electricity at all. I monitor my electrical usage daily, and there has been no discernable increase in usage. I have used them for over a month now.I highly recomend Battery Tenders to anyoneDoug Finck
