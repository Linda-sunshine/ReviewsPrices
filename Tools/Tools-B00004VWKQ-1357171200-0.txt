review/summary: easy and it worksreview/text: I've used this several times now and I like it. It's really easy to use and sharpened my favorite knives so they are usable again. I'm not a chef and keep one knife just for opening packages--it had gotten so dull that it would barely go through heavy plastic wrap. I was getting ready to toss it but I sharpened it and it's back in business now. it does seem to take off more metal than I'd expect but maybe that's normal for a knife sharpener. I'm just happy to get a little more wear out of my knives and make chopping/slicing easier now that I've got sharp knives.
