review/summary: Great plug layout, but haven't used some featuresreview/text: Finally, after so many years, power strip manufacturers have figured out that *some* plugs are attached to bricks wider than a standard plug and need more room. That means that my air conditioner's plug doesn't block half the others. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, I can't say anything about the effectiveness of the surge protection, having never experienced a power surge with it yet. It is also irrelevant to me that it has plugs for phone lines (who has 'em?), but this and the coax cable protection are another nice touch.
