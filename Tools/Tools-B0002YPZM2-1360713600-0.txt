review/summary: Works with the iPhone 5review/text: Besides these fitting great a big plus to these gloves is that they work with the iPhone 5. The accuracy on the touchscreen is low and you do have to press kind of hard but you can easily slide to answer a call and after some practice you can open apps.Besides this functionality they fit great and keep my hands at a reasonable temperature while driving.
