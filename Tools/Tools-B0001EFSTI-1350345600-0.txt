review/summary: Cool little toolreview/text: This is my second Swiss Utili-Key. The first one broke at the part that connects to a key ring, so it just became a small multi-tool. I decided I'd gone long enough without having it on my key ring, so I ordered another. Just as good as the first one - it's sharp and useful in tight situations. Being a manager at a retail store, I have about 15 keys to carry on a carabiner, and this one just blends right in, and it's always on me in case I quickly need a knife or screwdriver. The only problem I have with it is that it's kind of difficult to open. I wish it had a small notch or something to help pull it apart. Overall, very satisfied!
