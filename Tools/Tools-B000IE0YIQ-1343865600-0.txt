review/summary: Do Not Buy This Productreview/text: I bought the Black & Decker ASI300 Air Station Inflator in 2007. It stopped inflating in AC mode after 2 years. Like an idiot, I bought another one because of my trust in the Black & Decker name from years ago, and thinking I got a lemon. Well, here it is 3 years later and guess what, you got it, it has stopped inflating in AC mode. First time, shame on B&D, second time shame on me. That said, please learn from my experience and do not buy this product.
