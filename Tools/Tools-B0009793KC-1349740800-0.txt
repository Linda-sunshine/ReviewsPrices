review/summary: Proved hubby wrongreview/text: Hubby thought we had a crappy ice-maker. I suggested a new filter...he thought that was bogus. 2 days after new filter, lo & behold, we had a full ice bin, after getting just a few cubes a day before. Don't trust hubby's opinion!Super quick delivery also! And, best part was that I saved 50% from the local store the Hubby went to!
