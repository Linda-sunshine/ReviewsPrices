review/summary: Works - but with helpreview/text: The screen installs easily and, when closed manually, works well. However, when simply walked through the closure doesn't close completely. That may be because of the width of my door opening being slightly more than 60." Buyers should know that if you have an opening slightly more than 60", you will have to force close the magnets as they don't quite meet without that assistance.
