review/summary: Helped Me Out A Few Timesreview/text: Always having this on my keyring has been key to its usefulness. The knife isn't the best, even after sharpening. And the bottle opener is difficult if not plain scary to use at times. But, the fact is, you will have both of them with you wherever you are. Plus, its great that this fits on your keyring and looks like a normal key so that you don't get that &#34;boy scout&#34; look a swiss army knife or the like might attract.And how many times have you wish you had one of these tools with you when you were out and about? If the answer is more than zero times, then quit dawdling and just order this now.
