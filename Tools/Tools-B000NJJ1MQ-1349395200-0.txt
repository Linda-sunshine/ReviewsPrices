review/summary: Great auto deadboltreview/text: We had a kwikset auto bolt previously and had many problems with it. This one seems to be constructed of much higher quality materials. I also love the feature: before the code is entered the outside lock just spins so there is no forcing it open. High quality. Easy to install and operate. Uses a nine volt instead of many AA's. We are very happy with this product!
