review/summary: Works great!review/text: The accusharp is a great basic sharpening tool, follow the included directions and you will end up with a decent edge on your blade without risking your fingers in the process. Won't get your blade as sharp as other methods but will get it respectfully sharp in a short amount of time without a lot of hassle.
