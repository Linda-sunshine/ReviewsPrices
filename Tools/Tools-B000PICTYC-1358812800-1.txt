review/summary: SOG tactical tomahawkreview/text: I bought this for my son. He has used it to split wood up to 4 inches in diameter. It is sharp, well constructed and does not look as if it will break any time soon. No marks on the cutting edges yet, and the handle is solid and comfortable. A good purchase.
