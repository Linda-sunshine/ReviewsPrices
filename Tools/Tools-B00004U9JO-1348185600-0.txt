review/summary: Not plug and playreview/text: Be aware of the need to wire this thing yourself. Not that big of a deal if you know how to use strippers and wire nuts, but you'll have to order that stuff separately or go to the hardware store.Not included: the little clamp that secures the wire when it enters the bottom of the housing. Really?
