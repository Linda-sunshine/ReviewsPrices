review/summary: Best Buyreview/text: This disposal was a real good price. Had to replace the one put in by the builder. I did not have to make any plumblng changes. Your situation might be different. However it was the easiest install I have done.If you have a three bolt system you dont have to buy the adapter kit if youhave a stainless steel sink. I removed my three bolt and installed this disposal with the contents of the box.Good luck!!
