review/summary: InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposerreview/text: I like it because it is working fine after installation. A couple of weeks gone and I did not have any problem. The reason behind not giving 5 is I did not get the fiber gasket that is supposed to come with the package. I had to go to the home improvement store to get one.
