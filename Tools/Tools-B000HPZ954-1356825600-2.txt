review/summary: Handles all connections.review/text: I bought this SP because so many accessories for my computer have power pack plugs and takeup all of the regular plugins. Belkin separates them so I still have plugins for regular items like lamps,stereo receivers,etc. It works great for me. Most surge protectors are useless if you have several items with power packs, so this is your answer.
