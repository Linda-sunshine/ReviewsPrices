review/summary: Easy to Install, Smart Design, Great Valuereview/text: I am impressed with the ease of installation and smart design of this disposal. I was a bit nervous to replace my old 1/2 hp Kenmore, but it really needed to be retired. I bought this Waste King based on buyer reviews and felt like if the vast majority of buyers gave it 5 stars then it was probably worth a try. I opened the package and read the instructions thoroughly twice to make sure I could install it in one shot. It only required a screwdriver and a hack saw (to trim the waste pipe). I appreciated the detailed instructions that explained the possible ways my old disposal was attached to the sink and a step-by-step for removing it. The putty-less installation in my stainless steel sink was really straight-forward and simple. My eleven year old son helped me do it in about 20 minutes. I wasn't sure from other reviews and the product description whether or not it would come with a power cord. It did. I can't think of any negative points regarding this product. It is twice the motor of my old one and makes half the noise. It is taller than my old one, but I had plenty of room under the sink so it was no trouble. I recommend it :)
