review/summary: It really works!review/text: My cat has become useless for catching mice... He plays with them, they run away, and they continue to poop everywhere and make holes.. They ate the peanut butter out of the old traditional traps. After I read the reviews, I decided to try this trap. The first day (today), the light was flashing when I got home.. There were two dead mice in there! Awesome! I'm not sure how many mice we have still running around, but I might buy another one.
