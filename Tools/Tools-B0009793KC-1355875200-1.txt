review/summary: Much Better Price!review/text: This is the exact filter our refrigerator came with, at a fraction of the price of appliance stores. Sometimes you have to use pliers if the old filter doesn't turn easily. Just protect the plastic cover with an old rag so the pliers don't damage the plastic on the refrigerator and twist counterclockwise. Be sure to run a gallon or so through a pitcher before drinking and put the clear reminder sticker inside the door so you will know when it is time to change the filter again.
