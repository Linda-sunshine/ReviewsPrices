review/summary: Water taste greatreview/text: Took about 3 mins to install. At first run of the tap, smoke can be seen due to water passing through the filter then some black stuff, again from the filter. Just run for 5 mins and that will all clear up. 200 gal can pass through this unit before replacement. Replacement filters are cheap on Amazon just $11 bucks. This unit goes over $20 at retail stores saved half of that using Amazon. Great product!!! Fast shipping though Prime membership!!!
