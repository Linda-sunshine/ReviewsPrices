review/summary: Works pretty well...review/text: This is a really cool product, especially with my little dog running in and out all of the time. I live in an apartment and didn't want to pay to install a screen door and then have to leave it when I move. When I walk through it, it will close again, but when my dog goes through it, sometimes it doesn't close as she may go out the wrong side and the magnents are on apposing sides. The landlord had my apartment repainted and they pulled the velcro off of the sides of my door and the paint came along with it so the velcro is no longer good, I have to figure out how I am going to replace that so that I can continue to use the screen.
