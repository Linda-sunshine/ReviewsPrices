review/summary: Good, but...review/text: I definitely noticed a difference in the quality of the water (i'm dark-skinned and the shower water left white deposits on my skin), but i can tell that not everything is filtered out because i still see some deposits on my skin after a shower with the Culligan. Otherwise, i do like the different shower settings and it is definitely an upgrade from our last shower head.
