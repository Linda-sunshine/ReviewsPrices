review/summary: Easy install (no adapter needed). Powerful but makes a clank sound when starting up.review/text: Installation was easy and I didn't need an adapter, putty, or a second person. I installed it in less than an hour (I'm a first-timer) and it seems to work well so far. It's about the same noise level as my 1/3 horsepower insinkerator that crapped out after 4.5 years. I got this in large part because of the lifetime warranty. You can't beat the power of this for the low price of just over $100.When I flip the switch to start it, it has this brief clanking sound as the blades begin to spin. The two blades inside spin loosely and slap against a raised nob, which makes the noise when you start the thing up. It's not so bad that I will return it, but just something to be aware of. I tested it by shoving several celery stalks down it and it ate them up quickly, so it's powerful. All in all, if you want something super quiet, you'll likely have to spend a lot more money but you would want to get something else. If you just want the least expensive 1hp garbage disposal on the market with piece of mind (in the lifetime warranty), then this is for you.Small tip: make sure to check for leaks. When I ran it the first time and looked underneath, the connecting pipe (with the rubber gasket) wasn't completely centered on the hole of the Waste King and it had a small leak. Once I centered it DIRECTLY over the hole, with equal coverage over all of it (we're talking millimeters in difference between centered and leakable), no leak.
