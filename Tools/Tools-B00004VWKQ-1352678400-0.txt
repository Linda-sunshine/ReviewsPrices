review/summary: Functional and Inexpensive toolreview/text: This product is simple and very easy to use. The instructions were easy to understand. You don't have to have any really skill to use this, you just drag it along the blade with very very light pressure, and this bad boy does the rest. Don't expect scalpel sharpness, but it works well enough to get the blade sharp enough to cut through paper easily.
