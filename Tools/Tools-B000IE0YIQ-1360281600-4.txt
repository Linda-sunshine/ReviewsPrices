review/summary: This thing is GREAT!review/text: Used it today for the first time. It runs on AC. It runs on DC. It comes with a variety of attachments that snap onto or into the shell so you won't lose them. Best of all, you set the dial to the pressure you want, start it up, and it shuts off when it gets there. Much to my surprise, it forms a great and easy seal on the tires. Should have had one of these years ago. WELL worth the price.
