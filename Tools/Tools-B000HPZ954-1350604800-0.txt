review/summary: Saved!review/text: A car accident caused a transformer to blow resulting in a massive surge with lots of popping and smoking all over my house. I just knew I was going to be replacing all my electronics. Although my Belkin surge protectors are fried, NONE of the appliances plugged into them suffered any damage. My neighbors used a lesser protection and had much more extensive damage.
