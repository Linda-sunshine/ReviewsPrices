review/summary: Great Concept, but Not Accurate with Newer Electronic Loadsreview/text: This product is a great concept. It works well with old-style loads like incandescent lamps and conventional electric motors. However, I have found it to be inaccurate with devices containing electronic power supplies, like CFL lights. It may work with a pure sine inverter, but is probably not accurate with a &#34;modified sine wave&#34; inverter. As an electrical engineer, I have some knowledge about things like this. But to be clear, I have not run extensive scientific tests on this device.
