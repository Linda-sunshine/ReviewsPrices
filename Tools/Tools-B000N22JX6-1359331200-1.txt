review/summary: Nice, Attractive, and very warm.review/text: I needed a quick order to warm my house. Bought two of these and love them. They heat well, and have thermostats which are very nicely tuned. It warms my heart to know that I can trust this heater to deliver heat and shut off at the correct temperature so that the bite from the cold won't bite my family even when I leave for work. It's better than central heating in my opinion because it delivers the right heat at the right time in the right place. The oscillator is a plus as well as remote controls. The only thing I would change is to have the ability to place the thermocouple higher in the room. The heater sits on the floor so it is always cooler there.
