review/summary: Wasting your money...review/text: Good old fashion traps seems to work the best. I have had this Victor Electronic Mouse Trap for 3 months now, and haven't caught one rodent in it. I even looked online to make sure I have everything set up correctly.Yes, the old fashion traps are pretty disgusting. I HATE dealing with dead things... But, if you throw a puppy pad under the trap, you don't have to really look at it, touch it, or even clean up anything. They're quick and get the job done.Don't waste you money like I did!!!
