review/summary: Great storage item for brooms and mopsreview/text: I had looked around the big box hardware stores for a similar product, and couldn't find one I liked. I saw this one, and for the price, I figured we'd try it. I'm quite pleased with how well it fits behind the laundry room door. It keeps our broom, mop, swiffer wet jet, and duster neat and out of the way. We'll see how well it holds up, but for now, I'm very happy with my purchase.
