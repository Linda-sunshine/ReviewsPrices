review/summary: Belkin is best company for surger protectionreview/text: Just because Belkin is the best company doesn't mean you won't have problems. Make sure you read the paperwork and notify the company ASAP if something stops working right or the green protection light goes out--companies are very picky about repairing these...had one go out on telephone line but protected light is still lit. FOR THIS SPECIFIC ONE, MAKE SURE YOU REALIZE THERE IS NO ETHERNET PROTECTION, only phone, power, and cable TV.
