review/summary: Saves moneyreview/text: Bought due to ratings and it is worth it. Just bought my 2nd filter, in fact I have it set on automatic shipment in 2 months and I get like a $2 discount. I recall reading 10000 gallons or 3 months until replacement. Since I'll never be able to measure 10000 gallons 3 months sounds good, except I use it a lot and noticed at about 2.5 months that water was tasting like tap so I'd say every 2 months is good.
