review/summary: Works as describedreview/text: This product was delivered on time and was easy to install. The directions had lots of illustrations and was easy to follow. The replacement of the existing disposal went well and only took about an hour. It is quite a bit larger, but was not too heavy. It was a little noisy, but after using it a few times, it quieted down. Overall it is a good product. We will see how it holds up over time.
