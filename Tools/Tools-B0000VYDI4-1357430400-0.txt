review/summary: The swiss-army knife of ladders!review/text: After reading reviews for Werner and the major brands, I elected for the Werner. It's a great ladder and I find it easy to configure into different configurations. It's like a swiss army knife! I do suggest getting theWerner AC19-2 Extension Ladder Coversto protect your walls.As other reviewers have mentioned, this ladder is heavy. It is 300-pound rated and uses a heavy-grade aluminum. One man can carry it, but you're not going to sling it over your shoulder like a 6' consumer grade model. I'm a short-to-average guy, medium-build and I can handle it just fine. The weight is most noticeable as an extension ladder, as you have 25 pounds or so above center. Fully extended, this ladder could get away from you if you're not prepared. If you're planning to use it as a full-extension, work in a clear area, set the extension while on the ground and then raise. If needed, have a helper around.Great ladder. Would absolutely buy again.
