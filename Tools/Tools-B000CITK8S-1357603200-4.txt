review/summary: No worries with this chargerreview/text: I have antique cars and my batteries were always going dead before their time. This maintains and prolongs the life of your battery. Cheaper than buying new batteries. I plug it in and connect it to my batteries in the winter and never have to worry about overcharging or battery going dead. If you have to start the vehicle in the winter, the engine spins over like a brand new battery. The light indicator shows if you have it connected wrong, and lets you know what the charging status is. I recommend highly.
