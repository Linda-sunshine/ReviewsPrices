review/summary: Amazing...review/text: I didn't expect this to work for so low a price, but I was simply amazed at how well it gets the job done. There's not much more to say other than that it works exactly as described: two or three swipes and the knife is like new. I restored a 30 year old knife with 8 swipes, 3 swipes for knives of more recent vintage. Unbelievable.
