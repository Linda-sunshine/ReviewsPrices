review/summary: Defective filterreview/text: I usually buy my filters at my local hardware store and have always been happy with them.I decided to order one this time.I do not know what the difference is but I must have gotten a bad one.i have run about 10 gallons of water thru to try to get some kind of lint out of the filtered water.This is strange if I had not threw the box away I would return it,this one is defective.
