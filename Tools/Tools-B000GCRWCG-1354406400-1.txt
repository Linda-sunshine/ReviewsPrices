review/summary: love themreview/text: you can use these for anything heat or anti heat related. build a shelter line the walls with it to help deflect your fire toward you and keep the area around you warm. good use in an emergency situation to stay warm, dry, to attract attention for help, to hide from bees you name it. not a good item if u want to stay hidden from someone kinda reflects the light....a lot
