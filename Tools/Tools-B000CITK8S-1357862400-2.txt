review/summary: Battery tender brand is a quality product. I have 3 on 3 different tractorsreview/text: I have it connected top my tractor and it keeps my battery fully charged. I have the batter tender brand on 3 different tractors. They have been hooked to the battery and each tractor starts with ease this winter (2012-2013). We have not had a severe winter but the batteries are fully charges and the tractors start.
