review/summary: Good but not greatreview/text: It got really cold (negative 10) and quit working. I could hear it click when I typed the code but it wouldn't catch either for locking or unlocking. The key wouldn't work for unlocking the door either. Luckily I could open the garage to get in. Once it warmed up a bit it started working again.
