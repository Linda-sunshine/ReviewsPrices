review/summary: Terrific!review/text: Does what its meant to do and does it well. Sharpens knives in less than a dozen strokes.I use this at home and have been using it for more than 2 years now (have not felt the need to replace the blades yet.. our knives usage is limited to cutting fruits and vegetables.. no meat).
