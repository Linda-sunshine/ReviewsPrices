review/summary: nice pressure, all the usuable settingsreview/text: This showerhead surprised me with the looks and features for the price. The flow is perfect for an enjoyable shower and it has the most usable and practical functions and settings. I like the rain style for general use and the harder concentrated center spray for beating on neck knots and rinsing hair quickly. It is a quality piece at a great price.
