review/summary: Poorly designed!!review/text: It does work, but is Poorly designed!! Using the a/c power, the d/c cord has to be removed from it's storage to get to the on switch. Very inconvenient! The a/c cord and the air hose should both be about 6 feet longer. Who wants to get out an extension cord every time they want to plug it in? The coupler on the air hose is very flimsy, cheap and can't last long. The previous model air station was so superior to the new one and it was made in the USA! It was a/c power only but had long cords and hoses and wrap around storage for them. The switch was easy to get to. That thing was used almost daily, like any other home appliance. New one needs re-designed again to be much more user friendly, and made with better quality materials, such as a metal coupler and re-in-forced air hose. Sorry, I just think a company like Black & Decker could have done worlds better. Thanks!ProsAc or dc poweredConsAc cord is way too shortAir hose is way too short
