review/summary: Amazing!review/text: This Black & Decker inflator is awesome!! It does its job very well, no hassle whatsoever. It doesn't weigh much, it is very easy to use and to understand, also, it is very efficient. However, if there may be a flaw, it is that it makes quiet of a strange loud sound whenever one turns it on; but many automatic inflators do so, if not all. This is a great buy, will recommend to anyone!!
