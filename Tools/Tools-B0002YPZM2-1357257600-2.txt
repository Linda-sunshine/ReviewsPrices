review/summary: Not Smallreview/text: As a woman who does construction work I was excited to find a quality looking work glove in a small size. Unfortunately I will be returning them because &#34;small&#34; is still way too big for my small hands. I wouldn't be able to pick up nails, open my tape measure, etc. while wearing these because of the extra half inch on the end of every finger. If you have bigger hands this may work, but just realize the &#34;small&#34; isn't very small. (For reference, my pointer finger is 2 1/4 inches long and I can span 7 inches thumb to pinky. These gloves were about one size too big for me.)
