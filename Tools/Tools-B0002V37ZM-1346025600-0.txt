review/summary: Works Well So Farreview/text: We purchased this gadget about a month ago and so far, it is working very well. It is awesome for helping organize/tidy our brooms and mops. My only complaint is that the slots are kind of close together, and we have to stagger the height of each item so that the wide parts (i.e. broom or mop head) can fit.
