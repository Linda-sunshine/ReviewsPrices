review/summary: Needs a photocell & timerreview/text: The unit works real well. However, if you plug it in into a non-switched power outlet, you will need to buy a separate photocell timer to install inline between the unit and the power socket so that its not on 24/7. I didn't know that until I opened the shipping box.
