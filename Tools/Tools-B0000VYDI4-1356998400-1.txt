review/summary: Awesome Ladderreview/text: I bought this ladder to repair the ceiling and other hard-to-reach places where your standard ladder wouldn't suffice. This is a great ladder - a little on the heavy-side, but overall it is versatile, sturdy and will definitely be put to good use. It is especially easy to work with on stairs and the adjustability is key.
