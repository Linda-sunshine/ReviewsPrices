review/summary: Best $$ we have spent in awhilereview/text: I would buy this product again in a heartbeat. It is well made and looks very expensive. The convenience of having the keypad is AMAZING! No more fumbling for my keys with a toddler on my hip and grocery bags in my hands, no more taking keys on a run, no more ever being locked out. My husband says the same thing...one of our best purchases!
