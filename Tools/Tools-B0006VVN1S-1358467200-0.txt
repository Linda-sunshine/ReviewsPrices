review/summary: Great for eczema-prone skin!!!review/text: I've had this shower head for 3 years now. I've been suffering from eczema for about 10 years and this was my cure. I'm so serious! Once I got this shower head and continued using my sensitive skin soaps and lotions, I stopped seeing eczema on my skin for a good year. Of course, once the filter ran out, I noticed my skin was becoming irritated again. That's how I knew for sure that it was the filtered water! The only reason why I've given this 4 stars versus the full 5 is because I noticed that my shower head has gotten kind of loose after 3 years. I've tried to tighten it up myself but no success. Maybe there's something in there that I need to replace... idk, I'll have someone else look at it. Either way, I'm on my way to purchase another filter because my eczema is flaring up again. I pretty much have to replace it once a year since I'm the only one who uses my shower. Awesome investment! :)
