review/summary: Not bad, but not great eitherreview/text: Works good, light and easy to install without any leaks, so meets expectations there. minus two stars for having a small throat, there is no way I can get my hand down there to clear a jam or remove unwanted objects, and I'm not happy about having to get my 11 year old to stick his hand down there. Also not too pumped about how it sucks things down, which is not at all. I have one in my old house that would suck anything right off of the rubber once it fell into the throat, I like that, this one won't suck anything down unless you jam it down through the rubber, which means jamming a wood spoon down into the disposal all the time. Its just a matter of time before it gets down too far and into the blades.
