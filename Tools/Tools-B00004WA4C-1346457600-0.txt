review/summary: smoke/co2 detectorreview/text: it appears to be working as advertised. I now know that it has a lifespan of 7 years. I called Kidde customer service re the model that I owned. It started beeping 7 years and 2 months after purchase. This info is buried in the bowels of the documentation. Purchased the same model that I previouslyowned.
