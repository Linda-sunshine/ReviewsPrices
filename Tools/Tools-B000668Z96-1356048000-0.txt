review/summary: Uselessreview/text: I don't have a flea infested animal. What I have is a senile landlady who rents to anyone, including people scamming off section 8 housing without doing any background checks or she would have known her new tenants moved into the building to escape a flea infestation they caused in their previous building. It did not take long for their 3 flea infested cats to infest the entire building including shared hallways, basement, my apartment and the upstairs apartments. Funny how people who can not afford to take care of one pet always have to have 2 or 3. I am pretty sure that having to pick 30-40 fleas off my feet per day qualifies as a severe infestation, but these traps caught nothing but a beetle, which was able to free itself after less than 2 hours of being trapped on the glue pad. Do not waste your money on these traps. Unfortunately I wasted quite a bit buying one for each and every room. Also to the many people who think fleas are attracted to your white socks... Fleas could not care less what color socks you wear. They are attracted to you, not your socks. It is your body heat and the vibrations when you walk across the floor that makes them jump on you. It is only that they are more visible against white. Just because you can not see fleas on your black socks does not mean they aren't there.
