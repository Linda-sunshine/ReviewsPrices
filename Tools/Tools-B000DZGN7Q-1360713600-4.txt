review/summary: Good Unitreview/text: I purchased this unit as it was recommended by Consumer reports and got a great price on Amazon. This was a replacement unit for a Kenmore waste disposal already installed. What I learned from changing brands is that the dimensions of the Waste King and the Kenmore are different and it was very difficult to realign the drainage pipes. Had to use a flexible discharge pipe to make connection to drain pipe. If I had it to do over again I would probably get the Kenmore unit so it would be a &#34;drop in&#34; and easier to install. If its a brand new install I would go with the Consumer Reports recommendation.
