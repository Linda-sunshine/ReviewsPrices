review/summary: High Maintenance for the Bug Zapper Flowtron BK-150review/text: The product effectively kills many bugs each night as the light attracts mostly small moths and other flying insects including a few mosquitoes. However, these bugs stick to the electrified vertical rods that kills them and cause prolonged sparking. Each morning I have to us a thin wooden stick to remove 20 or 30 dead bugs from the bars to be ready for the next night. Using a hair dryer to try to blow the bugs off the vertical bars is not effective in removing the bugs. I have the device on a timer so it only operates from dusk to dawn which is a help, but it requires purchasing a fairly expensive time with a three prong plug so the bug killing device can be properly grounded. I also have a bug killer that operates with the same type of UV lights and a fan the sucks the bugs into a screened collection collection bin. This does not require any maintenance except the bug bin needs to be emptied ever couple of months. Both devices are effective at killing many insects--perhaps the zapper kills more but the extra maintenance is a big draw back.
