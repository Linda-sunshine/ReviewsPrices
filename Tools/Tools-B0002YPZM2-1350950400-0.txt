review/summary: keeps your palms from getting sorereview/text: These gloves are very comfortable and worked really well with keeping my hands from getting sore. If you have used a drill for a long period of time and you get that soreness in the palm of your hand these gloves do a great job.The only negatives is the fact that you cannot wash the gloves in the machine, and the dexterity grabbing small things like screws and staples is crap.For general use though, fantastic.
