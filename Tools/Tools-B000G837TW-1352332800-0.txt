review/summary: InSinkerator Evolution compact 3/4 garbage disposalreview/text: Can anyone really get excited about a garbage disposal, its something you need and once installed its kinda forgotten. But this thing is kinda cool. The evolution replaced our basic Insinkerator model which had failed. The decrease in noise and vibration was amazing, just a barely noticeable hum when running and it does seem to process waste faster. Have not had the courage to place a large load of potato skins just yet, an item our base model had trouble with.Installation was a breeze, current plumbing just required a slight shift in position with no cutting. The one issue is that due to the sound proofing insulation the device is larger taking up a bit more space under the counter. Prices were comparable to big box stores.The cost of the evolution models is more than the base models, but if you can swing it the difference is noticeable and worth the added cost.
