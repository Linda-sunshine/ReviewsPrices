review/summary: Fantastic Lockreview/text: This lock is great. It replaces an older generation combo lock we had installed 5 years ago. This one is more compact, seems more solid and has an great looking metal cover that matches the lock hardware. Installed easily in 5 minutes, works well and the lighted keys make entry at night a breeze. It arrived from Amazon as ordered in good condition and ahead of schedule. With shipping and taxes, I saved $50 over the retail at my local big orange box store.
