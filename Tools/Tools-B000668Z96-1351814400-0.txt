review/summary: little allien spaceshipsreview/text: This last summer we have a heavy invasion of fleas in our town,but not having much prior experience with fleas, I bought someflea powder at the market. It may have made the little critterscough or sneeze, but it certainly didn't encourage them to leavenor did it kill them.Then I hit the internet and local pet store to buy combs, sprays,shampoo, vitamins, essential oils, etc. The house and dog smelledbetter after all of this, but then so did the fleas. They were notplanning on leaving any time soon.I finally ordered 5 of these space-ship looking flea traps forour daughter's house as well as our place. They do look prettystrange, but they are good night lights, and they really seemto work. There are NO fleas on our dog, nor anywhere in ourhouse except in the catchers. They seemed to like these litup flea traps better than our pets. We even caught a few othersmall bugs who were attracted to the light, so we will takethese in our camper next year too. Mosquitoes see us comingand prepare for a feast. Maybe these traps will entice themaway from us.Anyway, they say what they do and do what they say withoutany bad odors, chemicals, or environmental harm. What elsecould one ask for in an anti flea product? These are great.
