review/summary: So far great... OH YEAH, THEY FORGOT TO MENTIONreview/text: I bought this item and installed it a wk ago and man, it's much quieter than the crappy Badger that broke down on me with barely any use. I've been abusing this new one since I juice a lot and don't really care to compost any of the pulp.NOW THE REASON WHY I GAVE THIS 2/5 INSTEAD OF A 4/5 STARS. THE DESCRIPTION FORGETS TO TELL YOU THAT YOU NEED TO PURCHASE A EFFING PLUG. Ok, so I'm a total noob but that's why I wanted something I can install on my own and this was it. Now I didn't realize this until halfway through the installation and realized "Oh, where the hell is the plug? Does this garbage disposal work with inductive charging? Maybe I got a defective unit... Oh what the f---... I need to buy it separately."Why not just include it and charge the $10.99 more for it. I would've preferred that. So I go down to Lowe's that night and they decide that starting that night, they'd be closing one hour early, which means by the time I get there, they were closed and I was "late" by 4 minutes.Thanks InSinkerator, your product is great once I got it installed and running but I'm not paying for a gd puzzle. Just throw in the plug and charge more for it.
