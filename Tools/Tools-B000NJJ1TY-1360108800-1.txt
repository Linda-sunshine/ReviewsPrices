review/summary: PERFECTreview/text: Very easy to install, works flawlessly and unlike other units you can set it to 'open' so once you close the door you don't have to enter the code each time (a common complaint with other models). This thing is great. I had to change the handle orientation, it just slides off and back on, too easy!
