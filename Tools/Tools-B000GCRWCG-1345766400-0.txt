review/summary: SPACE BLANKETSreview/text: Some reviewers say they only got one blanket. I got all ten. They came individually wrapped in their own ziplock-style bags, which is pretty cool. It's really the best price you'll find on space blankets as well, if you need more than one. As for quality, it's a space blanket. You really can't expect that much, it's not what it was designed for. They are supposed to be one-time use products. If you're careful with them you can expect several more uses, but they weren't really intended for that. It's kind of like buying plastic disposable cups for a cookout. Sure you CAN get more than one use, but they weren't really intended for that.Bottom line, this is a great deal.
