review/summary: Awesome for European Hornetsreview/text: We have had the 80-watt unit for exactly a year now, and are still enthusiastic about our purchase. It has killed more moths and mosquitoes for us than we count. We also had European hornets move in last year, and we couldn't find the nest to call pest control. First we got the smaller 40-watt Stinger, but it was only stunning the Europeans and we'd go out the next morning and watch them revive themselves from the ground and fly away. Then we got serious and set the Flowtron up in the flight path to our lilac tree, and we were killing 20-30 a night. Unfortunately, we must have bionic hornets because even the Flowtron was only killing about half and just stunning the rest. What works the best for us is to have a tub full of water and Dawn dish liquid underneath it so when the stunned ones drop, they then drown. It must be Dawn dish liquid in the watery grave, though, because other brands don't work. There is something about the de-greasing capabilities of Dawn dish liquid that breaks down their waxy protective coating on their bodies and wings and gets into their respiratory system so even if they don't drown they still die.This year we are having trouble again, so we set up the Flowtron again with our Dawn water bucket underneath and have resumed enjoying our patio at night. After being terrorized by these buggers for two Indian summers now, the carnage is pure pleasure. It's a safer solution for us than spraying Delta Dust or Drione dust because we have a toddler that also likes to play outside.If you are having a European hornet problem, I highly recommend this product.
