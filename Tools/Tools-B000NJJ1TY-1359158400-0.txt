review/summary: This product is awesome!review/text: Have always wanted to try one of these, but had some concerns based on some reviews I read.First, it is super easy to install. I think it took about five minutes to put in.Second, I have had it in for about six months now and not seeing any issues with battery life, so that hasn't been an issue at all.Third, i installed this on the door inside the garage to the house. With everyone running in and out all the time, I always hated how we often left the door unlocked as we were in the yard (often the backyard). Now that worry is gone as the door is always locked when it shuts.Fourth, we can go out for a walk around the neighborhood and not bring any keys - I really like that aspect too.I love this product and feel it has made a significant safety and convenience improvement to our lives.
