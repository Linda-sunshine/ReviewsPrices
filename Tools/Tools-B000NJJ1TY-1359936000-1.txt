review/summary: Great Productreview/text: This is a great lock. We installed it in our door leading to the garage after my wife and I got locked out a number of times. This is a great solution...no key needed just a simple code to unlock. Has the ability for a number of codes with different times of access...you can also turn off the code feature and require a key if you are going away, etc. It took about 20 minutes to install, excellent directions...highly recommend this.
