review/summary: Wish I had put this in sooner!review/text: I had to replace the original unit that was put in when our house was built. It was an old ge brand unit. I did some research and finally pulled the plug on this. I have to say I made a great choice. This unit is everything it claims and more. It is quiet and it is strong. I have a stainless sink and it is very quiet. Installing the unit was easy. Everything I needed was included. You do not have to buy anything extra. Now, it is a larger unit if you have something that was cheap and was installed as a standard unit so be aware of that. But that is what you get when you upgrade to a much higher quality unit with much more horse power. You may have to adjust length of the drain coming off of the unit so be aware of that, but it was simple to do with a hack saw. It took all of 1 hour to remove my old unit and install this one. I purchased my unit from warehouse deals and it was brand new in package by the way, so if you are looking that route to save some money I would recommend trying it out.
