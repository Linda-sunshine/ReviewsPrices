review/summary: WKL-8000review/text: Fast delivery! It comes with a power cord attached therefore I needed to rewire dedicated line to an outlet (30 minutes). About 60 minutes, 2/3 refreshments and the availability of a friends hands later we were able to attach the disposer to flange...what a pain! Once attached I was able to check the noise level....6/10 (10 = V. Quiet) and a normal conversation could be had...my belief is once the granite counter top and sink is acquired the noise level should be reduced to a 9/10. The WKL-8000 is definitely powerful and as of 6 weeks of use the only problem I'VE HAD WAS THE DISHWASHER DRAIN CAME UNDONE...pushed it back on this time as far as it would go and "reefed" compression band...NO PROBLEM SINCE!!!!I purchased this unit because of the Lifetime Warranty...don't want to change the thing after the new granite counter tops are installed!
