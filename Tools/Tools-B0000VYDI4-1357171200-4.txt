review/summary: Werner Ladderreview/text: My husband used the ladder for our Christmas lights this year. He felt much safer on this ladder, verses the regular ladder. It has much more support on on-even ground. The only complaint is it was kinda awkward for his to handle alone, when setting the different positions he needed.
