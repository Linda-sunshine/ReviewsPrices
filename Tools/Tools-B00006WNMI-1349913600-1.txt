review/summary: Great Faucet Filterreview/text: Length:: 2:00 MinsThe Culligan Faucet Filter is just perfect for what I needed. I live in an apartment and wanted a water filter but didn't want to clutter my fridge with a pitcher and wasn't about to change the plumbing to put one in. This is really nice. I use the filtered water to fill my Keurig so there isn't any type of buildup in it. There is no funny taste to this and is cheap. The filters run about $12. I recommend doing the Amazon Subscribe and Save on them so you don't have to remember when you bought a filter last and it takes it down to the $10 range.Culligan FM-15RA Level 3 Faucet Filter Replacement CartridgeMy video shows the filter and how to operate it. It looks alright and does lose some pressure but that's as expected when filtering your water, it's not too bad. Overall if you want filtered water or live in a place where the water isn't safe to drink I'd recommend this over buying plastic water bottles. It's cheaper and you can just fill your own bottle up every day.
