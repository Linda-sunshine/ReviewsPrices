review/summary: Still using incandescent? Upgrade NOW!review/text: I had a nearly identical 2-D Maglite for the last 20 years. People would tell me I should upgrade to the LED versions when we'd go on camping trips. The early ones were pretty gimicky. But slowly they started getting better and better replicating the quality of good incandescent flashlights.Still, my trusty old Maglite worked. Why upgrade?Why? Because these things are awesomely bright and make my old flashlight look like a joke, while providing longer battery life in a nearly identical package... that's why. I'm kicking myself for not upgrading sooner. Do it now, you won't be disappointed.
