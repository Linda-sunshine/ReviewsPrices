review/summary: First step in saving me $$ on my power bill.review/text: I purchased two of these so that I can ascertain my power consumption in key locations within my home. I intend to start purchasing solar and wind power generators in a grid tie scenario in an effort to off set some of my power usage and in turn cut down on my power bill.You can't really know where to start unless you know what you are really using and where you are using it at, This device will do just that.I didn't just plug it in to get quick numbers, I left each unit plugged in for a minimum 24 hours to gather data for an entire days usage.All I can say is that it works and you will be surprised at what power you are using and what power you are not.
