review/summary: Sturdy and light!review/text: I recently bought a house, and I didn't have a ladder to clean the gutters out. Saw this on sale, and figured I'd give it a shot. It is very versatile, since you can have it as an A-frame or a straight ladder. It's surprisingly light for its size. The mechanism takes a little getting used to, but once you have it down, it's no problem. Also, It's only 13' fully extended, so make sure you know how high you need to go.
