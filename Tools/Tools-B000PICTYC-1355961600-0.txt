review/summary: Very good hawk!review/text: What else can you expect from SOG? They just make good stuff. Strong, very well constructed. I can't say that it was razor sharp out of the box, but that was an easy remedy. Anyone who has ever owned this type of weapon knows they will eventually have to re-sharpen it. So that really wasn't a problem. It was sharp, but just not as sharp as I like it. All in all, I'm very happy with it, and recommend it.
