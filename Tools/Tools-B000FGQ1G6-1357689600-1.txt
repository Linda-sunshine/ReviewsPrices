review/summary: Works great.review/text: I bought this to open up my macbook to switch the memory and I have found multiple uses for it. The screwdriver is magnetized so it is easy to pick up dropped screws and get into hard to reach areas. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to open up their computer or has a pair of glasses that need to be fixed up.
