review/summary: Smoke & burning plastic smellreview/text: Lights on the surge protector came on for a few seconds, then I started smelling burning plastic with smoke. Lights went off. I'm sure there'll be no problem getting a replacement, Amazon are pretty awesome that way. But still kind of worrying. Makes me wonder the safety of the other belkin outlets I have around my apartment.
