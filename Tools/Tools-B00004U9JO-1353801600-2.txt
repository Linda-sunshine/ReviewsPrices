review/summary: leaks from bottom shortly after warranty expirationreview/text: It's been said over and over. Insinkerator garbage disposal products are designed to fail. Add my experience to the list of anecdotal evidence. This is my second one gone bad. I have a couple of rental units and it sucks when a disposal fails out the bottom of the casing or the bolt on the bottom. Tenants do not always notice or call immediately leading to further damage of cabinetry. Do not be lulled into buying another Badger just because you know the installation will work well with your existing set-up. I am switching to waste king. I give it two stars rather than one cause it was relatively inexpensive and they did at least last a few years.
