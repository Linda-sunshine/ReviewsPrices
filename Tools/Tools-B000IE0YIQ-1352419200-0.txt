review/summary: great if you can diy the fusereview/text: 3 years good working until yesterday it blew the fuse (AC).Yes, the DC still works fine using the car battery. But,I just can't accept not using its AC mode which probably is morepowerful than the DC.Goolgled for a fix that bypasses the internal fuse and drillsa hole on the back cover by installing a fuse holder so thatnext time a fuse blow would be fixed by replacing the fuse inthe holder without taking the machine apart.The blown fuse seems to be caused by bad connection when I connectthe nozzle to my car's tire valve stem. Make sure: when the connectionis made, the pin inside the valve stem is depressed - that means, theair inside the tire is open to the pump. Otherwise, like in my case,the pin is not depressed fully, and the pump inflates nothing more than acul de sac, boom! the pump motor can hardly rotate when air can't get out,which leads to the current hike in the coils that drive the motor - fuseis blown right away to protect from overheating the motor. So, whateverinflation you wanna do, make sure you hear the hissing sound before the airtunnel is firmly connected.After I took it apart, its internal components have seen moderate use.gears are made of plastic. Since it's mostly intended for just few times a year,I expect to last at least a few more years.
