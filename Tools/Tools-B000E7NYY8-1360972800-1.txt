review/summary: Works better than expected.review/text: Bought this unit to control a room heater in my daughter&#8217;s room. The thermostat built into the small heater would literally cook her before it shut off. The Lux WIN100 solved the problem perfectly. Remember that the unit itself uses batteries and set the off switch on the side to the ON position and you will have no problems. The unit keeps the room within 2 degrees of my programmed parameters and this allows my 6 month old daughter from freezing or sweating to death and sleep soundly.I recommend this product if you need to control any heating or cooling device or fan.
