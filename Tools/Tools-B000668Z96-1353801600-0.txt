review/summary: did the job!review/text: I had a flea problem in my basement. I was using foggers and sprays every weekfor about 6 weeks, and not getting anywhere. So I purchased one of these to seeif it would work, and it does. Within 2 days I had to replace the trap. I would saythe problem was resolved in 2 weeks. I still keep it on in my basement and havecaught spiders and centipedes, so I will definitely continue to use this and skip theexpensive sprays and foggers as they are no longer needed.
