review/summary: Very Nice Purchasereview/text: We've been shopping for keyless locks for about a year. Found this one on Amazon for about $25 cheaper than an identical one at Lowe's. Needed exactly one tool to install (a generic cross-tip screwdriver) and was done in less than 30 minutes. Took another 5 minutes to program 6 or 7 codes. It looks great and feels very sturdy. Could not be more happy with it.
