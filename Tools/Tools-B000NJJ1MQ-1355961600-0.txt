review/summary: Easy installreview/text: I replaced a traditional keyed deadbolt, it was an easy install BUT it just barely fit above the handset mounted below it, not sure if it is a Schlage issue or one for who cut the original holes in the door! It is easy to use and works great, now my wifey and I lock the door!!
