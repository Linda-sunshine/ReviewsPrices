review/summary: Easy to install, but becomes slow.review/text: Pros:- Very easy to install. None of those installation problems that Brita has, which is quite significant actually, thus 4 stars.Cons:- Does tend to become slow after about a month of use. Then you have to put your cup underneath it and go do something else and then come back.- Doesn't change the water taste too much. Gets rid of the edge, but keeps the flavor, so if you're okay with your water's flavor, then that's good.
