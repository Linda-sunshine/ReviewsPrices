review/summary: Worked fastreview/text: I had a mouse move into my apartment after Sandy and I tried to catch it but no luck. I set down traps where the mouse goes in but doesn't come out and used peanut butter but the silly thing would still pop out from under my couch and stare at me. I ordered this out of desperation since I typically don't like to kill mice. After 1 day the green light was flashing indicating the mouse was inside. I haven't seen any signs of more mice but keep this in the kitchen just in case. If you don't mind a kill trap this one works perfectly.
