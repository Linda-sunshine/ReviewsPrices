review/summary: Two out of three failed to workreview/text: I purchased three of these, but when we installed them, one would not take the code. Two days later, a second one stopped working. I contacted Schlage and a very nice person explained that it was a known issue with a spring and that she would send replacements. That was nearly two months ago, but no replacements. I love Schlage locks, but this is pretty poor customer support.
