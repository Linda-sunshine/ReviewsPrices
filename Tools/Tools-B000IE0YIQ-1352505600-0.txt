review/summary: Won't lastreview/text: Considering its not something used every day it should have lasted longer.stopped working today. 2 years 10 months. I used it about once a month.I will be conservative and say It was used 50 times max. It worked ok. A little slow and noisy. Gauge is hard to read. All in all I wouldn't suggest this unit.
