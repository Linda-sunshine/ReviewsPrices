review/summary: Very Satisfied!!review/text: I've been using this product for about a week and I'm really happy with it. I noticed a difference in my water since the very first use. I have eczema and my skin tends to feel aggravated after showers, however, since installing this shower head my skin feels much better now after showers. I didn't test my water before and after installing the filter but I believe this product does what it claims to do, which is remove chlorine, sulfur odor, lime scale, and bacteria.Installation was easy.To install the shower head you simply apply some Teflon tape(provided in package) and screw the shower head onto the shower arm.To install the filter cartridge you have to remove the stickers from both sides of the filter and then unscrew the two parts of the shower head and slide the filter cartridge in place, then you'll screw back the two pieces of the shower head and you're good to go.I've read its always good to let the water run through the filter for a few minutes before your first use. It helps to eliminate trapped filter debris, settle the filter material, ensure filter integrity and activate filtration materials in the filter. I'm not sure if that's applicable to this filter, but I did it nonetheless.Here are some specs on this product.Filter Life: 6 months or 10000 gallons (whichever comes first)Flow Rate: 2.5 gallons per minuteOperating Pressure: 40 - 100 psiOperating Temperature: 40 - 120 degrees Fahrenheit
