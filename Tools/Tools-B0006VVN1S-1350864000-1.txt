review/summary: This Shower Head Saved My Life!!review/text: I'll never forget the first time I showered with my Culligan. It didn't just clean my body, it cleaned my soul!It was a Wednesday and I had just received the shower head in the mail. It was quite easy to install, but resisting the urge to immediately strip down and get into the shower was much more difficult. I stared at its chrome finish as it glistened under the lights in my apartment, and it seemed like it was staring back at me, too (not that I was surprised, as I am quite good-looking). We stood like that awkwardly for a moment, as if waiting for someone to make the first move. I was never afraid to approach women at the bar, so naturally I went for it. I was already late to meet my boss at a very important client meeting, but he was going to have to wait.I pulled back the curtain, stepped into the tub and turned the handles. Suddenly, nothing in the world mattered. My job, women, the fact that I forgot to record Shark Tank last night; it all was irrelevant. I closed my eyes and succumbed to the raw power and efficiency of my Culligan's five spray settings. Water firmly pelted my neck and upper back, slowly releasing the tension that had been built up from my job and my weekly racquet ball lessons.At this point I realized my shower head was in complete control, and that my life would never be the same. Now that I knew shower heads like this existed, how could I ever settle for less? Thoughts that were normally composed of money and women were suddenly replaced by 3.2 lbs. of metal and 34 rubber nipples.I opened my eyes to see my Culligan once again. I then knew how to live the rest of my life.I'm happy to say that I now have a wife, two kids and a dog who enjoys running around in my backyard. The Culligan shower head saved me from a superficial life lacking depth and meaning, and I am eternally grateful. Thank you Culligan, for saving my life!
