review/summary: Belkin Surge Protectorreview/text: First off i've only had this surge protector for a month. Does not overheat. Haven't had any issues so far but hard to compare surge protectors. Love the lifetime warranty and 300,000 connected equipment warranty. 12 OUTLETS IS AWESOME. Comparing to other routers at same price its a deal. However i have not had anything break or any surge issues so i have not looked to far into how the warranty actually works or how well the customer service works.
