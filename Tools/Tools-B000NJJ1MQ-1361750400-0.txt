review/summary: Easy to install and works finereview/text: This works as it should once installed. The handle inside felt a bit lose when turning so I placed a bit of soft rubber hose to take up the slack between the handle and it's spline and it now doesn't feel lose any more. Just my preference and not needed to operate well.
