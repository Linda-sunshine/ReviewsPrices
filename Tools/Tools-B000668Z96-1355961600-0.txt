review/summary: Helpful but.......review/text: When you are looking for a way to reduce the flea population, theses can be helpful. I bought a couple and scored about 30 fleas the first night, then fewer as time went by (Seems to catch a percentage of the population). Best used in combination with a home treatment.Checked out a couple different products, ultimately it comes down to the price of the sticky discs which need to replaced regularly.
