review/summary: Great concept that failsreview/text: The idea behind it is sound, use the heater only at the times you need it and have it shut off when the thermostat reaches the desired temperature. The problem is, the unit only stays as far away as the electrical cord, so it really doesn't measure overall room temp. You should use extension cords on heaters, so the product is not useful IMO.
