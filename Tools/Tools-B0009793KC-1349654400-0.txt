review/summary: Great, clean waterreview/text: Our water here is bad! You can taste it's badness, see it's badness, and we pay a pretty penny for our water to boot! So glad these are on my fridge, the water is clean and tastes like water! Downside is the flow rate, so I find myself standing for about a minute to fill my large glass, but then I'm good for a long time! Noticeable improvement in clarity and taste over our unfiltered water.
