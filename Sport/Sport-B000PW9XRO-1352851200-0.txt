review/summary: Excellent shooting glove - Sizing information importantreview/text: With the onset of winter, and my refusal to give up shooting sports because of cold weather, I went looking for a pair of good shooting gloves. My needs go beyond just being able to pick up a handgun or rifle, place my finger in the trigger guard, and shoot. In IDPA or similar competitive shooting, you must be able to quickly draw your gun - fire multiple times - reload to another magazine, etc. All of this takes some dexterity and some sensitivity of touch. You can't just put on any pair of gloves and hope to accomplish that - and furthermore, you could compromise your ability to handle your firearm safely.The Hatch Specialist NS430 glove is a great solution for this. Made primarily of neoprene, they have a 'second skin' feel and are very grippy. Properly fitted (see more on that below), you can perform all your shooting moves without compromise and still keep your hands warm. These gloves are from Safariland, a top name in shooting sports accessories - so you can feel good about trusting the brand. Very good quality gloves, well designed for action shooting, and durable materials.When I purchased mine, I was unsure exactly what size I needed, so I checked another pair of normal winter gloves that fit me pretty well and ordered the Large. They fit me okay, but there is a wee bit of extra room at the fingertips that I'd rather not have. Unfortunately, as of this writing, Amazon does not have Medium in stock - so I have ordered a second pair in Medium from Amazon's partner/vendor OpticsPlanet (a very good seller) for about the same price. I will post a photo of the packaging that shows the sizing chart, but just in case; here is the info:6" = XS7" = S8" = M9" = L10" = XL11" = XXLThe length measure is taken from spreading your fingers out wide (like a tree frog) and measuring the distance from the tip of your thumb to the tip of your pinky.
