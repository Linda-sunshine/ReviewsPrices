review/summary: Good and inexpensive.review/text: I bought this mat in gray, and I'm quite happy with it. The length makes it quite roomy, and the thickness adds extra comfort, which is a good thing. I'm giving it 4 starts for two reasons: 1) It can get slippery if you sweat. 2) The color ended up being considerably lighter than I expected. As for the slippery part, wearing toe socks with grip helped, but I still have trouble if I'm supporting myself on my hands; having a towel nearby to dry your hands and the mat might be a good idea.
