review/summary: Favorite matreview/text: This is my original mat; I bought a crappy one when I thought I lost this one and then found it. It's a nice, thick mat that does exactly what you need. I did stick mine in the washer and it's like a huge chamois. It got clean and I would wash it again, however you need to be able to hang it outside and let it dry; about a 4 day task. But I now know it is washing machine safe.
