review/summary: Changed my Kahr CW40 into a new gunreview/text: I recently purchased a Kahr CW40 and took it to the range without the grip. The stock grip isn't bad, but it had its downsides- it is a little slim for my hands and the stock texture is a bit rough (gave my girlfriend a blister on her palm).With the hogue grip, it fits in the hand much better and is much more secure and comfortable. It contours to your hand and the rubber is soft to the touch.It looks impossible to get onto the gun when you first get it, but if you follow their instructions it's pretty easy!
