review/summary: Good Rugged Productreview/text: I purchased two, one for my wife and one for myself. My wife uses it as an encouragement for me to get off the couch and get moving. It is doing that. We are having fun comparing our &#34;steps per day&#34;. My wife is using your download software to generate trend charts and I am proud to say that I am trending in the right direction. The pedometers are reliably doing all that we expected. The order arrived promptly and correct. My pedometer has even survived a trip trough the washing machine in my jeans pocket. Rugged good product.
