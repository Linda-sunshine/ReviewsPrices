review/summary: Great scooterreview/text: This scooter is simple, but a lot of fun. The size lowered enough to fit a 4 year old but the 13 year old boys were able to play on it too. It's a little unstable for a first scooter, but it doesn't claim to be one either. Love the folding design for storage and travel.
