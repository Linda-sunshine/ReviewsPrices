review/summary: SO inconsistent, SO inaccurate, I'm SO disappointedreview/text: I have been doing Pace Express, which is a workout that relies heavily on monitoring your heart rate, and doing certain activities at certain times. I was concerned about whether my manually taking my own heart rate was accurate enough, since I was tired and panting while doing it, and maybe distracted by that. But this thing is USELESS. My modified resting heart rate is pretty consistently around 78. When I put this on this morning and began watching the monitor, it was just all over the place. 82, 78, 69, 75 within 10 seconds. How is that helpful? I need to know which of those numbers my heart rate is! I don't understand, even if my heart rate really were that erratic, which it is not, why it can't gauge an average, and update every 15-30 seconds, or so. Not second by second.To make matters worse, after each set of my workout, I know what my average has been every day that I've been doing Pace Express, and this monitor was a good 20 beats lower in its count than my own manual count that I was doing at the same time. When I was concerned about my own accuracy, I meant within a few beats, not 20 or more. That's insane.The last straw was during my evening workout, it mostly just showed zero. Even though the little heart icon was beating away, so I know it was on and working, it just kept showing zero. And then when it did show a heart rate it was, again, very low. Or at least much lower than I know my heart was beating.WHAT is the POINT? What a waste of money and hope. Save your money.
