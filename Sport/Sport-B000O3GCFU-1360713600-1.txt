review/summary: Great size for little lunchesreview/text: Love this thermos for little lunches and hot picnics. The 10 oz. of storage is big enough for any grade schooler's appetite. I usually fill the thermos only half full for my kindergartener, and she says her lunch is still really warm. The rubber on te top and bottom keep it from getting dented when little ones are a little rough on it.
