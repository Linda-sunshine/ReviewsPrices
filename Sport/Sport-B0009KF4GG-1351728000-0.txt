review/summary: Love This Knifereview/text: I've had this knife for a year now and I love it. I take it everywhere I go and am constantly using it. I primarily use the blades, can and bottle openers, and the scissors. Some of the other tools, the screwdriver for example, are a little cumbersome to use but I think that's to be expected from any compact tool like this. After a while the inside of my knife got a little dirty and the tools were harder to pull out, but it was nothing q-tips and some wd-40 couldn't fix. I am giving this knife 5 stars for the its exceptional utility and great price (at least when I bought it a year ago).
