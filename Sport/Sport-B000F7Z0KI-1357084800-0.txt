review/summary: Fabulous bottlereview/text: After trying one of these I bought several more. I freeze them with a little water in the bottom and they manage to keep it cold even on the warmest days. I also don't have the problem with condensation I get when throwing other bottles in my bag. They are the only water bottles I buy now. I also love the blue color. Great having color choices so we can tell whose bottle is whose.
