review/summary: Schwinn Thrasher Helmetreview/text: There are two black plastic pannels on the exterior of the helmet that cover the styrofoam near the ears, one on each side, that fell off the helmet during shipping. I was able to glue them back on, but was disappointed and a bit concerned that they were not firmly attached in the first place.
