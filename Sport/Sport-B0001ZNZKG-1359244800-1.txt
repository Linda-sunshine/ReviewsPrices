review/summary: Love 'emreview/text: I didn't expect to love ExOfficio so much, but I do. They really do fit better than anything else I've used, and they're so easy to hand-wash and dry. Great for travel, but also a really good fit for a minimalist lifestyle.I am between a medium and large in clothing sizes typically, but I buy my underwear in size small because I want them to fit snugly. These fit perfectly as a small, giving exactly the amount of stretch I want, but without making me feel constrained and without causing that area to sweat.
