review/summary: Russell Sport Pants are coolreview/text: For the money, these are great sport pants. I don't do much in them except hang out in the house and walk my dogs. They're soft, have nice deep pockets, a drawstring, and are gathered at the ankles. I've been practically living in them while at home after work. They're a blend of cotton and poly, which I wasn't sure I'd like, but they're great. They come out of the dryer ready to wear. Price point was very sensible and represented good value.
