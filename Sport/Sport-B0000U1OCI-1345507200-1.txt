review/summary: Great Little Pedometerreview/text: I have used this pedometer to keep track of my daily activity level for years. It works great for me. It's easy to set and use, seems to be pretty accurate - picks up my steps without being overly sensitive, and can be worn on the clip (just be sure to use the included security lanyard because sometimes it pops out of the clip, like if you bend over to tie a shoe) or just stuck in a pocket. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of more expensive pedometers, but it tells me exactly what I want to know: steps, distance, and calories burned, and it stores 7 days of this info.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because mine does seem to go through batteries very quickly and when the battery dies all your info is lost. I walk EVERYWHERE though, so maybe I just use it more than the average person would. I do think if they added an on/off switch the battery would probably last longer, since I could turn it off overnight while I'm sleeping.
