review/summary: GREAT cheap rope but slaps the hack out of my arm and forget about adjusting it!review/text: Great rope for fast training but the only way to adjust it is to slip it out of the handle and cut it cause if you try to tie a knot and stuff it inside the handle, it will jam itself and the bearings wont properly turn, tangling the rope constantly. I'm 5'11 with shoes on and the rope is a good size for me out of the box but it slaps the heck out of my right arm every time i trip over it. By the end of 30 minute training my right arm looks like someone beat me with a whip.
