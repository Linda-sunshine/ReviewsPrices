review/summary: Nice watch at a great pricereview/text: This was the first automatic watch I have purchased. Due to their inherent accuracy I have been a fan of quartz watches and have one watch that sychronizes via radio wave with the atomic clock in Colorado. I also tend to favor light weight watches and my everyday watch is a titanium Seiko I have had for years. I have always been a fan of the Rolex look and this watch copies a Rolex with some added flashiness. My biggest concerns in purchasing the watch were lack of accuracy of automatic movements and an inability to stop the second hand while setting the watch (non-hacking movement). I have had the watch for nearly two weeks and most of the time it has been on a winder. I have worn it some and left it on the dresser off the winder for about a day so power reserve certainly exceeds 24 hours. Since it has been on a winder, that may have equalized out the time gained or lost, but the watch appears to be maintaining accuracy to an impressive level - certainly within a second a week and perhaps even better. It may settle in at a different rate but out of the box performance has been impressive. The non-hacking movement has not been a problem since the second hand will reverse a few seconds when turning the movement backward. I can't do this with an Orient Mako I also purchased. The Mako is losing about 4 seconds a day. The Mako is an impressive watch and has a more understated look but the performance of this Invicta, at an even lower price, has been outstanding. The watch is definitely heavier than a titanium watch but it is not uncomfortable or excessive. I will certainly consider other Invicta watches.
