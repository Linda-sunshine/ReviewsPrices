review/summary: Great Long-distance running socksreview/text: I have used these socks 4 times, once a week. I ran my first official half-marathon, then a 25km trail run, a 30km run on the roads of Tijuana, and my first ever marathon and ultra marathon (47.5km). My toes used to bleed and feet used to blister. Not anymore, I love these socks! I know it's only been four wears but it's been over 123km. They are still in good shape. Love 'em. Worth the $12.
