review/summary: glovesreview/text: After I read a few reviews from others I decided to give these gloves a try. Thanks... to thoughs who gave these gloves positive reviews. Beause I'm pleased with these Hatch all weather gloves. The shipping was fast & packaged well. When I put them on they fit perfectly on my hands and fingers. I also reached for my Glock on the end table and the grip was...outstanding! Also a great buy!
