review/summary: The right-angle rise makes all the differencereview/text: This mirror was a replacement for an identical model that had worn out after about 10 years of use. The right-angle rise clears your angle of vision over your wrist and makes this mirror infinitely more adjustable than mirrors that extend straight out of the handlebar.
