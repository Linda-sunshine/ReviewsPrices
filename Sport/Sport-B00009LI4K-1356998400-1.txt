review/summary: Great protectionreview/text: These really do the trick! I could probably lay down and take a nap with my leaf blower attached to my back! Other reviews found fault with fitting. I have a large head and was concerned but these ARE adjustable. It is not smooth but that is a good thing as they stay put after adjustment. The metal &#34;wires&#34; slide very snugly within the black housing to provide a custom fit.
