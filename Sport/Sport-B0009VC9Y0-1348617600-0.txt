review/summary: Great Little Knife, but...review/text: I received one of these knives as a gift not too long ago, and proceeded to lose it within two weeks. I ordered a replacement on Amazon and was happy to find out that I ordered the exact same knife (I didn't have the box and wasn't sure of the model name).I would give it 5 stars for sharpness, appearance and how light and slim it is. But, the one I received doesn't open very smoothly and it doesn't always lock into the open position. I tried lubing it a little and it didn't help. I'm going to take it apart and lube it and see what happens, but I do feel with a knife this sharp, it should function properly out of the box. If I hadn't owned a few low quality knives in my life, I may have cut myself before I realized that it wasn't securely locked open.
