review/summary: Really Nice Watchreview/text: I own a Rolex Sub & this watch looks almost identical for a mere fraction of the price. This watch does not manually wind (first position out of the screw down should allow it to be wound )Don't know if I received a bad one but my other Invicta auto's all manually wind which I like because without the manual wind the watch will inevitably not hold time overnight.That's a real shame because this watch really does impress me otherwise.Update 13 Dec 2012............ I have to take back what I wrote about this watch not holding time overnight because it VERY definitely does. NOPE it does not manually wind but the truth is this watch is now on my wrist 24/7 because it deserves to be worn every day (as it should)& I love it. I wear it ALL the time & have never taken it off since original purchase......I was the guy that put it on the bedside table ready to go to sleep then put it back on in the morning. Not any more! If you like how it looks you'll love how it wears !!!!!!!!!!
