review/summary: It Serves Its Purposereview/text: I moved into a new home and my bedroom set was or order and did not arrive, so I needed a temporary sleeping solution. This did the trick.I loved having the built in pump so all I had to do was take it out of the box, plug it in and let it fill up. It took less than 5 mins to fully expand.I can't really say that the &#34;built in&#34; pillow negated one having to purchase a pillow. The built in pillow had my head too low and I needed elevation so I did purchase a pillow.The bed is comfortable enough; however, it does move around so you kind of feel like you're on a water bed (mildly) :). I think I would have preferred no movement. But it is temporary and works well enough that I have gotten good night's sleep on it. I would recommned.
