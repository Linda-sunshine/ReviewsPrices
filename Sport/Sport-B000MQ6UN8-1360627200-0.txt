review/summary: Grey gradient 58mmreview/text: I found the product really nice no scratch or anything did pay some extra shipping and handling for delivering it to Toronto. Ended up paying 128 instead of 99 for US...i hope that amazon.ca sometime gets better and we Canadians can save money too. Besides that i would have gone with a bit bigger size like 62mm but the colour was not available. But if you are thinking about being ligit or not...its 100% legit!
