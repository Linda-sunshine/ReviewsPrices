review/summary: Best desk chair out therereview/text: I bought this chair for my desk at school. I teach 5th grade, and while I don't get to sit down much when I do this chair rocks! It is the most comfortable chair I have ever sat in. It rolls great and is so supportive on my back. Lots of my fellow teachers have seen the chair and after getting over the initial shock and trying it have decided to purchase on themselves. You can not go wrong with this chair. I love it and you will too!
