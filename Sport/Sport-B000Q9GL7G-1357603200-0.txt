review/summary: Lyingreview/text: I ordered a left handed holster and received a right handed holster. When I contacted the company they said because left handed people wear the holster on the right (this was a christmas present I took their word for it). Not true! my son-in-law wanted a left handed holster. I don't like to order on line and not receive what I want.
