review/summary: Amazing!review/text: I thought this would be a gimmick, but for a few bucks, I thought, &#34;Why not?&#34; I kinda hope that I get stranded so I can bust it out again! We opened one up to see if they really are &#34;thermal blankets&#34; being only the thickness of paper. It became so hot so fast we didn't last but a few seconds under one on the couch. It's also tougher than I thought it would be based on its appearance. I think it would take a bit of effort to tear it.
