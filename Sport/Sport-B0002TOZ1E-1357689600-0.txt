review/summary: Gold Toe Men's Cotton Crew Sockreview/text: Like most every reviewer of this product sold by Amazon, these are terrific. They are even better than the ones used to be sold by JCPennys and since we have now lost that source, this is the place. I wear these socks every day, working around the farm, and they are everything that other reviewers have said about them. You won't be disappointed with these, unless you're allergic to cotton or socks, or have access to the 60's military cotton socks they supplied. These are worth every penny you pay for them. One last thing: They are crew socks, not tube socks. ColGilly
