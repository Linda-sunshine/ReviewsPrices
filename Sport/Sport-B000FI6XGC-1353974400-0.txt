review/summary: Well-Built and Compact Bike Pumpreview/text: I'm not a bike expert, but it's obvious that this is a very well-built and well-designed pump. It quickly switches between the two different types of valves, and comes with a nice, slim clip for attaching it to your bike. It is lightweight, but feels very sturdy even when you exert large amounts of force when pumping up tires.
