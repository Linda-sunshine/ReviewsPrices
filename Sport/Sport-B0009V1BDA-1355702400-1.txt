review/summary: Cooks Pretty Well, not used friendlyreview/text: I got this grill to mostly keep at home, and have the flexibility to take it camping and such. It sits and cooks pretty well, a little uneven as other reviewers have stated. I've had problems with the flexible part of it. It is very heavy, and quite unwieldy to stand up and down. It's really a two man operation, and led me to break one of the cheap plastic holders you see on the side of the tray. This seemed like a perfect compromise between portable and large and stable. If I were you, I'd get a simple grill like This Weber (http://www.amazon.com/Weber-1520-Propane-Go-Anywhere-Grill/dp/B00004RALK/ref=sr_1_29?ie=UTF8&qid=1355804752&sr=8-29&keywords=camp+grill) for on the go, and a nice larger one for home.
