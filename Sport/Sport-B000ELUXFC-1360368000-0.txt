review/summary: Allen Deluxe is awesome!review/text: I first read reviews before buying this rack, and was hesitant after hearing some people's were bouncing around going at high speeds and long distances. I drove from Dallas Tx to Destin Fl and not once did I have a problem with this rack. Zipped in and out of some traffic on the highways and the rack stayed true, along with the bike remaining in place. I was very surprised how well this product worked. I suspect the only reason others did not hold well was that they were not tied down correctly. The only reason this did not get 5 stars was because the bottom stram did not connect to my trunk or under the car but was still long enough to MacGyver it easily.Overall: Love this rack, easy & quick to install and take down
