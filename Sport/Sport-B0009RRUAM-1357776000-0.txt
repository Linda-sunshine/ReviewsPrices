review/summary: Really comfy for a camping pillow!review/text: This was comfortable for a six week trip. It gets pretty small when you pack it up and it is super light weight. It is pretty small, though...not the size of a standard pillow at all. We weren't backpacking, so we didn't need to worry about weight, but we were in a car all over Western Canada and Alaska, so it was the space that was important to us. This takes up very little space and it's very squishable if you are trying to cram it into someplace small. All in all a sound investment and will last for a long time to come.
