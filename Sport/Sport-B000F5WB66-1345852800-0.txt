review/summary: Inconsistent and sporadicreview/text: It worked great the first 3 times I used it. Then it started working sporadically. My heart rate would go up while I was walking I would begin jogging it would go down, start walking again and it would jump 29 beats in a nanosecond. Then it would not read my heart rate at all, so I took it to a jeweler to get new batteries and they checked the batteries and said they were full charged. It started working again (maybe because they took the battery out and it reset itself? ) and I wore it on the same walk I had used it previously and it seemed to be working steadily but was about 25 beats higher on AVG then just the week before.It is also very touchy when you are reading the info from your work out, if you press the button you can inadvertently erase all you info and start it over but I think that can be overcome by familiarity with using it. Sending it back, if it is that unrealiable in the first few weeks can't imagine it will improve over time. FYI- I did use the recommend gel.
