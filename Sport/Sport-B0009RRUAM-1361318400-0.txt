review/summary: comfyreview/text: I think this is an awesome creature comfort. I have both neck and low back pain/weaknesses. Used this on my recent flights and found it to very comfortable. It does take a moment or two for the foam to fluff, However I found it to be more than adequate. Better than ANY I have in my varied collection. Mine is the medium blue one. It compressed easily and fit my day pack nicely. I also put a small clip on it for easier access from outside of my pack. I highly recommend it.
