review/summary: Excellent upgrade for an AR-15review/text: This rubber pistol grip from Hogue is an excellent upgrade from the stock pistol grip, and is a welcomed addition for any AR-15. This particular Hogue grip fits my S&W M&P 15 great, feels perfect in my hand, and makes gripping the weapon much more comfortable. To those looking for a nice, affordable upgrade for their AR-15....or for anyone who would like to upgrade the stock handle and wants an accessory that makes sense and adds functionality to their rifle, I highly recommend this product.
