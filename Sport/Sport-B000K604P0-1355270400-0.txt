review/summary: Item leaksreview/text: The item is not really spill proof as the description says. Item is very inconsistent. Some days it leaks, some days it doesn't. I cannot seem to figure out what I am doing to make it leak. I am convinced it is the thermos as I had another spill proof thermos why I actually dropped and it never leaked even after I dropped it. Unfortunately the clasp broke on that one which is why I had to replace it.
