4.0
review/summary: Love the bottle, not the sport capreview/text: I bought the bottle for a nice reusable water bottle that isn't plastic and is dishwasher safe. I love the bottle as it is very strong as long as you don't drop it on cement. The sport cap 2.0 is nice but has a annoying high pitch whine from the air escaping while you drink. yes there are other reviews that tell you how to drink it &#34;properly&#34; but I just want to tilt it up and suck out the water.Water flowing comes out at a good rate, but if tilted on its side it will leak even if fully closed due to the air hole
