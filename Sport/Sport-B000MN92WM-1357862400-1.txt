review/summary: works so well I've brought 3!!!review/text: No I'm not crazy! but I think this is a great product and I purchased one for myself and two for friends. Easy to use, light weight, accurate, this is one of the best pedometers I've purchased. The software is easy to understand and presents you with a nice breakdown of your daily movement. You can set goal's for yourself (steps per day ....etc) and monitor your progress. If you're looking for a pedometer and really don't want to spend $100+ on one this is it.
