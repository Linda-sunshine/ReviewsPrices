review/summary: Leaks!review/text: It would be helpful to simply shove the bottle in my bag with all the other stuff I'm carrying to the office or other places but this bottle requires *special* treatment and must always be upright b/c it leaks. Doesn't leaking defeat the purpose of having a water bottle?There's a written disclaimer on the label attached to the bottle that it must always be upright or it will leak which I did not notice until my friend pointed it out.I received this as a gift and now I leave it in the fridge as my "quick cold water grab" and that's it.I would not recommend this product for more than fridge storage use and will not buy one for myself.
