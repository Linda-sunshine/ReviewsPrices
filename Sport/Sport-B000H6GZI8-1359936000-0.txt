review/summary: Very Nicereview/text: I found the Hogue Rubber Grip very secure and a very complimentary for my firearm, which is fairly wide but the factory grips (on both sides) were cracked. Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to fire the weapon prior to the addition of the Hogue grips. But I was very pleased with how the grips felt when I did fire the pistol.Perhaps the only draw back I found with the Hogue grips was that the pistol I placed the grip on, though a compact has a double stack magazine. The included instructions recommended working your fingers in under the grip to pull it up the side of pistol. I tried this but only managed to tear the grip. I tried the handle of some plastic ware but decided that a popsicle stick worked better.I have only put 100 rounds through this pistol if I find that there are any concerns further down the road I will update this review.
