review/summary: It's a good in-between cleaner.review/text: I like the BoreSnake and think it does a good job, but I agree with some of the problems that are pointed out by others. Number one fault, the cheap nylon cord breaks. I have had it break on three others, but have not ried this out yet. With the others, I complained to Hoppe's and they sent me new ones. Keep complaining about this problem, maybe they will fix it (but probably not). Also, they do wear out. A brush on the end of a cleaning rod can be replaced for a couple of bucks, these, not so much. These are good for a quick run through cleaning out in the field, but should not be substituted for a proper cleaning.I hadn't bought any gun cleaning equipment in a number of years and when I started to get the stuff from Hoppe's, it all says made in China. Outers is still made in America, my local gun shop stopped carrying Outers because it was "more" expensive and we're not talking by a lot. All they stock now is Hoppe's. From now on I am going back to the old rod and brush style and buy caliber specific Gunslick kits from Outers. I would rather pay the little extra for a better product, and feel good about buying it. Yes, this (the BoreSnake) is easier to use, but sometimes "easy" isn't what your looking for.
