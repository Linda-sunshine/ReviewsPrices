review/summary: Awesome Bottle, Poor Lid Designreview/text: This water bottle is a great idea in theory. The lid, however did break (in multiple ways) within the first six months. The bit valve sprung a leak, and the piece which connects the spout to the lid also broke. All was made right after I contacted Camelbak -- they sent a replacement lid for free. The replacement design was a different (and FAR BETTER) design.Would have been a 5 Star review if I had not had the initial difficulties.
