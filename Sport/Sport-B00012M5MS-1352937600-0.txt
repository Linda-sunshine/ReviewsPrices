review/summary: Inexpensive Helmet, a little shoddy.review/text: This helmet looks nice with the faux carbon fiber shell and it fits alright with the adjustable headband. You get lots of airflow and I believe it would nicely protect ones head in a fall. However, you somewhat get what you pay for in this very inexpensive helmet. The shell and side parts come unglued almost immediately. Really, be prepared to glue them back on. Its not a deal killer and if you have some super glue handy once you re-glue it you should be fine. Its an easy fix but still a dissapointment to have to make the repair in the first place. This is apparently very common for this helmet. It does not effect the helmets ability to protect you in a fall. Its just a nuisance.
