review/summary: Fits great, but 1 complaintreview/text: These work great in my Vibrams! My one complaint is that I had them on when playing the sports game on XBox Kinect and the socks got all fuzzy on the bottom (my other pair of gray ones have not had this happen, but I haven't worn them playing Kinect), so I am not sure of the overall durability.
