review/summary: Great Warning Lightreview/text: This is a great little light. I've been riding my bike at night lately and don't feel good about just having a reflector on the back. There are a lot of crazy drivers around here, so I figured this would be a good way to make me more visible (haven't been hit by a car so far).The light is quite bright and has 3 modes: Solid On, Blinking, and Off. I don't really use the Solid On mode, as I feel it might look more like a break light. The blinking mode definitely draws more attention (I know when I'm driving, I notice those blinking lights on the back of a bike). Great little light, especially for the price, highly recommended.
