review/summary: 8926OB - More watch than I expected for the pricereview/text: This is my first Invicta and I couldn't be more pleased. I chose the OB over the later model 8926 due to the coin edge bezel which I feel is more traditional in design. For those that want a Rolex Submariner look without the price tag... this, pun intended, fits the bill. Is it a Rolex? No. Is it a solid watch with features found on more expensive time pieces? Yes. The finish is very nice and doesn't have too much &#34;bling&#34; factor. The bracelet is hefty and is comfortable on my wrist.The bezel ratchets nicely counterclockwise and fits very well against the case. Some reviewers have complained that the dial markers don't glow very brightly at night but I haven't had an issue with mine at all. Overall this is a beautiful, solidly built watch that should serve me well through the years. If you want the Rolex look in a nice automatic movement at an extremely affordable price... look no further than the 8926OB.
