review/summary: A Beautyreview/text: This is a sweet little pocket or desk knife great for everyday use blade is excellent and very easy to use out of your pocket and the safety lock if you choose to use it works well for keeping accidental openings from occurring. I don't use the safety but I tried it out for several days and it does work if you worry when your knife is in your pocket i have not had this knife open once with the safety off but you have the choice. Either way it is a great small knife.
