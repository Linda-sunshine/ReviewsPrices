review/summary: Gold Toe Men's Socksreview/text: These socks were bought for my father - who has never worn gold toe. My husband won't wear anything but gold toe. Now my father won't either. The stretch (or give) and weight of the sock are perfect for his everyday use. He has size 11.5 feet and they are wide. Some brands don't fit as promised. Gold Toe does.
