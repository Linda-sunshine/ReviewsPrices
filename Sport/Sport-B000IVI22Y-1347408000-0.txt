review/summary: Wouldn't purchase againreview/text: There are a couple reasons I would not buy this again. First off, having a flip top design means there are lots of crevices for dirt/dust to gather. It's nearly impossible to clean it properly because of that. Second, the tip cracked open making it impossible to suck up any liquid through it because the opening was so big. The bottle itself is pretty durable, that's about the only positive thing I can say about it. Otherwise, this just isn't a good design and I'd urge you to go with a klean kanteen, much better design and quality.
