review/summary: Cyclists take notereview/text: These are a must have item for cyclists who want to ride in cold weather.I tried every possible combination of socks, expensive winter (?) shoes and shoe covers and still had numb toes even after just an hour in sub 40 degree temps. With toastietoes, I don't even need shoe covers. Contrary to the instructions, I wear the items on top of my toes between a pair of silk socks and a pair of Assos wool socks and shoes a half-size larger than normal (so the blood can circulate). It's like a summer ride for my feet. We had a sub 40 degree day and with shoe covers, the warmth generated is kept inside. Eight hours may be a little generous, but they're still going strong after my two hour rides. I owe my winter fitness to the fine folks at hothands. THANKS!!
