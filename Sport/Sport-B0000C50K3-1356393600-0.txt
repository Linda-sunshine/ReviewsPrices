review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I recently purchased this boresnake and it has revolutionized the way I clean my rifle and handgun. It has simplified the process and made what use to be a chore into an enjoyable experience. I will say the first time you use it the boresnake is a bit stiff. You will need to put some muscle behind it if you are trying to fit it through a .22lr caliber barrel. Other than that it's great!
