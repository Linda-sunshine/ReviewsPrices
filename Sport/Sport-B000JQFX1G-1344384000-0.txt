review/summary: Top Quality Watchreview/text: Opened the box and it looked so much better in person, I was debating between getting the coin edge 8926ob 42mm or the smaller 37mm 8926a because of my small 6.5 inch wrist, but i decided i would go with classy rolex style coin edge and i couldnt be happier, its the perfect size watch for a man and it screams class. The movement on this watch is great as well, it has the hacking second hand so it can be timed easily and its very accurate only a few seconds off a day, the bezle has a nice quality weight to it, and it feels solid between each click, all in all im extreamly happy with my purchase and have no real cons on it.
