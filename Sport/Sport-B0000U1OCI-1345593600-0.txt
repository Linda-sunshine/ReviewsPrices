review/summary: Fine Little Pedometerreview/text: I have had several pedometers of various makes. This little Omron pedometer beats them all. Compact; accurate, once you set your proper stride; most important modes of display; clips on belt, pocket, etc.; helps to urge you to get out and walk. Also, resets itself at 12:00, but stores display data for several days. Highly recommended. Have had good results generally from Omron products and other items purchased from Amazon.
