review/summary: Be sure to buy extra arrowsreview/text: My twelve year old daughter really liked this this bow and arrow set. Only complaint I have is that the feathers (?) on the arrows only lasted a couple of days before they started to come unglued. Definitely buy some extra arrows for continued enjoyment.
