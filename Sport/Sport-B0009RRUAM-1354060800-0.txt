review/summary: Like a real pillowreview/text: So when I first received this pillow I was disappointed. It was so flat and really lumpy. I decided to try it out at home and I fluffed it and left it on my bed for a while. When I went to sleep some time later this pillow was full and plush. Still lumpy in texture but not in a way that you can really feel it when sleeping. Worked like a charm. I used it camping and slept like a baby - no stiff neck the next day. I love this pillow so much I bought a second one so my boyfriend won't steal mine when we're camping ;-)I would imagine this would go great for long car trips or air travel as well.
