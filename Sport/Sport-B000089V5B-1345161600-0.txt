review/summary: Hard to size up, but otherwise amazing shoe!!review/text: This is the second Converse Low Top I bought this week because of sizing error(my fault). I ordered a size 10 in Mens the first time because I'm a legit size 10.5 Mens in every other shoe I wear. The shoes were received quickly by mail and the quality is great. When I tried them on, I had a good amount of space inside the shoes to move my toes which was too much for me. These size 9.5 shoes are a perfect fit. The sellers advice is spot on about sizing. Order 1 size down from your usual shoe size if you want a good fit. Other than that, these shoes are great for casual walking and weight training. I use them for dead lifting and squatting. Definitely recommend these shoes to anyone!
