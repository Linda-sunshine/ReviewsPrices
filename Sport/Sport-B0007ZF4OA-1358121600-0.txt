review/summary: Sub Par Heatreview/text: We bought these to put in our chalk bags during our winter climbing trips. These hand warmers took roughly 15 minutes to start registering heat and after that they really didn't get much hotter than body warmth. I'd say at their max heat they were maybe 110F. We'll see how the rest of the packs work out but if the 10 packs we busted open are all representative of the batch we got I'm worried we'll be disappointed.
