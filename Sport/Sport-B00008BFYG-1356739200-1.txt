review/summary: Cute scooterreview/text: I bought this scooter for my 5 year old for Christmas. The pink colors on it are nice and girlie and my daughter loved it. It was VERY easy to assemble out of the box... Basically, it folds open and snaps into place.We had my daughter on it within minutes and we couldn't get her off it. She was so proud riding this scooter. She's ready to start taking it to school when we start back next week.
