review/summary: love these pants!review/text: These pants are so comfortable. And soft! I liked them so much, I was back to buy another one! I'm on the slimmer side, about 5'5 and I buy a large. Just cause these pants are thin, and if too tight, show everything. So a wee bit bigger and they are perfect! yes, they do make them a little longer at the foot, but either roll them up around the waist or wear them with a little bit of a heel.
