review/summary: LOVE ITreview/text: I really like the memory feature as I record my steps and I can go to bed and record them the next day or even go back a few days if I forget as the memory keeps seven days of each type of data. It resets itself each day, so I don't have to reset it -- small deal, but helps. The clip keeps it in my pocket. Also really like the "aerobic steps" feature. After a few weeks of use, it seems pretty accurate as to time of aerobic steps. I use it when I walk the dog and of course there is lots of starting and stopping. It gets the time right within a minute or two of being out on a walk.
