review/summary: good product for the pricereview/text: Comfortable. Good breathe ability...my head still sweats though. I've had an issue with both of the rear plastic pieces falling off with initial wear. I just used shoe goo to glue them back on as they are just cosmetic pieces to the helmet. Wish it was a little smaller so that it fit better in my small gym bag. It looks OK on and visor shields your eyes and forehead well from the sun.
