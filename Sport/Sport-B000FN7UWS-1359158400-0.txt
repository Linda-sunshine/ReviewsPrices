review/summary: Not a bad productreview/text: I've had it for over a year now... It's nice, but it dents really easily. I dropped it on the floor once and the bottom of it dented badly. I had to have my parents clamp it and beat the bottom back down so it wouldn't wobble anymore. Now there's no more paint on the bottom. It still works, though.
