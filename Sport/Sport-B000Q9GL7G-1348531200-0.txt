review/summary: Best holsters hands downreview/text: I have a Glock 22 Gen 4. Bought an Uncle Mike's holslter and it didn't hold it as firmly as the BlackHawk. Lots of guys when I was in Iraq had them but I didn't buy one just for the year I was there, I used the issue holder. This holster is versatile and can adjust for nearly any size belt or be used as a clip on to the side of your pants. Great for taking to the range or in an open carry state. Holds it snug and you can adjust the release tension to suit your draw style.
