review/summary: Best peodmeter I have ever tried.review/text: I love this pedometer. I make it a point now to clip it to whatever pants I am wearing that day. It is a great insentive to keep moving. I love the fact that it keeps track of what I have done(steps I've taken) over several days. I'm finding myself marching in place during TV commercials just to rev up my steps when I haven't reached my goal.
