review/summary: The bike rack snapped!review/text: This bike rack is a freak accident waiting to happen. My strap just recently snapped and the whole rack with two bikes on it went flying. This happened going over a speed bump, now imagine the accidents and incident like that would cause on the freeway! Furthermore, three bikes barely fit on this thing, half the time the pedals or handle bars are jamming into each other. The pedals would also hit my read bumper and leave scratches because the rack is TOO SMALL, and too DANGEROUS. They should seriously discontinue this piece of garbage. I wish I could get my money back for this stupid, I'll engineered product. Hope they bite the bullet for such an awful product.
