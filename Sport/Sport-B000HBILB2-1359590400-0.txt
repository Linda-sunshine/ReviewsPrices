review/summary: Good bed.review/text: I love this airbed. I do have to blow air into it every few days to keep it firm. I've read review about not able to deflate, but I had no problem. I took this on the road with me and had no problem packing it. Just use the deflate dial (turn counter clockwise) and that's it. I was able to put in my travel bag just fine. If there's still a little air left, as I am folding, just turn the on button to deflate more and it's as flat as can be. Roll up just fine.
