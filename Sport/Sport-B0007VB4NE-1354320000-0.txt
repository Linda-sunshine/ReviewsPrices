review/summary: Best office chair I'm ever ownedreview/text: I bought this chair to help with my posture while sitting at my desk at work. I though it would help my posture which would help with back strain. It exceeded my exceptions! My one comment to anyone thinking of buying it, I'm 5'1&#34;. It is a good height for me but if you are taller you will need a to either find a different chair with a bigger ball or know that you will have to replace the ball that comes with this chair with a bigger one.
