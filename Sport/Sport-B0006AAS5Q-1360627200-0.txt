review/summary: My reviewreview/text: Delivery - Although I ordered in standard shipping, I recieved the package in USPS Priority Mail. It didn't matter though, since all my packages sent through USPS gets stuck in Hawaii for a week anyway.Package - It came in a bubble wrap bag. The watch itself was in a yellow box. A really yellow box. No damages, so I'm satisfied.Item - After reading several reviews, I realized that Invicta sells several models for 9212. The newer comments seemed to have lower ratings compared to reviews written three-four years ago. The newer models seemed to be made of cheaper materials resulting in poor reviews. I don't know which model I recieved yet, but I hope it was the older one. I decided to buy it through Amazon Global and from a third party seller that was slightly more expensive than the original price (in my hopes to get a better model. lol.)Ok the actual review of the Invicta 9212: the color was much darker than in the picture. The gold was much darker, and the silver had a heavier look. For some this may not be a problem, but I did not like the difference. The gold and silver has not peeled off yet ( this seemed to be popular problem in recent reviews). The batteries were alive, and nothing was broken or missing. Chronograph was functioning properly too. The band was too long for me, so I needed to have it adjusted. The crowns could be properly adjusted and moved.So far, I am satisified. For a watch that is sold for under hundred bucks, I think 9212 is doing pretty good. Let's see how long it will last.
