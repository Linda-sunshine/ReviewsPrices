review/summary: Warm but noisyreview/text: These things are basically on time emergency use. That is what they are designed for, to keep you alive in an emergency. These are small light weight and at a good price. Don't expect to be very comfortable or quiet using one of these things, as they are kinda like tinfoil, but they will keep you warm.
