review/summary: A glove that will lastreview/text: This glove seems to fit my hands almost perfect, except the length of the fingers are a little (0.5cm) longer than my fingers and compromise some dexterity. However, the gloves ARE made of what seem like durable and high quality material. But it's a little stiff and slightly thick, may take a while before it feels perfect on my hands.
