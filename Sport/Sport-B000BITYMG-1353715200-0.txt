review/summary: Major likereview/text: This has kept me from losing my Fitbit so many times. I attach the clip to the inside of my pocket or to a belt loop and clip the Fitbit to the pocket or the waistband. These places keep the Fitbit dry but they are spots where it sometimes will pop off. The leash was a major necessity for my $100.00 toy!
