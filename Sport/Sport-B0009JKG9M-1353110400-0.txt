review/summary: Another Versaile Panreview/text: I use the bottom to fry up french fries and such. Deep enough for the oil but not so big that I don't mind doing single servings. The lid makes a fine skillet though I rarely ever use it for that. If I were going camping I'd probably take this combo with me instead of a frying pan. Might even make a decent, small dutch oven.
