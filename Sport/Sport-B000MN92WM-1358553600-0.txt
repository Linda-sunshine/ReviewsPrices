review/summary: Omron Pedometer a NO BUY!review/text: The only pro thought concerning this pedometer is that it does accurately measure your steps.BUT:1. Clasp is terrible. I am currently looking for this device as it fell off of my belt. I have had this device come loose from my belt and fall at least 10 times and I haven't owned it a month yet.2. Software is limited. Just good for downloads. Limited info.3. Thank GOD it was only $32. Not even worth that much. Just bought a FitBit One to replace this device.
