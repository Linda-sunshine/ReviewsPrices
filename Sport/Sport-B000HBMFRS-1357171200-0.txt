review/summary: Great for one personreview/text: We have had this air mattress for a few months now and used it for several overnight guests. It inflates and deflates quickly and easily; I love that! It also stores very compactly. We have found that it is quite comfortable for one person to sleep on alone, but not for two. It is definitely large enough for two (queen size), but when two people's weight is being shifted around on it, it's just too bouncy and flimsy to provide comfortable support throughout the night. (These have all been normal-weight adult guests, by the way . . . no one very heavy. It would surely be even worse for two heavy adults.) But for the price, it is nicely constructed and has held up very well so far.
