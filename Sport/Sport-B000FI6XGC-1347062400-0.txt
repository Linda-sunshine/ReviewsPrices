review/summary: GREAT Pump.review/text: This pump is GREAT. It comes with a clip that you can attach to your frame, but I just throw it in my backpack. I read a review in which someone had stated that they felt the pump was hard to use, but I had no issues with pumping my tires up to their recommended pressure. If you're looking for something small, light, etc...I highly recommend this pump.
