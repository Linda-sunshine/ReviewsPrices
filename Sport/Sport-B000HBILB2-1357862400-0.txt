review/summary: Nice bed!review/text: I took this bed for a trip all the way down to Guatemala this past November 2012. It did a good job for the two week vacation. Future buyers have to consider that this bed is different from your comfy home mattress, it may not be as comfortable but it will do the job that is designed for an air mattress. I have to pump air every two days but the process was so fast (aprox. 15 seconds) that it did not butter me at all. The bed is firm and comfortable enough to survive a couple of weeks with out your comfy every day bed! I am happy with the buy and will recommend. Again keep in mind that comparing air mattress to your every day comfy bed is like comparing apples and pears, both fruits are sweet but they taste different ;)
