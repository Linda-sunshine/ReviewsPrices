review/summary: Angels sing when I put them on my big head, but I can't hear themreview/text: A seemingly minor feature of these earmuffs is the metal coupling between the cups. It adjust to the size of my head, which goes something like 24"+ around. I have tried to use ones with plastic couplings before, and I have a tendency to break them. First, if you leave them out over time, UV degrades them, and then they crack when I put them on my giant head. These earmuffs have not had this problem.
