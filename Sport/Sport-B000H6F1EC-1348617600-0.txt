review/summary: Pay no attention to sizereview/text: These tend to be smaller than what they say. If you are on the big side and don't want to order 4xxx, go ahead and order 4xxx. I can wear 2x of other brands and I ordered 3xxx to be comfortable but whoa, they were snug. Hold the fat jokes please. Just telling it like it is for the guys who are making that choice. Nobody's looking. Gte the 4 if you're big. (I'm not talking majore obesity because these aren't for you.)
