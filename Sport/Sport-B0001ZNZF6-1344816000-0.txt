review/summary: Changes the way I pack for long tripsreview/text: Its not often you come across a game changer - particularly involving underwear. These boxer briefs literally allow me to travel for two or more weeks at a time with only 2 or 3 pairs of shorts vs the 14 or so that I would need if I weren't able to wash these out so easily each night. All that reduced space requirement allows me to downsize my luggage - yep, I can go a month in Europe using only a carry-on bag. Now, if I could only get my wife to think along the same lines ....
