review/summary: Great for Grandson visit.review/text: I needed an extra bed for a grandson's short visit and after searching locally, decided to order this from Amazon. I'm glad that I did because this was better quality than the ones I saw in the stores and at a good price. The bed did not lose air during his visit and was comfortable. I like that built-in pump feature because it is one less item to keep up with and it makes inflation so much quicker and easier.
