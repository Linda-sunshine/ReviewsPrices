review/summary: No more burned food!review/text: Being such a bad cook, I almost always burn my food at least a little, but with this deep Lodge Combo Cooker that is no more the case. I just set the electric range to a little above the lowest, and the whole cooker gets hot and cooks everything to perfection. No more hot spots in the center, everything is equally warm!I than serve the food, and just rinse the pot and cover with warm water, dry it with a paper towel and oil it right away, it always looks like new this way, maybe better.I do not like for Amazon to charge sales tax, this product came from out of state! I do not have to pay tax to another state.In the future I will look for other stores first, I used to trust Amazon.com, but ???I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT OF THE BEST QUALITY!Rudolf.Lodge LCC3 Logic Pre-Seasoned Combo Cooker
