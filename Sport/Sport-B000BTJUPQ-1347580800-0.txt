review/summary: Perfect first bow!!review/text: Got this for my 8 year old son's birtday. Wow, was he excited to get a real compound bow!!!And, it's perfect for him. The draw length and weight are spot on for my 8 year old, and my 9 year old daughter has no problem either. And it's not too powerful so I'm not overly concerned about safety issues - still always under adult instruction and supervision, in a suitable area, with appropriate accessories (wrist guard, proper target, youth arrows, etc).Highly recommended, especially considering the price.
