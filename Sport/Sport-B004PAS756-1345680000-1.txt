review/summary: Worth the Purchase!!review/text: Ok, I bought this DVD several months on a whim trying to get a taste of what it would be like if I bought the full Insanity Challenge. I must say this workout does not let you down. He packs a lot into the 20 minutes you are working out. In the one month of using this workout along with other workouts I saw some results. Unfortunately I did not stick with it but am starting the workout regiment again using this workout and eventually I will purchase the full Insanity Challenge. I would say this is good for 1) people who are in a time crunch and or 2) people who are at a beginner to intermediate workout level .I truly recommend this DVD.
