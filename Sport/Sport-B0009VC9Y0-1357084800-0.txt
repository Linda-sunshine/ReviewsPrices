review/summary: Im very pleased with this knife!review/text: I read a lot of reviews mostly good one here. This is a review that is long overdue since I bought this back in 2008 & its now 2013...Jan 2nd....but maybe well warranted. I have had this knife since. I owned one previously till a friend dropped it and the tip bent..but it was on concrete...not the fault of Kershaw! I sharpen the knife on a ceramic sharpener and so far everything good. Great pocket blade and always with me. Yes...the tip is a little worn but if you are that worried about the tiny tips of your knife then idk how you will ever be satisfied with anything. For the price vs. value this is an amazing addition to anyones collection. Still looks nice with very little scratched even after 5 years.On a side note I was shopping for another blade to add to my collection tonight and ran into this one that I already had...its such a great knife!
