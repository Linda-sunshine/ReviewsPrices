review/summary: Stay AWAYreview/text: Unit arrived quickly, packaging was ok.Did not work correctly from the first use.Left side of the shuffler would hardly work and kept stopping.After using it 5 times the bar you press to get the cards to shuffle was hit or miss and the entire unit would not work.Sent back for a refund.
