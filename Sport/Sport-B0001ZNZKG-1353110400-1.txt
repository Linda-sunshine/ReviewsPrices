review/summary: I love these.review/text: I bought these a few weeks ago and by far, these are the best I've ever had. They wick moisture away and pretty much stays dry all day no matter how much I work out or perspire doing whatever all day long. They are not cheap, but do what they were intended to do and very well. I would encourage anyone who wants comfort while being active to give these a go. They are awesome.
