review/summary: Nice watch!review/text: I've had this watch about a week now and thought I'd share my thoughts so far.The watch really is good looking, I can see how many would think it is a much more expensive piece than it is. Since I'll never be able to afford the Rolex this watch so closely resembles I'm pretty excited to have such a classy looking time piece.As delivered the band was huge but removing a couple of links was easy and fixed that.I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the negative reviews but thus far I can say I'm very satisfied with this purchase. I set the time and date the first day I got it and it hasn't lost or gained any time at all, it's spot on.For the money I can't see how you can go too far wrong buying this watch!As a matter of fact I'm considering buying another Invicta in the future.
