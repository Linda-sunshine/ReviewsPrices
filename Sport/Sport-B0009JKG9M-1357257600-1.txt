review/summary: Great Set ... Will buy more Lodge products.review/text: I purchased this set based on the recommendation for Tim Ferriss in the 4-Hr. Chef. I was a bit nervous when I saw some of the more critical reviews, but I'm very happy with the outcome. At the recommendation of others, (and despite the description of being pre-seasoned) I seasoned this before first use by using oil on a paper towel on the inside and outside, and placing it upside down in an oven preheated to 350 for an hour.(I used olive oil ... not a big fan of vegetable oils.) Of course, if you do this, be sure to put out a layer of aluminum foil on the bottom shelf to catch any falling oil.Ultimately - after the initial seasoning, I am thrilled with the fuctioning of the product. I haven't had any issues with sticking, and the dutch oven and skillet clean easily. Very much looking forward to putting some miles on these. Would definitely purchase more products from this company.
