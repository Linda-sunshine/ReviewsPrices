review/summary: Pro Diverreview/text: So far this watch has performed admirally for the price paid. I wished it had a dive extension on the bracelet, but that is a minor issue. I have read some of the good and bad reviews of this watch and Invicta in general. I hope not to have to use their repair service any time soon. I was reluctant to purchase, but for the price, I decided that it was worth the chance. So far, everything seems tobe in order with this particular watch.
