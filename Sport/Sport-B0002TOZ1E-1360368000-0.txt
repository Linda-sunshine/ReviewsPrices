review/summary: What happened to the reinforced heel?review/text: I was really happy when I first discovered these socks and they were really affordable in Costco, yet now when I see them in Macy's or other such stores I am shocked at their poor quality. I hate having to buy new white socks every few months and I wear black socks throughout the week. Who makes a decent pair a white socks?
