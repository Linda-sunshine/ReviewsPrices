review/summary: Champion Men's Mesh Shortreview/text: I have a few pair of Champion gym shorts that are great, so when I saw these I bought a couple pair thinking they'd be as comfortable as the ones I already owned. They were not. I bought two pair of the same size (different color). These shorts wore very tight to the leg, not loosely like other gym shorts I owned. And this is not because they didn't fit, they did, it was simply the cut of these shorts. They also have a very rigid tag on the inside back seam that is very uncomfortable and will rip the seam if removed. I gave it a 3 star review for the fact they only cost $11 so I suppose I got what I paid for.
