review/summary: Beware of the dimensionsreview/text: I bought this mattress as a spare guest bed for our vacation condo. I was delighted to see it described as being 80"x40"(a twinXL). It arrived and the box clearly stated 80x40 dimensions so put it in the closet for future use. Just pulled it out of the closet 3months late and inflated the mattress only to find it is a standard twin measuring 32"x72". Nothing close to the stated dimensions noted in the product description and on the box.
