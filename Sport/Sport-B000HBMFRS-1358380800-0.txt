review/summary: Amazing buyreview/text: ive had a lot of air mattresses in my time (25 years) as ive surfed around couches and dorms in college and this is by far the best one for the best price.it's like the expensive ones that have the built-in pump up/deflate ! AND it is a bit higher than usual which is nice and comfortable. very sturdy and has a nice pillow sort of resting spot on the back so you can relax on it.bought one for my sister and shipped it to her before my trip so i could stay with her on it. $40 for this &#62; NYC hotel rooms! even if i have to buy a new one each time I go!!
