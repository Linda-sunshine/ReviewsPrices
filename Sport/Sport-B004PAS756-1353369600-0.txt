review/summary: Perfect for women with hormone challengesreview/text: I've worked out in some manner since I was 16 years old - running, weight training, yoga, aerobics, zumba, Jillian Michaels and more. At 47 and with hormone changes messing with my metabolism, the Insanity workout is giving me what I want - intense compacted cardiovascular workout, core strengthening and abs. It's the first workout that does all three for me. In addition, there's no fancy steps or routines - just good old fashioned conditioning! I feel like I'm a football player warming up for a game. Finally, I've challenged myself to go further with this workout than any other.
