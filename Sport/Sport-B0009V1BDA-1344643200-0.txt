review/summary: Sharp // Coleman 9949-750 Road Trip Grill LXEreview/text: Well when I receive this grill it was so well package I just don't under how the latch could have gotten broken off, and it was inside the grill with lid closed, to me it had to be shipped from the company with the broken lid.Because the box was not damage so (UP) get a five star. But whoever the employee was who package it up gets a one star. Now I have to have the warranty do its job.I am not packaging it back up, to have Amazon.com send me another. I really like the grill. Outstanding with the wheels and pull up and fold down, makes this a charm. And the two burners with the split burner and griddle it's outstanding.Thanks Amazon and Coleman. But packaging department you need to put wrap around the lid to keep these beautiful grill lid latches from getting damage.
