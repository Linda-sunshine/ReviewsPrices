review/summary: Exactly what I wanted...review/text: I do a lot of floor workout routines and this is great. Normally, my hip, knees, or tailbones hurt when I am done with a workout. I have tried using a towel or blanket but those are not the right density or slip & slide around. This mat is perfect for ab, thigh, etc. workouts on the floor. It stays put, doesn't move around, and provides me with enough cushion without getting in the way. Plus, I like the color!
