review/summary: Nice matreview/text: This order came very quickly. I bought this based on previous reviews and I am not disappointed at all. It is light, which is great since I don't have a strap. I bought the Soothing Sea color and really like it. It is slip proof and just the right padding so my old body is comfortable in the yoga poses!
