review/summary: Love the bottle, shame they didnt get the order rightreview/text: Love Klean Kanteens, for the open mouths which work in a dishwasher, the bright colors that kids love, that they don't make the water taste metallic, and the different sizes available. So much to love!Annoyed about not getting what I ordered. The lid was wrong and the sports lid leaks.So now I have the choice of returning the whole thing because the lid is wrong, which seems a waste of postage and effort, or going somewhere else to buy the right lid for another $4 or whatever it is.Not much money, but annoying. Maybe use a different supplier?
