review/summary: Love itreview/text: I love this chair and have had it for a year. i work on the computer a lot and it hurts my back and legs when i sit for an extended period of time. I would have given this item a 5 star rating had I been able to adjust the height of the seat. otherwise it is great for me. Would definitely recommend anyone who has bad back to try this item. Thanks
