review/summary: Quality item. Great, useful idea.review/text: Speedy shipment. Quality item, just like i remember from my childhood. I used that already several times. And definitely for breakfast eggs. Nothing sticks, it holds temperature nicely. For washing it is the best to use just some hot water. I usually do not wash it with every use, just wipe it clean with a good paper towel. Oh, and if something got burned add some water and a little salt, bring it to boil, then let it sit for couple hours. Wash and wipe with some oil. Dont use harsh chemicals. Love it. Nice and comforting addition to my kitchen. So far (3weeks) there is no rust of any kind.
