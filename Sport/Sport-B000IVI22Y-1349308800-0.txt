review/summary: i love this bottlereview/text: I was searching for weeks for a descent water bottle to take to work (construction) that i could beat on but still be easy enough to take drinks out of without having to unscrew anything. The first bottle i bought was a Sigg bottle, was expensive but i figured it would last me a while. It was 1.5 liters which was a little much but after about a couple weeks i dropped it trying to get it out of the fridge (it was big and awkward) and the top broke off. I then decided to pick one of these up since ive owned camelbak backpacks in the past and knew they were of good quality. Ive been using it for a couple of months now and it's worked perfectly. I love the fact that if i want more water flow i could just take the bite valve off in a second and drink straight out of the bottle. It seals the water in remarkably well, i thought it would leak some from either the valve or the flip up thing, but it doesn't. I don't have to worry about it leaking when i toss it in my car when im in a hurry. Would definitely recommend this bottle to anyone.
