review/summary: Fits my Kel-Tec PF9 and Ruger SR22review/text: I have purchased 3 of these over the past several months. I currently use the grip on my Kel-Tec PF9 and Ruger SR22. There was minimal trimming required to get it to not interfere with the safety or magazine on the PF9, and absolutely no trimming to fit it on the SR22.The third one I got was for my Diamondback DB9, but because the grip on the gun is so short I had to do major trimming, nearly cutting the Hogue in half. In the end I didn't like the jagged finish (my fault for hastily cutting) and ended up scrapping it.These grips do a wonderful job improving the ergonomics on both guns, which initially felt too small to handle comfortably. Also, when I carry inside-the-waistband I feel like I get a better draw because of the extra friction provided by the Hogue. There is noticable reduction in perceived recoil on the PF9 at the range. Great product, and I intend to try again on getting one on my DB9.
