review/summary: Great bed for the pricereview/text: This bed Blows up very quickly. Less than a minute. The unit has a large nob for letting the air out, so you can lay on the bed and reach back and adjust it for comfort. I am 6ft 2 and 260 lbs and I sleep well on it. Fitting sheets stay on well.The only thig I wish it had was built in handles to carry and move when blown up. Great buy for the Money.
