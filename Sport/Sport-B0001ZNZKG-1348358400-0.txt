review/summary: Best boxer briefs availablereview/text: These really are the best boxer briefs that I have owned. They are comfortable, fit well in all the right spots, and don't stretch out. The material is soft and comfortable. The waist band is snug but not too tight. There are no annoying tags poking you. After my first purchase of these, I ordered 2 more right away. They are a bit pricy but you get what you pay for.
