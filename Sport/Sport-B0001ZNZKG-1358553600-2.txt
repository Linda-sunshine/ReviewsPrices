review/summary: Skeptical - but won over.review/text: I NEVER want to pay this much for underwear. But I'm tired of cheap stuff that not only doens't fit, it hurts me. Time to get stylish and comfortable and take a chance. I'm glad I did. I'll have to buy some more. I don't like paying this much, but I also have no tears that my Hanes, et al would have had by now - so maybe durable as well and worth it in the long run in more ways than one.
