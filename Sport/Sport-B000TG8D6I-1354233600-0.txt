review/summary: Fantastic...BUT!!!!!review/text: First of all, this product really works, don't get me wrong and don't misunderstand the rest of this review. I started this program and found that this truly was some no nonsense workouts that truly burn. However, to get the results described did not take the stated 90 days. For me, and i really committed and did not slack off at all, took about 120 days, a lot longer than they stated. I did some research on how it was taking so long for me and how other people could get the results faster. What i found was quite interesting. I found that p90x has some very great qualities about it, but their exercises are working your body the wrong way. I found a book that totally changed my world and the way that i looked at all of my workouts. These book, for all of 2.99 each, go into extreme detail on the way that the body actually works to build muscle and create definition. I really recommend that you read these books before you try any exercise program.How To Get The Six Pack Abs You Have Always Had: The Complete Guide Book To Exercises, Workouts, And Dieting For Men or Women (The Future U)How To Get That Ripped Chest And Back: The Complete Guide Book To Exercises, Workouts, And Proper Eating For The Fastest Results (The Future U)Monster Arms Without The Monster Wait Time: The Complete Workout Guide Book To Huge Arms In The Fastest Time Possible (The Future U)
