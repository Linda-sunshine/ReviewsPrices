review/summary: Pretty knife but deceivingreview/text: When I got it, I was surprised by the weight and how slim it was. I was quite excited to open it, needless to say but when I opened it, it stopped half way. I thought that was weird and attempted to replicate it again. Yep, the bearing seems to be bad in this knife and I'm in no mood to take it apart and babysit something that should've been done right the first time in the factory. But curiosity got a hold of me and I took my Teeny Turner screw and see if I could tinker with it a little. I was surprised to realize the screw was VERY loose, not even tighten all the way in. In fact, it was sticking out of the side of the knife.So basically I have a lemon of a knife despite how pretty this design is.I'm returning it. Meh...
