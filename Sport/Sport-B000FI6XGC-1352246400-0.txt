review/summary: Small and does the Job well.review/text: I ordered this pump because I have more than one bike and was tired of moving my much bigger Topeak Road Morph pump between bicycles. This pump is much smaller than the Road Morph and still does a good job of pumping up tires. It seems to be pretty solidly made and the mount looks sturdy enough.
