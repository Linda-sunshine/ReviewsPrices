review/summary: sized smallreview/text: Just got these pants in the mail. I ordered a size up as I was looking for a loose fit. upon trying them on, I realized that instead of having a wide elastic band, it is instead very narrow and fits very snug, even though I sized up. I plan on returning these as the fit is uncomfortable. If I would re-order these, I would size up yet another size.
