review/summary: Decent for Indoor shooting range usereview/text: These work fine for an indoor gun range. Fit is pretty good. I certainly would not go with a lower NRR, and may go for higher on my next pair since they're primarily used at an indoor range. But my ears aren't ringing even after popping off 100 rounds and being surrounded by others doing the same.
