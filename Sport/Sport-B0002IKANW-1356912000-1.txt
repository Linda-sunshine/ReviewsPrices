review/summary: Like all Snap Caps - works just finereview/text: I have Snap Caps for a variety of calibers. While most modern guns claim dry firing is safe, Snap Caps just give you peace of mind. They are a bit pricey but they last a while. The edges do get knicked after a few uses, but the Snap Caps don't lose any functionality. Snap Caps are also useful when developing trigger control (randomly throw a few in a mag of live rounds while at the range and see if you flinch) as well as for failure to fire drills.Four stars only because these seems a bit overpriced for what they are. It may not seem so, but after you've bought a set in a bunch of calibers it really adds up.
