review/summary: Works great, as described.review/text: I had no problems getting good contact on the electrodes....but I guess that's because I sweat a lot during exercising. I did a 2 hour test on the monitor, and it was very accurate. I even set up my heart rate limits, and the watch beeps when you're out of the preset range. It has a nice stop watch, alarm, and displays the time and date as well. Honestly, seems like I made a very good buy! I recommend this item.
