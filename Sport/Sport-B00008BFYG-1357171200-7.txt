review/summary: My 5 yr old loves thisreview/text: she wanted one for christmas and she really likes this. folds up nicely and easy to use. very happy with it! Seems sturdy and i light the adjustable handles. I would beware though - she is only 5 and somtimes she wants the handles up even higher and they don't go any higher. So I'm not sure if this would work for an older kid.
