review/summary: 95% of a R___x at 1% of the pricereview/text: This watch from Invicta provides the look, heft, feel, and sparkle of its expensive cousin at a small fraction of the price. It is not a Rolex, but I must have fallen on a well balanced one since it keeps time to about a minute a month, and i usually don't need to adjust the time until i have the crown out to adjust the date for a 30 day month. A friend thought it was the real thing standing only a few feet away on the beach on a sunny clear day. Even if you own the real thing, it's nice to have this one to wear around, to avoid the heartache of getting a ding in a $20k timepiece. Save the real thing for evening wear or a special occasion, and wear the Invicta to the beach, playing ball, etc. Should have years of enjoyment from it with a little care.
