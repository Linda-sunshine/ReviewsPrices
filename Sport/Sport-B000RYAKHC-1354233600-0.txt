review/summary: Long Battery Life and Great Visibilityreview/text: Works great and is very flexible in its placement. The only issue I have had is that the light can pop out of its attachment point if the bike gets jarred. My original taillight fell off when I took my road bike over a set of curbs. Bought another one and then used electrical tape to secure it. No issues since and it works great.
