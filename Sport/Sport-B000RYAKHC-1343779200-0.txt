review/summary: Blinky lightreview/text: I bought this in August 2011. I ride alot at dusk and it is great. I use the clip to clip it on my bikeseat bag, that way i can also use it to run. VERY DURABLE- Was flying down a bumpy hill and it flew off ( I turned it on while i was riding, and pulled it some off the bike bag due to the clip- first time that happened). Anyway- after It flew off, sounded like it broke. When I drove home in my car past that spot 2 hours later, there she was, blinking away onthe side of the road. ALl that happened was the cover popped off, no breakage AT ALL-!
