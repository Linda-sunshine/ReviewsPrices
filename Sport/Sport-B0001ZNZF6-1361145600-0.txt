review/summary: appalachian trail tested, city life approvedreview/text: i bought a pair these in hot springs north carolina, about 300 miles into a 2200 mile hike on the appalachian trail. they fit awesome, never got funky, were the first thing to dry out, and the only underwear i wore for 5 months and 1900 miles of hiking.since getting back to real life, i've bought a few more pairs and they're awesome. they don't lose elasticity, look and feel great.i'm not the kind of guy that writes a lot of underwear reviews, but they make my junk look good too.
