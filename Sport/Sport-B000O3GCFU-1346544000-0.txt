review/summary: Perfect for a child's lunch!review/text: WHAT I'VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FORI pack my daughter's lunch almost every school day, and for a while she wasn't it eating it all because she doesn't like eating food that's gotten cold. So I went searching for an insulated container that didn't have any cartoons or characters on it, so that she could use it for years.I got theThermos Foogo Leak Proof Stainless Steel Food Jar, Blue, 10 Ounceand she used it for the last 2 months of last school year and has used it for the first week of this school year. So far she has been eating everything that I have packed inside the container.HOW I USE ITI fill the container with hot water and put the lid on it, but do not screw it on. I leave the hot water there for around 5-10 minutes, empty it, and then immediately put the food in and screw on the lid.OTHERShe leaves for school at 8:30 and has lunch at 12:00 noon; I don't know if it'll keep food hot all day. I have not used this product for cold food, so I don't have any comment on whether it is effective in that regard.
