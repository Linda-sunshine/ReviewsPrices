review/summary: Hit or Miss handwarmersreview/text: Since thwas hand warmers had such good reviews, I didn't think I could go wrong in choosing them. unfortunately for me, I was part of the few that received a box with defective warmers.I'm not sure if all of these are suppose to work but I sure hope the company expects each hand warmer to do its job. I had to open 4 warmers before getting to one that was producing some sort of heat worth carrying with me. almost felt like I was scratching tickets.Amazon's not really a gambling site like eBay, so I hope people understand that some of these hand warmers may be hit or miss. good batches and bad batches. if I was to do it again, I'd get a better set of gloves for the 30$ more that I put towards these. I don't really write negative reviews but for such a high star rating I expect results.
