review/summary: Leaky, leaky, leaky!review/text: So sad! I finally found the "perfect water bottle" for me, but it began to leak shortly after purchasing it. I have properly cared for it- never even put it in the dishwasher, yet it leaks! The air escape spot at the top seems to bubble up almost, and leak the fluid out all over. Bummer. I suppose my water bottle quest continues... :(
