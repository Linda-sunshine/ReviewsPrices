review/summary: Not good for kidsreview/text: We bought this to send clean water to school. We bought the pop-top with it. We put a sock on it to keep it from sweating on on our son's desk.It dented very easily within the first week, and so it barely stands up. Also the cap that goes over the pop-top fits tightly (good for cleanliness) so it is difficult for kids to pull off.Love the fact that it is stainless, but the bottom needs reinforcement. With the weight of the water, I doubt if the rubber sock they sell would have protected it from the dent.
