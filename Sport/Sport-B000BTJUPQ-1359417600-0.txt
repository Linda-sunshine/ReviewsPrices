review/summary: Good for the pricereview/text: This is a good bow for the price and my daughter was ecstatic when she got it. The problem is my daughter is 7 and this bow has a greater pull needed than she's ready for. I acknowledge I should have researched it more but didn't get the sense that it would be too much for her from the description (says it's great for introducing children to archery). Also, the bow did not come with an arrow guide so the arrow easily slips perpendicular to the bow when pulled back. We're holding onto it until my daughter gets a bit older and more experienced to be able to use it. All in all it seems solid and for the price cannot complain too much.
