review/summary: Excellent Quality Product, Works With POLAR Exercise Machinesreview/text: First off, I have been using this monitor for about 5 years now. I use it in the gym for weightlifting and (intense) cardio. I also recommended this to all of my clients while personal training over other, more expensive monitors.Aside from other reviews, I want to note that this HR monitor works with Polar coded treadmills, elipticals, etc. What this means is that when you wear the chest strap (the wrist watch is not necessary for this feature), your heart rate will be sent to the exercise machine you are using. Many other HR monitors such as Garmin devices do not transmit to exercise machines. Considering the cheapest Polar monitors are about $60.... this is an excellent deal.The watch battery died on me after about 3 years of moderate usage. The chest strap battery is still the original (over 4 years old) with no problems yet.The watch and chest strap are of solid construction, and neither has shown significant wear or damage. The buttons on the watch still function perfectly.The elastic strap broke once (at one of the plastic ends). Replacements are available for about $6.Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who wants a solid HR monitor and does not require all the bells and whistles of expensive models.
