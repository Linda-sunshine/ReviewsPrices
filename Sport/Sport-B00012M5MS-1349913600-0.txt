review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: It will keep me safe and wasn't too pricey. Good.Some of the decorative plastic on the outside fell off right out of the box. That doesn't reduce the functionality (which is all I care about), but prevents me from giving it a perfect review.I would have purchased it again (even knowing some of the decorative plastic became unglued and fell off the helmet).
