review/summary: Reliable Holsterreview/text: Although there have been some concern about the design of these holsters, I believe they are quite safe. They certainly prevents your gun from being grabbed easily by someone else or falling out by accident. If you have good and practiced gun skills, this holster is an excellent tool.
