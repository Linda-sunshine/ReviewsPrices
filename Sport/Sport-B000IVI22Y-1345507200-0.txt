review/summary: Good at firstreview/text: Does what it is supposed to do obviously. The top leaks though after a month or two. Also the bite thingy comes off and you can see all the dirt and grime that gets in there. It is pretty hard to clean. I am just going to stick with the traditional screw off top. I wont buy again or recommend to anyone.
