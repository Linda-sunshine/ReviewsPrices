review/summary: Invicta 8928OBreview/text: I love this watch, it is perfect for me. It is very nice, a perfect match of silver and gold. It keeps time perfectly and with the self wind convenience, I never have to worry about my battery needing replaced. Absolutely perfect, I highly recommend getting one if you are waiting for any reason.
