review/summary: Easy PZreview/text: This is the first time I've ever owned a mountain bike and the first time I ever used a Trunk Mount Rack. I have 98 Acura RL.This rack is sturdy (all metal parts), strong, and very easy to use. I admit, I was nervous the first time I used it. I kept looking in my rear view to see if the bike was flopping around or had fallen off or whatever ;) I was extremely surprised how well it held the bike in place, even over bumps in the road.This rack is worth every penny and easily fits in my trunk when I'm not using it.I highly recommend you read the other reviews and look at the pictures on how to secure the bike to the car, keep the front tire from moving, put socks on the pedals if you need to, etc. All that information was EXTREMELY helpful.You might want these bungee cords: Highland 90086 Bungee Cord Assortment - Set of 12
