review/summary: Needs better gluereview/text: fairly comfortable, but two of the plastic covers on the back of the helmet fell off during transit. I don't think I can use super glue as it may melt the foam, so I'll try Elmer's glue.and probably as a result of the price, much of the padding inside seems to be attached solely by little patches of velcro.
