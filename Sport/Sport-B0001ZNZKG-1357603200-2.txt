review/summary: A little lose but good overallreview/text: So these guys are wonderful for trips and hiking/camping.If you're on the go and need a pair of quick wash/dry boxersthat will keep your junk cool than pick these up.They fit a bit loose on me, but that isn't too bad.I'm happy with this purchase, great for travel...you can pack less and get more...quick wash and over night dry.
