review/summary: A compromise I might reconsider next timereview/text: Small and light, this pump requires quite a bit of effort to pump in volume and pressure.I think the handle shape could have been improved slightly, and perhaps the pump body could be coated with a non slippery paint (I can't imagine using this in the rain), it just seems like a lot of compromises were made to make it smaller and nice-looking.The pump's volume could be increased slightly by increasing its length, and the handle is not comfortable to hold.
