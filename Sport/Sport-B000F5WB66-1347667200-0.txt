review/summary: Simple, large display, starte giving erratic readings in cold weatherreview/text: If all you want is a simple heart rate monitor and session timer without other features this is it. The display is large. it displays time when not in heart rate mode. When you press the start button it reads heart rate. If you press the button briefly while in heart rate mode, the timer tells how long it has been in heart rate mode, then returns to reading heart rate. That is all it does. To exit heart rate mode press and hold the start button or remove the chest strap. To review time of last activity, peak and average heart rate, press and hold the start button after returning to time mode.The chest strap works with some other devices. The cardi equip at the gym where I work reads my rate from the chest strap without touching the grips on the machine. I have seen chest straps without the watch sell for twice the price of this set. I cannot guarantee this strap will work with all other devices such as GPS but it is worth a try before spending big bucks on just a chest strap.The chest strap has no on-off switch but works when there is a small amount of moisture. It has always worked for me when I press the start button on the watch. I have used it for months several hours per week without having to replace the battery. It looks like the battery will be easy to replace when necessary. The strap is a little snug on me when extended to as big as it will get. I have an average size male chest. If you have a large chest you may need a larger strap.UPDATE: After 8 months of regular use, it has started giving erratic readings, wandering from over 190 to as low as 40 bpm. This has happened in cold windy weather. I changed the battery but no improvement
