review/summary: Leakyreview/text: When I first got this bottle I LOVED it. It's very convenient to have a straw, so you don't have to tip the bottle up every time you want a drink.But, now I'll never want to buy another one.Why?Because they leak.If you can't toss a water bottle into a backpack and go for a hike what good is it??Near the end of my bottles life I had to baby it, constantly checking on it, ensuring it was always upright and leak free. Because as soon as I was turned sideways it would start leaking water onto everything else. Cameras, phones, coats, gloves, your backpack, your back. So I ditched it.Also, If I left the water in the straw it had a funny taste after an hour or so. My friend didn't think so, so maybe I'm more sensitive to it than other but it's something to think about.My advice? Only buy if you're using it around the home and don't mind/notice a bit of plastic taste from the straw.
