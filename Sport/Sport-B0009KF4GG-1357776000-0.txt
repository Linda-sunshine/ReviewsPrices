review/summary: Great product, but missing pliersreview/text: I carry this multi-tool in places where locking knives are not welcome, and it has been extremely useful so far. All of the tools are top quality and extremely functional, although some of them can be difficult to pull out. Like all Swiss Army knives the red coating tends to get tiny scratches from everyday use but these in no way impair the knife's functionality. If you think you have need for pliers or strong cutters, though, get the Swiss Champ.
