review/summary: Combo Cookerreview/text: This is such an excellent piece of equipment. Bought initially to bake sourdough bread, I have found so many other uses for it, too many to list. With all due respect to Amazon and their wonderful service, I cannot understand why there isn't a single retail business in Australia that stocks them.
