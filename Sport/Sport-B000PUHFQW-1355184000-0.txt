review/summary: Great but ..review/text: Seemed like a decent mat - however I ordered RED and the company shipped a PINK mat with an inventory tag that said RED. Don't think my fiance would want to bring a PINK mat to the gym, so it was returned. The carrying case felt a little cheap. I think the price is a little high for the quality of the product.
