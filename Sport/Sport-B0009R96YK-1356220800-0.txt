review/summary: Great Mirror for my road bikereview/text: As most people do.. I researched all the mirrors and chose this one as it met my needs of being low profile, strong , yet versatile with several installation options. I 've had this on my Trek Fx 7.3 for about 4 weeks. The installation was super easy. It was harder to remove the end of my grip than it was to install the mirror. Now I can clearly see any traffic behind as well as my riding partners. The mirror doesnt vibrate nor does it get in the way of any brake or shifter levers. I have it installed going down and in towards the bike and it works great for me. This mirror seems to be very solid. This shipped and arrived very quickly and the price is very reasonable.
