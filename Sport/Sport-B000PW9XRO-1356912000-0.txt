review/summary: Have been using them for a year nowreview/text: The gloves look barely used after a year of use so far, this is an excellent product for the price, highly recommended. I purchased them to use for photography and have done so in various weather conditions. Despite being fairly thin, they keep the hands warm, and have been completely waterproof thus far.
