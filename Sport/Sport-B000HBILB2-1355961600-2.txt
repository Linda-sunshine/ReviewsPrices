review/summary: Slept greatreview/text: My daughter purchased this airbed for my long weekend visit to her one bedroom apartment. For three straight nights, I slept great. It didn't hold all its air all that time but what air mattress would? With the built-in pump, I just had to throw the switch and within seconds it was firm, comfortable and ready for another night's sleep.I also want to mention how easy this bed was to get out of. I have arthritis in my knees. Because this bed is the height of a mattress and box springs, I was able to get up and down easily. This also made it a great place to sit. This product is absolutely worth the money!
