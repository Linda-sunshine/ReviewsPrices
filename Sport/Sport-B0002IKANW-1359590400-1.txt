review/summary: Great for practicereview/text: The wife and I both have brand new 9mm semi-auto pistols. We both are new to guns and need practice loading mags and chambering rounds. We are not comfortable using live ammo for any kind of practice. These snap caps are the best way to play with your new toys safely. You can also dry fire on them and then pull the slide to eject them, just like a live shell would eject. I just wish they came in a 17 pack, instead of 5, so you could fill the entire magazine. I'm so glad I bought them!
