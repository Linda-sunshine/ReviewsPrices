review/summary: P90Xreview/text: Bought this from a reseller as a like new product. From all appearance it is a new product. Contains instructional booklet and diet book that appeared to have never been open. The discs I have used so far all operate fine and were individually wrapped. You do miss out on some bonus DVD you would get from buying from Beach Body, but it only cost 65-70%.The program is tough. I worked out on weights and cardio 5-6 days a week and thought I would be ready for this. It is a great program but not for beginners or feint of heart. If you are looking for a fitness program that challenges you and takes you outside of your comfort zone this one is great. Be ready to work, challenge yourself and try things you have not tried before.The program comes with access to WOWY.COM which is a Beach Body support group. They assign coaches from a group of people who have gone through the program. This area is of no value. I got 1 e-mail from my "Coach" and never got answers to questions I asked. If you are looking for a support function I do not think you are going to get it here, but if you can figure it out yourself or have friends with this knowledge it is worth the money and the commitment.When I started I had severe shoulder and elbow pains. Since this is largely body weight and dumb bells or resistance bands you lose that joint strain that comes from conventional weight workouts.
