review/summary: A walk per day gives you staying powerreview/text: I use the Omron HJ-112 Pedometer daily, and I love it!The display is very large, and the easy removal from clip is great when you want to have a quick look at your step progress.It was a little pricey when compared to others, but I would buy another if needed because I needed something good as I was making a major investment in my health.This unit does not disappoint. Too often you get what you pay for. I paid much, but I have received much in turn.Why buy two cheap ones, when you can invest in one of the best?
