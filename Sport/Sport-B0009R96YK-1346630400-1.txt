review/summary: Mirror broke fairly easilyreview/text: I purchased the mirror a few weeks ago, and the purchase/delivery were fine. The mirror and frame assembled as directed. Just before my first ride the bike fell over as I was putting air in the tires, and the mirror hit something (ground perhaps) and cracked beyond useability. I checked the web site of the manufacturer and the replacement cost of the mirror alone was $5, but the shipping was another $5. The replacement cost of the mirror was almost the price I paid for the product in the first place.I contacted the manufacturer (explaining my situation) and was hoping they could send me a mirror with the shipping for $5, and they refused. They suggested buying 2 mirrors as an alternative (to make the shipping more palatable?). Very disappointed with the response.Anyway, I feel that the frame and design is great, but the mirror is way too fragile for a product that is sold as a "mountain bicycle mirror".
