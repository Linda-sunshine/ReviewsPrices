review/summary: Perfect, If You Have A Fat Headreview/text: Not only do these ear protectors do a terrific job, but they can be easily adjusted to comfortably fit my size 7 and 3/4 noggin. My lawnmower is now just a soft purr, and yet I can still clearly hear people talking to me when I need to.The last set of ear protectors I bought had a plastic headband (I know... what was I thinking?), and even if you decide not to buy these, please, never ever buy any with a plastic headband! As we all know, and as I should have remembered, you can only bend plastic so many times before the big snap. These have stainless steel rods for a headband and they appear to be quite well made, So not only do they work very well, but I don't anticipate having to buy new ones for a very long time.By the way, a special shout out to Amazon for their super fast "Super Saver" shipping. Nice job guys!OK, one more thing. I've noticed that some people aren't happy with these because they don't block out all sound. It's true, but ear "protectors" are supposed to "protect" your hearing from dangerously loud noises, not render you completely deaf. I think the fact that you can function in a dangerously loud environment, and still communicate with your fellow human beings is a big plus, not a minus.
