review/summary: Great gloves!review/text: These gloves are great. I love the grip I get on my firearms with them and they work well preventing slide bite. With my Karabiner 98 Kurz, they work well handling heat that builds here in Arizona.Under the situation of emptying a few mags from an Ak-47... They like to melt. They'll protect you from any serious harm but you'll feel the heat and clearly see some smoke.
