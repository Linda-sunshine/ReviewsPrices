review/summary: Comfy pillowreview/text: I thought this pillow wasn't gonna cut it when I first pulled it out of its package, but with some fluffing (like 30 seconds worth is it) and given a little time (about 10 min maybe) the pillow was just as comfy as the one I have at home. I had read the reviews before buying that stated they had to fold it in half to make it usable...simply not true. I used it flat out and it supported my neck and head beautifully.
