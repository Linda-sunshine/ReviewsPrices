review/summary: Boxer Technology's great leap forwardreview/text: Man oh man, these things sat on my wishlist for a LONG time before I pulled the trigger. They're HOW MUCH? For BOXERS? Each? But all those rave reviews sucked me in - and I don't know why I waited so long.They're amazing for travel, dry quick, don't stink, and are extremely comfortable. I live in Florida and the thin fabric is great for keeping cool as well - though I don't hesitate to pack these for cold weather. The fit is very comfortable - not to get off topic, but having enough &#34;room&#34; was a concern for me. Don't let the words &#34;stretchy&#34; and &#34;Spandex&#34; frighten you, even if you're a bigger guy, these fit like a normal boxer brief.Buy a pair, and join the future of boxer technology! Like the other hard sciences, it has made some incredible advances in recent years, and it's time you had a part in it (heh heh).
