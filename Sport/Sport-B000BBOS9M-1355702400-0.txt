review/summary: Great for so many thingsreview/text: Quality, quality, quality. For maximum loft (fluffiness) throw the pillow in the washer and dryer and be amazed! I use this for camping, lumbar support in the car, airplane and train rides.I think Cascade Designs is a great company. Lifetime warranty, based in Seattle, and super customer service. :)
