review/summary: Great!review/text: Obviously they're great, they're ray-ban aviators. After staring at them on amazon for ages I finally bit the bullet and bought them. The box they came in was a little squished but who cares - the glasses were in their case and everything was fine. It was nice to get them a little less expensively than through other platforms. DO be careful about size, these are the adult size. The small size means kids and will not fit an average adult face.
