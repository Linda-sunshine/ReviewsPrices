review/summary: Nice working and looking watch, but lacks durable exteriorreview/text: I've owned this watch for a little over three weeks now. I didn't purchase it from Amazon, but I did pay about the same for it as it was offered for here ($75). When removing the watch from the box it has almost a breathtaking beauty. It looks and feels every bit as good as the Rolex Daytona (the watch it's designed to look like). Setting the watch was simple and the chronograph works well, however I was disappointed to discover that the long, center second hand does not function as the chronograph second hand. This makes the tachometer pretty much useless. I had a replica Rolex Daytona for a few years, and one of the things I liked about it was that the actual second hand was used to measure seconds when using the chronograph. Anyway, the main problem I have with this watch is that the gold on the band is exceptionally thin and NOT durable at all. In three short weeks I've lost most of the gold off the bottom the band just from rubbing it against the surface of my desk during regular office activity. So this beautiful watch now looks really grubby from certain angles. But ultimately, for $75, the watch is still a bargain.
