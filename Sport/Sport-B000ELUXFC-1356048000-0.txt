review/summary: Works just fine for the Moneyreview/text: Bought this because I was getting tired of folding the seats down and pulling off tires and seat to throw my bike in the back of my car. The cushions are plenty sturdy to hold up to the weight of two (pretty heavy bikes) and no scratches or dents thus far.I would like to see a better design on the two main support flat-hooks. A more rounded hook would be nice, or perhaps some rubber padding for underneath. I have yet to see any scratches or have any issues with jamming but I'm just being a bit picky.The utility of this product certainly warrants the money spent!!!
