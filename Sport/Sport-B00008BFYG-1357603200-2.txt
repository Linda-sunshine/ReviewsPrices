review/summary: My son loves it!review/text: This was a Christmas present for my 10 year old son that replaced his older Razor (still in good shape but was a hand down from his older brother) and he thinks it's a great scooter. Razor is a longtime brand made with quality materials, built well, and will last for years. Smooth rolling wheels, strong welds, foldable, and easily adjustable for size. This scooter comes with a small shock absorber up front that is an upgrade from previous generation A2's and the wheelie-bar adds new way for additional tricks.
