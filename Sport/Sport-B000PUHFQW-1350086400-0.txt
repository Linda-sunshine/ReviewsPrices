review/summary: Great Matreview/text: I heard about the odor that is imbedded into the mat, and that can be easily fixed by airing it out. I didn't even need to shower it down. Another note, the mat is slippery especially for yoga. I think I'm nit picking, but they cut the mat a little off. Meaning there are patterns/texture on the mat that signals a straight line, and it was cut slightly off.
