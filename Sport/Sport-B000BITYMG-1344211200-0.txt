review/summary: Don't Buy!!review/text: The 1st one was broken when I received it. I called customer service and sent me another one right away. They were great and I didn't have to return the first. The second one does not give me the confidence that it won't break with use if the 1st one broke in the mail. The wire to hold on to your pedometer is so thin I would not trust it.
