review/summary: Best little pocket knife ever!review/text: Indispensible pocket companion! Incredible little scissors are great for clipping coupons, opening snack pouches, trimming hangnails and "fixing" broken fingernails. The knife blade itself keeps a sharp edge through all sorts of cutting tasks. The blunt end of the fingernail file blade is a useful staple puller or light-duty flat screwdriver. This Victorinox tool is the first one I have owned among similar tools made by other companies that will keep its toothpick and tweezers in place, without fear of losing either. Overall, an excellent value for the price, and I wouldn't think of leaving home without mine with me.
