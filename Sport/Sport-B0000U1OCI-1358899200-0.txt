review/summary: Did what it says!review/text: About a month of usage,I was actually quite worried when I read the reviews. When I first gotten it, i tested it out by walking around my room and it wasnt accurate all the time and that worried me, but when i walked around the house the steps i took tallies with the pedometer!!!!! So I guess it is a matter of steps. I never tried this on a run so I cant comment on that.As for the clip, I thought it was pretty okay.
