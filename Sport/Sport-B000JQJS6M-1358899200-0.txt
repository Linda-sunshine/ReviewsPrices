review/summary: Nice looking, good functioning watchreview/text: This was a gift, so I can only state what my father told me. He really loved the watch, he thinks it looks great and functions well. According to my mother, he acts like a kid with a new tech toy (he's 71). Also, apparently the &#34;automatic&#34; part, which can sometimes be an issue, seems to be working well over the two weeks he's had it, and he hasn't had to wind it.
