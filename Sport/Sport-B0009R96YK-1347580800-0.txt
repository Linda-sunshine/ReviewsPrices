review/summary: Made in USA & it simply works!review/text: Made in USA! Price is reasonable. Seemingly good quality. Clear and concise instructions. Assembles and mounts easily.This mountain bike mirror is just what it says it is. A compact, convex mirror with a head that will mount either above, or below the bar.After riding 5 miles in town with the mirror mounted above and out from the handlebar, I've remounted it below and in. Both positions work equally well but I think I prefer the down and in mount. Very clear view mirror.Purchased from BIKEZILLABIKE SHOP through Amazon. Quick ship & good packaging.
