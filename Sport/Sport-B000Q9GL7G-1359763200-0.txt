review/summary: A great solution for Taurus PT809Creview/text: First off, I love the 809c - compact and with either 12 or 17 round magazine. Surprisingly EXCELLENT trigger. Only one problem - finding a holster. I searched and searched the interwebs for a solution, and finally resigned myself to having to make my own holster with a kit. Not a huge problem, but I just wanted an easy solution for carry around the house, range, etc. and for concealment when wearing a coat. The Blackhawk! Serpa CQC size 30 is your solution, 809C owners. FEDEX dropped it off 20 minutes ago, I opened it, and fully expected to be slightly disappointed with the fit and retention. Nope. The quality is, unsurprisingly, excellent. The 809C fits as if this holster was made specifically for it. Retention is excellent and the indexed trigger finger release is smooth and without a hitch. There is a tiny amount of "slop" when the pistol is in the holster, but it's a slight amount of "up and down" slop that really isn't an issue and may be fixable with some very minor tweaking. I'm completely satisfied with the fit as-is. If you have a Taurus 809C Compact, you will be very happy with the Blackhawk! Serpa CQC Size 30 holster!
