review/summary: Better than a hair shirt, slightly.review/text: This contraption is a tight, uncomfortable device clearly designed by medieval dungeon masters. Moreover it's unreliable and provides a variety of rates until you start sweating. Zero chance I am slathering up with Vaseline to increase the contact points. How about they improve the technology?Luckily it occasional falls off freeing the wearer to run gleefully away.And I often suspect that motion itself registers a heart beat. For example, currently, I have a heart rate of zero. Best resting heart rate ever? Or maybe I am dead? Like Bruce Willis in the Sixth Sense. Looking for red door knobs...And why can't the watch just pick up the beat from all those handy arteries nearby. Even I can do that. What's up with the Chest Strap of Woe?Reluctantly, I must recommend this device. Based on my research it is the best on the market. And it does work (sporadically) well enough to get a general trend of your heart rate. If you are an old fart like me it's critical to wear one of these to avoid a trip to the iron works.It really does help. I hate it, but it's good. I will use it again as soon Iregister a heart beat.
