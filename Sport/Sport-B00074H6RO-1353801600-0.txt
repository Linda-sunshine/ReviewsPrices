review/summary: Love the glovesreview/text: When I started working out with weights, I noticed my hands were sweaty and did not get good grip. So out of fear of having weights fall on me or elsewhere. I purchased these gloves. They are comfortable. After i cut the webbing a bit from another reviewer mentioned. Now i work out and have better grip on the weights.
