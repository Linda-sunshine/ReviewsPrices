review/summary: Excellent knivesreview/text: Kershaw makes excellent knives. That is all I really have to say. I own 2 this being one of the models. Carried Gerber for a long time but have been really pleased with Kershaw. Love the spring assist as it helps if you are trying to do things one handed as well as just a quick open. Love how a lot of their knives are very sleek so they fit in your pocket nicely and you cannot even tell it is there. The blades usually come very sharp out of the box and stay that way after a multitude of uses. Have yet to sharpen this one and I believe I purchased it 8 months ago with almost daily use. Will continue to buy kershaw.
