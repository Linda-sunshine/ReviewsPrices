review/summary: Bottle is okay but does not insulate wellreview/text: PROSThe white 20 oz polar bottle is light, has simple design, and keeps liquid cold for a timeCONAfter placing some ice cubes and cold gatorade in the bottle I was surprised to find condensation on the outside. The conditions were indoors, low humidity and 74 F. The bottle is not as well insulated as I had expected it to be.BOTTOM LINEI will probably use this for running outside 1-2 hr, but will have to see whether it can keep liquid cold enough for that activity.
