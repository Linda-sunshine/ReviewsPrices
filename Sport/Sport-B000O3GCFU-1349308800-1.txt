review/summary: A must have for kids/ lunch boxesreview/text: I have 2 of these I bought from Amazon, and they're the only ones I'm using for my daughter's lunches. Being a health coach, I'm not too fond of a cold PBJ sandwich everyday, so I use these for hot lunches like vegetable balls, meat balls, organic pasta with cheese and more! (And for snacks or fresh fruits/veggie cuts I prefer Bento boxes!)This one we bought for my best friend's baby son. So she can give him the good home cooked meals when she's out, instead of the baby-food in jars
