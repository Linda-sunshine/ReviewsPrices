review/summary: Impressive watch but I can't read the dial!review/text: At first glance a fine watch. It has substantial weight and screw-in stems and the band is easy to adjust if your wrist, like mine, is fairly narrow. It feels and appears to be a much more expensive watch - like many Invictas (at seventy something dollars, it's not expensive at all.) Unlike some of the reviews I have read here, everything on my watch including the chronograph function worked as described and I really was ambivalent about returning the watch. I have three other Invicta watches and my experience with them and Amazon has been very good.I simply couldn't read the dial without spending an extra second or two looking for the hands inside the maze of gold and white. The watch is not as pictured on Amazon. The numbers on the bezel cannot be read unless the light is reflected just right, there is just no contrast between different elements of the dial. The size is also not as described, it's closer to 43mm diameter and 12mm thick so it's not quite a doughnut on you wrist but close. The other similar Speedway watches are correctly described - makes no sense. So I sent it back.
