review/summary: Battery operated, 6 deck shufflerreview/text: We have a pretty avid group of hand and foot canasta players and typically use 6 decks. So this kind of shuffler is a mush. The price is right, and the product does what it is supposed to do, quite well. It would be nice to have an AC version.
