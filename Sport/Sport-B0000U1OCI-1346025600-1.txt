review/summary: It keeps track of everything!review/text: I love it! It is easy to set up and operate. It records total steps, aerobic steps, distance and gives the current time. It also allows you to compare these stats to those of the last 7 days. Moreover, it clips securely to my waistband and has another clip as a back up in case the waistband clip gets dislodged. I am buying more for family.
