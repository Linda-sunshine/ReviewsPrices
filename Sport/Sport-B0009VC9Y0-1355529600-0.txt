review/summary: Great EDCreview/text: I've had this knife for 3 weeks now. I am not disappointed. Right out of the box the blade is super sharp. The knife feels great in my hand, very comportable. The speed assist works perfectly and is really fast in deploying the blade. If you've never owned an A/O knife, be very careful. This is my EDC knife (every day carry). Fits flush in your pocket and is almost unoticable. Sometimes I forget it's there.So far I've used the knife to cut cords and ropes. Cutting duct tape and cutting dead stems off of my outside plants. And it's great for food prep on picnics and camping. It's not the strongest knife out there but it serves it's purpose for me. Just about the only thing that's a drawback for this knife is that it has a smooth finish handle. If it gets wet it may slip out of your grip. But since I use it for minor work it's not a problem for me.I think this is a great EDC knife for the average person. It's pretty strong and has great workmaanship and design. I just wouldn't beat up on it.
