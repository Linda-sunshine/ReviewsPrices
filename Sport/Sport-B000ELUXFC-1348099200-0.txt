review/summary: This is for the weekend riderreview/text: I needed a trunk mount rack to take 2 bikes on a 3 hour trip north. After reading reviews forever I decided to go with this one because it was cheap and seemed like it would work. After reading how to install the rack it only take a few minutes to put on and even less to take off. My bikes aren't the greatest so after getting them on the mount I didn't care that they where touching in areas as long as the mechanics where in good shape. Make sure to tie the wheel so they don't spin and to place a cloth of some sort where the hooks connect to the truck to avoid scratching your vehicle. I drive a 2011 Fusion with a spoiler and it fits over it without a problem. This rack held up on the 3 hours trip to and from and I have taken it to the local trails many times since. One thing to note this is not for smaller, kid, or odd shaped bike so make sure it will fit yours before purchasing. If you want to spend your money on a high end Thule or Saris go for it but if you want to save some cash get this one.
