review/summary: solid little knifereview/text: This was my first assisted-opening knife, and I must say I am impressed. The Leek feels solid and well-made, and it is very thin for easy pocket carry. I have had it for a few weeks now, and it has become a reliable everyday carry knife for me. I have heard that the torsion bars in the assisted-opening mechanism do tend to wear out and break after a couple years of regular use, but Kershaw will replace it for free.Pros:sharp blade with decent steel for the pricesolid lockup with frame lock (no blade play)thin and lightweightcomfortable in pocketgood customer serviceCons:blade shape makes me worry about breaking off the tip of the bladepocket clip doesn't allow for deep carry in pocketthin shape and metal handle can make knife difficult to grip for hard usesafety tab has limited function (but not really needed)Overall, I like the knife and am pleased with my purchase. It's not perfect for every situation, but no knife is. It's hard to beat the Kershaw Leek for the price.
