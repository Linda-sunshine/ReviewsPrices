review/summary: absolutely met my expectationsreview/text: when i was purchasing a bike rack. my main concern was the cost associated with it. I did not want something too expensive. I came across a couple of racks which were pretty expensive. But my concern was about using it on the interstate since I was moving my bike from Missouri to Illinois. A total of 4 hours spent on the interstate. I was skeptical about this rack holding my bike at speeds of 70-75 miles/hr.conclusion: It met my expectation 100 % . No car paint was damaged and it held my bike firm and steady. it did exactly what i expected it to do.
