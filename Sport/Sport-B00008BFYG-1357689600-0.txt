review/summary: Sturdy, great adjustability.review/text: These kick scooters are so great - our kids (ages 2-6) love them. They are durable, the handle bars adjust easily so our 2 year olds can toddle around on them, and our kids have even been able to roll through slush and ice on them without wheels locking up. The ride is so smooth and the platform is very solid. Great product.
