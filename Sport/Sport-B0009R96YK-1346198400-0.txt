review/summary: Simply works.review/text: It's a mirror, and works fine! It's tough as I've taken a fall on my bike before and the glass held up fine, just a few scratches on the plastic, but that's not an issue. Installation was straight forward, and use is also easy. Adjustable while on the move, and provides a great view.
