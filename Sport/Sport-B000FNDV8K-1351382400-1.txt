review/summary: Always Have This With Mereview/text: I've had a small Swiss Army knife in my pocket for as far back as I can remember. I especially like this version of it - so versatile and compact. And cool looking! I'm always losing the toothpick, and the tweezers eventually break, but the core knife is essential for occasionally opening boxes and letters, and filing errant fingernails and cutting paper and labels. I've even used the tiny nail-file as a screwdriver onstage moments before a concert to fix a misbehaving synth rack. A real lifesaver. Bigger tools can do each of those better, but the tool you have with you is the tool you can use. My right pants pocket is never complete without it. Long may it live!
