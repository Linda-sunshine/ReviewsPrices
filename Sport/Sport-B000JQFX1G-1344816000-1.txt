review/summary: Four (4) defective watches in a rollreview/text: The last four Invicta 8926OB have been defective1st - there was a piece of glue hanging from where the crystal attached to the case2nd - the bezel was loose. It was wiggling and got looser by the day.3rd - the bezel was so loose that it rotated clockwise to almost 10 seconds. What I mean is that the bezel should only rotate counter clockwise. It should not rotate clockwise at all.4th - this one was even more loose and rotated even more counter clockwise than the third. On top of that the dial was not on center. That is the face of the watch was off-center.
