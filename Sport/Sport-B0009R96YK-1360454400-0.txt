review/summary: Take care not to lose during transport.review/text: Family member lost his mirror when the bike was on the a car bike rack. Fault likely vibration loosening bolts/screws. To avoid the same problem, I tie a nylon bag around the mirror and over the brake lever.Love using the mirror EXCEPT when mountain biking in the trees. Must remember to bring tightening tool on rides.
