review/summary: Nice Mirrorsreview/text: I bought two. One for my bike and one for my wife's bike. They were easy to install, easy to adjust and they do the job. I have read some reviews of people complaining about bouncing and shaking of bike mirrors. Duh, you're riding a bike while looking in a mirror. What do you expect? If you just glance at it to see what's behind you it works fine. If you are staring at it long enough to be annoyed by bouncing you have bigger problems in front of you than you have behind you. I recommend this mirror. it seems very sturdy, good price and it stays in adjustment as you ride. What more could you want?
