review/summary: Great Strength Training Work outreview/text: I chose this fitness program due to all the hype about it and a desire for the kind of results I had seen some people have. It works, but it is not magic, much sweat and my times of wanting to quit will occur before changes are made. This program taught me that I don't really like slow paced, long strength training work outs, but really love fast paced cardio and Plyo workouts. Since discovering this, I have moved on to Turbo-Fire, but what I learned from P90X helped me to jump right into Turbo-Fire fairly easily. I am still proud of some of the exercises I am able to accomplish now due to P90X. My body results from P90X also helped me see that exercising is not just about looking good (though that is part of it), but also about being able to MOVE! I make can keep up with my elementary and middle school students and can even pass some of them in physical ability. That would never have been said before this program.
