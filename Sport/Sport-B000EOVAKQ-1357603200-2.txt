review/summary: Best Goggles I've Ever Usedreview/text: When I was little, I used snorkle goggles to swim with. Now, I use these. These are way, way better than snorkel goggles.I am an amateur swimmer who hopes to someday participate in a triathlon, but I feel like I'm a freaking champion using professional goggles when I use these. They are crazy comfortable, very bendable and rubbery, and fit wonderfully around my head. They secure snugly around my eye sockets without feeling like they're going to suction my eyeballs out of my head. It's like you're wearing gloves on your eyes because they fit so well, except they're goggles, not gloves.Visibility is high whether you're in or out of the water, and they wrap around your head in a way that allows for good peripheral vision. It'd be helpful in races to see opponents. Also, if a shark is attacking you from behind this feature will likely assist you in evasion tactics.I love how they stay in place securely on my head and around my eyes, and only occasionally does water get in when I push off the wall or do a sweet underwater ninja move.Although these are extremely streamlined and highly useful at keeping water out of your eyes, the most outstanding facet you'll notice is the comfort, and you'll notice this as soon as you put them on. You could probably watch TV with them and not even realize you're wearing goggles. I might try that tonight.**UPDATE** Do not watch TV with them - it is not as enjoyable as you might think. Just use them for swimming.
