review/summary: Something just seems offreview/text: The scooter has had only one use, but it should be enough for this review.It works, it gets you from place A to place B provided you have the leg strength and the leg endurance, especially the leg endurance since you'll feel every small bump on whatever surface you're traveling on. On top of that, the steering is a bit wonky: everything I did, whether it be a push forward or a slight turn, would make the steering rapidly switch left and right despite holding the handlebars stable; I was afraid the whole handlebar would turn a sharp 90 and send me flying forward.
