review/summary: worth itreview/text: I have used these since my freshmen year in high school band. In october for us it got cold and a lot of use used these and always worked. Most people fail to read if they don't heat up fast, expose them to air and shake them. They will heat up fast. If that doesn't work, rub your hands together on the hand warmer
