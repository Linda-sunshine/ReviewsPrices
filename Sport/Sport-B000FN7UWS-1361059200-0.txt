review/summary: great bottle, cap works well till the vent falls out.review/text: This is my daily take to work bottle. it fits in my large cup holder in my car. I have the poly sport cap and am very happy with it until the vent plug fell out in the dishes. It took about a year for the plug to come out but I got a nasty surprise when I went to take my first drink from the canteen after the plug (check valve) came out and had water splash on my face and run onto my shirt. Now that I know its out and will leak I just put the vent on the top side and make sure that while its up I am sucking water out. Or I put my thumb over the hole while drinking.I use this for water, tea (hot and cold) and other mixed fruit drinks. It has not stained or rusted over the 18 months I have owned it. I liked it enough that I bought a second one.
