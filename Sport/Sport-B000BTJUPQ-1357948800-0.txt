review/summary: happy 8 yr old = happy momreview/text: this really worked out. not knowing what i was getting (first time archery mom) i was more than happy to have ended up with this lil banshee jr. my 8 yr old daughter loves her bow and after a few times out and getting a few pointers has been able to make this bow really work for her. the only thing that would make it better would be more arrows!
