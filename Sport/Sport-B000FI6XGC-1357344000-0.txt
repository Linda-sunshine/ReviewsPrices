review/summary: A great &#34;on the road&#34; pump.review/text: This is a quick and easy to use pump, it doesn't take long to get a tire up to ~100 PSI. It has no gauge, so it's primarily an emergency pump. Look up a youtube video of how to change it to your tire type if it doesn't fit as it arrives - the instructions included were less than helpful, but it works fine once you figure it out.
