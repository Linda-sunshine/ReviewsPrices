review/summary: Track your jogs using this Pedometer!!review/text: Hi! I bought this pedometer for my wife who subscribed to south beach diet and need to track her walks/jogs and record them. This pedometer was the perfect thing for her as it is small, weightless and easy to carry around. It also records past 6 days of details of your workouts. The only issue that she is facing is that the readings are bit awkwardly programmed. If only the way it displays the information could be simpler, this would have been a great product. For now, this will do but I am going to need to upgrade her as and when required.
