review/summary: good, simple lightreview/text: This light is simple, durable, and it runs on AAA batteries. I like that it comes with a seatstay mount (very useful on a commuter with a rack) and that is has a clip. I just snaped it to the back of my saddle bag and that was it. If I wear a backpack or ride a different bike I can just clip it to whatever and go. Very bright too. No need for anything more in a tail light.
