review/summary: OMRON HJ -112 DIGITAL POCKET PEDOMETERreview/text: THIS POCKET PEDOMETER WORKS VERY WELL WHEN I KEEP IT IN MY POCKET. HOWEVER I CAN'T CONFIRM ITS ACCURACY, WHICH PROBABLY ISN'T TOO IMPORTANT ANYWAY. MY ONLY FAULT WITH THE UNIT IS A COUPLE OF THE FUNCTIONS ARE NOT COVERED WELL IN THE MANUAL PROVIDED. ALSO,IT'S A BIT TRICKY SETTING UP INITIALLY. ALL IN ALL I'M SATISFIED THAT I KNOW HOW MANY STEPS I'VE TAKEN AND THE DISTANCE I'VE WALKED. IT'S SMALLER AND LIGHTER THAN I WAS EXPECTING AND THE CLOCK KEEPS VERY ACCURATE TIME. I THINK IT'S WELL WORTH THE PRICE FROM AMAZON
