review/summary: Works for me ...review/text: I work out for aerobic purposes on a stationary bike and without some feedback I don't know if I am hitting my target. I wanted a simple device to monitor my heart rate and this device achieves this purpose. It came packaged with a foam plug which fits the watch band which I used to mount it on the handlebars of the bike and now I can constantly monitor my heart rate and ensure I am not slacking off and staying at the desired heart rate. Good product at a good price, recommended...
