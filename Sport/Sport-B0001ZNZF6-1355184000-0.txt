review/summary: Give-N-Go Boxersreview/text: I am new to ExOfficio Give-N-Go boxers but have worn boxer shorts since my teens. Boxers are clearly my prefered choice of underwear. The reason for this purchase (3 pairs) is for backpacking, which at 61 years old, I am also new to. So, I did plenty of research on all aspects of clothing. To date I have only worn these boxers on short walks in the Pyrenees, where I live and found them to be perfect. The gusseted crotch makes for comfortable walking and there was no riding up of the legs. I can also say that for normal day to day wear they are a delight. Very comfortable with a cool luxurious feel, leg length just right (for me) and easy to wash and dry. Perhaps care needs to be taken with the type of trousers that they are worn with as one pair, worn for day to day use with corduroys, bobbled in the seat area first time on. Worn with typical hiking pants they show no such problem. Were it not for this slight disappointment and the fact that they are a little pricey, I would have awarded 5 stars. I will keep a few cotton boxers, given the slight problem above, however, that aside, Give-N-Go boxers will now be my choice for everyday use, such is the level of comfort.
