review/summary: THIS is the one you want!review/text: I have had the Mirrycle MTB on my bike for five years or so and have never had a problem with it. Unlike the Blackburn Multi-Mirror that I tried on my wife's bike, it stays firmly attached on the bar end and can be quickly folded out of harm's way when parking or navigating tight places. After the bad experience with the Blackburn, I found the Mirrycle here on Amazon at a cheaper price than I'd paid for the Blackburn. Installing it drove home just how superior its mounting system is: the support arm is rock solid, while the mirror assembly swivels easily.I recall that when I first installed the Mirrycle on my bike I needed to do some tightening up of the mirror mounts (but not the main mounting bar) after a couple of weeks, but after that there's no problem at all.So, if you want to see what sorts of dangers are coming up behind you (e.g., drivers in over-sized vehicles chatting away on their mobile phones while sipping a coffee), THIS is the way to go.
