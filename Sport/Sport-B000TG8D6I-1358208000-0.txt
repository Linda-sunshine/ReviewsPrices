review/summary: Wow!review/text: I'm new to the program, but trying to build up my workouts. Thought this one would be way above my means, but Tony Horton actually gives you excellent advice along the way about building up and what to do when your body is tired. So far, so good. Second week and I'm still on it! Also comes with a lot of other information and tools to help you get where you want to be.
