review/summary: Good tackiness, great value for the pricereview/text: Previously I was using a mat that cost about twice as much as YogaAccessories and I think I prefer the YogaAccessories. It has decent tackiness for a non-sticky mat (I still need a towel sometimes but I needed one for my previous mat too), no chemical odors and the color is very nice (I got the Slate Blue). Overall great value for the price.
