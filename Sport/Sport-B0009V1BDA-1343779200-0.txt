review/summary: Awesome Grill! Dont be fooled by what others are saying.review/text: This grill is awesome. Easy to clean, easy to cook on, just the right size for an apartment deck. Others have said that you cant cook with the top down, THEY ARE DEAD WRONG! I cooked for a good hour with the top down and heat on high just to test it out and it worked just fine. I even forgot to slide the tables out a couple times and nothing happened.If i could give 6 stars I would.
