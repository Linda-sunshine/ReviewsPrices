review/summary: Great Holster for the FNP-9!review/text: They do not make this holster to specifically fit the FNP-9. I called Blackhawk and they said the Glock 19 model holster would fit my weapon with a small, one screw removal modification. I bought it and it fits my weapon superbly. I would recommend it to anyone needing a secure holster. Don't listen to the "un-safe" claims some folks on Youtube are trying to make, unless you are in need of a chuckle. The truth is that you can make ANY product unsafe if you are a complete moron. This holster is safe and well made with a great design.
