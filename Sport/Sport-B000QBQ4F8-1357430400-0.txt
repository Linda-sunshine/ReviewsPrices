review/summary: Just what I wantedreview/text: I got these for a Christmas present after seeing them in a store. They are as great as the name behind them. I love them. The only thing I don't like is they don't stay on top of your head well if you hair is in a ponytail. They will fall off the back of your head...fortunately I or someone else has caught them. If you looking for great quality and really cute design, these are for you too.
