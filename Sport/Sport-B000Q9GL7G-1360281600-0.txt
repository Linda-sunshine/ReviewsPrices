review/summary: Good fit and finish.review/text: I bought this holster for my father and he loves it. The paddle isn't much more comfortable than the belt clip so either way you go, you can't go wrong. The Paddle IS uncomfortable when sitting, but that's the only bad thing we have found about it. If it only came with one or the other, I would have given it a lower rating.
