review/summary: not rugged enoughreview/text: this knife is an amazingly sharp knife and it is made well.... but it is not rugged, its too thin and brittle to use as a all purpose outdoors knife. this is sharp and precise knife but not tough, it will break if you try to put longitudinal stress on it
