review/summary: the greatest thing I have ever purchasedreview/text: The Invicta Men's 8926OB Pro Diver Collection Coin-Edge Automatic Watch has made me a god among men. I am a plebeian no more. I purchased this watch and immediately got 5 miles better gas mileage, knew 10 percent more French vocabulary, and watched men and women fall to their knees in awe of my effervescent prowess. I replaced the band with a 20mm black and gray NATO style band and dove to the bottom of a lake to rescue a drowning monk seal, searching for twelve minutes without needing a breath. Right now, I have the original band back on and love it, but it is hard to type because my Scandinavian runway model girlfriend Frieda continues to pull my wrist away from the keyboard in order to gaze at the elaborate timepiece on my wrist. I ooze with the appeal of a learned and traveled man. Plus it was on sale.
