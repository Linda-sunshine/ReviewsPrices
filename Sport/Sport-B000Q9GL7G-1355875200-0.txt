review/summary: Blackhawk serpa cqc for glock 17review/text: I debated back and forth over the blackhawk serpa vs the fobus holster. I ended up going with the serpa because of the design. I am satisfied with the form and function of the holster although concealing it can be difficult at times. That being said I am carrying a glock 17 which is not exactly a small frame pistol. The paddle is the primary form I use vs the belt attachment. No complaints sliding the holster into place. It is a nice snug fit, and it doesn't seem to move once in place. I have no problems with the index finger release. Some say it is a safety hazard. I feel when used properly it sets your trigger finger up for appropriate indexing. I understand a quick draw for self defense but don't get ahead of yourself by lodging a bullet in your own limb. Use common sense and all is well. My reason for a 4/5 star rating is the slight movement I've noticed when the gun is holstered. The movement is front to back. Not a big deal but noticeable at times. I would recommend this holster for those who want more than a friction fit and would like the option of belt loop attachment as well as an included paddle attachment.
