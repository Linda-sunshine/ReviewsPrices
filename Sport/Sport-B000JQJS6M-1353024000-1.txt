review/summary: Chronometer Level Accuracyreview/text: While not a chronometer, the japanese automatic movement, after the first day use, is showing only -3 to -4 seconds per day. That is approx 99.997% accuracy, and about the same as my Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean (certified chronometer). Not bad for an $83 watch with an automatic movement!It's a very beautiful timepiece. I like the INVICTA stamp on the left edge of the case.My only complaint is the crown/stem feels a bit grainy and cheap when you wind it, but still 5 stars for the price (my seamster's crown glides like silk). I have no doubt the gold plating will wear and fade, but i can just always replace it with the same or different Invicta model.Pull the trigger!
