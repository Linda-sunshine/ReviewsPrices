review/summary: Plastic parts came offreview/text: I received the helmet in the mail and opened it to try it. When I put it on I realized that the big plastic part on the top was loose and moving.When I slightly lift it it came out completely. Also the one of black plastic parts on two sides dropped by itself. I can see the glue under the plastic parts. I looked at the same item at Target before buying it Amazon.com and they looked very firm and there was nothing loose. I requested a replacement.Check yours when it arrives.
