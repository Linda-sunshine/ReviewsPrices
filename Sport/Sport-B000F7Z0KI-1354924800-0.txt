review/summary: Keeps coldreview/text: First off, the interior wrapped of installation works great. Keeps my water cold for hours while riding in the summer time (avg temp around 90 F). The little handle is helpful, only takes a finger to lift it out of place. Works great in a tight spot, where the 24 oz bottle won't fit.
