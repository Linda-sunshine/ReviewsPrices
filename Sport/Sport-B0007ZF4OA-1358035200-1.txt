review/summary: Warm hands and feetreview/text: I live in northern Idaho and would not be without these - use them in boots and for my hands. I carry them in my car and purse and give them for Christmas presents AND stuff stockings with them. A must for winter &#34;emergency kits&#34; and for just staying comfortable in cold weather. Last for years without going bad - buy them by the bulk so you never run out. I keep them out in the mud room and everyone grabs a pair before heading out into the cold.
