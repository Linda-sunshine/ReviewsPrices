review/summary: Hot stays hot, cold stays cold, for HOURS.review/text: This is so great for commuters! The lid fastens securely and there is NO leakage from this cup. I can toss this in my purse or backpack, drop it, shake it, whatever, and it doesn't spill a drop. The contents stay at temperature for an incredibly long time. I packed up tea one morning and forgot about it. That evening I opened up the thermos and it was still steaming. I bought one for my mom who took it on vacation to Virginia Beach in June. She filled it with ice water before heading out for a day on the beach in 100degree weather. There was STILL ice in it at the end of the day! I used mine so much that after 2 years the clip mechanism broke and I need to buy another one. Same thing happened to my mom's, but some failure is to be expected after daily use for years. You may feel it is pricey for a travel mug, but believe me - you will NOT be disappointed. As a matter of fact, I'm logging on to buy another to replace mine, right now.
