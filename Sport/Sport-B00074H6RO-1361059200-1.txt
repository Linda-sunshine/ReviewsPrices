review/summary: Meh, it hurts the webbing b/w my fingersreview/text: The glove I got fits okay (only a tiny bit loose), but the fitting isn't the problem. The gloves dig into the webs between your fingers and when your hand start sweating, it really starts to sting and hurt.Stopped using them but still giving 3 stars because they're well made.
