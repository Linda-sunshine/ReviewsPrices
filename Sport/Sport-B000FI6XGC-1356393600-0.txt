review/summary: Light and Fantasticreview/text: Versatile, compact and light, and most reliable, Topeak's Pocket Rocket is the best hand pump you can carry on your bike. The Pocket Rocket lives up to its name for high pressure tires in reaching 115 psi so quickly that you don't have to keep -- uh -- pumping. The dual Presta-Schrader head fits all tubes. but it is especially gentle for those delicate Presta valves. Experienced cyclists know the worst thing that happens on a bike ride is to incur a flat tire and then ruin the good tube needed for the repair with a pump that breaks the Presta valve.
