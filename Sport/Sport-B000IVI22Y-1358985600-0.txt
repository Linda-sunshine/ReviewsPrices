review/summary: The BEST water bottlereview/text: This Camelbak water bottle is the most valuable purchase I've ever made on Amazon. It cost about $15 with shipping but it was so worth it. The bite valve straw allows you to drink with one or even no hands at times! Some people have complained about the bite valve being hard to use but it just takes about a day to get used to. It also doesn't leak which is important for bottles with straws. I can't recommend this bottle enough. It's the easiest, most handy water bottle out there.
