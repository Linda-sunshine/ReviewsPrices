review/summary: Nice productreview/text: Everything was there and in good working order. I was really only interested in the DVDs, but all the booklets were there too and in good shape. I have used the plans about when to do which work outs. These are really good workouts. I like the counter on the screen that lets you know where you are in the work out, and the options to turn off the music and excess commentary.
