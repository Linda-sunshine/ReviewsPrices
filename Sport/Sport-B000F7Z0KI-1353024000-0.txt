review/summary: Nice bottle for bikingreview/text: This bottle is not going to keep your drink cold for too long, but what I have noticed is that it keeps it from getting to the point where the water is so hot its no longer satisfying. It keeps it at a cool temperature for a couple hours, or longer if you pack it with ice. The removable pull top is a nice feature for cleaning and the built in hook is a good handle to grab the bottle. Have not had any leaking problems and I own 3 of them.
