review/summary: runs smallreview/text: Definitely buy one size larger than you normally wear if you want a little room and two sizes larger if you want them to be very roomy. My son wears a XL to XXL depending upon the brand and I ended up buying the XXXL.Otherwise, they appear to be of good quality and the best value I found. Very comfy for lounging around the house and nice to have two deep pockets for your cell phone and misc.
