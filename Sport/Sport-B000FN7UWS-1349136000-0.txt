review/summary: The bottle leaksreview/text: I bought this bottle with the poly sport cap for my son to use in school on a daily basis. The bottle has really nice color and feels a bit more sturdy than the SIGG bottles I have bought in the past.However,the bottle leaks no matter how hard I try to tighten the cap - whenever the bottle is not upright,it starts leaking slowly but instantly - not enough to lose most of the water in the bottle but more than enough to wet whatever container it is in. So bags/backpacks get wet.Leaking seem to be such a basic quality issue that I didn't expect any leaking for Klean Kanteen (and have never bought a bottle that leaked). With this "defect" product that is under $20, it seems exchanging/returning is a lot of hassle. So I have kept the bottle. I will be very hesitant to buy another one in the future and wouldn't recommend it based on my, hopefully less common, experience.
