review/summary: Nicereview/text: My son takes his in his lunch box with soup, and likes it. He says his soup is still warm at lunch. I put hot water in it before filling it with the hot soup just to get it warmed up first. Seems to do the trick! The lid is. A little hard for I'm to screw back on straight though( he's six).
