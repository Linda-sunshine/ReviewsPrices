review/summary: Fits great on my 2013 Kia Fortereview/text: Previously bought the Allen Deluxe Spare Tire Mount for my Jeep. After selling my jeep last month for a 2013 Forte I wanted to keep the same brand. Bought this to use. Fits great onto the trunk on my car. Holds my bike just as good as the spare tire model does.
