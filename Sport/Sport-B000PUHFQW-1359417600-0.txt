review/summary: Great purchasereview/text: I ordered the grey mat and love it. It's a little bit lighter in color than I hoped, but it's just the color so oh well.I don't have any other mats to compare it, but it's not slippery, and keeps me in position when there's tough yoga moves.Love this and I recommend it!
