review/summary: Good knifereview/text: Its an okay knife i didnt know that is would be so small though. its my first knife i ever bought. i would but it on my keychain when i go out. i got my package on time. it cuts well too. the other tools are nice aswell. but i think i would have rather gotten a bigger knife because i keep losing it. but thats just me
