review/summary: great workoutreview/text: A friend gave me the pirated copies of these videos and they were starting to wear down, so I asked for them as a gift. I do like all of the P90X workouts (P90Xplus and P90X2) and find they get results. Once you've done the videos as recommended it's fun to pick and choose a combination of P90X, P90Xplus, and P90X2 and come up with your own weekly workout. They aren't for beginners or someone who isn't dedicated to working out and sticking with a program.
