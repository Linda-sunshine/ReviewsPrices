review/summary: great bottle; it even squeaksreview/text: This water bottle is exceptional quality. The only drawback is when you drink from it, the relief valve chirps. The remedies for solving it don't work or randomly keep it from working. If you are using it inside around others, you might get slapped. Outisde or by yourself, no big deal. We bought 5 of them for Christmas and my daughters refuse to use them as they annoy them to much and hurt their &#34;coolness&#34; at school.Other than the squeak - great bottle!
