review/summary: Wonderful from Day 1review/text: I ordered this chair for my work desk at the suggestion of my chiropractor. He thought it would be good for my spine overall, even though most of my work stress gets centered in my neck and cervical spine areas.My boss actually assembled the chair for me. I had trouble with the pump. It's a simple thing, with no backstop to keep air from escaping the ball while you're pulling the tube to get more air. So, when pumping, you've just gotta pump really fast. Also, the pump tube overheats when you do this. My boss used a little chapstick on the tube to loosen the motion and that worked beautifully.It really does help to improve your posture. I used it comfortably for 7 hours on the first day. I was shocked to notice that I had no neck, shoulder, or upper cervical pain that day because my posture was so much better!I still take my motion breaks for exercises to relieve the repetitive stress on neck/shoulders due to sitting at a keyboard all day. But this balance ball chair will be the long-term perfect complement to those intentional exercises.And while I'm away from my desk for a few days, everyone else in the office is trying it too!
