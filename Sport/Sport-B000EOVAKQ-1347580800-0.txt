review/summary: Good gogglesreview/text: This is a very good product. I have used speedo products before, and always had problems with adjustments. But with this goggle, adjusting is very easy, and it is comfortable to wear it. It does not put unnecessary pressure on eyes. The only problem with this goggle is it gets foggy after 45 mins to 1 hours swimming. But just washing it with water clears the fog. Overall it is great.
