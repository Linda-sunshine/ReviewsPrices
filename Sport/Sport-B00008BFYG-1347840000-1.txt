review/summary: perfect scooterreview/text: I purchased this scooter for my 5 year old grandson. His 7 year old twin sisters have the same scooters. He immediately got on it and rode with no problem. It was a wonderful purchase and since I have made purchases thru Amazon many times I have always been extremely satisfied and I will continue to do so. The delivery is always prompt as well.
