review/summary: 2 weeks straight on vacationreview/text: Had 3 pairs which I used every day and night for 14 days while traveling in Ireland. Washed and dried very easily. Very comfortable. Considering buying more and using it every day. Some wear noted on one pair in the crotch so I have some concern about it's long term use.
