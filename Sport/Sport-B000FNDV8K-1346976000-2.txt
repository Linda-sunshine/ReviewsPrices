review/summary: I love these.review/text: I love these things. Perfect for a keychain. Has exactly the tools you need, and nothing more. Small as you can get to have the tools you need.Funny story, I always have one of these on my keychain and I forgot to take it off when I was getting on a plane. It was confiscated, so I used my phone on the way to the terminal to order a new one with Amazon Prime, and it was waiting at my doorstep when I got home. I heart capitalism.
