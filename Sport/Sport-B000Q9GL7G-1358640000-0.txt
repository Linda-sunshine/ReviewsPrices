review/summary: Very nice fitreview/text: I'm no expert, but was very pleased with the fit and quality. It would be nice to be able to cant the weapon a little easier with notches or the like. I'm sure they thought about it, so it must not be a viable option or I just didn't find the model that would. Oh well, I'm happy with it anyway.
