review/summary: Ok, but not the pillow of my dreamsreview/text: I originally purchased this pillow for backpacking and it wasn't the only item I realized was too heavy and/or bulky on that first trip (but that's a whole 'nother story). It ended up being a bit too bulky for backpacking and not quite as big/comfortable as I would like for car camping so my use of it will probably be limited. Last time I did use it I dropped it in the dirt when packing up and it survived cleaning via a washer/dryer cycle so that's a plus. If you don't have enough room for a full size pillow but don't need to conserve every cubic inch this may be the pillow for you. For backpacking I went with the inflatable Thermarest pillow and couldn't be happier with it.
