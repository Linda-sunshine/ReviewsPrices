review/summary: Nice, but annoying long in the crotch (for a short guy)review/text: These are very soft and comfortable. I did my best to shrink the heck out of them, as I'm only 5'3&#34;, and these could easily fit someone 4-6&#34; taller. Ignore the waist sizing. I'm a 32&#34;, and I have plenty of room to spare. They're very stretchy. The leave a LOT of lint behind in the drier, so they may disintegrate over time. If so, I will lower my rating. Otherwise, I like the deep pockets, the color, and they're warm. If I keep them long enough, maybe I'll like the fact that I can easily pull them up to my rib-cage, but at this point in my life (and not being a youngster), I like my pants to sit at my waist, and the crotch to end somewhere near my, um crotch. These either hang down, or I roll-up the top to make them fit nicer. If anyone knows of a better cut pocket sweat w/elastic bottoms, please do share!
