review/summary: Unbeatable combo! Made in the USA!review/text: This set of Lodge Cast Iron cookware is an unbeatable combo for nearly any type of skillet and deep frying use. The lid/skillet fits well and the deep skillet is great for deep frying or baking bread. The handles make it easy to use in spite of the considerable weight when both pieces are combined. 100% made in the USA. I highly recommend this combo to anyone who will use cast iron skillets, the extra utility of using the small skillet for a lid is priceless and the cost of this set is very reasonable. The cast iron is flawless, it heats evenly and comes already seasoned from the factory. Overall an outstanding set of cast iron cookware for a reasonable price and I highly recommend it.
