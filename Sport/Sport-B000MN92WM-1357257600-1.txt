review/summary: Great inexpensive tool for fitnessreview/text: I really like this little thing. It is an excellent tool for motivating me when I haven't gotten much activity due to being behind a desk all day. I've had mine for almost 2 years now and it has been dropped multiple times and even gone in the pool for a very short amount of time (jumped out right away) and it is still working great. It is very durable, I love the goals setting and download/tracking capabilities. The only thing I dislike is that it can come off from my trousers if the waistband is set more at hip level - not a problem when it is at waist level. I would recommend tethering it to a belt loop or putting it in your pocket if you have the same issue. I would definitely buy it again though!
