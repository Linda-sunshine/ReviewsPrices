review/summary: Handyreview/text: This are great for carrying in my pocketbook- I mainly use the nail file and scissors, but sometimes the blade and screwdriver come in handy, too. The toothpicks and tweezers usually end up lost, at least that has been my experience over many years with Swiss Army knives.
