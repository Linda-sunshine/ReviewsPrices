review/summary: Ice rink when it's wet.review/text: I like the thickness; I have bony knees.That said, I tried out a warmer yoga class, and this mat got ice-rink levels of slippery when it got wet. I've never had troubles with it doing yoga at 70F, but at 85F+, downward dog became a quick way to injury; my feet took off, and I twisted my wrist trying to catch myself... then did it again. Ow.Will keep using this for more relaxing stretching and yoga, but won't waste my money paying for a hot yoga class if this mat is all I have.
