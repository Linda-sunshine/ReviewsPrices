review/summary: Quick and painlessreview/text: Review on the seller: Speedy delivery! I got my p90x within 3 days of me ordering it! I was expecting at least 5 days so I didn't go to my mailbox but when I did, the paper in my box had a date from 2 days before and I couldn't believe it! Everything was in the package and in great condition. I'm a happy customer :)A review on the product: p90x is really challenging and definately will take you out of your comfort zone to help you grow and become more strong and lean. Honestly, though, trying to break a sweat in your living room is really hard and not as Motivating as if the setting was in a gym. Also, not having some one to train with made me feel less driven. I suggest to not get bands but instead to use weights. I am in a lull right now because of a work related injury, but plan to get back into working out once I'm all better!
