review/summary: Okay Performancereview/text: These briefs provide decent performance. They do dry fairly easily and are comfortable, however over time my pair have stretched out. I'm a fairly lanky guy, and so this comes as a surprise to me, as I'm not sure why they are suddenly ballooning out and looking generally depressed. I own two other pairs of 'quick dry' boxer briefs, and they have held up their beatings without any qualms.For the price, I can honestly say I'm disappointed in them.
