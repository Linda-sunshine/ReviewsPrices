review/summary: Poor designreview/text: What people say about adjusting the length is true. I had pliers, wrenches, and the works and still adjusting the length was a major problem. Also, the rope had been so tightly wound (and too quickly packaged) that it seriously still has a crooked shape when extended. Very poor manufactoring/packaging. The bearings are nice though, and the rope otherwise works. I recommend it only for people who at 6'5" and don't have to adjust the length.
