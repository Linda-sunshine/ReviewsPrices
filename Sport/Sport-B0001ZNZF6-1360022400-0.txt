review/summary: Not bad, but you are nuts if you dont wash these.review/text: Exactly was I was looking for, a dri fit type standard boxer. It works great.Marketing wise, and from some reviews, people like to wear these multiple times without washing. This is sweat wicking material and all sweat wicking material absorbs the stench of sweat. Dont fool yourself, wash them if you dont want to stink.Good price on here as well. Other alternatives which are along the same lines, but a bit softer, are the ones rei branded boxers.
