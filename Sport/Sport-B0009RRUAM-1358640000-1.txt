review/summary: Too bulkyreview/text: I'm not overly impressed with this pillow. For one thing I prefer softer pillows, and it does not compress easily. I found it very difficult to roll back up. I have a fleece sleeping bag liner that rolls up smaller, is far more comfortable, easier to travel with, and works as a blanket or pillow. I wouldn't recommend this.
