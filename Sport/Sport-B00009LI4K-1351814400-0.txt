review/summary: Greatreview/text: I got these for my son who sometimes has trouble focusing when reading or doing homework. These earphones block out the sounds from the rest of the house to help him concentrate. They work like a charm and are very comfortable. His sister was very jealous and has requested her own pair. Reasonably priced too.
