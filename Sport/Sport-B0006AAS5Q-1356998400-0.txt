review/summary: A very good looking watchreview/text: This looks very good. I did not give it 5 stars is because the instructions are inaccurate which is a little frustrating. However, it does not take too much effort to work out what to do. The only other thing I would change is the fact that it has gold dials in it and then the hands are gold which makes it a little difficult to read in certain lighting conditions. Otherwise, I love it.
