review/summary: comfortablereview/text: I found this very comfortable to sleep on. Some people complained about the lumpy factor and that didn't really bother me. Yes, you can feel that there are small pieces of foam and that's not one big piece of foam like a normal pillow, but when actually lying on it, it's not that noticeable or a big deal. Also, the more time it has to air out and expand, the better it is. This worked for my needs but I did find it impossible to squish it down as tightly as when I very first got it. I still prefer this to an inflatable pillow. I got the medium size which was comfortable but not very small when packing my carry-one. I did take it on a plane, but I think if you are looking for something for back-packing or frequent plane travel, you might consider the small size.
