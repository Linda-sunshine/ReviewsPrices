review/summary: Good Inexpensive Glovesreview/text: These are pretty decent gloves. They are thin and light weight. The back is a neoprene and the front is a type of rubber. The nice part of these gloves is that you can use touch screen devices with them. I feel like the middle finger is slightly short. Also, the seams at the tip of your fingers can feel awkward after wearing for a while. At $16 I'd buy them again but not for much more then that.
