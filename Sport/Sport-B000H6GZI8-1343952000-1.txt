review/summary: works well on revolverreview/text: I bought this product hoping for the best and it fits the new EAA windicator 357. As anyone who has one knows finding a Hogue is difficult for this revolver but this works well as long as you take your time and work at it. It fits well as long as you line up the 1st finger groove and don't mind the build up there.
