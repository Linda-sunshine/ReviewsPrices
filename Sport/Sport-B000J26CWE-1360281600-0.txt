review/summary: Comfortable, but a bit big...review/text: Having worn injinji toe-socks for over two years now, I have come to expect that the socks are originally a bit larger than needed, but shrink considerably after several washings;buy big, wash often, and eventually they will be the right size for your foot.If you buy the 'right' size out of the box, they will become too small and you will be stretching them out to fit onto your foot, which has to weaken the threads and cause them to wear out sooner than designed, and definitely sooner than desired.Unfortunately, I can't find any relevant competitors.
