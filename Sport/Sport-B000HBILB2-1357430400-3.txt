review/summary: I enjoy sleeping on this airbed...super comfy...review/text: I bought this air bed for the purpose of daily use for 3 to 4 month period, so my point of view is from keeping it inflated since day 1. The bed was super easy to inflate. Just plug in the attached cord in an outlet, make sure the valve is turned towards closed to keep in the air, and press the on switch on the bed. In under 3 minutes my bed was inflated to my desired firmness. I've been using the bed for about a month, and so far so good. I sleep comfortably, and I'm no featherweight either, so it's important to me that the bed be able to provide support, which it does. I would highly recommend this bed so far. Will update if a problem develops but so far, after a month of daily use, it's still going strong.
