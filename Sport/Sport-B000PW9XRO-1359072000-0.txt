review/summary: Great for shootingreview/text: I have used these gloves for rifle shooting and pistol shooting. When you spend an entire weekend shooting, especially when you haven't for awhile and/or you are using a new rifle or new grip, gloves really help save your hands from unnecessary wear, tear, and blisters. They also do a great job of protecting your hands from serious burns. Those barrels get HOT!My hands do get sweaty in there. I'd like to give them 4.5 stars, but I don't know how easy it is to keep hands from getting sweaty when they are in gloves like this for so long. And the price is right. I haven't noticed any significant wear yet. If and when I damage them or start to wear them out I'll report back.
