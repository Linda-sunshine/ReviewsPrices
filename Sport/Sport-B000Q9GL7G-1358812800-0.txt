review/summary: wrong itemreview/text: they sent me the wrong item i asked for the carbon fiber 5&#34; holster i got a plain black 4&#34; holster. then they say too bad you have to wait . even tho i ordered it in proper time allowing them to ship it. i waited forever and got the wrong item. so i had to go to a competition with the wrong holster
