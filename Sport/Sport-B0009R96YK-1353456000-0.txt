review/summary: Easy installation and adjustmentreview/text: Went on quickly and I only tightened the screws all the way on the third day after doing re-adjustments while riding.Now it stays put and I only once needed to re-adjust when someone seemingly bumped it while being parked.Sometimes fogs up on cold mornings - but I presume that all glass mirrors will do that if not treated with anti-fog stuff...
