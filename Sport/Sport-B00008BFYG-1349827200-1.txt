review/summary: Just a blast for our kidsreview/text: what would summertime be like without bikes, skateboards and scooters? Our kids went through a succession of each, and we've had three of four razor scooters over the years. These things just keep on ticking no matter what our kids do to them, and that is a good thing. Fun time, get one for your kids!
