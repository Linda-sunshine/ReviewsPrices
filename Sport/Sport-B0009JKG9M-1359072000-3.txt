review/summary: AWESOME iron!!review/text: I grill year round...It rains a LOT in Oregon!!...Cast iron RULES!!!...And Lodge is KING!!...The grill pan is a MUST have(!!!) and skillets are a necessity...Dutch ovens helped build America and Lodge is made here!!...let's do the math...IRON vs. aluminum/Teflon???...both non-stick, but...IRON ISN'T being phased out!!...On a camp trip, with this...you can do "mountain man breakfast" AND pancakes!! I own a LOT of Lodge and NOTHING'S BETTER!!...(PS...I'm a machinist...I do well...I don't work for Lodge...they just make my life better!!)...:-)
