review/summary: So far, so good.review/text: At first I thought the ball was going to be too hard but it has been a couple of weeks now and is softening up some. Everyone who sees it is enticed to try it out and the comments are mostly positive. If it works to strengthen my core, I will be so happy I bought it. It went together quite easily and I like the way it rolls. I took the advice on another review to place the locks in the rear which was helpful. So far, I am liking it but take an occasional break to my regular therapy ball without the frame as it is a bit softer still. I am hoping the Gaiam Balance Ball will soften up even more as it is used. I had to add air only once so far. I only wish there would have been included with the package a measuring string of some sort to help me know I have it at the correct optimal size. For now, I am keeping it and using it regularly.
