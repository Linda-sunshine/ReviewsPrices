review/summary: Tinyreview/text: Great for emergencies, a little tricky to figure out (switch down - as in the picture = open/ switch UP = closed) since its reverse from natural common sense. Also tricky to engage a Presta valve, but I mostly blame the French for that. Its tiny, doesnt bother when I ride and hides behind my water bottle holder.I would suggest getting a floor pump for regular use though. And also a little disappointed that Topeak sells a pump without a pressure gage attached!
