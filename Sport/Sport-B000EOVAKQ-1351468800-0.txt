review/summary: Fits poorly when they're not leakingreview/text: These seemed like such a great deal from all the glowing reviews. However, they never really worked for me. They constantly leaked, and the only way that I could get them to stop leaking was to wear them extremely tight and to mash them into my eyes. This stopped the leaking, but, as other reviewers have noted, they were so close to my eyes that it caused significant physical pain during long swims. They had to be so tightly fastened that they would leave deep gashes in my cheeks for hours after use. A month after dealing with these I'm back to looking for a new pair of goggles.
