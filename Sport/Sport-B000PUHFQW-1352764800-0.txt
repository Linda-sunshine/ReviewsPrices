review/summary: A little dissapointedreview/text: I got my mat within two days of ordering which was awesome. However, at first i noticed it does cause some slipping during downward dog and other poses. I also ordered the "seafoam green" and it turned out to be lime green... a little disapointed with that. The thickness is great though and provides plenty of comfort for headstands on my wooden floors.Overall a pretty good deal for the price.
