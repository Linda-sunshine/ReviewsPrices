review/summary: This was actually a very comfortable pillowreview/text: I've used a variety of travel pillow before. Inflatables are the worst, but filled pillows are hard to compact. This one was actually quite compact, and after opening and allowing time to fill with air, was quite comfortable. I found that when I opened the pillow first and then got ready for bed, it was fully plumped by the time I climbed into bed. It's very light weight as well.
