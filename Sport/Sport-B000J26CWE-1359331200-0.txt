review/summary: To straighten crooked toesreview/text: I bought the toesocks to see if they could help straighten crooked toes. I think they do help a little. It's too soon to tell but I have hope for them. If they work, I will buy the toeshoes. It takes patience to put them on over crooked toes but is worth the time if they help.
