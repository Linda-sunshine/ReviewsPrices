review/summary: Poor man's Sub-Marinerreview/text: Japanese movement, good solid construction. Looks just like a Rolex Sub-Mariner aside from the branding and see-thru back. Invicta gets a bad rap in the watch aficionado circles because they do copy many high end designs. This watch is one of them. This seems like a good solid automatic watch that could last me a few years or more. I like the style of it and the price was right. This is my second Invicta watch. I will be buying others from them in the future.
