review/summary: Exceeded expectationsreview/text: This was a slightly different model than I have worn for the past 2 years, and at first, I wasn't sure about the slightly bulkier detachable clip holder. (The other one just had a spring-loaded clip on the back.) Once I got it on, though, I liked the larger display and was pleased to learn that this model can be placed in your pocket, or inside a purse, if needed, and it still appears to count steps accurately. Very pleased with my purchase.
