review/summary: Will always love my camelbak!review/text: I've been using my camelbak for probably 3+ years and I LOVE it. And now I love their customer service too! After dropping and breaking the entire mouthpiece (not the silicone but the actual plastic piece; this rendered the top completely useless) I was prepared to buy a new one. But thought I'd contact customer service first...they sent me an entire new top for my bottle no questions asked. Wow.As for cleaning the small parts I bought a straw cleaner...research "Straw Cleaning Brush - for reusable straws, baby sippy cup, tea pot spout etc" here on amazon. Of course the parts are going to get gross...you have to clean it. I have even used q-tips to get into the crevices. Dishwashing doesn't work for the bite valve and I usually don't want to wait that long. Keep it generally clean, let it dry out overnight and every once and a while you have to give it a good scrub but I think it's worth it. And I will soon be purchasing a little one as my 13 month old has figured out how to use it! Yay for no more leaky baby cups!
