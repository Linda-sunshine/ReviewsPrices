review/summary: Good product and great customer service...review/text: These are my favorite water bottles, ever! Our family owns 3 of them. They are sturdy, don't leak and the bite valve makes them easy to drink from. I did have one problem (hence the 4 stars vs. 5). The flip top bite valve became loose and would no longer close properly. I contacted Camelbak and they sent a replacement top at no cost. Make sure you clean the straw and bite valve thoroughly as they acquire build-up.
