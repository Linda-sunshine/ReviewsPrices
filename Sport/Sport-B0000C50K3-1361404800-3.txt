review/summary: DISAPPOINTED .17 HMR boresnakereview/text: Bought the .17 HMR bore snake and it would not even fit into the barrel. Total waste of $16.00 and shipping. I have bore snakes in .223 and .308 that I really like alot and are great products, but the one I got for my .17 will not even fit into the barrel.Brandon
