review/summary: Super for Liftingreview/text: Well made. Partially open back allows cooling and faster drying to help with odors between workouts. Right amount of padding for my lifting. Some support but still allows one to feel the grip without a lumpy palm pad. No color bleeding and a good fit compared to the typical hand width measurements. Too early to estimate wear but seems solid after ~ 50 workouts. Enjoy.
