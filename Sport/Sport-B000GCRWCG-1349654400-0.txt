review/summary: Its mylar and it will keep you warmreview/text: OK, yes, they're cheap and wont last very long. Yes they're noisy so if you're trying to hide from zombies while wearing this you're screwed. However, if you're in a pinch, someplace safe and need the extra warmth, huddle down, wrap this puppy around you and it'll keep a bit of heat in. If you're smart you also bought a few hundred hand warmers. Stick one of them in your pants THEN get under this thing. You'll swear you're in Texas in June. One of the bug out bag and car trunk "needs to be there" items."Be prepared people." CSM R. Clark
