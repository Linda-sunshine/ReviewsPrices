review/summary: Mickey-Mouse Gripreview/text: When reading the reviews for this grip, I found only one that related to the gun of interest, a Diamondback 9mm. Depending totally on this one review, I decided that a $10 investment was a low risk expenditure, so I ordered it. It does add some &#34;meat&#34; to the thin, comfortless handle, but not much. Once the grip is installed as far up the handle as possible, the protruding finger separator is too close to the trigger guard, unless the user has very small fingers, so the grip must be lowered which will then require trimming off the grip at the bottom. In short, I will not buy another generic grip for any gun, I've learned my lesson. In sharp contrast, the Hogue grip I purchased for my Sig P238-.380 is fabulous. This is not a generic grip, it was made only for this pistol. I don't recommend this grip, at least for a Diamondback pistol.
