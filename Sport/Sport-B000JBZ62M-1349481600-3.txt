review/summary: champion mesh long men's short with pocketsreview/text: I bought only a pair of these shorts to try them out for my husband and me. My husband hasn't gotten to wear them yet but i am a fan. I'm a 4'11 female and was looking for something to just wear around the house but that isn't too short. I notice that women's shorts are made way short and i don't really like it. I got a medium and they fit pretty long and are extremely comfortable. Sometimes i fold over the waist to make them a little shorter in the front area as they are i guess designed for men lol. The pockets are a cool feature for when i do my house chores i put my phone in there and listen to music on my headphones. I think i have even worn these shorts to run errands a couple times. That's just how comfortable they are. I hope to see my husband in them to see how he likes them. If he does i will be buying more.
