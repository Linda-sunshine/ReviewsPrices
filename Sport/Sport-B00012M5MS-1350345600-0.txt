review/summary: Crazy Glue Please!review/text: I read some bad reviews about this product but for the price and the good reviews I decided to get it. when I open the box the plastic fell off the helmet I didn't even cut off the tag yet. I absolutely cannot believe Schwinn put their name on this crap I will never buy another Schwinn product again, if they will allow their name on this piece of garbage. I won't even send it back I don't want them to send it to someone else. Pay a little extra get something better.
