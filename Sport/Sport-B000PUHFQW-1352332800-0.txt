review/summary: Not an expert, but seems great to me!review/text: I bought one of these mats (in a teal green color) after signing up for my first ever yoga class at school. I wanted something basic and relatively cheap, but sturdy enough. This has been holding up very well! I'm not an expert at all, but from my perspective this is a truly great mat. It does indeed have a slight chemical smell when you first open it up, but that has gone away quickly from mine. I haven't found that it slides around a lot, but I also don't use it on tile floors or anything else that might be slippery. It's long enough. It's a great color. I'm happy with it!
