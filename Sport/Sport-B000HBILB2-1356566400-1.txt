review/summary: Comfort on a Budgetreview/text: This airbed is well worth the price - the twin size makes it easy to travel with when you are just looking for one extra bed but it's plenty big enough to sleep comfortably (and indeed it is comfortable to sleep on). The material is not too noisy if you toss and turn at night. It inflates and deflates quickly and quietly and the built-in pump is so convenient. I'm completely satisfied with this product.
