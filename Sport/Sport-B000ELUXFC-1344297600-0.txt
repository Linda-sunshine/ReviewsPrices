review/summary: Good quality at a great price!review/text: Allen Deluxe 2-bike Trunk Mount Rack is a good quality product at a great price. I checked out other bike racks of similar quality which were priced at least $20.00 or more dollars higher. My daughter used bike rack to transport her bike to college 2 1/2 hours away. She traveled on a highway at speeds of 70 plus miles per hour. The bike stayed put through the whole trip. We are very satisfied!
