review/summary: Very strong!review/text: This product surprised me with how strong the material was. What I used it for required me to pull it through a tough tight spot. I pulled and pulled to get it through, and it did not tear. This is strong material and has a multitude of uses when camping. Some of the other reviews said it tore easily, and maybe that's true once it actually gets a tear or rip. But I did not experience that at all. I would definitely recommend it to others.
