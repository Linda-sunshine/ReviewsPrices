review/summary: Entry level bike helmetreview/text: Helmet is nice have only 1 problem you seem to sweat a lot in front should one with extra pads otherwise fits great and looks good recommended to adult or child for the money well spent any helmet will protect you better than any expensive helmet but the better ones cost more than twice as much
