review/summary: Great bedreview/text: I purchased this mostly for the great price, to replace a more expensive model. Love that it is a raised bed. Makes getting in and out of it much easier. It is very comfortable. Like it better than the more expensive brand it replaced! Have used it a lot, and it has held up well. Great for when traveling to relatives or friends houses. Very satisfied with this purchase. Would definitely buy it again.
