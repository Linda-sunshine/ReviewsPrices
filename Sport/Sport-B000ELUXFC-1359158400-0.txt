review/summary: Everyone should have a bike rackreview/text: My boyfriend was biking to work everyday while I was driving...that is, until he broke his collar bone. So I let him use my car while I biked to work in the afternoons, however, my work schedule had me getting off around midnight and I did not want to bike home at that hour and needed him to pick me up. This rack was perfect! Easy to set up and easy to take off. It's very small and takes up no room in the trunk. Once I was back to driving myself to/from work, it was great for those late nights when my biking coworkers needed a ride home. &#34;Do you need a ride?&#34; &#34;That's ok, I have a bike :(&#34; &#34;No problem, I have a bike rack!&#34; So handy to have!
