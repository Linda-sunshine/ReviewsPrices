review/summary: Love this grip still after 5 years!!review/text: Well I have had this grip on my AR for the past 5 years now and it is still holding strong. With all the options out there these days for grips, I still haven't strayed from this Rubber grip. 5 years is a long time for almost anything and it still feels and seriously looks almost like it did out of the package! Its crazy! BUT im a firm believer in it and it has never failed yet! Great job Hogue!
