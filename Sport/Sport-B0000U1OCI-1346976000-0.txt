review/summary: Well done!review/text: Amazing device. Once the stride length was set (resolution = 1 inch) it is able to measure distance to much better than two significant figures. The greatest variable is the actual human stride length, but since the user in this case is remarkably consistent, it worked out to three significant digits. Amazing.But even better, the programming and operation are supremely logical. If you sat down and thought to yourself "What should the perfect pedometer do?", THIS is what you'd come up with. Everything about it is easy and logical. Easy to set up. Well-written instructions. Logical operation -- I mean the way the buttons work. It's so well done that you can probably figure it out without the instructions after a minute or two of playing around.Also, it's good at keeping data for you. There's a seven-day history easily accessible. It automatically rolls over to a new day at midnight. It can distinguish between casual walking and serious walking. I've found it unerring in that respect.It purports to calculate calories and "fat burned". There's probably some physiological basis for those calculations, but I'm not the person to ask about it. The numbers, at least for calories burned, seem plausible.It uses one easily-replaceable CR2032 which is expected to last six months of average use.The overall "feel" of it is quality. Look and feel are first class.Highly recommended.
