review/summary: Can't get any better.review/text: Just the rigth size and its weight makes it very effective for uncorking wine bottles which will probably be the most adventurous survival skill you will find for it - add to that that after you have bravely saved the day uncorking -the Swiss Army knife will turn into a conversation piece reaffirming your hero status. If there is one thing for sure it will create envy. Super tool,super cool.
