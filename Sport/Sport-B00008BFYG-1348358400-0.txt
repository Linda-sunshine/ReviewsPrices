review/summary: razor a2 scooter rocks!review/text: I love this scooter; the only thing is I don't like the rear bar because it's hard to brake with it on. It caused a lot of trouble until we realized that it could be removed. So basically we paid more for something we had to take off. Get the razor a instead. It's cheaper and you don't have to take anything off.
