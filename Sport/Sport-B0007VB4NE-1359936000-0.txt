review/summary: Too Low!review/text: I didn't realize there would be a 52 cm ball with this. As I am 5'3", it puts me too low to the ground next to standard desk. I got a bigger ball, 72 cm, but now the back part of the chair is unreachable, and therefore unusable. I love sitting on a secured yoga ball, but I can put the bigger ball in a laundry basket for the same effect and that costs a lot less.
