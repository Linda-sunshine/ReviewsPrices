review/summary: Great Automatic Watch for under $100review/text: Great product for the price point. A good looking automatic under $100 that resembles a Rolex and can be combined with a NATO Strap for a great look. There are some minor things of concern but for the price I can't complain. The minor things are that the bezel is a little hard to turn and the lock down crown isn't as smooth as other watches. But these minor items are not a deal breaker. Its a great value and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good automatic watch without going over the $100 mark.
