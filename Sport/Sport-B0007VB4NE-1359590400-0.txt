review/summary: Great, if you're shortreview/text: The ball is much smaller than expected (which is good for me). It is not like my balance ball used for exercise at home and even that one is the smallest size. I am 5'1&#34; and my legs are bent almost at a 90 degree angle & my feel rest flat on the floor...something that NEVER happens in office chairs. I can't imagine anyone taller than myself using one, though. I've used it for 2 full days at work so far. My only concern is whether I'm going to have shoulder/neck issues because my desk is probably not a good height match for this chair (or me). It's probably only an inch or so shorter, but that can make a difference.
