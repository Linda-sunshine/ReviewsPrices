review/summary: Not the same as they used to bereview/text: The style of these has changed, and in my opinion for the worse. These used to be a loose fitting boxer, but they are now more like a tight fitting boxer brief. The quality and material is still just as remarkable though. Had I known that they fit was tight though, I probably wouldn't have ordered more.However, these are still great boxers, and it's hard to bash them because they perform well.I only give 4 stars because I don't like the fit as well as my older ones (which came loose fitting from the store).
