review/summary: Too good...review/text: This thermos definitely lives up to the info stated. My drinks stay HOT all day. Almost... too hot. I've had to figure out how long to leave the thermos open before I pack it up so that my tea has cooled off enough to be drinkable by lunch. So far I think leaving the lid off for 30 minutes makes my tea drinkably hot. Also, I haven't had any leaking problems, and its been through some rough times in my backpack.Basically: I would have liked it better if the insulation was slightly less good so I could actually drink my tea at lunch... but that's kind of a ridiculous thing to say so I didn't take off any stars. Does not leak. Lives up to the promise!
