review/summary: excellent pantsreview/text: I will start this review by saying that I HATE yoga pants. Hate them. They always ride up too much, or they are high water, or they look thin and cheap and they sag down and I have to keep tugging them up...etc etc etc....but i was getting ready to take a new yoga class and, well, I NEEDED yoga pants so I bought these and they are GREAT!! Iam five seven, 140 lbs (with a little junk in my trunk thanks to lots of squats)...I was worried about buying a size small because i didn't want them to be too tight, BUT I really didn't want them to be too loose either so I went with the small....when they first arrived they looked SMALL and i was worried I had gambled and lost, but after I put them on and stretch a little they loosened up to fit perfectly! The length is GREAT! in bare feet they just brush the floor...during class today i did not think about these pants one time and that says a lot!! if you like your pants a little looser get a size up, but they DO stretch out as you wear them around!
