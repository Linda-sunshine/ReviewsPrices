review/summary: Great shoes!!review/text: My husband is an almost exclusive low top Converse wearer. He has been wanting a pair of TRUE red not TOMATO colored chucks. These are a true tradition red and he loves them!!! Great price, better than any I have found in stores and they fit like a dream. Highly recommend these!!!
