review/summary: Dont purchase 54mm if your a manreview/text: Hmmm this is a tough one, I couldn't decide if I liked the glasses or not, they fit great! But.... I think they look like GIRL glasses, which I think its because the size 54mm (go smaller,and they wont look like female glasses!) I didnt notice until I started seeing pictures of myself. I'm unpleased that I wasted money on glasses that I'll never wear, its the one downfall to ordering items like this on the internet. So if your a man DO NOT buy these glasses in the 54mm. BUY A SMALLER SIZE!I hope this will help for someones future purchase!Thanks
