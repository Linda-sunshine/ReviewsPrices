review/summary: An essential toolreview/text: This small knife is a very sophisticated and well designed tool for almost any sudden household need, and these needs for cutting, opening, filing, screw tightening, etc, are usually frequent and urgent. I find I use it almost daily for something around the house, in the car, traveling (except by plane, of course), etc. If for some reason I lose it, I feel an urgent need to replace it promptly, as I value it's utility very much.
