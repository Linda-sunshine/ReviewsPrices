review/summary: thermarest pillowreview/text: Wonderful pillow. Bought it for a trip to England, have not gone yet, but we have tried it out at home. It rolls up compactly and when you take it out all you have to do is fluff it several times. Nice and fluffy, good support. I will probably purchase another one before we go.
