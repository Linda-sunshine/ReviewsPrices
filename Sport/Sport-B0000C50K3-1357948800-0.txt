review/summary: Good productreview/text: Why didnt I think of this when I was in the army? It's a good tool for field maintainence of a rifle, gets its mostly clean. This shouldn't be seen as a replacement for a good rod and brush, but with this bore snake I find I can keep the rifle in the field in a good state of cleanliness quickly, which encourages me to clean it more often. Because the snake is easy to use, compared to a rod, its easy to just do it whenever you have some downtime.Just a great little invention.
