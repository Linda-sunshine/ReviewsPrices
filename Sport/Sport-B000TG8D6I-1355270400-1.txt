review/summary: Great Exercise DVDsreview/text: With any exercise program, you get out of it what you put in. If you follow it and use the diet you will see amazing results. I followed the workout but not the diet and still saw some great results. I completed the 90 day program but I still use the DVDs to work out. I just made my own program up. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it gets repetitive. You do the yoga once every week and 2 times a week on your &#34;rest&#34; weeks. Also, plyometrics and kenpo are used every none rest week. Wish there was more variety because you start to get bored doing a workout when it's the same thing over and over again.But overall, a great program and I would recommend to anyone.
