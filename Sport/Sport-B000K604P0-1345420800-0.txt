review/summary: My co-workers probably think I am a paid spokesperson now...review/text: I got this based on the reviews and it is fantastic. I haven't tried priming it with boiling water (suggested for 10 minutes before filling with beverage), but it still keeps my coffee reasonably hot for 12 hours. Best of all, it fits in the cup holder in my early 90's car...that's pre-big gulp days, people. I have to give great compliments to the feel and usability of it. The metal canister itself feels nice and sturdy, and it honestly does not feel like a thermos...just a fancy insulated coffee cup to go. It feels great to have a truly quality product in my hands for once. Thermos, thanks for showing the best in yourself rather than trying to get the best of me.
