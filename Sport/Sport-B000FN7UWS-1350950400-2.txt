review/summary: great except for one thingreview/text: My husband and I bought two of these to replace some more cheaply made water bottles. The old ones, we had noticed, had developed a strange taste and one of them had even began rusting or corroding in the bottom(we don't think that one was stainless steel anyway). We love these bottles, they have a great feel to them, they keep things nice and cold, and they are all around perfect for everyday use!(we take them to work literally every day). We have not noticed any metallic taste to the water at all, but we did follow the included instructions and washed them with baking soda and water before using them.The one thing we don't like about them is that the bottom of the bottles are slightly contoured. One of ours fell when it was full and now has an ever so slight dent in the bottom of it. not a big deal, before we had this happen to our bottles, but since the bottom was flat we just took a small hammer and pounded it back in place. hopefully they hold up now and they don't dent any more!
