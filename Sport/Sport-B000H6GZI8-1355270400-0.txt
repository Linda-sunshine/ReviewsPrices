review/summary: Made Shooting my Kimber a pleasure.review/text: The Kimber rep had recommended this item. The Kimber Solo is a great (expensive) personal safety gun, but I was running a lot of ammo through it to break it in, and my hand hurt. reminds me of my five shot .38 . This made all the difference, took the bite out of shooting the Kimber Solo.
