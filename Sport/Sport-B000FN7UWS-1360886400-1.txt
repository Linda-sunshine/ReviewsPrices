review/summary: won't leave home without itreview/text: Better than plastic water bottles (they get smellly and dirty within a few days if you're not washing them daily with soap). With the Klean Kanteen i just run it through the dish washer once a week and can just rinse it out other wise. no weird smells, no weird tastes. Great water bottle for people on the go.
