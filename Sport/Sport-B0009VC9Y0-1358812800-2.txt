review/summary: Perfect for EDCreview/text: Honestly, its the best knife for EDC I have ever owned, 3 inch blade is legal even in NYC, cheap enough to not be too too worried about it, yet enough to still care. If I know i'll be cutting later in the day, I wont bring it, and bring something box cutter style with a replaceable blade. I haven't tried to sharpen it yet, but it's pretty damn sharp right now and fairly decent at holding the edge.
