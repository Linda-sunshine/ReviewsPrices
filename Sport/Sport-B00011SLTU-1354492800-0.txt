review/summary: Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife (Black)review/text: This is a nice little pocket knife. I'd rather call it a key chain knife. Perfect size to use it as a key chain.I'm not sure about the quality. It looks like it is only good for very light jobs. But it will be there when I need it because it is with my keys.
