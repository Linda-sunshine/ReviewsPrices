review/summary: Worked Great for 6 Months, but then Bustedreview/text: Used as my bed with a 4 inch memory foam layer thrown on top. Most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. But after 6 months of use one the of the seems broke on the top and bubbled out. Its now just unusable. However it lasted pretty long for me so I liked it.
