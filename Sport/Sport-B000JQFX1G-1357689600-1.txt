review/summary: Invicta Diver's watch true lemon. Poor service.review/text: Purchased Invicta Divers watch in fall, 2009. Worked fine for about a year. After that it started gaining time, 5-7 minutes a day. Sent it in to Invicta. Adjustment took nearly three months. After I got it back, it worked satisfactorily for less than a year when the self-winding mechanism stopped working. Did not send it in right away. Sent it to Invicta in June 2012. It was returned at the end of December 2012-nearly six months. Called Invicta Customer Service at four and five months, and was told both times that watches are sent overseas for repair and take up to ninety days. Less than a month since it was returned this time, the self-winding mechanism has stopped working-again.This is not my first Invicta timepiece. Also have a quartz diver's watch received as a gift. Battery lasted a little over a year. Sent it in at the same time as the other watch. It took six months to have the battery replaced.I cannot recommend Invicta products or their service. I was initially pleased with the variety of styles they offer and the build quality. But the build quality is only external. Their watches are not well-built on the inside. Service time is deplorable.Avoid Invicta watches.
