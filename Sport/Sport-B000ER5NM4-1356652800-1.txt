review/summary: Love it!review/text: I read all of the previous reviews and actually went up a size larger than I usually wear (I am usually a size small but ordered a medium) as several people suggested the sizing runs a little small. I love these pants! They fit beautifully, are comfortable and I love the chocolate brown color...difficult color to find in stores.
