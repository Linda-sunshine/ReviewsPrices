review/summary: You get what you pay forreview/text: I needed a bottle that was strong, lightweight, and held the right amount of water. This bottle fits my needs as a college student who is always on the go. Very well constructed. I would not recommend the sports cap 2.0 because it makes a loud whistling noise that sounds like a dolphin laughing which is very distracting in quiet places. Might want to try the sports cap 3.0 which is supposed to make no sound.
