review/summary: Great qualityreview/text: I was really impressed with the quality of this jump rope given the low price tag. It's very easy to resize (I'm not sure why other people were having such a hard time... it took me 1 minute). The handles swivle so it never gets kinks, the handles have a nice grip that never slips out of your hand or gets sweaty (it's breathable), and the rope itself has a nice weight to it. I already bought another for a friend I liked mine so much!
