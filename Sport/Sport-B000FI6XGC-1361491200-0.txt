review/summary: The picture is correct.review/text: That little rubber stopper never stays closed and will eventually rip off when it snags on something trail side. That's the only down side. A friend had to borrow it for some high pressure tires and I told him it probably wont get up to 70 p.s.i. and I'll tell you if i hadn't seen it with my own eyes I wouldn't have believed it. It did take a while though.
