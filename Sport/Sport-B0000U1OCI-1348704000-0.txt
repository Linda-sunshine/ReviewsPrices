review/summary: Omron HJ-112 Digital Pedometerreview/text: This pedometer is a replacement for the HJ-112 that I purchased in 2007. The original one worked great, however, I recentlymisplaced it. I was happy to learn that HJ-112 was still in production so I ordered one. A week after receiving the new one, the 2007 unit appeared. I would highly recommend this item
