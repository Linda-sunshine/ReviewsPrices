review/summary: neon animal print duct tape!review/text: The seven-year-old is on this all the time. We "customized" it with some colorful neon animal print duct tape for easy identification, since the local Brooklyn park we frequent has DOZENS of these things lying around.The steering column and front wheel have slid out of alignment a couple times, but were easily fixed. Just keep an eye out for it.
