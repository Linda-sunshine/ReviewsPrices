review/summary: Not sure its meant for a 4 year old. But high quality.review/text: I bought it for a 4 year old i was told it would be a good fit. The deck i feel is alittle to far for a four year old to be able to ride and then press on the rear brakes. This scooter completely raised up was comfortable to ride for me at 6'2 186 lbs.
