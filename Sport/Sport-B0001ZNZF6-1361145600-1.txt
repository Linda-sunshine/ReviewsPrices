review/summary: They are comfortable, most of the timereview/text: You can barely tell you have these on, very light material, stretches so you don't feel them pull when squatting for example.My only complaint is occasionally they will grab an ass hair and not let go. I'm not a very hairy man but a few times a day a hair will get caught and you basically end up pulling the hair out. I guess I'll have baby smooth bottom in a few months.
