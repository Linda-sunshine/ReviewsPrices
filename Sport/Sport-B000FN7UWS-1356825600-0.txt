review/summary: Holds up to daily abuse of a my eight year oldreview/text: My son takes this to school with him and brings it home every day. It gets banged around on the outside of his backpack, the lid gets chewed on, it gets dropped on cement, left in the sun, left in the freezing car overnight and it still performs beautifully. We have had to buy extra lids thanks to the abuse, but the replacement lids always fit perfect.
