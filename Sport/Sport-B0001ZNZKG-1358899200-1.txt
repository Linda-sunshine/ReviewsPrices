review/summary: Ok, light weight and dry easy but very sweaty in hot climesreview/text: Does what they say on the tin but I would not buy any more. I found they were light to pack and dried very quickly however they were very sticky and sweaty to wear in 30 Deg temps of Thailand. I went back to my all time favourites Mundo Unico which are more comfortable and although not as light wick up the sweat
