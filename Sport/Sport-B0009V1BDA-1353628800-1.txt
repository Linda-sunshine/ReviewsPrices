review/summary: Life saver for single malereview/text: Got this about 2 weeks ago. I am a single, male who was getting tired of eating frozen dinners and the kitchen stove might as well be like kryptonite to me. This product was heaven-sent. I have been using it to cook hot dogs, burgers and steaks daily since I got it!Notes:-Do not close cover. Instructions clearly state this grill is not meant to be used with the cover down. Reports of the handle melting or breaking is because people are closing the cover during cooking. Instruction manual clearly states not to do so.-Man your food. Things can get hot quickly.
