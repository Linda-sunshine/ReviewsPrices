review/summary: Do not purchase P90X from Amazon!review/text: This is a great workout but I made the mistake of buying from Amazon. Don't be fooled (like me) by the &#34;sold by Beachbody&#34; &#34;fufilled by Amazon&#34;. I knew when it was purchased that it was going to be a couple of months before beginning the workout. I purchased early to give me time to read all the materials and purchase any additional needed items. When I started the program the KempoX DVD was damaged out of the package and never played but my Amazon 30 day return window had expired. Beachbody customer support ignored my email request and when contacted by phone told me that since I had bought from Amazon, all correspondence must go back through Amazon. Beachbody claims to have great customer support but I have no idea since I was unable to use it!
