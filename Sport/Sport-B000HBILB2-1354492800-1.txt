review/summary: Better than Hotel Bed!review/text: Ordered this twin to use in Hotel while visiting sick relative in other state. Two full size beds in room..not enough room for other bed,and hotel didn't have a fold up... took this and put it between the two full size and slept on it.. Comfortable, and so easy to put together and take down...my husband slept on one full size and his mom on the other.. I was the most comfortable! Love it.. and now have it for when my nephew and niece visit.Compared to an Aero.. the price was awesome and works the same way!!! Not having it directly on the floor with the elevation made it easier to get in and out... Great deal!
