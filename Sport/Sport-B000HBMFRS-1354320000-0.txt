review/summary: They don't lastreview/text: I purchased four (4) of these air mattresses to use while my family waited for our furniture to be shipped cross country. Two of the four mattresses lost their internal chambers and one side of the mattress blew up like a balloon. Rendering each air mattress unusable. These mattresses will not last short or long term.
