review/summary: So far, an excellent productreview/text: Don't believe the other reviews, the rope's length was extremely easy to adjust. The end cap screwed right off, and I used a rubber band to temporarily hold the rope at my desired length so I could test it before crimping & cutting. The grips are well-molded to fit your hand. The rope itself didn't display any of this nonsense about staying sort of coiled-up. The rope is just heavy enough that it all straightens out just fine as soon as you use it for a couple of minutes. Excellent product for the price.
