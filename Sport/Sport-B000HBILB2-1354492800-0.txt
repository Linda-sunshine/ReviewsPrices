review/summary: Huge disappointmentreview/text: I received this air mattress and was very impressed at first. It's only been a couple of months with sporadic use by an average size/weight person and it's now unuseable. Two of the seams along the top of the mattress have now "popped" so that the top of the mattress is 1/2 big bulge and 1/2 normal. There's no reason this should've happened. When only 1 seam popped it was still ok, but with 2 gone we have to throw it away.
