review/summary: Great for noisy neighborsreview/text: I live in an apartment complex on a university campus, and the apartment adjacent to mine loves to play electronic music into the wee hours of the night, while I typically have 5AM wakeups for work and running. This is what keeps me asleep or on tasks when I'm studying.
