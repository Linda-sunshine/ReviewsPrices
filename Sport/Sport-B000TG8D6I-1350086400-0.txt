review/summary: insane workoutreview/text: P90X is a high intensity workout. The moves are easy to pick up and although we are not following the meal guide to the tee, my husband and I have lost a combined 15 lbs in the first 3 weeks of using this system. Only negative is that we had to spend a bit more money to get some more equipment/ weights bands and chin up bar in order to take full advantange of the workouts.
