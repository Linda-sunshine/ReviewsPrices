review/summary: Slipperyreview/text: Been using this mat for quite a while now and it is still super slippery. I washed it and everything. Spend the extra money and get a better mat. Not only is this mat not enough padding for my knees but its like a slip-n-slide which is very annoying and dangerous in yoga.
