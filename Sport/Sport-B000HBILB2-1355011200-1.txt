review/summary: What a great choice!review/text: Bought this for a Thanksgiving guest consigned to the basement. Incredibly easy to set up, stayed inflated, he said it was way more comfortable than any air mattress he'd ever slept on. And the electric deflate is fast and makes it easy to get back into its bag.
