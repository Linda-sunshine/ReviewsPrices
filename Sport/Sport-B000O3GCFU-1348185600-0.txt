review/summary: Good Productreview/text: Bought for the kiddo's lunch, I have a non-sandwich eater. Works great to keep lunch warm til lunch time. I fill with boiling water first then dump it out before I put the really hot soup in. It stays warm from 7:45 til 12:00. Also it does not leak all over his lunch bag.
