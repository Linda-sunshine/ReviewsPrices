review/summary: Champion Men's Long Mesh Pockets Short, Maroon, Largereview/text: These shorts are really comfortable. I used them for around the house,playing sports,and hanging out with my friends. It is a really nice deal they are a lot cheaper than most shorts and they fit and feel amazing. I could wear these all the time. The only thing about these pants is if you carry something in your pockets you need to tighten them up with the string or they will be tugged down. I usually have my iphone 4 in my pocket and it tends to drop a little but when it is tied tight it is fine. I recommend buying at least one pair if your skeptical. I did and I ended up buying more of them.
