review/summary: My son wanted this when he saw a friend's mom doing itreview/text: He says he is going to wait until after basketball season to start; but, in the meanitme-I looked at it and it looks great..just as it says...fast and furious! Lot's of enthusiasm... and worth it to do that as opposed to nothing due to time limitations...and I imagine doing this would be better than a longer one done half-heartedly... good bang for the buck so to speak:)
