By doing so, you will be able to prevent any heatloss that irradiates off of your body.REMEMBER, to be off the cold ground as you will lose much of your heat that way(i.e Sleeping pad, bag, or tent). It is imperative that you find a way to get on top of a object or item that will help you retain heat.This product worked well for me when a friend of mine brought the crappiest sleeping pad and bag known to man.Cheap and effective. It works. What more do you need?Pros:- Incredibly effective- Cheap to pickup- Comes in multiples- VERY portableCons:- People don't know how to use them.
