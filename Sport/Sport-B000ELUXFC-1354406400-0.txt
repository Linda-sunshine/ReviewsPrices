review/summary: Works well enough.review/text: I don't like the picture of the bottom strap clipped on the rear valence. Most cars have flexible plastic valences too flimsy to hold rack securely. At least mine does. I clip it on the bottom of the trunk a few inches below the license plate. I use the outside rack for my top tube. Then I turn handle bars so bar end is near the second bike holder closer to the car and use that strap to secure handle bars to keep from excess movement.For the price I don't think you can beat it.
