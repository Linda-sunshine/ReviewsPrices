review/summary: Adequate for limited usereview/text: Hubby dearest reports:Adequate for my limited use.Pros:Fast to set up.Easy to install.Sufficient strap length to fit my pseudo notch back.Cons:Not the most sturdy (though adequate).Light on tie-down capabilityMay not be suitable for all frame configurations.I got this for short distance carriage of one bicycle (I didn't see any 1 bike racks). Set-up took less than 5 minutes and no tools though the clip on braces took a fair amount of force. Installation was easy even on my 1990's Dodge Shadow (it looks like it has a trunk but it's really a hatchback and the clips have to reach the hinges at the roof line. Note that while this configuration works on my pseudo hatchback it does require at least some trunk length and would not work on a conventional hatchback, a van, or a sport ute.It's adequately strong to hold my single bike and works to haul it around for short hauls. The primary hold down straps seem adequate though the secondary (anti flop) tie down strap configuration seems to be a biton the flimsy side if you were going to use it for a long run at highway speeds. Also, due to the sloped frame crossbar on my bike, the front wheel hangs pretty close to the pavement and I'd probablu remove the wheel for long hauls.That having been said, it appears to be adequate for my short haul application and the fast, easy set-up and installation are a definite plus.
