review/summary: Great knife, safety tab to keep it closed a little iffyreview/text: I've had this knife for about 4 years (recently replaced it with an M16-14z), and keep it around for "dress" occasions...times when my usual pocket knife is too big (like, say, when wearing nice pants).I've got two take-aways for this knife...one common to all knives (so I can't take a star away for it) and one for something specific to this knife.First, the pocket clip screws work themselves loose. This is something that's happened to each knife I've had like this, so it's not really a big detractor, just be aware of it and tighten the screws from time to time (or possibly apply a tiny bit of some sort of threadlock). I lost a screw, contacted Kershaw and they sent me a whole new clip and both screws in a couple of days, free of charge. That was fantastic.The part that *does* make me take a star away from the knife is the plastic slide that "holds" the knife closed. If you keep your knife super sharp, as I do, if you're not careful, the plastic tab that slides into place to hold the knife closed could move into the "closed" position with the blade out, and when you go to close it, you'll slice right through it. Again, in this situation, Kershaw sent me a new plastic tab (which was simple to replace) within a couple of days.That all being said, it's a great knife...just be careful with the plastic "tab" that keeps it closed!
