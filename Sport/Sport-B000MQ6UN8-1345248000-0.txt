review/summary: EXCELENT SUNGLASSESreview/text: First of all i ordered them in gunmetal polarized grey lens, size 58mm. I'm a medium face guy so based on previous reviews i thought that 58mm was the size for me and oh boy THANK YOU REVIEWERS because i nailed it, they look and feel exactly how i was hoping them to be.About the color, luv them, the gunmetal of the frame is perfect for every situation, i go to my office and they look awesome and stylish and when i go to the beach they just scream STYLE. The gray color of the glasses are just fine they give you the looks without messing with the colors of your sight.Got them polarized so i can wear them in the Caribbean sun of the Dominican Republic and oh man no more half-closed eyes for me.Hope this review can help you as others helped me.
