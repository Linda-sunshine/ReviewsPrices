review/summary: Great Glassesreview/text: I picked up a set of these when I lost my sunglasses on vacation. I usually wear wrap around glasses but needed something asap and these were the best they had. I am very happy with these and I know they polarization works since I was under and umbrella and I got sunburned on my face except where my glasses were on my face. That will teach me not to wear sunblock on my face at the beach again.
