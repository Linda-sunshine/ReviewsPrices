review/summary: Bad workmanship on card shufflerreview/text: This was my second order for the Casino 6-deck automatic shuffler. The first one worked great until, I'm guessing, some contact stopped making proper contact. So, I ordered another one since I had liked the first one. We used the second one five times - first 2 times it worked fine but it sounded like it was straining. The next two times it worked sluggishly as if the batteries were weak. I again purchased new batteries, thinking maybe I had gotten some bad batteries when I first installed them in the new machine. Guess what? New batteries did not help. It still sounded as if "it were on it's last leg", very slow, not moving the cards through the shuffler. I tried every thing I could think but to no avail. Evidently, I had purchased a lemon!
