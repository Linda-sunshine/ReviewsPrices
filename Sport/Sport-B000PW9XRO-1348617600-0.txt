review/summary: Excellent, fittingreview/text: I have ordered these gloves once before, but lost them. Both times I have been satisfied with the quality of the gloves. They are tougher than their thin-feeling palm material suggests, and do provide a little warmth. I wouldn't recommend these glove for any long periods out in the cold. They provide good grip and are flexible and manageable. You still maintain a lot of dexterity in your hands with these gloves compared to most.One thing I should note is that if you ever expect to be sliding down any ropes--these are not the gloves you want. I slid down a 12 rope and holes were partially melted in the palms of the gloves. They are still great gloves though, don't get me wrong!
