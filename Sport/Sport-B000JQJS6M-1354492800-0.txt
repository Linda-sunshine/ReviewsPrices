review/summary: Good looking watchreview/text: A very good looking watch for the price. I can't say anything negative about the workmanship. If anything the bezel is a bit tough to rotate. The watch arrived with a fer seconds slower per day. After a couple of tweakings now it is spot on. I wear this watch during the day and take it off before go to bed. It has been running nonstop so far.
