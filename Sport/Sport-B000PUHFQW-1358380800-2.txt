review/summary: Good mat and good valuereview/text: I work at a resort and oversee our fitness center. We purchased these mats at the request of some of our older clientele (hey, it's Florida) who were doubling up standard yoga mats to have a little more cushion. We have some 1/2&#34; thick mats as well.The feedback on these has been positive - some extra padding to help with comfort, but not so much that the students can't &#34;feel&#34; the movements. Good for our clientele, and the value of these is just right for a higher-end resort: high quality, but not so expensive that we're hurting if they get damaged or a guest &#34;forgets&#34; to return it.
