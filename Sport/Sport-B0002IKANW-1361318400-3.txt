review/summary: practiclereview/text: i really like this product in my tuarur 24/7. manufacturer recommends not dry-firing, due to potential damage to firing pin. this product prevents this damage and i can safely practice dry fire, simply raking the rail provides new casing.it is a sa/da pistol so reloading is for practice only.
