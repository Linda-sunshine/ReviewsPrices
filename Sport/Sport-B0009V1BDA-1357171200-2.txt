review/summary: Very portable and efficientreview/text: Bought this to replace a small camping grill. I love that this grill extends to standing height, so there's no bending over for the cooking. The side tables are excellent for plates, utensil, etc while you cook. So far I have had no problem with the temperature of the grill
