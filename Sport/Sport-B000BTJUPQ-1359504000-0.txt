review/summary: Nice Acrhery Setreview/text: This was a Christmas gift for Grandson after he had broken 3 of those bows that you buy at &#34;big box&#34; stores. Although he was not quite strong enough to pull it all the way back at 7 years old he is practicing with it and has gotten better. It is a very nice set.
