review/summary: Name recognition and qualityreview/text: This grip is almost all it should be. A major improvement, but do keep your old hard plastic 1960's factory grip if you want your AR to be competition legal. The Hogue name spells quality, but I held off on the 5th star because I was disappointed to find out it is made in Mexico. For that reason alone, I will go with Ergo Grips in the future.
