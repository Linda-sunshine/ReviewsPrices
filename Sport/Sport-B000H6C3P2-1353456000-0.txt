review/summary: Outstanding grip; a value at twice the pricereview/text: Fits great on my Smith and Wesson M&P AR15. Very positive feel and control of the rifle. Incredible value at ~$18. Finger grooves are just right for my hands and the surface is soft to the touch yet firm underneath. Marvelous.
