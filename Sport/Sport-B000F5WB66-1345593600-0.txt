review/summary: Good Basic HRMreview/text: This is a good `basic' HRM... while it lasts. I say that because mine only lasted two months before the wrist monitor broke and needed to be sent back to the factory for repairs. The wrist monitor is rated to be water resistant to 30 meters and to withstand pressure to 60 p.s.i., but it states in the manual it `does not need to be rinsed'. If Timex claims it can withstand 60 p.s.i., but water gently flowing from the tap causes it to malfunction, then they need to reevaluate their claims.I still like the Timex line of HRM's because the batteries in the chest strap can be user replaced. All of the others I have looked at require you to send it in to have them replaced.Just be aware... quality is directly related to the price paid.
