review/summary: Best bang for the buck!review/text: I've been using this for almost 2 months now. The accuracy is incredible for the price. Have not had any problems wearing it all day. Does not increment while driving in the car as some have complained about and I drive a little bouncy hatchback. It does not increase the steps while sitting or swiveling in my chair at work either. One big bonus for me... it accurately counts my steps while on my Epic elliptical trainer. This is nice as I do not have to remember to add these in at the end of the day. I clip it on my belt in the morning and forget about it for the rest of the day!
