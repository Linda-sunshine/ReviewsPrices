review/summary: A must havereview/text: We have a 2-deck and a 4-deck shuffler. They don't work anywhere near as well as this 6-deck shuffler. The reason is that the door rests on the lever and the lever is spring-loaded so it keeps the cards from falling sideways, or out of the shuffler. So even if you own a 2-deck or 4-deck, I'd recommend the 6-deck because it works really well.
