review/summary: Great for bread makingreview/text: You may ask yourself, what does bread have anything to do with a Lodge cast iron cooker? And the answer is: everything. Chad Robertson recommends using this in his book:Tartine Breadand it makes all the difference. I spent the last 11 months figuring out how to make great bread out of my old gas stove and this cooker is an integral part.YMMV but for my setup I put a pizza stone on the lowest rack and place this cooker on the middle rack. I've found that a pizza stone on the bottom helps keep the oven at a more consistent temperature and keeps the bottom of my bread from burning. Without the pizza stone, I would consistently burn the bottom of my bread. Also, cooking the bread on the smaller "lid" portion seems to crisp the crust better. 20 minutes with the lid on and 20 minutes without it off yields awesome artisan loaves.I have two of these now to make two loaves at once and love them. They are a little heavy and a good thick oven mitt is essential. You'll learn this quickly if you don't have a good mitt. =) These come pre-seasoned which is great. These don't need a whole lot of cleaning but they do need to be dried or you'll notice rust color pretty quickly. I tend to season it again at least once a month which is super easy since that can happen while pre-heating.
