review/summary: Erratic Or Non-performance After 6 Monthsreview/text: I bought this HRM based on a review in Consumer Reports. Initially, the monitor performed as advertised; however, after less than 6 months the monitor performs erratically when it functions at all. I've yet to try replacing the transmitter's battery to see if this will resolve the problem, but, regardless, I do not feel one should have to replace that battery after only 6 months of sporadic use. (I do not use it daily, only to occasionally make sure I am in my intended target zone) In the past, I have used a Polar HRM in the past which gave consistent, long term results. If replacing the battery resolves the problem, I will revise my rating for this product, but for now, I can only give it 2 stars.
