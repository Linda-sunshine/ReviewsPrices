review/summary: P90Xreview/text: I decided to buy this thinking it would give me incentive to use it rather than aquireing it in other ways. I don't have the time to do it every day right now, but since I'm not in the greatest shape to start with that might not be a bad thing. These are serious workouts esp if you are like me and not in great shape.If you take it easy when starting out it's fine though. The music is a little cheesy and the guy talks the entire time, but it all works and makes it go by pretty fast.
