review/summary: Great safety devicereview/text: I installed this on my Schwinn Aluminum Comp. Installation was straight-forward, quick and solid. I no longer have to turn to check traffic and risk falling or changing direction. No cyclist should be without one. I can't recommend it enough.Update. 11/21/2012: Removed the above mirror and installed it on a Trek Shift 2. I did have to cut and enlarge the grip end to install it but then it fit perfectly. Works great!
