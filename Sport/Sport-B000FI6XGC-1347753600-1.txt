review/summary: Great price, great pumpreview/text: Well made very sturdy pump, the instruction are not very explicit but in my opinion are very clear.I read those complaining about the amount of strokes it takes to inflate a tire and I decided test it on my 29er 2.2 tire and in a few minutes has reached enough pressure to put me on the trail again, I just take it easily. If you need inflate your tire very fast I suggest use a CO2 cartridge.
