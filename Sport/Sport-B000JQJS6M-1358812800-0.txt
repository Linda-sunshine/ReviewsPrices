review/summary: Everything the good reviews claim it isreview/text: I read the mixed reviews with some trepidation, as it appeared to me that Invicta quality control might have been an issue. For the price I figured that it was worth taking a shot so I ordered one and I have to say the I'm very impressed.The watched arrived on time and in a very nice, but VERY yellow case, all quality, not a cheap thing about any of the packaging. The watch was wrapped in so many different protective layers that it took me 5 minutes just to unravel the thing! I own a Rolex Submariner and an Oyster Perpetual and this watch matches those in looks, weight, finish and fit. The face is just the right size, almost (or totally) identical to the size of my oyster.I read the reviews regarding the watches ability to keep accurate time, so I started my chronograph when the seconds hand hit 12 and timed the watch for 6 minutes. It was EXACTLY on time with the chrono, so I would have to say that this watch is AS ACCURATE as my two Rolexes, at least so far. I'll update this review if things change but for now I give this watch an unqualified recommendation.Fit and finish - Rolex GradeAccuracy - Rolex GradeLook and feel - Rolex GradeWow factor - Rolex GradeTime, of course, will tell with this watch, but for 90 bucks I could buy 50 of them before I'd hit the Rolex mark, so I just don't see a downside.
