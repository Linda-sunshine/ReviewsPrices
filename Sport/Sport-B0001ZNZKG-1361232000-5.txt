review/summary: Worth the money.review/text: I bought 2 pair plus 2 undershirts for a trip to Switzerland because they advertised you only needed 2 pair for 30 days traveling Europe. I like them so much I want to wear them everyday. If you follow the instructions for washing and drying, 2 pair is all you need (actually 1would do). Expensive but worth it.
