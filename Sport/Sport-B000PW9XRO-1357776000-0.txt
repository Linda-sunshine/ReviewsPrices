review/summary: GREAT FOR COLD DAYSreview/text: I bought these gloves for my wife and they are great. They are neoprene and vinyl and theres no wierd seams on the outsides to come apart. The tags are right at the wrists so they arent uncomfortable and you can remove them easily if you want. The fingertips are shaped well for shooting and the velcro is heavy duty and durable
