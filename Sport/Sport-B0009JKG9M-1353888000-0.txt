review/summary: big fan of cast ironreview/text: It's heavy for sure. A bit heavier then my other cast iron pans. I love that the lid can serve as a pan as well. I often will boil sausage, then flip the lid over into a pan position and brown the sausage. It's like getting two pans for the price of one. :)
