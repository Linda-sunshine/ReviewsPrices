review/summary: Cast Iron fan forever!review/text: I purchased this combo cooker for my husband who is the chef in the family and he absolutely loves it. The size is great for a cooking roasts, whole chickens and even turkey wings. Its heavy duty, easy to maintain and very, very versatile. It hold heat like an oven! Great buy..It's worth far more than what I paid!
