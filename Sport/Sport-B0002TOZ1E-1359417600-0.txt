review/summary: Repeat Purchasereview/text: These are my &#34;go to&#34; socks for everyday work and casual wear. Just purchased another 6 sets following my original purchase about 4 years ago. (Eventually the heels wear out.) Very comfortable, with athletic sock thickness - yet breathable for warmer weather. Hopefully, these are the same quality of the set from 4 years ago. Seems so - but I will update this review if necessary.
