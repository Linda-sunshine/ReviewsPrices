review/summary: They do exactly what they're supposed toreview/text: These are my first dummy rounds and definitely worth the money. They load easily and can dry fire without damaging the pin. I can see that like other reviews the paint will probably rub off eventually but they're a sturdy product and seem like they'll hold up for a while.
