review/summary: Defectivereview/text: I got this pedometer for Christmas, and the first battery lasted 8 months. Now, it has gone through 3 new batteries in one week, and there is nothing more frustrating than having your pedometer die in the middle of a day, and not having any more batteries on hand. :(
