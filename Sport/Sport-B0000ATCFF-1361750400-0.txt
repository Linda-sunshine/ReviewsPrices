review/summary: cool shoesreview/text: I bought these shoes for my daughter a few months ago because we could not find them at the store. It was well worth the risk of buying them the wrong size because they are exactly what she was looking for. They don't look cheap, they're not noticeably dirty even when they are, and for a girl mostly importantly, is that they match just about any outfit. We can't find anything negative to say about these shoes.
