review/summary: Divers watch that cannot survive the showerreview/text: This watch cannot take any moisture, even perspiration will kill it dead. Mine stopped working after 90 days. Saw the water inside the watch for about 30 days thinking it would eventually be ok, it was not. Returning now for a refund, total junk.
