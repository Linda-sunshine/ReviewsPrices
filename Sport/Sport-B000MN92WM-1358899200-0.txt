review/summary: Counts well, not too happy with belt clipreview/text: This pedometer seems to count well, but the belt clip mounts too high, making the unit easy to knock off your belt. If I didn't have the strap clipped to a belt loop, the pedometer would hit the floor several times a day, which would probably give it a very short life!
