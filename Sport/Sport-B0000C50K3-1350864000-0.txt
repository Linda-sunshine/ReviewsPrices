review/summary: all in onereview/text: Can't understand why I didn't buy one of these sooner. I have one in a different caliber for my carry pistol and bought this to use on my .22 target pistol and also my m&p15-22. After putting 550 rounds downrange, I put some hoppes solvent on the front of the snake before the bristles and some CLP on the tail end of it and ran it through the barrel twice. Unreal how good this thing does at cleaning the bore of a rifle in a couple of swipes. Ran patches down the barrel after I got home from the weekend and they came out almost clean (cleaner than when I use patches, brushes, and a rod to clean the barrels). For the price, this thing is worth it's weight in gold. Easily pulled through a 6" pistol barrel and the 16 inch barrel on the rifle. I'm buying an extra one in case I ever lose this one.
