review/summary: Best One I've Ownedreview/text: This is a GREAT pedometer! It's easy to set and easy to use. The 7-day history is a nice feature. The only thing I don't like is that the display reads 180 degrees from what I'd prefer. I can certainly read "upside down" but I'm guessing they could change the waist clip and it would still function pretty accurately. The "safety strap" has been a godsend. I've lost 2 other pedometers because the waist clip is poorly designed and they pop off. With this one, even if it gets dislodged from your waist, it swings from the secondary clip.Definitely worth the money.
