review/summary: great :Dreview/text: awesome jump rope!! so much better than my old one and its rlyyy cheap!!!! if ur looking for a good cheap jump rope definitely get this one. its also rlyyy easy to adjust, just read the directions on the back of the cardboad thingy (ull know what i mean once u get it) and ull be fine. also to adjust the rope to the right size stand on the middle of the jump rope and the handles should reach ur armpits. if its too long just cut it to where the rope is at ur armpits.
