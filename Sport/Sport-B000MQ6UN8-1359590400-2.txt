review/summary: The classicsreview/text: The original and classic style shades. Never go wrong with these on. Because of the chinesse fake saturation in every level, you always doubt about the authenticity of the products purchased online. Took mine to a optics shop and made the uv proof. They have 100% UV filter. So, could a fake pair have UV protection?
