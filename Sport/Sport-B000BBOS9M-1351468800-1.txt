review/summary: Sweet and Simplereview/text: I purchased this pillow to replace one I bought about 10 years ago and couldn't be happier with the product. While I loved my old one which finally just couldn't be mended anymore, this one is much improved. It rolls up nice and tight for packing, and it's not hard to do at all, which I know can be an issue with items meant for travel. I was concerned at first that after unrolling it that it would not be fluffy and pillow like, providing little support, but after a few minutes it expanded and fluffed right up. Currently I use it at home but I am about to travel to Africa for six months and have high hopes for this guy!I should mention that I got the red one and I have a small pillow case that fits it and the color does, or rather, did bleed onto the pillow case.
