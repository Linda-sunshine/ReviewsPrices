review/summary: Sorry but had to replace itreview/text: Was very frustrated trying to figure out assembly and installation of batteries.... no directions came with it. Also, mine was defective so contacted Amazon's excellent customer support, and they credited my account without returning it. I bought the Portland Design Works Danger Zone taillight and glad that I spent the extra $20 as it works fantastic.
