review/summary: Better than expectedreview/text: I bought this thermos for my daughter to take to school with her for lunch. We gave it a trial by fire by filling it with hot chicken noodle soup. I then put it in a lunchbag along with some other things including a mini candy bar. I was curious if the outside of the thermos would get warm enough to melt the chocolate. I was pleasantly surprised when my daughter came home and reported that a) the thermos didn't leak b) the outside of the thermos stayed cool and did not melt the candy bar c) her soup was almost too hot to eat four hours after I had put it in the thermos. We've since used this thermos for all kinds of liquids and solids that we want to keep warm. We use it almost every day because it's so versatile. The mouth is wide enough that it's easy to eat directly out of with a spoon or fork. It's very easy to wash and so far I haven't noticed any staining from food on the thermos itself or the lid.
