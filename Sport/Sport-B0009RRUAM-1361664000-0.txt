review/summary: Excellent pillowreview/text: I slept 2 nights with this pillow so far never moved the back material is very grippy so it does not slide around the interior of the pillow seems to be pieces of foam or something it is kind of lumpy but since all of it is very soft it ends up being very comfortable. the fact that is compresses down real small into its own pocket is awesome. makes if very portable. It is very insulating as well I am buying another for my wife it is so good!
