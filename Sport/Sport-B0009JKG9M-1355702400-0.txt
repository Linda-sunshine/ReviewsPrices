review/summary: Easy to use, easy to cleanreview/text: If you're looking for a review from a master chef, look elsewhere; two months ago, I had no idea what a dutch oven was!I don't cook much, but my favorite piece of cookware, by far, has been my heavy cast iron skillet; after learning that you're not actually supposed to clean cast iron with soap (oops!), I decided to get another piece and try caring for it properly. I recently read Tim Ferris' Four Hour Chef and he recommended this piece, so I figured I'd give it a try.After receiving it, I seasoned it one time (put in a little oil, spread it around with a towel, then stuck each piece in the oven for a few hours) and then started using it. After cooking, I use a wet sponge to wipe it down and dislodge anything that sticks. For the most part, everything has come off easily; I've had to use a little elbow grease occasionally but that seems to be improving as the pan gets more use. The top fits well; I haven't yet used it as a separate pan, but it makes a great lid.For the price, I rate this a definite buy.
