review/summary: Perfect for apartment/condo livingreview/text: I've used this grill several times over the past summer and am very happy with it. I live in a condo without a lot of outdoor space. So it fits nicely into my storage area when not in use and easy-as-pie to pop it up whenever I'm in the mood to grill. It's also easy to put in the trunk and take to a park for an impromptu picnic.I preheat it on high with the lid down and, within a few minutes, it's hot enough to seal in the juices of any meat that you're cooking. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the cooking grates are a bit hard to clean, but I'm okay with that as long as it's durable and cooks well.
