review/summary: Good price but could get pain in backreview/text: Product is as described on Amazon. The pillow is good solves it purpose. The only issue is it has a slope in middle of bed. Which makes the back go down and below the legs and head level when you lie on it. I got back pain in 2-3 days of using it.
