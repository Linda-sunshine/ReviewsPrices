review/summary: Works ok, takes some time.review/text: I used this on a flat on my road bike and it worked ok. It took some time and a lot of pumping, but it inflated the tire back to normal. A great save on the road when you're not close to home. The pump comes with a a clip to attach it to the bike. It screwed in under the water bottle and sites along the side of the frame next to the water bottle.
