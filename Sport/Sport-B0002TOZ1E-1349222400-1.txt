review/summary: Fabric Content not as listedreview/text: I have worn gold toe athletic socks for over 20 years. These most recent purchase show a remarked change in the fabric content of the socks. They now only contain 78 percent natural cotton fiber instead of 82 percent as recorded in the Amazon ad. The amount of nylon and polyester has increased and so has the spandex. Instead of being manufactured in our neighboring Mexico, they are made in Honduras. I do not like these changes and do not like that the ads on Amazon are not updated so that you can really tell what you are buying.
