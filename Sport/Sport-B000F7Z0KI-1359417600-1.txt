review/summary: Over a year later...review/text: I've been using my Polar insulated 24 oz bottle daily for over a year. This bottle has had hundreds of gallons through it and it still functions as new.It looks great and the insulation works fairly well. I am very pleased with it. I highly recommend it.On the downside, there are dimples on the inside (they might have changed this on the new bottles) that make it slightly harder to clean thoroughly. After all this time the plastic has gotten a pinkish hue to it inside (looks like pink algae but won't clean off). I came back to buy another bottle. This one will still be in use.
