review/summary: Excellent for the pricereview/text: Have been using this for the last few weeks to ferry my bike to the park and back.Had to get a Cross-Bar Adaptor for the bike to fit on the stand, I have a mountain bike with a medium frame,and it would not fit unless I put the front fork on one of the hooks,did not want to risk damaging the wires so just used an Adaptor.Thanks to the tips in other reviews I used bungee cords and microfiber cloth rags, and there have been no scratches on the car or on the bike.Definitely worth the price, will update after using it for a few months.
