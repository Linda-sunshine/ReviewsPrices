review/summary: Times Easy Trainer Heart Rate Monitor Watch w/chest strapreview/text: Overall it does what is says it will do. Only thing I have noticed is that when I am running on the treadmill I have to keep the watch part on my wrist to get consistent readings. I found it hard to be looking down at my wrist so I strapped it to my treadmill so I could see the readings easily. However, I found that I had to run near the front of the treadmill or it lost the signal with the transponder. If I faded back more towards the middle of the tread it would lose the signal. Use it with my spin bike and have it strapped to the handle bars and it works fine since I am closer then when on the treadmill. Overall I like the price and constant reading you get with the chest strap.
