review/summary: My daughter loves thisreview/text: Bought this for my 3.5 year old for Christmas, and she loves it. Comes preassembled, breaks down to a compact size for transport, is lightweight, is easy to adjust the handlebar height when the time comes. Brake feature isn't being used yet, but once my daughter gets the hang of riding it, I'm sure she'll utilize. Overall a quality, well designed scooter. McFly would have loved this thing!
