review/summary: Useful for Tracking Activityreview/text: Really enjoy using this pedometer to track my activity level. I am desperately trying to lose weight and this has been very helpful tool to track myself. High quality pedometer that seems very accurate and not too sensitive like some are. The belt clip and lanyard are very convenient. I like this and at the price you cannot go wrong
