review/summary: very comfortable- and well madereview/text: I have owned this brand for over a year and they are by far my favorite. I just bought another 2-pair. I now wear both Under Armour and the ExOfficio and I prefer these as they are more generous where it counts. They also seem like they "breath" a bit more to keep me more comfortable. I wear the xxl and these are a really good option for bigger guys. I have tried Champion, Addidas and several others over the last few years. I will likely only buy these in the future. Highly recommended.
