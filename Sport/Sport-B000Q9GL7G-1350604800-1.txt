review/summary: Great basic holster!review/text: Love this holster! Simple design, easy to use! Its also way cool that it comes with not just the belt attachment, but the paddle as well, which is super comfortable. I have an extended mag release on my Glock 22, and a lot of people complain that it rubs your side when the firearm is holstered... not true at all. This holster rocks! Cant beat Serpa CQC holsters!
