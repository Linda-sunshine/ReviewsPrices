review/summary: Not for mereview/text: I'm accustomed to Dansko, Sanita, and Allegria shoes, which are all very comfortable, but require a break in period. I'm ok with that. But these never seemed to get broken in. Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands. I'm on my feet 9 hours a day, on concrete, walking around and up and down stairs, for several miles a day, sometimes with long periods standing (I'm an adult-education instructor). I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time, and was hoping these would be it. I wear a 10 (40) in women's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well (thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order) but they just aren't the shoe for me.
