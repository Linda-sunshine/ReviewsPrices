review/summary: Excellent Socksreview/text: Been buying these for a long time and they are the most comfortable, longest lasting I have found.Switched to Hanes last time around. They were less expensive, but the heels wore through faster, they lost their stretch sooner and were thinner and in general less comfortable.From now on, Gold Toe is all I will buy. I see reviews about the quality deteriorating, but I haven't noticed, and as far as the lint goes, is that really such a big deal??
