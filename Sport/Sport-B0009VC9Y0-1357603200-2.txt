review/summary: Best Aroundreview/text: The knife arrives sharper than a razor blade, the speed assist Kershaw offers if far superior to any other &#34;assisted opening&#34; knife on the market. The build quality is exactly what you would expect from Made In America...Exceptional .I've been the proud owner of many different knifes over the years but none compare to Kershaw.Quality is Top Notch.Customer Service is Extremely Helpful.The Warranty on their knives is Amazing.Worth every penny and some!!
