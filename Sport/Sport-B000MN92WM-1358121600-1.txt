review/summary: Great and useful productreview/text: Have had several pedometers over the years but this item and model is most versatile and reliable. The only problem encountered was changing the battery with metal tool provided. Informed by Omron customer service that only a wooden or plastic utensil should be used in process to avoid corruption of stored data. Otherwise, the ability to download and graph/track daily, weekly, monthly, YTD and total overall activity, is terrific.
