review/summary: Poor qualityreview/text: After being cycled through my gun twice, already leaving flakes of aluminum inside the gun. I bought some for my 9mm as well as .40 S&W, both sets did the same thing. Amazon Prime is a MUST!! Returned them and had a refund before returning home from the post office. Amazon Prime=awesome. A-zoom=crap
