review/summary: Very Comfortable - Convenient Build in pumpreview/text: Used while camping for a week and was delighted by the level of comfort and the ease of inflating with the built in pump! Air loss for me was in line with the many other airbeds I have owned, and with the built in pump, made it easy to top it off every other day or so. Highly recommend this great affordable air mattress!
