review/summary: GREAT!!!!review/text: I dont often write reviews, but I gotta say these things are the real deal. they are everything and then some. I think the sizes are about right. Im a 34 waist with big legs so i went with the large because i have some under armor in medium and they are a little to small for me. so if ur like me &#34;stocky athletic&#34; grab a large.
