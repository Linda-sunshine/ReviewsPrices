review/summary: Great pump, easy to usereview/text: The day I received this pump, my cheap foot one broke and I had a totally deflated tire on my road bike. I was able to completely pump it up with this (though it did take a while and some muscle) but I was thoroughly pleased with its performance. For the price this little guy is hard to beat and definitely worth it.
