review/summary: Be prepared to really BRING IT!review/text: After reading various reviews here and online, I knew this program would be tough. But OMG! If you have never really worked out before, you may find it difficult to jump right in and follow along with Tony. I did and had to cut the first few workouts a bit short. It was soooo worth it though. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to shock their body into losing weight and getting in shape. If you can just stick it out past the first few days it becomes much easier.
