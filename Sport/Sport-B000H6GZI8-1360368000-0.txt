review/summary: Fits wellreview/text: This grip fits my 3rd gen. Glock 36 well but it was pretty hard to get on (very tight fit). I use this in conjunction with a Crimson Trace laser sight that has the activation switch at the middle finger location of the grip.This fits over the activation switch but does not cause it to stay on, which is perfect because the switch had to be pushed very hard to activate before.Overall this cover changes the feel of the grip for the better as it is nice and gripy without tearing up your hand during extended shooting sessions.
