review/summary: Super Versatile Grillreview/text: Gave this to my husband as one of his Christmas gift. He fell in love instantly. He never expected that a gas grill could give this much nice flavor to a steak. We've grilled all kinds of meat, fish, and vegetables with it. No problem at all. It also works out great with my ceramic pot to make stew and soup.
