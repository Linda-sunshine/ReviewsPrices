review/summary: Nissan Theroms review 2review/text: I have had one of these thermoses for a long time, but it was time to replace it. I have purchased an additional one for a friend. It is the best thermos I have had in a long time. The ease of using it with one hand instead or having to screw off a cap makes it convenient when traveling and working without worrying about spills. I love this product and should buy more of them for gifts.
