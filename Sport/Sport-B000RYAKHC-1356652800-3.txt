review/summary: Inexpensive and potent...review/text: Super brite and works well even on overcast days...should fit any seattube, and plan on leaving the mounting bracket in place because it needs Phillips head screwdriver for complete removal. The light itself slides in and out of the bracket just fine. I like it always being there but not everyone will : )
