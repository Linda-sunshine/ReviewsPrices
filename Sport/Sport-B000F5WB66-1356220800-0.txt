review/summary: Great productreview/text: I only got this due to an illness where it was recommended to keep tabs on my heart rate, so for the price figured would give it a try. At first I couldn't get it to start, but when I realized it was ME doing it wrong & got it to work, it's actually a very cool item. I have found it invaluable at the gym, & just in general if I think my heart is racing too much. It's not intended for medical use, so want to emphasize that, but it really does help if you need to keep tabs on your heart rate. Once I'm over my illness, will still use it to maximize my workouts. I have used for a couple of months & the batteries are still good, & I ordered a bunch on Amazon to keep as spares (see my post on the vendor that sells a pack of 5 for a great price). I noticed at the gym the machines pick up the heart signal on them, & I don't even need the watch part sometimes. I like seeing my heart working in real time & just helps with the awareness of what you need to do to keep it strong!
