review/summary: Gloves that don't fit mereview/text: I'm only 5' 7", 133 lb, a small guy. I ordered these men's gloves, size M. Size M arrived. Although they appear and feel nice, they are way too small for me. For decades, all size M gloves fit me fine, but not these. I gave them to my wife (they fit her).
