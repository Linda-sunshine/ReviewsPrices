review/summary: Great portable grill!review/text: We recently bought this grill to take camping with us or just wherever we want to go and this is a pretty great grill. It is a collapsible propane grill that you can use anywhere and everywhere. It burns great and cooks your food evenly and fast which is great. Who wants to carry a large grill around all the time? It really is the perfect outdoor traveling grill and inexpensive. If you want an even better space saving and portable grill, the Cuisinart CGG-200 all foods portable outdoor grill is more worth it. It is a tabletop gas grill. It starts up easily, it is durable, portable, porcelain enamel coated has a built in temperature gauge and a veggie panel. Both are great grills, but i would suggest the cuisinart one just because its smaller.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TOWLTO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag;=amazon070f-20&linkCode;=as2&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B001TOWLTO
