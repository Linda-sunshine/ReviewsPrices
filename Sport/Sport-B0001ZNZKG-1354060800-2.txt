review/summary: Room for Improvementreview/text: An odd review to give, but nonetheless, here we are.Frankly, I was excited: the prospect of purchasing the last piece of underwear a guy could possibly want to own was, well, exciting. Unfortunately, this item did not live up to its hype for me.The bad: I still experienced chafing. Now, this may simply be me: small waist, big thighs, a recipe for disaster given how most modern clothing is designed and made to fit. ("Oh, you have a small waist? You must have child-like thighs and wear skinny jeans!")The good: Having been relegated to exercise routine underwear, it is has survived repeated washing (sans dryer, as instructed) and airs drys quickly as advertised. It also seems to live up to the marketing regarding odor resistance.Improvements: Make it more chafe-resistant. The technology now exists for seamless creation. Given the other technologies employed in its construction and its relatively high price point, this would be a welcome change in a future iteration of the model.So... recommended with reservations.
