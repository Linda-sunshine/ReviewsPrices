review/summary: Fast cleaningreview/text: I find that the boresnake makes cleaning the .17HMR the best way because I had a hard time finding a good bore brush for it that would fit my breach to muzzle kit. I was able to put some solvent in front of the brush part of the snake & behind, then oil with the tail end dry. 2 pulls and I'm done. Will buy other calibers..
