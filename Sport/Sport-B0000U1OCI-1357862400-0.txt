review/summary: Best pedometer I've ever tried.review/text: I love that it has a safety clip, which has come in handy more than once. I really love that it keeps track of 7 days history and resets itself every day. I don't have to worry about starting it every time I get up from my desk to walk. It starts counting itself. It was easy to set up and I'm technically challenged. I know that this pedometer will help keep me on track with my walking goals.
