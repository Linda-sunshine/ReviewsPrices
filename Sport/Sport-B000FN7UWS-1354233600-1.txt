review/summary: The O.G. Kanteen...review/text: I purchased this Kanteen to replace a generic one that I got at a chain pharmacy for my son. We have 3 other Klean Kanteens (24s and one 40oz) and they are holding up great-even after a lot of abuse. All the dents on mine give it "character".I did notice the lid on the new one is all plastic, as opposed to stainless core with a plastic exterior. I'm not sure why they changed this as the old style was good. The 18oz size is just about right for an upper-elementary to middle school kid; not too heavy or large for a packed lunch. Here's a few of my user tips:1. Use an electric engraver to permanently identify and personalize your Kanteen. It's a loud but as easy as using a pen. The Dremel 290-01 is available on Amazon for under $202. If the bottom ever gets "popped out" so that it does not sit level on a flat surface, you can use the corner of a study bench or desk to fix that. Position the Kanteen about 12" up and then slam it down on the corner. This should make the bottom concave enough for it sit flat.Other than wishing they were U.S. made, I'm still a big fan of their products.
