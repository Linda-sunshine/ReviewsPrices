review/summary: Cool little pumpreview/text: I have multiple bikes and am part of an active cycling family. With that said I have fixed many flats on the road. I have used a couple different frame mounted pumps, none have been able to put as much pressure as I can with this pump, it is very portable, easy to mount and light. Being small this pump only has a short stroke therefore it takes a lot of pumping to fill a tire, the only other draw back is that you can actually overfill a tire.
