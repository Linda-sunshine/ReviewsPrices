review/summary: very comfyreview/text: I have been sleeping on this mattress for several weeks now and have no complaints. Its much more comfortable than many other mattress I've slept on in the past. It is easy to inflate and stores the cord conveniently on the mattress. Feel like this was a great purchase.
