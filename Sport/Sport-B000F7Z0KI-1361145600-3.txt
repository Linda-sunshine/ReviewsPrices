review/summary: Stylish Water Bottlereview/text: There are many things that I really like about this water bottle. The design is eye-catching, unusual, I don't mind carrying it in public and because of the little strap, it is easy to carry. The shape of the bottle is ergonomic, intuitively shaped to the human hand. If closed, the bottle doesn't leak when tipped over and no water condenses onto your table or other furnishings when you set it down. I like the pull-out nipple you drink from, it is reminiscent of the disposable plastic water bottles I used to like in the store.In short, I like everything about it except for one thing which is what kept it from 5 stars: for an insulated bottle, it doesn't keep your water cold very long. If you add ice, you can expect about 3-4 hours of coolness (less in summer, I imagine). This means I am constantly adding ice which I find annoying. If you don't care whether your water is cold or not, this is a 5 star bottle.
