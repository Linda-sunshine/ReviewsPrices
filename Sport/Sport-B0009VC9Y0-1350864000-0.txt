review/summary: This Knife is Awesome!review/text: I have had had several Kershaw knifes, and this one meets Kershaw's usual quality. Its simplicity goes hand in hand with its resilient design which allows you to carry it wherever you need to and it's rigged and straight edge combo allows you to rip or slice whatever you're working on. I would recommend this knife to anyone.
