review/summary: I love this bottlereview/text: This water bottle is great. The bite valve is by far the best thing about this bottle. I am handicapped and having this bottle is very easy for my hands. The only reason I did not give this bottle five stars, is the fact that the mouth piece does not come with a cover. I think having a cover would make the product even better.
