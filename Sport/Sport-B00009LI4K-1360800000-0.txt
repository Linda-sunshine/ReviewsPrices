review/summary: Far too big!review/text: I know that plastic earmuffs are big, but WOW! these practically double the width of my head! I originally bought them because I wanted to wear them on the subway over my ear buds, so that way I wouldn't hear the subway noise and wouldn't need to turn my music volume up as loud. Nope. Not only did I look absolutely rediculous wearing these, I could still hear a lot of things on the subway. Yes everything was much duller to hear, but the fact that for the size, they couldn't block out even conversations being had near me makes this not worth the money. Now they're hanging up in storage. However I'm sure they'll work just fine for a more practical use, such as protecting your ears on a construction site.
