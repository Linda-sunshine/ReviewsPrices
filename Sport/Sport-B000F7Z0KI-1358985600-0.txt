review/summary: Best Cycling Water Bottlereview/text: If you cycle when it is remotely warm and you enjoy drinking cool water, then these polar insulated bottles are a must have. The day before I go riding I will typically fill the bottle 1/3 with water and freeze it. If I forget to do that, I'll fill it with ice and then add water. Either way, your water will stay much cooler for much longer.
