review/summary: Will not last!review/text: This item was purchased less than two months ago and it no longer works. I have changed the batteries but it just keeps searching for my heart rate and then goes back to the clock. I thought it was a good price, but unfortunately in this case, you get what you pay for. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on an inferior product.
