review/summary: Nice grip for my Taurus PT140review/text: Definitely heat grip in boiling water prior to installation. I even put just a very small dot of light soap on both sides of pistol grip to aide in the process. A previous reviewer stated they put the grip on upside down to put the middle finger index placement more to their liking. I studied on this and ended up doing the same and it is perfect for my large hand w NO trimming necessary. Well worth the small investment!
