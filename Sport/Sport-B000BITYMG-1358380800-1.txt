review/summary: Saved my FitBit - Husband didn't use and his is gone!review/text: This product, while yes, looks like the mitten keepers you had as a kid (warm weather people, no worries), it works. My pedometer is a Fitbit, so attachment 'string', slides into the center and works great. My husband didn't want to use it and go figure, he lost his. I swear by this leash and wouldn't be without it. I am going to purchase more in the future to save my work door fob from slipping out of it's home. Keep up the great work!
