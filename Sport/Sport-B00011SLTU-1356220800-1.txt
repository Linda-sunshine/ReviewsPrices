review/summary: Handy to keep in your pocket.review/text: I have had one of these before and always found it useful. Why did I buy another one? Because I forgot to leave it at home when I went to an LA Galaxy match and the security made me throw my original one in the trash, which I had for years. They considered it a dangerous weapon with a less than 2 inch blade. Ah well, I have learned not to take this one to Galaxy. LOL.
