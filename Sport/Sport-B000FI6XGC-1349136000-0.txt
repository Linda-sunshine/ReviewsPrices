review/summary: rocket powerreview/text: This pump is awesome!!!!! A must buy for the Biker who wants to travel light. I only had "one" reservation about this item, i could not use it on "schrader valves." I have a presta valve and got an adapter because my valve broke but after a little dismantling of the pump's head I figured it out!!!!! GREAT BUY!!! PLUS IT REQUIRES LITTLE TO NO EFFORT when pumping. Have been using it for the past 3 months now after 4 patches and regular deflation of tires. Works Great!!
