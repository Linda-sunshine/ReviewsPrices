review/summary: work greatreview/text: I already have about 4 of these but ordered 4 more for Christmas presents to fellow cyclist. They keep the drinks cooler, but I fill them half full and lay them a little to their side in the freezer and then just before I go into the TX heat I fill them the rest of the way to the top. By the time I am thirsty it has thawed and still cold.
