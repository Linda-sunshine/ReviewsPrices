review/summary: Mixed thoughtsreview/text: &#34;All-weather&#34; is a mostly true description of these. Needless to say, they aren't for operating in extremes. I've noticed they keep my hands comfortable while on, neither hot nor cold, but as soon as you take them off they loose all heat and have to be warmed again. Also, they don't dry very quickly on their own (compared to other neoprene gloves I've had). To dry them out faster I had to use the wife's blow dryer, which worked in short order minus the fingertips.
