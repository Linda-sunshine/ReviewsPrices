review/summary: These feel great, but not worth the moneyreview/text: Liked:- stretch- feel- very breathable and comfortable- good support- won't stainI do like these but:- if you have big thighs, the nylon will stretch/run in the back of the legs- they cost too much- why would you want to only take 1 pair of underwear on a long trip?So while it'd be great to have a drawer full of these, I have to wonder why anybody would buy a drawer full of these when you can get a 4-pack of normal underwear for half the price of 1 pair.
