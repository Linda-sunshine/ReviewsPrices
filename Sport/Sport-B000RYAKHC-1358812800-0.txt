review/summary: Works great on a motorcycle.review/text: I installed a pair of these on my motorcycle. When I bought the motorcycle it had a tinted rear tail light. I didn't think much of it until a buddy passed me on the way to work early in the morning, and noted that the light was so dim he had a hard time picking me out from the semi in front of me. I quickly bought a pair of these, found a great place to mount them. Having the mounting brackets with a couple sized inserts to choose from helped a lot.I leave them on solid, don't want to blink on the interstate and someone think I'm an actual bicycle. They are put through much more abuse than on a bicycle, but they are still holding up after a few thousand miles. If/when they break, they are cheap enough to replace.
