review/summary: Absolutely fantasticreview/text: I cannot begin to tell you how much I love these things. They're durable, comfortable, buttery. They are just so smooth. They keep the undercarriage nice and dry on hot, sweaty days. Dry may be an overstatement, but they keep you from soaking in your own soup, that's a fact.The elastic is firm. I've owned a pair for just over a year now and I've noticed no loss in tension whatsoever. That being said, I do take care of them. I don't dry them in the dryer as the instructions, which are provided, will tell you. I do wash them in warm water, and I believe the instructions say cold. They are just fine.I own enough pairs to make it the only underwear I wear. On laundry days, though, I have fabric boxer briefs and the difference is just night and day. It may be that I've gotten used to wearing them, but in ExOfficio's, I feel like I'm wearing nothing at all. There's enough space so that your jumblies don't get tangled in a variety of positions, which, admittedly is the point of boxer briefs, but I feel like these just pull it off better.Exercising in them is fantastic. I haven't had them ride up on me.The only small caveat: when you use the fly you will have to add one or two moves to your repertoire to get the beast back in and comfortable. Otherwise, it will be off to the side (NOT PINCHING) and you'll have to do a bit of a dance to get reoriented. Quick to get used to.Don't be intimidated: you don't have to be outdoorsy or even exercise all that much to enjoy these boxer briefs. They are so comfortable for just lying around in and for everyday use. Though they can be pricey, definitely give one a try.
