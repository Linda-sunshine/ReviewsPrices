review/summary: Good small grillreview/text: First time reviewing anything on here. I do wish when people review an item they would not rate it low because of things like slow shipping or poor packaging. The fact that it took a while to get or maybe UPS damaged it in shipping does not reflect the quality of the item which is what you are supposed to be reviewing. The grill is good for it's intended purpose. It is not made for slow grilling a prime rib, it is made for tailgating and making a quick burger or dog, which it does quite well. Very well made, easy to move and you can add the attachment to use a full size tank. I know some of you simply like to caomplain about everything, but try actually thinking what the purpose of the review is. To let others know if the product is good quality and worth the money. I think this item is.
