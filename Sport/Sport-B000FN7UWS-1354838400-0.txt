review/summary: Must keep upright, Cap 2.0 leaks our pours out when closed, as packaging says after arrival.review/text: This cap 2.0 pours water out when upside down. It does not hold water at all due to the air bypass design to allow quick drinking/air replacement. The packaging on arrival notes this. I did not see that disclaimer on Amazon. Cap 2.0 is a rip off and is good for only uses cases when the bottle is always upright.Bottle quality is good, get different cap or competing provider. I think it is a scam/business decision to get people to by the better lids which are an extra ~$10 sold separately, after the get this poor designed cap. Get stainless cap or the Cap 3.0 might be better.
