review/summary: Best boxers everreview/text: These things are just as advertised. They fit snug and are supportive without choking &#34;your boys&#34; out. I wear them under my Aftco fishing shorts when I go fishing and they dry as fast as those shorts do. Perfect for outdoors where you might get wet but don't want soggy undies all day and don't want to be commando.I've traveled with these and 2 pair is all you need. Wash and dry in the hotel overnight, no problem.Comfort is unparalleled. My buddy and I joke that a cotton ball on a baby's butt, laying on a cloud....doesn't even come close to how comfortable these are.
