review/summary: Keeps my soup from leaking..... and that's about it.review/text: My husband bought this for me to take soups and pasta to work and keep it warm. I have not been able to have the food stay even luke warm by lunch time. Its a very nice jar, but it doesn't do much more than hold my food. I've tried putting boiling water in the thermos beforehand and having it set. I've tried letting very hot (burning my hands hot) water run into it for a while. I've had the food piping hot and steaming and no matter what I do, it is cold in about an hour or so. It is a shame because its a nice design, looks great, light, washes nice in the dishwasher or by hand and doesn't leak; but I really just wanted to have at least warm soup for lunch. Really disappointing for my first Thermos product.
