review/summary: You get what you pay for.review/text: It worked flawlessly the first few times, then could only pick up every second or third heartbeat- or was reading my number of footsteps perhaps. A consistent 70bpm reading is not helpful for trying to train, and offputting when it flatlines to 0 bpm in the middle of a run. I could buy some of that gel to smear on under the strap every time, but you shouldn't have to. Not sure if this is a feature of the (very nicely priced) monitor or of this type of product in general, but generally i've been underwhelmed and have stopped even trying to use it when training.
