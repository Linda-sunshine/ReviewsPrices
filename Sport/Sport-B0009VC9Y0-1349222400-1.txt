review/summary: Four stars for good customer service...review/text: When I received my Kershaw Leek I was really unhappy to find that it had a flaw on the flipper. The gimping was cut too deeply near the tip and it was almost cut completely through the flipper. It was still useable, but it should not have made it through Kershaw's QA/QC. My initial assumption was that the knife was a second or a reject, which might have explained why the knife came without a box or documents from Kershaw, but that guess was incorrect. It was simply a flawed knife that just slipped through the cracks - it happens...Thankfully, the vendor Starr Self-Reliance, LLC refunded me the full amount of my purchase without having to be hassled or even prompted. Kudos to them! I am disappointed in the flawed knife, but impressed by the customer service!
