review/summary: Champion Men's Mesh shorts, Medium.review/text: Great shorts! They arrived promptly, are very comfortable, light, and fit great. I wear a size 32-34 jeans (US) and these shorts in medium size fit me great, perfect length. I can easily forget I am wearing shorts, they are so comfortable. I have worn and washed them many times and they are holding up great. The pockets have a good depth to them. Would definitely recommend these.My only beef with these shorts is that the draw strings are really just one string and it's attached to itself in one big loop around your waist and it's a pain for me to tie it for some reason. I cut the loop to have two ends to it and also shortened it a bit, quick fix to a minor quibble.
