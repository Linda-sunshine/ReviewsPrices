review/summary: This Underwear Is Amazing--And I don't review stuff like this.review/text: OK.There's a first for everything, right?This is my first ever review of a pair of underwear (now multiple pairs as I am up to six ExOfficio Men's Boxers--and counting.No matter how active, or inactive and seated at a conference table--these feel good.They never seem to have the issues (creeping upward, wedgies, limited movement, over or under absorbent, and on.) More, they are a pleasure to the touch--and I'll eventually change out all my Boxers to this brand.They are well sewn, the seams don't attack me... they wash well on cold. They don't shrink on high heat drying. Sheesh. I. Am. Reviewing. Underwear. And. Oddly. I. Cared. To. Do. So.(Go Figure.)Try a pair of ExOfficio boxers (and read my other reviews,) as I am in tech--not clothing.I've tried multiple styles and they all seem to rule.The price? Not so much. But strangely worth it.
