review/summary: Buy them and never use themreview/text: Keep them in your trunk, in your backpack, have some around the house, such as with your flashlights and backup batteries. If you don't use them for their intended purpose they could be window coverings or Halloween costumes. Cut them up and make tinsel out of them for the holidays. Use these and a paper punch to make confetti to celebrate when your heat comes back on. You could make some great seat covers out of these for your car.
