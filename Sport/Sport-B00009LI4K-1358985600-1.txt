review/summary: Blocks out most noisereview/text: I bought these earmuffs to use when I was studying for a state licensing exam. I live in a very noisy neighborhood, and most of the noise was blocked effectively. Small noises, like a faucet dripping or clock ticking, were completely blocked out. Other noise, like an ice cream truck, helicopter, loud music played from a car, wasn't blocked out completely, but definitely toned down.I was able to get used to wearing them while laying down and even sleeping, but I don't think they were made for that purpose!
