review/summary: keeps hot drinks hot!review/text: i bought these for my kids to take hot chocolate on ice skating, sledding, snow shoe excursions. they work almost TOO WELL, at keeping their drinks hot. i have to add a lot of cream, or milk to them, before i send my kids off with them. the pop up lid is awesome. i only wish it had a straw. i think it would be a LITTLE easier to drink from, but, i can't complain. they are great thermoses!!
