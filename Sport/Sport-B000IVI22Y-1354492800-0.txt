review/summary: Love. Love. Lovereview/text: I don't leave home without a Camelbak. I keep one at work, one in the car for the gym and one at home. They don't spill, and I find that the &#34;sippy&#34; top actually leads to me drinking more water than when I had a conventional water bottle on my desk. I can fall asleep with it in my bed and it doesn't leak, and I also don't have to uncap anything if i'm thirsty. Perfect lazy water battle for the constantly-hydrated.Also really helpful when running, you don't slosh yourself in the face or drop caps.
