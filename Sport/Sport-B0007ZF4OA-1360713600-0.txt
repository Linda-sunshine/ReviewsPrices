review/summary: Once these things warm up, they last a looong timereview/text: I bought these to take to the Music City Bowl (GO VANDY!). The game was out side (11am) and had snow flurries. I opened 6 packs (12 palm sized warmers) and shook them around in the air (air activated - right) and my wife and I put 2 in our back pant pockets, 2 in our front pant pockets and 2 in out jacket hand pockets about 45 minutes before game time. At first (within 10-15 minutes) I thought they were not going to work but they then started to warm up. They eventually did (20 minutes) and my wife and I very cozy throughout the entire game. (if you take them out of your pocket and try to hold hem in the cold air they are not as effective as leaving them in your pocket and putting your hands in your pocket) After the game they were still all extremely warm and we gave them some tailgaters that were going to be outside celebrating for a while.I have used them on some 20 degree mornings at the local dog park and I open them 20 minutes before I thought I would need them - they worked great. When I came home wiht my dog they were still going strong. I placed a few under her mat and she happily laid on her now heated mat for hours.
