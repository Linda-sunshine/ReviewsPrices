review/summary: Flimsy streamers,Cheap bellreview/text: This is the 3rd Razor A Kick Scooter that I have purchased, in as many years, so, obviously, I like the product. However, with this particular scooter ( I purchased two), the big attraction was the added features, of the bell and streamers. I was very disappointed that they were both cheap, and not very functional (streamers were as flimsy, as paper, and started shedding, right away,out of the box. The bell was no better...hard to make a ring, with the little plastic knocker, on the tiny little bell)...I would have preferred paying a little more, for quality, durable, functional, added features. I was very pleased with the color, since one girl wants pink, and the other purple, and this color satisfied both. Just, give us a better bell and sturdier, heavier plastic, streamers.
