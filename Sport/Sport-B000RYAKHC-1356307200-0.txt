review/summary: Horrible bike mount.review/text: The light itself is really bright. The bike attachment piece is cheap soft plastic. Couldn't get the screw tight enough to hold the light in a level position, so it was often pointed at the ground. Finally the screw vibrated loose and I lost it somewhere. I didn't have the light attached at the time so I mounted it to my rack with the mounting kit that was provided with the rack.
