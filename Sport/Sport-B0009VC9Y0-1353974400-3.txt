review/summary: Solid. Sharp. Compact.review/text: I Highly recommend this product!The blade is super sharp (be careful) and the release on it is great.I'm not an aficionado when it comes to knifes, however, I have bought quite a few over the years.This one has been my favorite far above many of the other ones I have tried. This includes cheaper as well as more expensive knives.If you are looking for a great knife that is sharp, locks, and has a quick release, look no further. This is the knife for you!
