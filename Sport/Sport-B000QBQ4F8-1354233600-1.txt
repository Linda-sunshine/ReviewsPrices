review/summary: almost perfectreview/text: I bought these on amazon, not realizing that the temple arms were short. I was about to return them, but my wife liked them and they fit her. Another thing I thought was interesting is that, although they were in good condition, it looked like someone wore them before they were shipped out. There was a fingerprint on the lens and what looked like makeup smudges on the rims. Not a big deal, but they could have made it look new!
