review/summary: Greatreview/text: I have circulation issues in my fingers both winter and summer. My right hand stays cold year round and most of the time it hurts. I bought these to put inside my arthritis glove that I wear at night since that is the time that my hand causes me the most problems. It works great for me like that. Keeps my hand warm all night.
