review/summary: Great Little Pump for the Pricereview/text: Like others, who have reviewed this product, it took me a bit to figure out how to switch the pump to support Shrader valves, which my Giant bicycle has. Once unscrewed and switched the head around to support the pump worked great and provides the ability to pump up my tire.
