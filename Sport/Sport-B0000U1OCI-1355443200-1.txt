review/summary: Durable and helpfulreview/text: I work in a hospital and used the clip on strap to attach the pedometer to my scrubs- I lost it and it wasn't returned. So I ordered another one and just kept it in my pants pocket. This works great as it keeps me on track for my 10,000 steps. It even went though the wash, but I took it out of the pocket, opened the back to dry it out, replaced the battery... And it continues to work, going on several years now! A helpful tool for losing weight!
