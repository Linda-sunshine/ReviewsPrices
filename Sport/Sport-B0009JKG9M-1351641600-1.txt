review/summary: purchasing a 2nd set for xmas gift!review/text: I am SO happy with this purhcase. I always thought I'd have to pay a whole lot of money and only IF I find an old cast iron, but then I read online that the Lodge's pre-seasoned are great and cheap! So I bought this starter-set and followed other's suggestions to season it 3-4 times when I first get it. Now right now I've got sweet potato hash in the oven, bacon on top, and I'm ordering a second set for my PARENTS who don't even own a cast-iron skillet. :) I'm so excited for more cooking.
