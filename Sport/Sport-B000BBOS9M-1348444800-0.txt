review/summary: A crazy good pillowreview/text: I am shocked by how much I like my pillow (medium size). I like it so much I used it last night in bed at home instead of my expensive down pillows, and woke up feeling great. My kids like it so much they try to steal it. I am a chiropractor and could honestly recommend this pillow to any patient as a home pillow for good neck support (I should get Thermarest to pay me for the endorsement! LOL). It rolls up pretty tight for the backpack too. I am able to roll this pillow up into it's built in stuff-sack and place it into my Teton Sport Explorer 4000's sleeping bag compartment along with my sleeping bag (3.5lb).
