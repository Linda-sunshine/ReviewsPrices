review/summary: Chucks all the way!review/text: I love Converse and this is my ninth pair. Not of the shoe of the same color though. I'm fairly meticulous about taking care of my shoes so all of the ones I own (some for more than 5 years!) still look brand new with moderate wear. They're comfartable, durable, versatile, and flat out cool. Go buy them if you've never owned a pair!
