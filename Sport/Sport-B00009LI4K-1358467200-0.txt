review/summary: Effective and comfortablereview/text: I mostly wear these while working with a chainsaw. Noise reduction is dramatic - My ears wish I bought these sooner. I haven't tried other earmuff type protection units and based my purchase after reading so many prior positive reviews. The size adjustment is easy and stays in place. Recommended.
