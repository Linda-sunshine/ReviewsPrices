review/summary: Doesn't leakreview/text: I love my Camelbak bottle. I was looking for a water bottle that wouldn't leak and it doesn't - EXCEPT when I've left it in the car overnight in the winter - so the temperature gets very cold and when the air in the car gets warm the natural difference in air pressure ends up causing the water to squirt out if you touch the mouth piece. But that's not the fault of the bottle - just science. :) I have no complaints about this bottle and have already gotten another one because I lost my pink one somewhere.
