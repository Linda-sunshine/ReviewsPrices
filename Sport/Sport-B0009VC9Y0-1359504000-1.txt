review/summary: Great for EDCreview/text: The knife is excellent as an EDC around the city and walking through the parking garage. The design looks nice, is extremely light, and the one handed open is very useful. I would have given it a 5 star review but after a week the screws became loose, more specifically the blades screw. I used some blue lock-tight and that seemed to do the trick. I would recommend this knife to anyone who is new to carrying, or adding to a collection.
