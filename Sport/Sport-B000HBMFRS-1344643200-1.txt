review/summary: Gonereview/text: It's been just over a month since I bought this. It was fine for a month, but then the walls or stitches inside the bed kept coming off and the bed became a huge lump like an air balloon. Right now it is exhibition material and I may try getting it into some Guinness record book or something.. Oh wait, maybe someone already got it in there! It says that return period is expired and I don't even know if there is a warranty through which I can exchange it. I had high hopes but very disappointed with this product now.
