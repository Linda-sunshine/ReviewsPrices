review/summary: Very pleasedreview/text: The only decent option for the M&P Shield. Fits well considering this wasn't really made with this gun in mind. A little difficult to get on, will definetly need some hot water encouragement and possibly some very slight trimming at the bottom. Overall, I'm very pleased. I now have a Hogue on all 3 of my pistols and wouldn't have it any other way. It greatly increases grip and comfort.
