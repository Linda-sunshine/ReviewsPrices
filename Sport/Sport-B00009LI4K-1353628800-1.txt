review/summary: VALUE-PLUS EAR PROTECTIONreview/text: My staff members and I have found that these Peltor earphones are hard to beat with respect to bottom-line ear protection and price. Our office is very close to a high-decibel fire siren, so we rely on these devices to guard our hearing whenever it sounds. The Peltors also ensure quiet in less-hazardous situations.
