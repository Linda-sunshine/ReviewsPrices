review/summary: Spoilerreview/text: This bike rack WILL NOT work with a rear spoiler. Was able to use only after removing the spoiler. So long as you make all connections tight this works great. Using it for a women's mountain bike with a tension cross bar. Don't see how you could have two bikes on but as I'm using it, it works great.
