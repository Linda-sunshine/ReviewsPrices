review/summary: Software problemreview/text: Paid extra for this version so I would have the software to track my status... no where in the description does it mention it only works with window based computer. I have an apple so can't use the software. I like the pedometer, but i'm considering sending it back and getting the less expensive version. Why pay for something I can't use>
