review/summary: Gets the job done, nicelyreview/text: I like it. Bought it as a replacement for a different make that lost a couple of screws (which fastened the body to the clip) as I came out of the driver's seat with it hanging on my belt. So I wanted something inexpensive (did someone say I can't trust no more?). Well, it happens this comes with a clip you can slip on and off, so no screws that get yanked out of their shallow hole. I like the clear display, that I can slip it into my pocket (sans clip), and, well, it just gets the job done for me
