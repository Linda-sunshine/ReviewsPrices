review/summary: Does what I need it toreview/text: I like to go mountain biking in the spring and summer time but I only have a little car that I can&#8217;t fit my bike into, even if I take off the front tire. This is rack is really easy for me to put on my car by myself and it holds my bike in place without bouncing around. Last summer I helped a family member move from Oregon to Wyoming and I put their bike on this rack and drove all the way down there on the free-way with it and had no problems at all. Every time we stopped I checked it and it was always really tight and secure. I also like that it folds up to and is easy to store.
