review/summary: Poor Qualityreview/text: Bought 2 for my 80 year old parents. When working, they were okay. Nothing special, but did the job. Within a few months both of them broke. I used the parts of one to fix the other. That one lasted another few months then broke. Between the 2 they lasted a total of 15 months. Very poor quality. I will look for a different brand.
