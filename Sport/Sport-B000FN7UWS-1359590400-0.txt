review/summary: Good Durable Water Bottlereview/text: Not much to say about this ... it's a good quality, unpainted steel bottle, so no chipping or scrapping. It fits a bike rack perfectly, and the cap is small, but seals well.One note: it's a bit much to claim that this fancy grade of &#34;food grade&#34; steel does not taint the water taste at all ... perhaps it's just me, but I can always taste a difference when water comes out of a stainless steel conainer. It's not necessarily a BAD thing, but just don't think that water from this bottle will taste &#34;natural spring clean&#34; or anything.
