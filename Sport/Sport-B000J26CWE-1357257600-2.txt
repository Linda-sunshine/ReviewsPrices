review/summary: Great for running!review/text: I bought these socks to use doing mud runs/obstacle course races. I know the socks I wear doing these event take an extreme beating. The Injinji socks held up excellently for the 10 mile course. The added bonus over other socks is that they kept my toes separated in all the mud, water obstacles, and rain. Although I do run in toe-shoes, I use standard athletic shoes, I will not run a race with another pair of socks again!
