review/summary: Great Gym Shortsreview/text: I purchased a couple of these shorts in different colors to wear to the gym during the course of the week. Perfect for running, elliptical, or stationary bike. No problems with the length of the shorts for a size large (I'm 5-9). Shorts end just before the knees on me. The pockets are necessary when you&#8217;re carrying keys and phone.
