review/summary: Fits perfect for anyone.review/text: I don't use this that often but it is a very good rope. When i got it i went without tightening the length. This initially felt awkward until a friend mentioned you can shorten it. I would test the length multiple times before you cut it. One problem i have is of course i don't have room in my house to do this and on days i can't go to the gym i jump rope outside. This is the reason it loses a star. It has warn down a lot. I was looking around at goodwill and i saw a kids jump rope that had some small plastic rings on it so it doesn't decay the rope. I can't say i want some cheap rings on my rope but this is not meant for outdoor use. If you want it to last you have to use it on a smooth surface.
