review/summary: Fit Well, Super Comfortablereview/text: I needed some sweats to sleep in when i go camping so i bought these. They fit great, have pockets which is nice, and the elastic is snug without being uncomfortable. The elastic is clutch because I don't want my warm air escaping when ever i move. Great quality for the price too. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a casual pair of sweats.
