review/summary: Totally in LOVE!review/text: I don't leave a lot of reviews, but I had to for these! I am totally in LOVE with these pants! I never owned yoga pants before, and I actually bought these to wear under a sweater dress since I lack the confidence for tights. When they arrived, I thought they were going to be too small (I ordered an XL since I just lost 42 pounds), but no! They fit like a dream, and I love how my legs look in them. They are soft, warm, and very flattering! I want to thank the person who created yoga pants because seriously, they are magic! I highly recommend the Bella yoga pants. I will probably order more. O.O Love!
