review/summary: Great for the travel bugreview/text: I travel regularly for work and I now only take a couple pairs of these boxer briefs with me on trips. I've always enjoyed traveling light but socks and underwear can take up a surprising amount of room in a suitcase when you need to plan for more than a week or two. I can now comfortably get by with only two pairs of boxer briefs and a couple pairs of socks (drymax). This pair was purchased to add to my current supply but the original pairs have held up well and I have no complaints about them. If you follow the directions that come with the product, they dry incredibly quickly (a few hours at the most).
