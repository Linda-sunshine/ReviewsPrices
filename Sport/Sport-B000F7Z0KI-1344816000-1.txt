review/summary: After Testingreview/text: I haven't had a thermal bottle before and I needed something that would stay cold in the rain forest for about sixish hours. I personally was a little skeptical to see if it was truly that much greater for trapping in cold conditions and keep out warmer ones. In order to see, I took a normal water bottle and added water that was about 42(f) into each bottle and let them sit for a set amount of time(1 hour) in about 70-75(f), and I came out very impressed. In the end the thermal bottle was about ~10(f) less than the other. Over all this water bottle will be great for my hike.
