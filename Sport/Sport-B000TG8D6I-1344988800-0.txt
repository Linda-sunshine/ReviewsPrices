review/summary: p90xreview/text: p90x is defenetely a commitment so if your having any doubts dont waiste your 200$. i bought the dvd set, 12 video set. the weight bands and bar. i also had to invest in protein powders and supplements, not madatory but helful whilst working out. i had a baby ten months ago and really felt out of shape. p90x workouts are very hard and dont explain how to prefrom some of the basic workout moves so it might be too advanced for someone who has never worked out before. what i found helpful is the nutrition plan that you can follow to keep your diet steady, and never feel starved....important while working out. i can see results two months through and my flexability and stamina are back and stronger than before i had my son. its a healthy weight loss program when done right or bulk up program as well. i follow p90x lean version included in the set.
