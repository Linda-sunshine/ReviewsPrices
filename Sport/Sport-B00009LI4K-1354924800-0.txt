review/summary: Great fit and price.review/text: I began using these instead of my ProEars. Unless I am talking to anyone or listening for line commands I have no need for amplification. Besides these are more comfortable....and batteries for Proears are way expensive. I also use foam plugs concurrently with the muffs.
