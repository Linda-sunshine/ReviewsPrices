review/summary: Super bright and easy to installreview/text: I bought this light specifically for a nighttime bike ride I was attending. This particular event always draws a large crowd, so I had the chance to see many different brands of tailights in action. Without a doubt, my Planet Bike Blinky was noticeably brighter than many other lights and I could be seen from very far away.No installation instructions are included, but I was able to figure out how to install it on my bike without any problems. There are two pieces - a mount that is attached to the bike, and the light itself then clips to the mount. This design allows the light to be quickly removed so it won't get stolen if you have to lock your bike up and leave it. Batteries are also provided in the package which is nice, and there are two modes of operation to choose from - steady on or a fast blink.Taillights are a must for safe nighttime riding and this product is cheaper than many other similar lights. You won't be disappointed!
