review/summary: Soooooo comfortablereview/text: I would like to say in the amount of time I was able to wear these before getting pregnant, they were amazing. Now that I'm trying to get rid of the baby blubber they don't fit as comfortable other than the length which is great! I hope to fit into them more comfortably through sometime this year! Feel like you have nothing on but they are warm. Highly recommend these!
