review/summary: The kind of knife you hate to lose...review/text: I say that because I bought one as a gift for my father. He lost it and called me asking where he could buy another one because he liked the Kershaw so much. I own several Kershaws and have given away probably 10 of these knives as gifts. The recipients are always amazed at how sharp the knives are (and stay). This is the kind of gift you can give someone where they know they've received something special. Can't go wrong with a Kershaw!
