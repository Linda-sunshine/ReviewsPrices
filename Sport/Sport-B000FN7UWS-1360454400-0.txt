review/summary: Klean Kanteen Rocksreview/text: I do backpacking trips and I'm an avid cyclist and thus have owned quite a few water bottles over the years. Klean Kanteen is my current favorite. My boys and I (they are 3 and 5) each have the 18 ounce size with the Poly Sport 2.0 cap and I think it's great for boys their age. It's not incredibly bulky or heavy but holds enough water for them to go on a hike with me and stay hydrated. I like the 40 ounce version as well but it's a tad on the bulky side obviously (I usually bring it in a pack with me on hikes to make sure the boys and I don't run out of water).For smaller kids where the 12 oz size is ideal, Nalgene's kids' water bottle ("Grip 'n Gulp) is awesome if you're OK with plastic (it's BPA free) and looking for a "sippy cup" type lid. Klean Kanteen's sippy lid is a pain to clean and doesn't work as well based on my experience. The Nalgene bottle is also wider near the top and thus is easier to clean by hand. I've owned a few Sigg kids' water bottles as well and I would suggest Nalgene then Klean then Sigg.These things are pretty durable. I've dropped Klean, Sigg and Nalgene bottles on everything from boulders to hardwoods to pavement. Sigg are the least durable of the bunch based on my experience (pretty much anything will dent them). Klean bottles hold up pretty well (my 3 year old has used his as a hammer before and it chipped the paint and caused some scratches but didn't dent it). Nalgene bottles are pretty much indestructible and you have to try really hard to break those darn things (I have never succeeded in fact).Bottom line: I currently choose Klean Kanteen because they are made of stainless steel. I don't like Sigg's "mystery liner". Nalgene's BPA-free bottles are probably totally safe and I've used them for years (even before they made BPA-free versions) but steel trumps plastic in terms of what I'm looking for at the moment.
