review/summary: Here's the Rubreview/text: I bought these googles for my son who swims competitively. As soon as he tried them on he said that the lense was touching his eyelashes and it bothered him. He told his coach and she said let me try them and they also rubbed her eyelashes. I guess the latex is so soft if collapses so the lense approaches the eyes too close. He doesn't wear them at all now.
