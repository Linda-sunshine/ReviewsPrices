review/summary: The name speaks for itselfreview/text: Coleman impressed me! I decided to replace my Weber Q for a Coleman Road Trip LXE because my dad told me that it was way better than the former. Since it's doesn't cost much, I gave it a try. The package arrived and I prepared myself for hours of assembly but I was surprised that the grill looks ready to use already. I only had to install the wheels, the regulator and handle and it was ready for a test. What I loathe most about using grills is the fact that you have to put water underneath so as not to stain it (according to tips from most manuals) but this one didn't have such guideline. I realized later that you really don't need to put water since it's unbelievably easy to clean. This is highly recommended for people who love tailgating, camping and fishing since it's easy to pack and assemble.
