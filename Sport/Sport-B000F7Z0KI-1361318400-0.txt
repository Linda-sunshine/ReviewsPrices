review/summary: Great water bottlereview/text: Arrived on time and as advertised. Great design ans attractive looking. Easy to put ices cubes it . Keeps things cool for quite long. On my one hour bike ride in the summer using the old bottle; all ice cubes melt by the end of the ride. With this new bottle, I still have lots of ice at the end of my bike ride.
