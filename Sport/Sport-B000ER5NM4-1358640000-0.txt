review/summary: Very tight band!review/text: I found these pants while I was looking to buy a secondary pair of yoga pants from a brand that I already own. These were suggested by Amazon and I was drawn to the fact that these had a long inseam. I prefer yoga/ athletic pants to be long.So, I ordered these in black and I was disappointed. The top band of these are WAY too tight. They are high waisted and sit at the top of your natural waist, which I do not care for, and then, the top band is very constricting. Many brands of yoga pants have a band that you can fold down- these also do not fold. These are very uncomfortable to wear. I am a medium in most clothes- sometimes a small depending on the brand. The medium fits fine everywhere but at the top of the waistband. I do like that length, but thats about it. I wish I had just ordered what I had intended to.
