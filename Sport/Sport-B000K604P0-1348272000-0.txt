review/summary: Thermos Nissan JMW500P6 16-Ounce Stainless-Steel Backpack Bottle, Silverreview/text: so far im very happy with this flask. it certainly keeps hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for many many hours. it does not leak, its easy to drink from with one handed opening.its my favourite everyday drinks bottle. i prefer it over my nalgene and goyut design bottles although i do wish it was available in 1 litre.
