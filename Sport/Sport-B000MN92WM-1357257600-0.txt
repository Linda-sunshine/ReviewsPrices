review/summary: Walking For My Health who would have believed it....review/text: I couldn't believe that when I started using this pedometer I was walking a paultry 2500/3500 steps per day. I felt lethargic, my blood sugar, blood pressure, my weight and health were all headed in the wrong direction. This device has been my loyal companion and has encouraged me to keep going through rain, shine and storm since I got it April 2011, that was 6,192,639 steps ago as of 12/31/2012. I have shed 30+ pounds (not as much as I want but it feels good not having to drag it around), it has lowered my blood pressure, my sugar is close to normal and I feel great. I never thought that walking could have such an impact, thanks to this pedometer I have been able to keep my health on track. I strongly recommend this as a life changer and you get one; get the one that will keep track of your daily progress over time it really does encourage you to keep going. Thanks to the folks at Omron for building a long lasting, reliable and durable device that one can trust to do the job. I bought a second one in the event I lose or somehow break the one I have.
