review/summary: Bought 2review/text: Bought 2 of these. Much better sound protection than the electronic Howard Leights they replace. Cans are a bit large. I did a mock up shooting a scoed rifle and I was hitting the stock a bit. Hope it's not an issue. Got these because every time my wife and I go to the range we always end up next to a tool firing his cannon repeatedly with wreckless abandon.
