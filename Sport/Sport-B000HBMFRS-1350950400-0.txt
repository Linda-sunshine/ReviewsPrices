review/summary: Excellent product...review/text: I love this airbed...I am completely satisfied by this purchase! I bought this air mattress to give my old friend a comfy place to sleep while visiting. Filled up in a few minutes using the built-in electric pump...totally comfortable...held air for 5 nights straight. Emptied in no time using the same built-in electric pump. At a mere $45.00 this is quite a bargain!!!
