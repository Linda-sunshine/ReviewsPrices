review/summary: Great Introduction to INSANITYreview/text: I just received my DVD today and finished one round with it. It holds up to the name pretty well and had me sweating pretty good about half way through. I'm not sure why people are complaining about the audio/video quality. Everything was clear and crisp for me. Did it ever occur to anyone to turn up the volume, haha?For those sitting on the fence about buying the larger INSANITY package, this is an awesome introduction and stands as a good workout on its own. Also perfect for those with busy schedules. Easy to fit in a session before work or before bed. After 30-60 days of use, don't expect to keep progressing much though. That is the time to upgrade and push yourself further.
