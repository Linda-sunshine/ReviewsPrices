review/summary: Backpacking pillowreview/text: I use this for backpacking, i need a pillow to sleep, and this exceded my expectations for comfort. Takes up a little space in the pack but weighs almost nothing, i actually liked the size and shape it compresses into, it worked well in my pack to help balance the load by taking up a little space but adding little weight, luffed up nicely and compresses easily, i wont take a trip without it, beats a stuff sack full of clothes for sure. I got the small and love it.
