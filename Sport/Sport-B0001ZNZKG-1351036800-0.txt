review/summary: Awesome Boxersreview/text: These are fantastic! I'm 5' 11" 190lbs and what I would consider a muscular build. Medium fit me perfectly. My favorite aspect of the boxers is that they don't ride up. With cotton boxers, as my pants go up and down my leg when moving around throughout the day, my pants grab the boxers and pull them up little by little. These are made out of a smooth fabric that allows my pants to slide over them, never pulling/bunching the boxers up. After I bought them I wore the same pair for four days without washing them. They were completely fine, I changed them on the fourth day, because... why push it when the risk is smelling dirty. Great boxers.
