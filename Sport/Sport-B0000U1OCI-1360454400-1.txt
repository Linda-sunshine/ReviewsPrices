review/summary: Easy to use but doesn't work in pocketreview/text: As other reviewers have said, this is easy to set up and use. It's accurate and the clip doesn't budge. Negative: I tried it in the pocket of my pants one day and it didn't register 85% of my steps. I'll keep it, but you should know that it works best clipped to your pants, not tossed in your pocket (or purse as it claims).
