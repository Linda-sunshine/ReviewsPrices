review/summary: Perfectly Portablereview/text: I must walk .75 miles to the train every day to get to work so I thought it would be better to scoot there. This has cut my walk time by about 60%! It's also a great alternative to a bicycle because you can just fold it up and bring it on the train with you! It only weighs 5 lbs and is about 4&#34;x16&#34; when folded, so its no burden to carry. I am 5'2&#34; and it's the perfect size for me to both ride and carry. The only complaint I have is that it wore out so quickly! I only ride on smooth sidewalks and still the wheels are all chopped up and the steering wheel is constantly going crooked. If you're thinking of getting this as a daily transportation tool, know that its life will only be about 3 months.
