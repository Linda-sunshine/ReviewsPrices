review/summary: Worst. Mat. Ever.review/text: These mats initially caught my eye because of the eye-catching bright colors and perceived value. When you search for 'yoga mat,' these mats come up as the second best selling item so I figured that they must be worth my money. Unfortunately I couldn't have been more wrong...The first mat I ordered was the color 'light green,' which judging by the picture, looks like a brilliant shade of mint green. When it arrived, it was a dull olive green, nothing like the color swatch shown on the item page. Since this color was nothing like the color shown on the page, I thought surely they had just shipped the wrong color. What was weird was that when I double checked the invoice, it said 'light green.' It dawned on me that the color representation of this particular mat must have just been wrong. I wasn't ready to throw in the towel just yet and decided to send it back and reorder a new color 'teal green.' When the 'teal green' mat arrived it was THE EXACT SAME DULL OLIVE GREEN COLOR!!... MADDENING!!!!By this point, I was incredibly frustrated and decided to simply settle with the second mat. On my very first class, I found that not only the mat was incredibly, dangerously slippery, it also fell apart before my eyes. All it took was one brush across the mat with my toenail to scratch off a whole line of mat material that ended up covering my pants by the end of class. Finally, when I went to roll it up after class, I found that it wouldn't even roll evenly because it was cut wrong.So in closing...1) The actual colors of the mats are in no way similar to the colors pictured2) The mats are dangerously slippery3) The mats fall apart after one use4) They are poorly constructed and not symmetricalDon't waste your money.
