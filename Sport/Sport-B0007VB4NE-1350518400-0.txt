review/summary: This is not a desk chairreview/text: I wanted to return this item but missed the window to do so. We put the chair together and realized that this chair was much top short to be used at a typical desk. I immediately put it at my desk and knew that this chair would not work. I have a standard desk so it is not the issue of the desk being taller than normal. Measure your desk before ordering. Also, the nuts that hold the ball rest onto the chair were the wrong size.
