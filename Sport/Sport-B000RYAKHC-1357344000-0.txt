review/summary: Bright and noticeable.review/text: Easily seen from a good distance at night, especially in blinking mode. Install was simple, but it isn't very firm - the light moves somewhat when the bike is in motion. It doesn't move enough to really affect the visibility, but it's something I am looking for extra rubber to tighten up.
