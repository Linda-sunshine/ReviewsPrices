review/summary: Coolreview/text: When I first hit these it was rather difficult fitting all my toes in at first but became progressively easier after third time, its true to size also I'm 6'2 so when it says big and tall definitely, I have more wiggle room in my pinky toe in my Harlem Knights voice above all else get them they work well with the addidas toe shoe when working out. You heard it again from Chiro Doc!
