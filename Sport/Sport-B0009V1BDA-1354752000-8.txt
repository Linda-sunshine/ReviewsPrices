review/summary: A solid little grill for light duty workreview/text: The Coleman is a great grill for light-duty grilling. It is unit is easy to fold and to carry and works great for thin meats, hamburgers, hotdogs. I love it when the family wants something on the grill and the thought of firing up the household one for a couple hamburgers isn't appealing. Also the side tables are fine for light stuff (utensils, ingredients, your beer) but the holders don't look sturdy enough for anything heavier than a plate.
