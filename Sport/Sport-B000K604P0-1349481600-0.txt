review/summary: My Nisson Thermo'sreview/text: I ordered 1 thermos in Espresso. I enjoyed it so much I ordered another in a Smoke color. I now have one for coffee and one for water. I love the fact that fingerprints don't show when handling and that there is no spillage. The best ever. I also bought another from a friend that ordered one too many. I gave this one as a gift to my daughter. Cathy Streiff
