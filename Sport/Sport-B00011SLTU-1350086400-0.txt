review/summary: Handy!review/text: Very cute and handy pocket knife you can attach to your keychain. I must say that I've found it very useful and handy on several occasions, especially for the scissors. You never know when you need scissors! The toothpick is also very convenient when you're out somewhere public and you realize you have something in your teeth. The tweezers are great for whenever I need to reach for something in a tight crevice. Works great. Totally recommend :)
