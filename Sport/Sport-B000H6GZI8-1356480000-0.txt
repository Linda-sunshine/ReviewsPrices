review/summary: Nice for the price.review/text: I can't ask for much more. The grip was priced low and fit my Taurus 740 very well with minor trimming. Installation works well when following the instructions on warming the grip to allow it to stretch.It slips a little while in use, possibly when your hand warms the grip. It actually twists slightly but still offers a nice cushioned grip.
