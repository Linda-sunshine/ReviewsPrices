review/summary: Got it for Mountain Bike, Doesn't Seem to Work At All on Schrader tubesreview/text: I can't seem to pump the tire at all. After deflating it all the way with my non-portable pump, I just couldn't get the pump on the valve. I knew it was set up for Schrader valves, because if I took the little plastic out and put it directly on the tire it would start draining the tire, but I couldn't manage to actually lock harness onto valve for pumping. Even after getting it on the valve slight it was really hard to get off. I hear this works fine on road bikes, but on my mountain bike it does not.
