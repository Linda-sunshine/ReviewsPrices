review/summary: Worth the money.review/text: The most important thing is, read the directions carefully! Make sure you're accurate with the a.m/p.m. If you don't have it set right, it'll totally throw you off of your miles. I love the clip that you can attach to your pocket or waist so you don't lose the pedometer.I'm very satisfied with this product;)
