review/summary: Gorgeous, Cheap Garbagereview/text: Opened the box, WOW! It is drop dead gorgeous! Read the instructions, attempted to follow same. Fergitaboutit! Both Chronograph buttons frozen solid. Guess I could of worn it as a time piece only except it would have aggravated me every time I looked at it. Then noted it was running when I opened the box. Hmmmmmmm, a previous return methinks. Back to Amazon with it, no more for me.
