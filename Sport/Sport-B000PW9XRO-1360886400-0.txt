review/summary: The second skin glovereview/text: These gloves were SO much better quality then I thought they were going to be. Note that these arnt work gloves and they wouldn't hold up well to anything more than light use. However these were designed as all weather shooting gloves and they work in the role perfectly. They literally hug to your skin giving you as much dexterity as possible. On another note these will keep your mitts warm down to a realistic temp and since the palms are synthetic leather (wont swell) and the back is neoprene these dry very very quickly. I imagine these would make excellent dive gloves. For this price they simply can't be beat!
