review/summary: Have only tried two so far!review/text: The idea is good but, they can be annoying! I insert it in the earpiece port of IPad, it is both handy and annoying! Especially when holding the IPad in my hands....Wish it came with a clamp or something such that would be safe to use on IPad -- not scratching it!
