review/summary: arms are far apartreview/text: I like how easy this is to put on and take off my car. Sturdy and holds up to regular use. However, I have to rate it a 3 because the arms to hold your bike are too far apart and not adjustable. I have a small frame freeride bike and I have to put it at a crazy angle because the arms are wider than the top tube. It holds well at a crazy angle, but I have to mount the rack off center on my trunk so my bike does not extend too far past the side of my vehicle. I see many racks with similar spacing but warn you--if you are small or plan to use this for children's bikes, you may find it awkward and difficult to position the bikes in a different way.
