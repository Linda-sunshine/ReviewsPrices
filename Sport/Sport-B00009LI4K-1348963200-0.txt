review/summary: Awesome Earmuffs!review/text: Hello to all who seek knowledge on this product!I recently purchased these for use at an indoor gun range. They performed very welland are extremely comfortable. The NRR of 30db was very important to me. As a guitarist and music lover (I'm ebealienhead on YouTube if you care to listen/look)I try to take very good care of my hearing. Let me also just say that when I shoot(Glock 30sf 45 auto) I also wear foam earplugs with a NRR of 29 in addition to these muffs. Worn together you have the best hearing protection available...Depending on the situation you don't always need to double up, but when firing a pistol at 158db for 30 min or an hour (and others next to you shooting as well)It's a VERY good idea.These muffs would be PERFECT for machine shops, mowing the lawn, leaf blowers, shop vacs, etc.Lots of padding and very comfortable to wear. The thick padding did not interfearwith the polycarbonate protective eyewear I use on the range either. I also boughtthis same pair in the "behind the head" model as well. I use this particular pair when I'm wearing hat at the range.So, in a couple of words, BUY THEM...They are worth it. PROTECT your hearing! If your ears ever ring after a loud noise, or prolonged exposure to noise, you've done some damage. Wear these when you KNOW you are going into an enviroment where noise is excessive or prolonged.Right! I've said my pieceEnjoy!
