review/summary: Sweats evolve into Tightsreview/text: My expectation of sweats are baggy, loose fitting pants to wear around the house.I'm a 34&#34; waist so I ordered the medium (as usual). After a handful of washes, they are tight like a new tube sock. I feel like i gained 10 lbs, but I didn't.If I were to buy this item again, I would order -at least- one size larger and suffer the bagginess until the shrinkage stopped.But that's the thing, I won't buy this again...Bottom line, kinda thin and expect shrinkage.
