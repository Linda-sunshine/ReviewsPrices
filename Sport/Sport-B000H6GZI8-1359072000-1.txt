review/summary: Fits Like A Glove on the SCCY CPX-2review/text: I took a chance on this grip. I was looking for a grip for my SCCY CPX-2 (I know, a what?). To find the exact size I would need, I gave Hogue a call and they didn't have an answer for me but they were very helpful in their attempt. I then called about a Pachmayr slip grip and the only thing they told me was, "We don't make on for that!"(talk about customer service). So I took a chance and bought this one and it fits perfectly, with absolutely no trimming needed. The no trimming required thing was important to me. I hate spending money on something just to turn around and cut it up.The thing is a beast to put on, but Hogue grips usually are. I had to use window cleaner and a hair dryer to get it on. Originally, I put it on upside down since that's the only way it looks like it will fit at first glance. The grip fits, upside down, but the finger notch doesn't line up correctly. So, I spent an hour debating on if I wanted to wrestle that thing off to try the other way. I think that hour, let the grip stretch some because when I got it off and put it back on, right-side-up, it slipped right into place and the notch lined up nicely.I looked around, quite a bit, on forums for advice on grips but really didn't find anything for this gun. Most people haven't even heard of this particular gun, so finding accessories for it is difficult. So, if you're looking for a great grip for your CPX-2, the Hogue Jr. is a perfect route in my opinion.
