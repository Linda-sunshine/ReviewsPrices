review/summary: Better than our regular mattress for comfortreview/text: We were needing some temp beds for our visits to our home out of state and found these on Amazon at an exceptional price. We got 2 twin mattresses instead of a queen so that we don't disturb each other as much when we shift and so we can split them up for guests that don't like each other that much ; ) Another reviewer had good advice to let them air out before use, because they do have an odor for the first 24 hours. They lost very little air over the 4 days we used them and virtually none during our evening use of them. Just add a little air prior to bedtime and you're good to go. I do recommend a blanket or comforter below you if you like sleeping with the room a little cool because the air in the mattress stays at the same temp and does suck all your heat away through the night. As for comfort, both me and my wife agree they were more firm than the pillowtop mattress we have at home, yet soft enough to give where you need it... and we both have back problems that are always aggravated by the standard hotel mattresses. We have slept on air mattresses in the past, but this was by far the best we have tried.
