review/summary: Just perfect!review/text: I bought this scooter as a birthday gift for an 5 year old boy. It was a hit! He totally loves to ride it. There is no assembly required. Just adjust the handlebar to the appropriate height and off you go. After using the scooter it can easily be folded up for storage. I would definitely recommend this product to any 5+ year old.
