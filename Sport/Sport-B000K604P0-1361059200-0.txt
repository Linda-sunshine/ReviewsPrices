review/summary: Awesome thermosreview/text: I had one of these before but had lost it. I finally got around to getting another one. This the best thermos I have ever owned. I have tried many but his one is great. Most others will keep your coffee hot but the lid is best part of this one. Being able to drink really hot coffee out of it in a controlled manner. The only bad part is the price. But I believe it's worth every penny.
