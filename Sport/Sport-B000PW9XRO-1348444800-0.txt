review/summary: great glovesreview/text: The gloves are great,they are skin tight and thin which make it easy to handle the ammo and reload both clip and gun. They also help absorb some recoil from my hand gun and rifle.I liked them so much i even orderd a pair for my wife,she likes that they keep her hands from smelling like gun powder. Thanks
