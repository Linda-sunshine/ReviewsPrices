review/summary: Bought this for my Savage Model 93 HMRreview/text: This boresnake works great. I bought them for my 243,22 and some of my other rifles. They do the trick on smaller guns since there is very tight clearances and the barrels are so small. Just use some solvent and gun oil on it and your chambers. You can't go wrong with this. Fast shippping and super easy transaction. I would do business with them again.
