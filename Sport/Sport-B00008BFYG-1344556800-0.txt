review/summary: Good for childrenreview/text: I bought a black one and a blue one for my little siblings, who are 4 and 6. It's good for children up to 10. They really love it. It doesn't take too much balancing and there's no learning curve, like there is for a bike, so when they go to the park/playground, they won't get bored. The blue color is really nice. The ability to fold it and put it away after they're done makes it that much better.
