review/summary: Returned this watchreview/text: There are many variations of Invicta diver's watches. I had read in some reviews about one watch being much smaller than others. By mistake I ordered this one, which is only 38 mm across. When I received it I was surprised at how small the face looked. The circular bezel takes up a lot he space so the face was quite small. I returned it and ordered the larger titanium version. I just received the replacement and am very happy with its size. Invicta watches are great value for money. Just beware of the size before ordering.
