review/summary: Why havent I got one of these earlierreview/text: My son has been trying to get me to buy one of these for a long time but I am an old rod and patch person and thought there was no other way to completely clean the bore of a gun. I finally purchased one of these and I am impressed. It really does the job, especially out in the field when you need to do a quick cleaning and caint carry all the accessories needed to do it right. I also use this in conjunction with wetting down the bore with solvent and soaking, then use the bore snake to remove the fouling. It works like a dream. I have one of these for every caliber now.
