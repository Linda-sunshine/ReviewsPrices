review/summary: Surprisingly Comfortablereview/text: I have been trying to lighten the weight I bring to the outdoors, but I also want to be comfortable at the same time. The king-size pillows I have on my bed are way too heavy to lug around so I started looking at pillows specifically made for camping. More importantly, I needed to find something my very picky girlfriend would like as well. I read some great reviews about this pillow on Amazon so I figured I would give it a try.When I first received the large size pillow, I was underwhelmed. I unrolled it from its compressed state and fluffed it up a bit. I knew it would take a while to reach its full loft, but it felt lumpy and it did not seem like it would be comfortable. A few hours later, I got back to the pillow and it seemed fuller but still seemed lumpy to me. Merely squeezing it in my hand caused it to flatten out. I just left it where it was and waited for my girlfriend to get home and test it out.The first thing she said when she laid on it was "it's a little noisy". She did not mention the lumpiness that I felt but she commented that the pillow was very soft. We were about to go to bed by this time so she figured she would give it an overnight test.She did not mention anything about the pillow that morning, but the next evening, she made sure the camping pillow was under her head. I asked her how she liked it and said, "You may not be getting the pillow back." The following evening, she was kind enough to allow me to use my new pillow and I have to agree with her; it is very soft and I do not notice the lumpiness I can feel with my hands when I lie on it. Also, the fabric is very soft and the pillow does not compress as much as I thought it would, even under my big head.Overall, this pillow was a great buy and I can highly recommend it to anyone who wants a compressible, light weight pillow for camping or traveling.
