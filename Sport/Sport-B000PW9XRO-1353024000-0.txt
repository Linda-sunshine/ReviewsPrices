review/summary: Second skinreview/text: I love these gloves! They feel lik a second layer of skin. I am able to draw my weapon with ease from the holster and the feel is perfect. These gloves are also very comfortable when I'm hunting with my shotgun. Here's the kicker I can still use my touch screen cellphone with no problem!
