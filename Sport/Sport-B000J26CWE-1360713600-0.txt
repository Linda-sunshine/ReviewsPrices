review/summary: Sizes have changedreview/text: I ordered xl to match the 3 pairs that I bought just over 2 years ago with my vibram five fingers. The xl that I had previously bought fit my size 13 feet perfectly, however, the xl that I got this time were a bit on the large side. I'm not sure if injinji has made the sizes to fit a more broad range of sizes or what, but next time I think I will order large instead. Overall great sock for use with vibram shoes or with any shoe for that fact. I would own only these if they were a little (or a lot) cheaper.
