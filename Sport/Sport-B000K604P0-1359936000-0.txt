review/summary: Latch breaks, manu doesn't stand behind despite warrantyreview/text: This bottle is absolutely outstanding at keeping water cold but the hinge/tab break VERY easily...I had two different ones each break in 6 months with less than daily use. Despite a 5 year (I think) warranty on the product, the lid is not covered and the manufacturer did nothing. Will not purchase a Thermos product again for this reason... a true test of a company is how they stand behind their products/handle complaints and Thermos failed.
