review/summary: awesome and punishingreview/text: After I adjusted it to my height, it worked like a dream. The handles fit comfortably in my palms, and the material of the rope can get some fierce speed without too much force. My only complaint is that it stings like a $&#%&#er when I miss a jump and it whips my toes.
