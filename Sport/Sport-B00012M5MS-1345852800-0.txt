review/summary: Everything I hoped it would bereview/text: Sorry I don't have a cool crash story to exemplify how great a helmet this is. But I can say it fits snug and comfortable with a few adjustments. Fortunately, the straps on this helmet lay flat against your face unlike another helmet that also got great reviews. That said, it's important to spend several minutes adjusting and tightening the straps until they are just right. With this done, you will barely notice the helmet and will be more able to focus in your ride.
