review/summary: a must for your pedometerreview/text: I purchased this at the same time I purchased the Omron pocket pedometer. The Omron comes with a safety leash, but it's a plastic clip and it didn't take long before it broke. Luckily I had this already as a backup. It's got a metal clip so it doesn't break. It has saved me from dropping the pedometer on the ground several times and possibly from losing it. I would highly recommend that you purchase this at the same time so that you have it ready when the other breaks.
