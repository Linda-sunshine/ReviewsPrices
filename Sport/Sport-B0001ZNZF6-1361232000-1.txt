review/summary: Surprisingly worth the pricereview/text: $20 for underwear seemed ridiculous to me. I was somewhat athletic as a young adult and apparently developed big thighs in proportion to my waist. I prefer boxers but have had the hardest time finding boxers that fit in the legs. Most bunch up and cut off the circulation when I am sitting. Finally i decided to take a chance on these. I love ExOfficio pants so why not? These are everything they are cracked up to be. They are super light weight, breathe really well, Best of all they do not bunch up on me and cut off circulation. I never thought I would spend $20 for underwear, but these are well worth it to me. I have not actually tried hand washing so I am not sure about durability or how long it takes them to dry.
