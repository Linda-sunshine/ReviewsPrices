review/summary: As if wearing...review/text: ....nothing***from a pugilistic view***These boxers are extremely comfortable. I hesitated when I thought I could've bought 6 boxers @ Wal-mart for the price of one.After finally taking the plunge when it was on lightning deal, I am oh so glad that I bought them.I've always had elastic issues with underwears. The bands on these didn't have a "feel like a rubber band around my waist" effect.All the materials used as well as the structure itself has a feel of QUALITY. And it IS quality...In the photos, it looks like they are form-fitting, but it isn't some spandex that tugs and hugs your curve. It is just so rested that it follows your contour so it lightly drapes over you vs. hugging and tugging you. The family gem stones definitely appreciate the extra breathing room that these boxers extend.well constructed and extremely comfortable.While I wouldn't box nekkid, wearing these would definitely feel that I was boxing nekkid...That's how comfortable they are... well worth the price (especially when it's on lightning deal...)heck, I loved them so much, I bought a second pair a month later. :-)
