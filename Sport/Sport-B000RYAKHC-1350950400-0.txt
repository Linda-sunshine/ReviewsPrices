review/summary: Absurdly small plastic bit on clip breaks too easilyreview/text: I received this and mounted this bike light on the same day and biked out to my night job, which clearly explains the need for a rather bright bike light. I will concede that the light is quite bright, and blinks reasonably well. However, let me frame the scenario for you: I ride a cruiser bike, single-speed, on a city road the whole way, no off-roading or rough gravel road, yet this broke off THAT VERY SAME NIGHT as I was returning home. Fortunately I noticed and was able to retrieve the fallen light without too much of a detour. What a disappointment! Upon further inspection, I saw that the part broke off was a tiny plastic bit on the clip that attached the light to the bracket. Really, PlanetBike, really? You're supposed to be a bike company and you make something so fragile? Now I have to see if I can get a replacement or refund, and get something else that has actual practicality. Sheesh.
