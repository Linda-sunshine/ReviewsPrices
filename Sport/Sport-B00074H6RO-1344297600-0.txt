review/summary: Quite Solidreview/text: I've been waiting to write this review until I knew whether or not this product was going to last or not. I've been using these gloves for about a year now and they have yet to rip yet at all. They are now all broken in and feel very comfortable. They also still are protecting my hands just as well as the first day (but now they are formed better to my hands). I have even recommended that a few of my friends get these gloves as well. They are quite inexpensive and in my experience they have lasted quite well. Hopefully they will last as well for you.
