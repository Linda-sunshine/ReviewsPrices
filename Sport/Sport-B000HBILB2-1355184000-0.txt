review/summary: not 80in in lengthreview/text: I ordered it because I have a 6ft 8in relative who spends time with me. The description says this airbed is 40in wide and 80 inches in length. The box housing the bed clearly states the bed is 39 in wide and 75 inches long. I am really disappointed because I have been shopping for this for over 3 months and only recently decided this was the right bed. WRONG!The goal is to provide comfort. /his won't, his feet will be hanging off the edge of the bed. Its going back.
