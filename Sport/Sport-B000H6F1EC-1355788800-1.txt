review/summary: Surprisingly disappointed.review/text: I read the reviews on these sweats before I ordered. Some of them made comment about them running small. The price was really good and I wear an X-Large. So I figured, I would get the XX-Large and be safe. I don't mind them running big, as long as they have closed bottoms and if they are small, I should still be able to get away with it. &#34;WRONG !!!!!!!&#34; When I got them I was excited. I tried them right away and I was so dissapointed. They felt like skinny jeans. I even asked my wife if she wanted them and they were too small for her. I called my daughter and she didn't want them. I believe this was only the second time I ever returned anything back to Amazon. Of course, problem free return. I do most all my shopping on Amazon. They treat their customers very well. I went and ordered the Champion sweats from Amazon. More expencive, but well worth it. This is my recommendation.
