review/summary: very comfortable for extended wear on campoutsreview/text: I'm active in Boy Scouts and use these for all of our weekend campouts where showers are not always available. They work awesome and after 2 days, they hold their shape with no odor. They work as advertised and when hiking on longer trips (3+ days), they dry fast after rinsing. They may be a little more expensive, but I think they are worth it.
