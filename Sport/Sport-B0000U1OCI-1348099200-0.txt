review/summary: Pocket Pedometerreview/text: I LOVE this little pocket pedometer. I am never without it. It is easy to program and very easy to use. It is now an integral part of my fitness program and has helped me keep my power walking program going. It's great to see what I've accomplished at the end of every day; how many miles I did, how many of them were aerobic, and of course how many calories I burned. The only caution is, be sure to check/record your daily data before midnight, because this unit is automatic and like Cinderella, it turns back into a pumpkin at midnight; wipes out all data and goes to zero.
