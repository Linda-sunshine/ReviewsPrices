review/summary: Dopereview/text: Great product to keep you motivated. The only draw back is that they are at least an hour long so it takes a chunk out of your day by the time you shower. In addition, after two play throughs you will be muting it because Tony Horton's jokes weren't funny the first time let alone the third, fourth, fifth time.
