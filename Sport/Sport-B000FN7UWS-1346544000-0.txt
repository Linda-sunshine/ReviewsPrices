review/summary: pretty goodreview/text: I purchased 2 of these and so far I really like it. The sports 2.0 cup is actually pretty good and is the one I use the most... I bought the open cup one too. I recommend buying a brita pitcher/filter also to fill your canteens up. I recently converted from buying water bottles anymore and its probably one of the best habits i have changed over. money isnt an issue but bringing cases of water up steps is the most annoying thing ever. also i think the brita filter water taste a lot more clearer/better than bottles. :)
