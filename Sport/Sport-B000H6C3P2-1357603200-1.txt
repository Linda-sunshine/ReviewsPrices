review/summary: Hogue grip Stag Arms model 3 AR15review/text: 5 stars all the way!! This thing dropped right in place of the cheap factory plastic crap grip. It is so comfortable to hold and relaxes my hand it seems when I'm shooting. Another excellent upgrade by Hogue. I have a Stag Arms model 3 AR15, and like I said this thing dropped right in place, snug fit with no gaps or wobble. Buy this and you will love it as well.
