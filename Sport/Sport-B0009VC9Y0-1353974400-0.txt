review/summary: Great Everyday Carry Knifereview/text: I have this with the smooth blade in sunburst pink. This is a high quality durable item. I would recommend this to anyone. The speed safe opening mechanism is great. The blade is high quality, it is both strong and sharp. I haven't found anything I've needed to cut that this wouldn't cut. I've had this knife for over six months now and I'm very pleased with it.The only problem is that it falls out of my pocket often despite the clip (I believe this happens because women's jeans have shallower pockets than men's jeans). When it falls out of my pocket and hits the floor it springs open if you don't have the plastic locking mechanism engaged. I have dropped mine so many times that the plastic mechanism is broken. If you're not careful this could be safety hazard, this is the only reason it doesn't get a five star.
