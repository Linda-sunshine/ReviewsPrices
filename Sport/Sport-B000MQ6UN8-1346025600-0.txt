review/summary: Great sunglasses, glad they are not polarizedreview/text: These are great classic and timeless sunglasses that never seem to go out of style and also provide great eye protection.I'm glad they are not polarized because with polarized lenses, you sometimes cannot see instrumentation screens or your iphone screen.I got the 62mm size and at first they seemed really large however I have gotten a lot of compliments on them and have since seen photos of various celebrities with they large ones on as well so they must be cool.I'm quite happy with my purchase.
