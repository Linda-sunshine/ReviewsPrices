review/summary: Fit for my Sig Mosquitoreview/text: Needed a better grip for a Sig Mosquito. Read reviews and had some doubts. I wasn't easy to get this grip on my pistol as it was extremely tight, but in the end, PERFECTION. Gives me that extra grip for the small grip on a Sig Mosquito.Just a smaller version of the large ones.If you have a grip that might be too thin for you, this may be the answer.
