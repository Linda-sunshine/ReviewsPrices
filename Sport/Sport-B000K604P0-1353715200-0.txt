review/summary: Best sippy cup ever.review/text: THE best &#34;sippy cup&#34; I have ever had. It actually does keep hot coffee hot all day. It doesn't leak a bit, It is easy one hand open and close, and it is durable. My last one stood up to falling out of the truck, down stairs of tables and desks and rolling down hills but it didn't stand up to falling out of the cupholder on the tractor and getting run over by the york rake.As soon as that happened, during my grief, I order two replacements. I highly suggest it unless you are on my christmas list, then you'll probably get one from Santajack.
