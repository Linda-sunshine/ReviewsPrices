review/summary: great glovesreview/text: These are by far the best gloves I have been able to find at a reasonable price. I have had them for about 9 months. I usually throw them in the washer once or twice a month and just let them air dry. All the other gloves I have tried would've had at least one or two holes by now. The only minor problem is they run a bit small so would order one or two sizes larger.
