review/summary: Extremely useful and convenientreview/text: Great knife and quality as usual with Victorinox, the champion plus is probably my favorite version of the SAK due to its usefulness and amount of tools. A little heavier than the lighter models but the size is still good for EDC. I use my multitools for larger tasks but I keep the champion plus at my desk at all times for light duty uses. I especially love the magnifying glass, tweezers and needle (behind the corkscrew). Basically a mini, super toolbox in a small footprint, something I cant go without now everyday.
