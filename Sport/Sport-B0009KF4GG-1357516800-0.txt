review/summary: Quality product.review/text: This product is the perfect size and mix of tools for everyday use. The size it not too big while providing a nice range of tools. The blades are sharp out of the box. I wish the magnifier was mounted in metal instead of being all plastic (less chance of breaking). This knife replaced a Mountaineer. This knife has almost 2x the number of tools but is not much wider than the previous one that it is still comfortable for everyday carry in a pocket.
