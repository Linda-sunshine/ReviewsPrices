review/summary: Not a flaw to be foundreview/text: Very simply put, these feed flawlessly in both of my 9mm pistols and in all 5 magazines. Wonderful training aid for dry firing as well as imposing weapon/ammo malfunctions while live firing. I wanted to get some for my sister's .38sp/.357 but those only come in a package of 6. I'll be ordering a set for my .45LC pistol soon.
