review/summary: Does the job consistently!review/text: I've used this product for 5 running session since I bought and it does the promised job very well. Function of reading the heart rate and toggle to timing is pretty straight forward. Feature to set timer beeps at desired interval can take this product to delightful level. So, a rating of 4 stars. Since the timer beep is missing, it's difficult to keep your eyes off the watch if you are undergoing Interval Training. Otherwise, I'd highly recommend this product.
