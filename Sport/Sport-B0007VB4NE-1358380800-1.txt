review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I am disappointed because I have not been able to sit in the chair. I can't screw the nuts onto the support bar; the nuts are too small. I couldn't even fit them on using a "grown-up" pair of pliers. Is there a way to get replacement nuts without having to return the whole chair? Thank you.
