review/summary: Great pillow, worth the money.review/text: I know these pillows are a little bit pricey, but if you are going to be using it for any extended period of time or do a lot of camping I would highly recommend it. My husband and I each have one of these in size Large and love them. We used these pillows for 2 months straight while in South Africa. They pack to about a 1/4 of their full size and puff up nicely. I love that you can throw the whole pillow in the washer and dryer and how plump it comes out afterwards. It doesn't stay as fat as when you first take it out of the dryer and after sleeping on it for a few nights it loses a bit of it loft, but it is still a great pillow. HIGHLY recommend for any extended or frequent camping. Well worth the money for the 2 months we used these for.
