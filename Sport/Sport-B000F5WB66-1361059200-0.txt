review/summary: Save your moneyreview/text: I just got this gizmo a couple of days ago and it doesn't work. Oh, it'll keep time but it's not going to tell you how fast your heart is pumping. I've tried getting the sensor wet until if I wanted it to be wetter, I'd have to get in the shower. Once it did work but I had to have the receiver touching the chest sensor. Not really what I'm looking for while excersizing.Save your money and spend it on something else that possibly works.
