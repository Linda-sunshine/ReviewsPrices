review/summary: Great extra bed!review/text: I purchased this when my son and family came for a week long stay. It was easy to fill up and it stayed filled the entire time. Queen size sheets fit perfectly and they said it was very comfortable to sleep on. When it came time to take it down I was able to deflate it by myself with no problem. I would recommend it for anyone needing an extra bed for guests.
