review/summary: Great Rackreview/text: After reading the reviews, I was skeptical about buying this rack. I took a risk, and it payed off. Sure, the rack isn't a Thule, but the price doesn't rival a Thule either. At around $30 you get an exceptional value. I am leary of putting two bikes on it, because the bikes can get pretty heavy for this bike rack. But for the short distances I drive to the trails to ride, it is worth it and works great for my needs. Friends cannot believe how little I payed for this bike rack. It fits nicely into my trunk when I park at the trails, and it goes on/off in a snap. Realistically, as much of us understand I cannot afford a $200 rack, so this is exactly what I need for an inexpensive way to keep in shape, and enjoy the scenery. I recommend this product, just be smart about how fast you take turns, and the weight of the bikes.
