review/summary: Qualityreview/text: This is a great little bottle for those wanting to keep water cooler longer. Also, I use it for recovery drinks because the nozzle can be removed and cleaned.In fact, the whole reason I got this and NOT the camelbak bottle is because the nozzle comes out...and because the bear on the front is cool. :)
