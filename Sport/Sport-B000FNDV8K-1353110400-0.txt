review/summary: Neat way to replace a similar lost knifereview/text: I used a google search to find a replacement for my lost knife. This came from an airport security check and was no doubt taken from a passenger. It showed moderate wear but was otherwise functional. Was sold at an attractive price compared to new ones.
