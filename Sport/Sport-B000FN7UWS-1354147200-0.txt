review/summary: This bottle leaks...review/text: I previously had the same sized Klean Kanteen bottle which worked fine. I lost it so bought another one. Unfortunately the new bottle leaked no matter how tightly I tried to screw in the cap. I discovered this when I was carrying it in my purse. I tried to make do with this leaky bottle for a while, always making sure it's upright, in cars, in airplanes, while going for a walk, in the end I decided it's really not worth it. I'll look for another bottle.
