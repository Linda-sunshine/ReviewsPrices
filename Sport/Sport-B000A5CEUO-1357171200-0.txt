review/summary: Good basic heart rate monitor.review/text: Worked first time after I wore the chest strap with Spectra 360 Electrode Gel. I have had it for a month. Monitors the heart rate really well. Don't have any problem so far. I use the watch by itself more often. Essentially, it is a good basic heart rate monitor. Doesn't have fancy stuff you can get with Garmin HRM's, like GPS functions. All actions are done by pressing the buttons. No touch type actions, which don't work some time. Very easy to replace battery in the chest strap. Also, it is not that hard to replace the battery in the monitor (watch), if you are a bit handy type of person. On the negative side, the monitor (sports watch) is not that good looking. A bit harder to see the display in sun, and low light conditions, compared to my old Casio watch. All in all, I think, I made a very good decision to buy this product.
