review/summary: Harbinger Rocks!review/text: Harbinger has proven to be the best weight lifting gloves I've ever used. They outlast any other glove I've ever tried. While many gloves last me only a few months, I can usually get at least a year out of Harbingers, and I lift five times a week. The fact that they are washable is a great plus as well.
