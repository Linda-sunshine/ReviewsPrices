review/summary: Works really wellreview/text: I have checked it against mile markers on walking path and by comparing with manually counted steps, seems to be very accurate. It's intuitive and easy to use, display is easier to read than most pedometers that I have had.It has a user replaceable battery so that you can use it till you loose it.What I like best is that I can carry it in my pocket and get an accurate reading- it isn't necessary to clip to a belt. The belt clip is on a removable holster, and it has a nice form for carrying in the pocket.
