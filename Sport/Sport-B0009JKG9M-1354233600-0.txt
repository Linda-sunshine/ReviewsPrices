review/summary: Couldnt be more pleased with this!review/text: I couldn't be more pleased with this than I am! Item is well made, good quality and heavy. Lodge Logic is well known for their quality and sturdiness in their products and I have bought their products in the past. I love this combo cooker, I am able to use the lid as a shallow depth skillet, as suggested, does a great job. And the larger bottom is perfect for cooking many things, such as fried chicken. These items are well made and if I take care of them right, will probably last a 100 years, and my great, great, grandkids will be using them! Never leave a cast iron cooking utensil wet to dry on its own, or even just dry with a dish towel. Turn a burner on low on the stove, and place item on their to heat up for a about a minute or two, then turn off burner. Or place in a heated oven for a little while and you are good to go. Get a little cooking oil on a paper towel and rub the oil into the cast iron to keep the seasoning going. This also prevents rust and removes any rust.
