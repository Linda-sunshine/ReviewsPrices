review/summary: Nice Bottle - Big and Pretty Good at Keeping Water Coldreview/text: I've used the bottle a few times, typically for 15-20 mile recreational rides. It's large (I have the 24 oz., my wife the 20 oz.) and fits very well into the Zefal Spring Bottle Cage without any movement or rattling. We usually start with ice water and it will typically stay cold for at least a couple of hours. I looked at bottles with other valve systems but I didn't want to worry about mold build-up so went with this simpler system. These bottles work perfectly for our type of use.
