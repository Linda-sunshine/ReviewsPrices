review/summary: Great for 3+review/text: I bought 2 of these.One for my 4 year old and one for my 2 year old.My 2 year old loves it and uses it for hours but he can't really skate on it.At 3 my daughter was able to use it no problem and now that she is 4 she is a pro on it.I love it as I don't have to wait for the kids to catch up on a walk they zoom and its made walks a lot nicer...and faster!The quality is great. Very sturdy, good wheels.The best thing about them is that the kids develop their balance using these.
