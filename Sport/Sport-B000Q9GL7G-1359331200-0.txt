review/summary: BlackHawk Serpa Holster Super Securereview/text: This is a great Holster, I like the paddle option making it quick to put on and off. the paddle is soild with little flex. Also the exterior trigger lock is great for security and safety and puts your finger in the correct position when you draw.What kept me from 5 stars are the 2 hooks that are optional on the paddle to hook to your belt if you like and then the hook that is permanent on the lower paddle. If all 3 are on the paddle its near impossilbe to take the holster off with out taking down your pants. Even with just the one lower permanent hook, it very difficult to take the holster off. Of course, this makes it super secure from someone trying to take your gun off you. I have 2 other holster with paddles and they have different methods of keeping it on but are easier to remove.I would recommend this hoster to friends and I would consider purchasing it again.
