review/summary: a short timereview/text: I've had the Invict now for a short while so it's really hard to say anything good or bad. One thing I did notice is the part that latches at the end of the band seems a little cheap and the band is to big but that can be a easy fix. I'll wait awhile and give another rewiew.
