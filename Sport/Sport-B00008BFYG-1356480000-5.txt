review/summary: Thank you.review/text: Product and shipping were as intended and satisfactory. It did arrive in time for a birthday gift and the recipient is delighted. Internal box was ripped at end, but external shipping box was in good condition. It could have been packed a little better so it didn't slip around inside the larger shipping box. I purchased from this seller at an okay price weeks ago and overall the prices are now much higher online and in stores. I believe, even my price should have been about five dollars lower since this is really a simple cruiser for relatively light weight, beginner, elementary aged kids. I did not reduce the star rating, because I experienced no complications and really...$5 above the most competitive price and no shipping, personal gas/shopping time is okay. Thank you.
