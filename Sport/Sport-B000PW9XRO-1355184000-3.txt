review/summary: worked wellreview/text: These were very comfortable while still allowing full manipulation of my firearm. The palm and fingers have plenty of grip. They offer some warmth, which was nice, but I am not sure how &#34;all weather&#34; they are. Since they are a neoprene-like material on the back, I am guessing they would not be great in rain, but I have not tried them in rain.
