review/summary: It works for mereview/text: I bought one for me and my wife. We want to get in 10,000 steps a day as part of our effort in managing our exercise regimen and this product is meeting what the manufacturer claims. I especially like the safety line attached to the device as it has saved me from having it drop off several times already. The mode button allows me to review the calories burned and distance traveled. It is easy to set up (you need to determine your stride) and the instructions are easy to follow. I gave it five stars because of easy setup, easy to read instructions and the fact that it does what it is supposed to do.
