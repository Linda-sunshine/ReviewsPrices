review/summary: depends on how frequently you use itreview/text: i don't know how long yoga mats are supposed to last. i used this mat once or twice a week for a little over a year and it's now starting to crumble (i just purchased a new, different replacement mat). the mat colors are attractive and they are nice and dense, but you will have to replace it somewhat frequently.
