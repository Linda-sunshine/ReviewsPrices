review/summary: Potential danger.review/text: I am not a tailgator. I bought this for the backyard. Easy to assemble. Cooks just fine. However, it is top heavy and very wobbly. If not placed on very firm (like concrete) ground, it has a high risk of easily falling over. Even when placed on a wooden platform it needed to be lashed down to the platform to increase its stability. A redesign of the legs (longer with a wider base than the top, 4 wheels instead of 2) would solve this problem.
