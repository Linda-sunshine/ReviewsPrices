review/summary: Bottom of the Barrel?review/text: This product is functional so far but appearance wise it is now at the "wavery" stage which I wouldn't have expected for a new product maybe after a few years of wear but not within a couple of weeks of regular use. What's up with this? I am already thinking of ways to improve the safety leash as it might not last much longer but what does one expect for a couple of bucks? Also I have found that at times the small loop slips out of the Fitbit or the clasp doesn't hold & have found the clasp being "saved" by the Fitbit or just dangling by itself. Live & learn. For a company that services heart monitors I expected more & would have paid more for a higher quality product.
