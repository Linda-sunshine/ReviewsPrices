review/summary: Perfectreview/text: I bought this mattress because my parents were coming to visit and I figured I'd sleep on the mattress in my 2nd bedroom so my parents could have my bed. That was back in July and I'm still sleeping on the mattress long after they've gone home. It is so comfortable and I have only needed to put a little more air in every couple of weeks. You can not get a better product especially for how inexpensive it was.
