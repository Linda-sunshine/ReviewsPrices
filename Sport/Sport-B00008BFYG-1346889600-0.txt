review/summary: Great Scooter for My 5-year oldreview/text: I purchased the Razor A Kick Scooter for my 5-year old after his starter scooter (Radio Flyer) fell apart. The other kids in the neighborhood all seemed to be riding Razors and I knew my son would like to have one. It arrived assembled and was ready to go. It is easy for my 5-year old to ride and extremely light weight if it needs to be carried.
