review/summary: Great productreview/text: Best to remember these are adjustable. When I first received these they would not fit over my ear and I was beginning to become irate that these did not work. The frames are adjustable, however very stiff and that is a great thing. The stay on your head firmly once adjusted. After adjusting the frame, these work very well for noise reduction either for the range or around the house doing yard work.
