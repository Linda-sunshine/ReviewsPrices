review/summary: It's Okayreview/text: It's a nice bed for guests who are not staying too long...3 years later the bed inflates..but deflates in less than an hour with two people on it and makes for the most uncomfortable night ever !Intex is overall is a good brand, I am not sure if 3 years is the typical life expectancy (with an average of the bed being used 3 weeks a year) but ours did not make it til the end :-(
