review/summary: So comfortable!review/text: I love this pillow! While it doesn't fold down as small as some camping pillows, it is far superior in comfort. The medium folds to the side greater than a Nalgene bottle which is bigger than my Therm-a-rest NeoAir Trekker. The fabric is a micro-suede which makes it easy to wipe down and clean.
