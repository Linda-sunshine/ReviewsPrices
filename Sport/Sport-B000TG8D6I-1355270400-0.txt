review/summary: The best fitness program I've ever triedreview/text: I've used a number of other home fitness programs, many of which produced good results. However, P90X has more than exceeded my expectations. The workouts are tough (in a good way!), and I always leave feeling like I've &#34;brought it.&#34; The Yoga X and Kenpo X routines are by far my favorites. I dread Core Synergy, but only because it pushes me to my outer limits. I highly recommend P90X, and I plan to move on to X2 after completing the program.
