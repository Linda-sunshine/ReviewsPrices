review/summary: Good Value but not Perfectreview/text: It is a great value if you only looking for the heart rate, time and a few functions. Compare to my other similar product, Sportline 1060, the display is smaller and difficult to read in weak lighting conditions but much easy to set up and cost about half for me. The heart rate reading is comparable.
