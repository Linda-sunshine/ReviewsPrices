review/summary: P90X Awesomereview/text: I am 41 and apparently in alittle better shape than I thought but still over weight and in need of a program I could stick with. I have to say that due to my work and lifestyle (international airline pilot, not like United but like way international, my 355 pax carry guns) it was hard to stick with a regiment. As long as you have a DVD player (laptop) and some bands and a door this program will do what it advertises. It keeps you motivated and interested. I cant hop on the tred and watch deadliest catch anymore but I can press play and see results. Tony Horton rocks, and he makes his workeouts so almost anyone can do it even with a few injurys. Highly recommended. But same thing goes you got to press play for it to work.
