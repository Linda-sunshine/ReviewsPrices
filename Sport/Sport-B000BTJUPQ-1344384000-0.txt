review/summary: Great quality, it is worth the price!review/text: My daughter is 10 yrs old and she loves this product. It is made out of very good materials, very resistant, not only the string but also the bow and the arrows; it is very precise, it uses a rod to stretch the string. However, I do not recommend it for younger kids. I also have a 7 yrs old boy and it seems to be hard for him to manage it as it is not as light as the one sold at Walmart for $7 and not as small either.
