review/summary: Kind of Pricy But works Wellreview/text: We needed this for a class I was doing where we need to log 10-12000 steps per day. I haven't had any problems with it at all. Although, I do think it's a little pricy considering other alternatives out there.It seems to lag a bit on walking in place which is why only 4 stars. Sometimes it doesn't read those steps and I wonder if it has something to do with the way I have it set up rather than the way the pedometer actually works.All in all I think it's a great tool, and it works well. I do think there are cheaper options that would work just as good however.
