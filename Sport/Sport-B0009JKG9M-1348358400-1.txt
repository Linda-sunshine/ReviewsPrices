review/summary: great cast iron panreview/text: This is a great set of cast iron wear. Frying pan fits as lid. Good for single older people that do not want to heft around an monster kettle anymore. Cooks very evenly and the price cannot be beat. Super fast shipping and included a recipe pamphlet and list of other products I believe. Makes good soups and stews, split pea or Chinese soups. and also long stewed Chinese foods. Extra benefit is that it helps with anemia as the cast iron gives you a bit extra. Alos it was pre seasoned which is a nice plus.Would recommend to anyone. A+++++++++++
