review/summary: excellent product so farreview/text: The watch works very well, easier to operate and care for than a Polar, which I have used. I also like the fact that the watch and the chest strap each have a battery and it's easily replaced. And the monitor provides continuous heart rate readout, useful during exercise. My only concern: The chest strap is fastened using a plastic tab which is not very sturdy, so it will likely break away at some time. When that happens, I'll have to figure out a way to close the strap tightly enough so that it can do its job. Timex doesn't seem to allow for this eventuality, except to sell replacement straps. An Internet search shows that the cost of a new strap is almost that of the original package! But I'm not sure if the straps advertised are compatible with this watch. If not, the only option will be to buy a new monitor and strap.
