review/summary: I have a big head...review/text: ... and I'm not talking about my ego. I've always liked Schwinn products, and this one seems to be excellent - except that it doesn't fit my long 7 1/2 size head. If you wear a size 7 or smaller hat, then this should be a great helmet for you. The dial adjuster on the back is super easy to use with the helmet on, and the cam locks on the side straps seem to be very secure. There's even enough length to the straps to leave some room for adjustment under my chin (which was a problem with my old Specialized helmet).Unfortunately, I'll be returning this and getting aBell XLV Bike Helmetinstead. If any of the Schwinn helmets on Amazon were clearly listed as fitting an XL head size, I'd stay with my loyalties.
