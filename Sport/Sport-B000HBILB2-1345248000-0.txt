review/summary: Works wellreview/text: I bought this to have for overnight guests to my small apartment. I read a lot of reviews and went to some stores looking for the best features. I found this on Amazon and it seemed to be one of the best available. It's in my office at work at the moment where I sometimes stretch out on it and work on my laptop so I can prop up my feet. It holds the air well, and only needs a top-up every couple of weeks when I leave it blown up. The pump is not too loud, and it's very easy to work. The electric cord is a bit short, but I got an extension cord for it so I can orient it without worrying about where the outlet is (it always seems to happen that I want to place it facing away from the outlet). Lots of people have plopped down on it and declared it very comfortable while discussing work issues with me.
