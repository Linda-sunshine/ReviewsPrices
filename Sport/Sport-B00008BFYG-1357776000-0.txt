review/summary: Well madereview/text: My husband bought two folding scooters for our custodial grandsons when they were 2 and 4 years old. By the time the boys grew into them they were stolen. We bought 2 of these razors to replace them and gave them to the boys for Christmas. These are better, safer, more stable and easier to ride then the ones we had stolen. The Amazon price on these is very reasonable. We keep them in the car to have whenever we stop at the park. Our grandsons love them.
