review/summary: Not durablereview/text: Within the first week the visor/brim became loose and would no longer fit into the slots so whenever its windy, the brim flaps in the wind. Then the knob to adjust the size of the helmet fell off so it no longer fits properly. If that's not bad enough the straps for the helmet came inverted but the clips are fixed in such a way that it can't be easily fixed. This is definitely a poor quality product and I've only had it for less than a year.
