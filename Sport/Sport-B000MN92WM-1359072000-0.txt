review/summary: New Pedometer came Usedreview/text: I ordered this pedometer and was so excited about it. However, I was extremely disappointed when i received it and it was not only used and already turned on, wasting battery life, but the manual had someones writing written all over it to calculate their stride and personal information. I am extremely disappointed that i paid for a brand new product and received something very used.
