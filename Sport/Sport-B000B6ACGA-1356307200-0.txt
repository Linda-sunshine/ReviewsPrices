review/summary: I like it.review/text: I purchased four. Two have a little problem but are hoping with use it will work itself out. It seems the card holder is too tight, consequently the cards will not come down automatically. It needs to be pushed by hand.I have one that I purchased five years ago at a Flea Market and it is still working! Due to its age, I wanted another one on reserve just in case it should die due to age.
