review/summary: Good pillowreview/text: I bought this for a trip overseas to use on the plane. I like it better than the plane pillow. I thought it would roll up smaller though but it still fit in my carry on bag.UPDATE: I have the medium pillow it's a little bit bigger than a plane pillow. If you are a man you might want to get the larger one. Remember to fluff the pillow I didn't at first and just stood there a looked at it waiting for it to do something.
