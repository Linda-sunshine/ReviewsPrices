review/summary: My second Invictareview/text: Just received it yesterday but from looks alone it's a beauty.This is my 2nd Invicta.My current one still runs fine. Aside from the minute ring falling off (recently) It takes any abuse I can heap on it.I swim with it, chop wood with it, drop it, etc. and it keeps on going.Initially it was a little fast but now keeps nearly perfect time.I'm expecting the same from this new one.
