review/summary: Superior Design - My Glock Fits Like a Glovereview/text: After trying out many competing holsters I settled on the BlackHawk Serpa CQC model. I find the design and function of this holster outperforms older traditional holsters. I have read many accounts of altercations or fights in close quarters where the &#34;other guy&#34; grabs for the gun and sometimes they succeed at which point the odds are stacked against the person who was carrying the gun. In a life threatening situation I do not want to make a move for my gun until I am at least 7 to 8 feet away from the assailant. The Serpa lock on this holster prevents it from being removed until the lever is pressed releasing the lock at which point the pistol can be withdrawn. After practicing this movement over several days it becomes quite easy to release the gun quickly.The holster is made from a very tough injection molded plastic that is easy to clean and it appears to be well made and should last for years. There is also an adjustment for the amount of friction you want to apply against your gun when withdrawing or inserting it into the holster. This is a slick feature that allows you to customize the feel of the holster to suit your preference. The holster comes with a sturdy belt attachment that can be adjusted to fit the width of your belt. I ran around the yard testing the holster and my Glock is really secure once inserted into this BlackHawk holster. I am very pleased with this product and now I am going to order the matching BlackHawk magazine holder to go with the holster.
