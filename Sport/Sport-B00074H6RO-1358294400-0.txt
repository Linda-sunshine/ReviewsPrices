review/summary: Way too smallreview/text: I bought these as a backup to have for the gym at my apartment for when I can't make it to the gym at work. The gloves I've used are Harbinger 155s in a size Medium (they're great and stretched to size after using them for 2 weeks.).After reading reviews, I decided to get an X-Large in the H-143s. I have long, thin fingers and I didn't want to get some that were too small. Let me just say these are still way too small, regardless. The finger holes are way too tight (as is the palm), but the wrist is loose. I don't know why this is the case, but I do know that whenever I do "push" exercises, like on chest day, my palms start to cramp up from trying to hold the weights. I'd rather have calluses on my hands than drop a 60 lbs dumbbell on my face from my hand giving out.I'm going to attempt to further break them in, but after using them sporadically for over a month I don't see that happening. I purchased mine from Amazon, not from a 3rd party seller, in case anyone was wondering. Feels like a nice glove other than the sizing issue.
