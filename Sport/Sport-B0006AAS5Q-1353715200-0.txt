review/summary: Look Wise its coolreview/text: I received this watch on time and its looks are same as shown on the website, but unfortunately I received the technical damage piece, as I want to adjust the time and try to pull its crown to adjust it as I saw its not working and chronograph button also not functioning its looking like a dummy buttons that's why I return the product to AMAZON for replacement.Look wise its a great product and Invicta is well known brand in Watch world industry, I have 2 more watches from Invicta which I purchased from my city centre they are working perfectly from years. I request Amazon team to thoroughly check the product when you are dispatching to your customer as your customers are from worldwide and face difficulty in shipping back the product to Amazon.And one more thing tachymeter is looking very clear and black dark in photograph but its dull when I received the product.This is my first time purchasing experience from AMAZON.COM and its bitter hope next time onwards I will received the items in good and working condition.
