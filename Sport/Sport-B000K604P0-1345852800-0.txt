review/summary: Buy it without a doubt!review/text: I have been searching for a leak-proof mug for a long long time... even bought another one from Thermos which leaked all over... so this bottle was mailed to me as a replacement... I now own a second iteration of this bottle, because I finally broke the first one by repeatedly dropping it on various cement floors and staircases (I am astonished that it was able to handle as much abuse as it did!!!).It does not leak if you are careful and don't overfill the bottle (there is a lip inside the bottle that serves as a seal, and if you fill past that lip it will leak). Period - does not leak, and I use the bottle daily with a couple of refills... so probably 900+ times a year (hmmm, do I drink THAT much coffee?)It is very stylish, even the plastic is not cheapo - it is smooth and shiny. It is easy to clean.Highly recommend! Just don't be an idiot like me and don't let it repeatedly fall out of your pocket and hop down flights of concrete stairs!
