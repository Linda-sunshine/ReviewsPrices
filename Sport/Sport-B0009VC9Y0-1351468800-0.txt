review/summary: Paper thin bladereview/text: I bought this as a replacement for my last pocket knife (benchmade), that I lost while on the job. I had the knife for one day and was preparing supper so I thought I'd use my new blade for cutting vegetables. Much to my surprise, the tip of the blade bent after the first cut! Rather than risking snapping the tip completely off by bending it back, I've got a permanently bent blade. Too thin for real use. Very comfortable to carry in a pocket and assisted opening works fine.
