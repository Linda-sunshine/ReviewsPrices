review/summary: Great product for a great price!review/text: My 13-year-old loves this archery set. Perfect for both the novice and those who have some experience with a bow and arrow. My son earned an archery merit badge the summer before he received this gift for Christmas and really enjoys going to a nearby archery range with it. The set came with 2 arrows. We bought 2 more 28-inch arrows as well as a paper target to go with this gift. It's sturdy and very reasonably priced compared to other sets we looked at. A great buy!
