review/summary: Awesome Productreview/text: The Gaiam Balance Ball was a gift to my mother for Christmas. At first she didn't get it, but after a couple of days sitting in the chair she said she very much liked it and understood how it could be a benefit. She said it is one of the most comfy chairs she has ever sat on. She also found out that every student in her grandsons 4th grade class sits on a Gaiam Balance Ball Chair and if it works for them, it must be good!!!
