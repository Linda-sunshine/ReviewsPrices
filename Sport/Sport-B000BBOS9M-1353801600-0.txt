review/summary: Great portable pillow.review/text: I ordered these for a camping trip and they came in very handy. Roll up nice and small and were surprisingly comfortable! They do take about 30 minutes to fully expand and i washed them per instructions on tag before use. I noticed a difference after the wash in the comfort of the cushion. I have a sofa bed and these are now the pillows we use there. Highly recommend.
