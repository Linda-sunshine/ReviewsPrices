review/summary: Great for school lunches!review/text: I bought these for my sandwich eating kids, so I could give them more variety in their school lunches I pack. They work great. The kids say there food is still warm when they get to lunch. And they don't leak. I have tried spagetti, and raviolis without any problem. Great buy!!!
