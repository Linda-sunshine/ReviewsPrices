review/summary: Not for mereview/text: I was so disappointed because these googles had such great reviews, but it seems like I was the problem. I tried them for two weeks, adjusting them to stop the water going in and the fogging up problem. I would put tighter and they were uncomfortable and water still managed to get in. Seems like a personal problem though.
