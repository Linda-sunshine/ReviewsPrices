review/summary: Seem to run smallreview/text: I typically wear size 12-14 pants. That would normally fall in the large size range. I ordered size XL because of reviews here. XXL would be closer to right. The crotch length could stand to be a little longer to avoid the awkward dip in the center back. I've not had a chance to wash and dry these yet but the fabric has a good, heavy feel.
