review/summary: easy to use, reliable productreview/text: Earlier I bought my husband a Garmin Forerunner watch, that costs $200, which is hard to use and drains battery in every two days, and the heart rate monitor is far from accurate, making it totally useless for our purpose. Meanwhile I got myself this cheap Omron Pedometer, it's so simple and accurate. I wear it all the time, aiming for the 10k steps a day. Since this pedometer is so good, I returned the garmin and bought my husband another Omron HJ-112. We both love it.
