review/summary: Not for beginners -- but a great set of workoutsreview/text: I did this 4 years ago, borrowed it from a friend, swore that if I do it again, I'd buy my own. So I did. Worth the money.I am into my 8th week -- hate yoga, not flexible -- working on it :)This works you -- pullups, pushups -- it's hard. Plyometrics (jump training) -- I got into distance running since doing this 4 years ago, and doing the leg routines worked me harder than training for a half marathon, so it's intense, we'll see how I do on my next run in April, I might repeat some of the routine when prepping for the race -- it's a great way to stay shape.
