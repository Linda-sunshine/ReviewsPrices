review/summary: It is a beautiful, beautiful babyreview/text: It doesn't take on flavors, odors, and I haven't put a huge dent in this one yet. It's a great size-- not too big not to just carry in hand outside, and not too small that there isn't any reason to use it in the first place.It's not a great shape to clean, but I love that the cap screws into it rather than onto it-- that means when I take the cap off, nothing spills down the sides or onto my hands or lap. That's perfection right there.
