review/summary: Sock it to mereview/text: Finding reasonably priced, well fitting socks for a size 15 foot is a challenge and these are perfect. There are no bulky inner seams, the cushioning is decent and they wear better than some of the more expensive products that we have purchased. They seem to be identical in every way to the Gold Toe brand that JCP carries....except that these are much cheaper.
