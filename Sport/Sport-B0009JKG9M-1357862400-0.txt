review/summary: Best cast iron skillet I've found yetreview/text: I have been a long time lover of non stick cookware, but over the past year with all the new &#34;bad&#34; things coming out about them I decided to try a good ole' fashioned cast iron skillet. It was the best change! I try and buy only American made products and sometimes they are hard to find. This is not only made in the USA, but it works wonderfully and has made me a better cook! These are heavy and they are not for someone who has a weak wrist, but cooking on them is wonderful and so simple and the clean up is WAY easier than on any non stick pot or pan I've ever used. I love the fact you have a skillet and cooker all in one. Truly, this is one of the very best investments I've ever made and it wasn't even a big one. I cannot recommend this enough. I'm ordering a larger one to accomodate bigger meals. We are a family of 3 and this one sometimes is a little too small, but it still works great.
