review/summary: Defectivereview/text: Yesterday I possibly would have rated this item a five, but after having it for only a month, today one of the chamber seals broke. So now the right side is significantly higher then the other it looks and feels really awkward. There is also the small issue of it losing air a bit faster then I anticipated. Otherwise, the product was great. It is super comfortable, especially with a mattress topper.Hope that helps!
