review/summary: I love thisreview/text: At first I got confused that it didn't have pliers and the picture that it came with did; but then I realized that this version didn't come with pliers. Oh well, maybe next time. It has come in handy very often and I carry it around when ever I could. Honestly swiss army has great quality and I would buy more right now but the quality is so good and lasting that I find it hard to justify buying another one so soon after this one. Although I did just end up buying others as gifts (which were well received).Also gets lots of compliments on it. Its pretty wide, but I actually like that it has so many tools so being wide doesn't bother me at all. I know girls generally want to carry slim looking things around, but I think the bulk looks fine (just don't carry it in your pants pocket). But as girl, who doesn't have large purses?
