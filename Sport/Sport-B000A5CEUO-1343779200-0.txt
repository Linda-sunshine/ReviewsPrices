review/summary: Inaccurate and doesn't fit small wristsreview/text: After using this heart rate monitor 3 - 4 times I have finally resorted to using the watch feature to determine my heart rate. When using the heart rate function, the beats per minute will fluctuate wildly then stay at one heart rate for over a minute then drop 50 beats immediately. It is completely unreliable which makes it pretty useless.Also, I have a pretty small wrist and the wrist band makes it hard to get a good fit. The wrist band is very stiff so when its a little too big, the face of the watch hangs off one side of the wrist or the other.However, the face of the heart rate monitor is very large which makes is really easy to read. The display is also clear and simple, displaying only the needed information. And, starting the heart rate feature is easy - just press the red button.
