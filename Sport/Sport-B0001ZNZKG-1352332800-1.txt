review/summary: The best undies ever!!!review/text: I could write a book about how great these underwear are! I bought these specifically for backpacking from Cambodia to Malaysia and they exceeded my expectations. They are super comfortable, they don't ride up, they will keep you cool and wick away all the nastiness. Best thing is washing them in a sink and drying super quick! If your on the fence, get off, buy four pairs of these and throw all of your other underwear out!
