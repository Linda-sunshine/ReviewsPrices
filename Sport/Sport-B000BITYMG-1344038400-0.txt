review/summary: Great Quality and very usefulreview/text: I originally purchased this 2-pack of leashes to replace the broken plastic tether on my Omron pedometer. I used the first clip for over a year with no problems at all. I can't count how many times my pedometer came loose and it was just dangling by the leash.Several months ago, I bought a Fitbit and immediately attached my second leash to it. It has saved my Fitbit several times now.The metal clip is high quality and the plastic snap-clip (or whatever it's called) hasn't broken or given me any troubles.
