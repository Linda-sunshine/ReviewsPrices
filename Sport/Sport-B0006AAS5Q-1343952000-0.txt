review/summary: Bad gold finishreview/text: I received by 07/29 this Invicta 9212 Speedway. I loved the model and also many people has good things to say, but unfortunately, in less than 30 days i returned this because the gold tone finish of the band metal was fading and turning into a stainless steel color, only wearing daily and never into the water...ONLY 30 days..!!! Come on....it's supposed that this finish should be last at least 2 years or more....
