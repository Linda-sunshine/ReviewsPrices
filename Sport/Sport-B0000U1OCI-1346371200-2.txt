review/summary: Very helpful and incredibly easy to use!review/text: I'm REALLY happy I purchased the Omron pedometer, after I received it and started using it, my whole family decided they wanted one too. It comes as it is, and with an extra piece you can attach it to in order to clip it on your clothing. It's not too complex. The instructions are so easy. The screen is big enough so you wouldn't have to squint your eyes. And the best part is, not only do you see the steps taken in one day, you can see the current time, calories lost, and miles you walked. It also automatically resets itself to 0 steps 0 calories and 0 miles whenever it hits 12:00AM vut it saves all of the information from all previous days so you can compare. I LOVE IT.
