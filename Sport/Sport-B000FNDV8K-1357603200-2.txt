review/summary: Very good little knifereview/text: I've carried one of these for years. Just bought this one to replace one I lost. These are high quality, small and easy to carry. I use everything on it. The scissors come in particularly handy. The tweezers are the least useful, and don't work great. I will alway carry one of these in my pocket because it works so well and is so easy to carry.
