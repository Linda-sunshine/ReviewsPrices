review/summary: Hoppe's 22/223 rifle bore snakereview/text: This product is a little pricey but it works great so it is worth every cent. Has a great brass weight and this is free of hassle. All you need to do is put a cleaning solution near the front so it cleans and then takes it off throughout. (Might run it through twice if you shot a lot :))
