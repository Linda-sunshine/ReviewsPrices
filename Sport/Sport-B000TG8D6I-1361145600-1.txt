review/summary: Awful Programreview/text: The videos are bearable but are littered with product placement plugs. One disc skipped some, but I did not have the problems that other users experienced. The workouts take much longer than the advertised one hour. The average workout is an hour, yes, but this does not include stretching, breaks, or rearranging your living room twice. You need to allot at least two hours a day to commit to this program.I am a male approaching thirty and wanted to drop a few pounds and tone up a bit. It appears that most of the (negative) reviews are from people who have not actually done the workouts, but I was physically able to do the sessions, and I nearly completed the ninety days, working out an average of four times a week.The results: I lost a measly five pounds and have joints that pop a year later. I should have ceased this program much sooner than I did, but I thought that it would get better. I was exhausted after each session, but I could tell that these were not "healthy" workouts. These workouts seem to target your joints instead of muscle groups. My coworkers can tell you that my knees, elbows, and ankles starting popping excessively about halfway through and have not stopped to this day. I recently started back to the gym, working out only three times a week, and I have already seen better results after five weeks.
