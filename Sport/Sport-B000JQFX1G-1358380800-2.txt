review/summary: Looks good, not so good at keeping timereview/text: This watch is very eye catching. It looks like a Rolex Submariner and that is part of the reason I bought it. The other reason I bought it was to try out an automatic watch (which do not use a battery). I have discovered that it is not very effective at keeping the correct time. After around a month of ownership, I noticed it was loosing more and more time each day. Currently, I have a watch winding case whose purpose it is to prevent time loss. When I leave it running all day with the Invicta inside, it looses 5-10 seconds a day. For timekeeping purposes, this is not up to par. Most good automatics should loose that amount in one week.
