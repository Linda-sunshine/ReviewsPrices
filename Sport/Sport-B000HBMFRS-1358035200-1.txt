review/summary: Queen Airbedreview/text: I loved this air mattress the first few times my dh and I slept on it. It was very comfortable. I actually woke up with no back pain. But it was short lived. After a few times of sleeping on it, it develop a few air bubbles which eventually came into one large air bubble. This happen less than a month of having it. Money wasted. I would consider buying a new one but I don't know how to avoid the air bubble therefore I would not want to waste more money on a product that will not last. Sad!
