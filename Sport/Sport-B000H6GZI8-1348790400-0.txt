review/summary: Feels Great and Adds a Lot of Stabilityreview/text: I have used Hogue grips on all my handguns for the past 20 years and they feel the best to me. I did have to do some slight trimming before I put it on my sub compact, about 1/8th of an inch. I soaked it in hot water for a couple of minutes, dried it off quick, then it was very easy to install. As it cools it will grip tight without any movement. The reason why I trimmed it is because it will go over the grip safety if you don't. I know some people will consider this an advantage with the Springfield, (Glock doesn't have it), because it will disable the safety and you only need to pull the trigger, but I don't like doing that. Please remember to remove the magazine and cycle the slide. Looks great. I highly recommend Hogue grips.
