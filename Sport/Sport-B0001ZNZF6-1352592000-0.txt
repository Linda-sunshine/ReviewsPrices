review/summary: Best underware that money can buy.review/text: Originally purchased a couple of pairs of these to wear under my board shorts on a two week vacation in Hawaii. They performed great. They were comfortable to wear surfing, swimming in the pool or just hiking.They don't dry all that fast, but they don't chafe or bind when wet. To be honest after about 30 minutes of being wet, they are really just damp. My board shorts were dry in about 30 minutes, even with these being damp underneath. Making it easy to go all day in these; from the water to dinner and hanging out, all in comfort.You can also wear the same pair for days without worry. You know for those extended camping trips. They hold up exceptionally well.
