review/summary: Love this combo cookerreview/text: My husband was diagnosed with cancer, so after doing research, we chucked out all our other &#34;expensive&#34; pans and went with good ole' American made Lodge cast iron. We picked this to use as a sauce pan as Lodge doesn't have a traditional sauce pan size (well they do but it's enameled and although good...I've found that the enameled cast does chip and I have a habit of slinging my cookwear)..so it's two pans in one.There are people that complain about the seasoning. It's really just not a big deal at all. You can season it again when you get home by turning your oven on low, oiling up your pan and sticking it in there. I don't find that necessary. I do know that new cast iron can stick a bit but once its seasoned? boy oh boy are these great. Yes, heavy but retain heat well and cook like a dream.
