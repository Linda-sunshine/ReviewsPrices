review/summary: Best underwear Period. Found the briefs version to tight and uncomfortable but LOVE these Boxersreview/text: Wish I could give these 10 stars, Love them. I ordered the sports briefs and Boxer Briefs also, but found them nowhere near as comfortable as these boxers. I wear a large in these boxers but found the XXL sports briefs much too tight. Go figure. Guess it just a matter of taste you won't go wrong buying any exofficio underwear, you'll be hooked from the first pair. A sale on these from Amazon would be great as even though I love them they are very expensive
