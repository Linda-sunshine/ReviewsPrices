review/summary: 8926ob great deal.review/text: I have been a mechanical dive watch collector for years now and I have yet to find a better watch for the money. I will make some clarifications to help people out. First off this watch has a Seiko branded TMI 24 jewel movement. This movement is a copy of the 4r15a movement by Seiko either made in japan or Malaysia it is not the same as the 6r15 found in higher priced watches. That being said the TMI movement is extremely nice. It has a decorated rotor and polished bridges. This is not some cheap base movement at least not in terms of how it is made and its performance which is very impressive for the cost. It will hack and handwind like most expensive Swiss movements but the beat rate is a lower 21000 oscillations compared to 28800 oscillations which some may see as a disadvantage but not me. Higher beat rate usually requires more service as more wear is put on the movement. For a dive watch in this price range I want the lower beat rate movement. Accuracy Serena just as good as eta or sellita without the cost or maintenance. This watch does NOT have a flame fusion crystal which I find annoying. I have a few other pro divers with a larger case and flame fusion and the difference is obvious side by side. Flame fusion on a flat crystal is much better than mineral. Much better!The case and bracelet are very well made. All in all you will not find any other company that makes a better watch for the money. On the warranty side why worry? If you have a problem most likely it will be in 30 days which you can return it. Otherwise after owning several Invictas through the years and have never had any major issues. Nothing out of ordinary considering price. Yes they had issues in the past but so do a lot of companies. You are only as food as your last product and if these new.pro divers are an indication Invicta is doing something right! If you like the look go.for it!
