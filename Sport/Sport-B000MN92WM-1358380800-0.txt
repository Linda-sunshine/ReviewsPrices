review/summary: Keeps Me Movingreview/text: I had overestimated the number of steps that I was walking until I got this. It makes me want to walk even more when I see how much - or little - I've walked during the day. Accuracy is not perfect, but I figure it evens out in the long run. (Some steps are not counted, some are counted twice. ) I would recommend it as a motivational tool.
