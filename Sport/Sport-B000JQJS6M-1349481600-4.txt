review/summary: poorreview/text: I liked the way it had a very high quality finish. But It was defective right out of the box .I was so disapointed in the way it started to gain time every hour. 2 hours in about 12 or so hours. Then I heard from other people on the invicta site about the poor quality internal workings .A friend of mine payed much more for his and He said ,"I would have been better off buying a 20 dollar Rolex knock-off at the swap meet"
