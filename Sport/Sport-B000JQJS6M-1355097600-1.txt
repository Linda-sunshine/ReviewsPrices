review/summary: Invicta Men's 8928OB Pro Diver Two-Tone Automatic Watch reviewreview/text: It's a beautiful watch, very elegant and stylish, looks very much like a Rolex. Only problem is that it's automatic, not quartz, which means that if you do not move it fortwo days, it will stop working and you will have to set the time and date again after you have moved it a bit to wind it, However, its a very elegant dress watch that will match any formal dress you wear.
