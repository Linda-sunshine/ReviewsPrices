review/summary: Works as advertisedreview/text: I ordered a box of these for motorcycle touring. There were exactly 40 pairs. Tried one out last night and it worked as expected. Took about 20 minutes to get noticeably warm, and got warmer over the next hour or so. Was still warm after 10 hours but not very.I'm thinking at its peak temperature it might be too hot to keep inside a glove comfortably, but time will tell.
