review/summary: I am 100% sold!review/text: When my chiropractor suggested to get a balance ball chair, I have to admit I was very skeptical. I am a translator and sit in front of the computer for 7-8 hours a day, so I wanted something comfortable yet good for my posture.Well, since the day I got it I haven't used anything else! It is perfect for me (I am 5'8"). I can sit on it for hours and don't get back/bottom aches. My core and back muscles are engaged and getting stronger and I don't feel the need to slouch anymore. The other day I went to a restaurant and after 2 hours sitting on a hardwood chair I felt all achy. But on the wonderful balance ball chair my spine sits nice and tall and I can do my work without any problems! Absolutely amazing!
