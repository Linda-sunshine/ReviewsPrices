review/summary: What a piece of crap!review/text: To start with, it was difficult to install the batteries because the springs on the negative end of the battery compartments tend to push to the side & not make good enough contact to make the shuffler operate. The switch to operate the shuffler only works if it is manipulated several times. When it does operate, the gears on the right side don't turn so the order of the cards from the left side are merely reversed. Amazon's return procedure seems flawless but the shuffler is worthless.
