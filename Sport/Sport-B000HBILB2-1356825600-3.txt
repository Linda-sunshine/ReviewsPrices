review/summary: Nice!!review/text: I bought this for one of my parents. Based on what she told, the bed is really nice. It is raised off the ground about a foot and a half, has built in electric pump that makes the bed ready for sleeping in about three minutes. It also has a nice raised pillow (not too much raised). I don't think this bed is supposed to be used every day since my mother told me that her first bed (same one) gave away/deflated after two months or so. It is more for guests or family members who come to visit with not enough beds left in the house.you can store this in a small bag or a box and put it in the closet or slide it under one of the beds in the house. This bed has a built in air pump that can't be taken out. Also, the bed comes with a small bag and it comes with small piece of rubber in case the bed has an air hole that you can patch up.
