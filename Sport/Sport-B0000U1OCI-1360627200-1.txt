review/summary: Not accurate!!!review/text: This is my first day using this product and I am very unhappy. I have been counting my steps and checking to see if it's accurate and unfortunately it's not at all. I do daycare and am on my feet from the time I get up until after dinner. I have been on my feet for over 5 hours now constantly walking and it is telling me that I have only walked 2522 steps! It hardly counts steps when I am walking on carpet which 90% of my house is carpet.... I have to say that it is the worst $25 I have spent! I will shake it in my hand as if I am walking and it won't count at all and then all of a sudden it will start counting like it should. POOR POOR product!
