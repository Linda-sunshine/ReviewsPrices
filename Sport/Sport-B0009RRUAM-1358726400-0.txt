review/summary: Make sure to fluff it!review/text: Either throw this puppy in the dryer, or fluff it and let it sit for a few hours - you'll be amazed at how much the pillow turns into a decent, well-padded pillow with a little time. It's still perfectly compressible, but it takes time to decompress. I can slip this puppy in my bag, and when I throw down to set up camp for the night I can unroll it and throw it in my sleeping bag and by bedtime, it's ready to roll! The down pillow is significantly lighter and compressed to about 1/3 of the size of the foam version, but the foam is more comfortable to me and offers much better support than the down version + some rolled up clothes.
