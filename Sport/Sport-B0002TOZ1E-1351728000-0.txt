review/summary: Love these socksreview/text: I use these socks both for work and with tennis shoes on the weekend since they are basically sport crew socks just black instead of classic white. Very comfortable they never fall down on you. Also very long lasting I bought 12 pair of these in August 2009 and just noticed they started having some holes in the heal so I'm ordering 12 new pairs. Hey if I only have to buy new socks every 3 years I don't mind paying for the quality.
