review/summary: Great visibility - Easy Installation - Durablereview/text: Title says it all, this is my third mirror of this type for two bikes. I broke one, but after all the abuse I gave it and the dropping the bike JUST RIGHT on broken up concrete AT SPEED. I can hardly fault the mirror or mount. Metal where it matters, durable plastic to save weight where it doesn't. I have tried 4 other style mirrors and this is the best by far. Others were so low I could not easily see, or vibrated so much I could only see light/dark, or fell off as they were cheap plastic. This one is great. So good, that I plan to move to it to my next bike along with my $100 clip on pedals.
