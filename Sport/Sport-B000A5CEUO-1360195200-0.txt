review/summary: This monitor is not as advertisedreview/text: The literature on the product page it says that this monitor includes a handlebar bracket both in text and in an image of a comparison chart. I quote, &#34;...MOUNTING BRACKET INCLUDED TO ALLOW WATCH RECEIVER TO BE DISPLAYED ON MOST TREADMILLS & BICYCLES...&#34;; and on the image a check mark is placed in the row indicating that the model HR100C includes a mounting bracket.Needless to say there is no bracket included and since I am a MTB rider and purchased this monitor to take on rides, it upsets me.The monitor came factory sealed in its box and it does not appear to have been tampered with nor is there any mention on the box implying that a bracket is included so this is not a packaging issue, it is clearly a misleading advertisement.That said the monitor fired right up and has been working correctly for almost 2 hours now. Set up was straight forward and easy. The screen is easy to read and the high and low alarms kept me on track during my workout. I should say that It is receiving interference from my notebook as i sit here and type and is displaying zero, but when I back away from the computer about 4 feet it comes back on and works just fine. Who needs a heart rate monitor while sitting at a computer anyway, no big deal.So my rank would have been a 5 had it not been for the missing &#34;advertised&#34; bracket. So a 4 it is. I am going to keep it as well. For the price I will just wear it on my arm, and should the need to mount it on the bars become pressingly important I can fabricate a mount.
