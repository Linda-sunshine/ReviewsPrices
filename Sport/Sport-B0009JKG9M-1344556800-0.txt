review/summary: PRE-SEASONED COMBO COOKERreview/text: I love this cooker, I use it all the time, it's great for frying chicken, as well as making soups, and chili, and anything you need a deep pot for. If you want food that taste like food again, then stop using that slip and slide cookware laced with chemicals and go back to what your Grandma used, the food has an entirely different taste, it's so good, chicken comes out golden brown, and moist inside, the skin is crunchy, what the original Kentucky Fried Chicken used to taste like before the changed the name to KFC. You can't or won't go wrong with Lodge's Pre-Seasoned Cast Iron cookware. Give it a try today, Throw all that Non-Stick, Slip and Slide cookware away and buy cookware that healthy to use.
