review/summary: Best Cooking Frying Pans I have ever owned.review/text: After years of suffering with Non-Stick and Stainless Steel. I decided to try out this Lodge Cast Iron pans. This is the absolutly the best set of frying pans I have ever owned. I got tired of buying new Non-Stick Pans because they flaked, scratched and are toxic. Stainless steel discolored, scratched and were hard to clean. These pans from Lodge are heavy duty and you can try to burn the hell out of them and they just keep coming back for more. I was always worried about Hot Frying in Non-Stick and Stainless Steel because hot frying would almost destroy the pan, these Lodge pans took a beating and came back for more. If I need anything baked I just throw these pans in the oven and the food comes out perfect. I even took them camping and put them over an open flame and all the food came out great. Cast Iron Pans are heavy, they need to be cleaned correctly and need to be oiled, but it is worth the time and every penny. All my Non-Stick Pans are going in the trash as soon as I get the different sizes I need in the Kitchen. If the Stainless Steel pans are lucky, I might keep a few of them around for light cooking. I will also be ordering the 6 1/2 in pan for melting butter and heating/cooking sauses, the Reversible Griddle and the BBQ Grill/Grate. They would also work great for the Survivalist.
