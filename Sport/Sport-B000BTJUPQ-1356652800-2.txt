review/summary: Great Bow but more powerful than I expectedreview/text: Bought this for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it. It's a good bow and she can handle it fine but it's very powerful and probably more than I should have gotten for our suburban neighborhood. We had had trouble finding an adequate place for her to shoot it without worrying about it being a danger to neighbors should the arrow go over the fence. Don't mistake the fact that it's kid sized for the idea that it's not a real bow that will shoot arrows hard enough to be dangerous.
