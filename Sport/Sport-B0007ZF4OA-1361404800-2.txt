review/summary: Great for Ice Fishermen and Car Emergency Kitreview/text: My husband uses these along with the toe warmers when he goes ice fishing. We also keep some in our winter emergency kit in the car. We have had no problems with the hand warmers and they stay warm longer than the advertised time.
