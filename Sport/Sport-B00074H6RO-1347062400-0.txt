review/summary: Great purchasereview/text: Bought these for my son to use during weightlifting in preparation for sports for his Junior year in high school. Before using the gloves he always complained about calluses and sore hands after weightlifting sessions. Using these did the trick for him. I've used Harbinger gloves that I've had for years now for myself. Good product for the right price for sure.
