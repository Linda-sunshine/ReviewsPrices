review/summary: 'eh, there's others out therereview/text: I'm stationed in japan and do a lot of bike riding. I bought this to try and help me not get hit by cars. While the mirror serves its purpose, i didn't like that a had to cut a hole in the rubber of one of handle bars to mount it and the adjustments only go in two directions, up and down left and right. Oddly enough I went down to 100yen store and found a bike mirror that just clips to my handle bars and has a greater range of flexibility. The product itself isn't bad, its just there are others out there for comparable prices.
