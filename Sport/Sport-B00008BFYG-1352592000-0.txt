review/summary: awesomereview/text: Best price in town for the rezor and delivered quicker than I could go to the store! KIDS LOVE IT - have had it about a year now. I love that it can take a beating!!!! Make sure to put your kids name on it with a sharpie though - they all get mixed up at the park. My 5 year old and my 7 year girls old had NO problem using this and it saved us in VEGAS, they didnt have to walk so far from hotel to hotel.
