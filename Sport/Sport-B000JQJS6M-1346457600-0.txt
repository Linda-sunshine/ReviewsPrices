review/summary: Great Buy, great watchreview/text: I purchase this watch and immediately had it sized. It is exactly what I was looking for and is beautiful. Many people think it's a Rolex, but I tell them it is an Invicta. I have gotten numerous complements and it is exactly as it was described. I recommend this dealer since it was delivered as stated in his ad.
