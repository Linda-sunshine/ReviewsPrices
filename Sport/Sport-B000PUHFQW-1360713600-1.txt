review/summary: Excellent mat for the pricereview/text: I used this mat almost exclusively when I first started practicing yoga. I've bought 3 of them in total. They are comfortably thick, but not so thick that they make balancing postures too difficult. They are also sufficiently sticky. It's a perfect beginner's mat, an ideal alternative to the yucky loaner mats that they have in studios.Unfortunately, the durability of these mats varies. I had one that lasted two years without any visible wear, then another that was already flaking after just a few months of use. For reference, I was practicing 3-5 times per week on them.I've since moved on to another mat, but mainly because I wanted something thinner and more compact. I would buy this one again.
