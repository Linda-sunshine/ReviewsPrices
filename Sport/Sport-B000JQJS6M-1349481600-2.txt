review/summary: Wow what a copy!!!review/text: This is the 2nd Automatic Pro Diver watch I have purchased. Originally my wife got the first one because it was my dream to buy the $10,000 Rolex that it is an exact copy of, (my gift to myself for making it big in life) but once I put it on I felt I had made it big, because the copy is so perfect. I have a real 1970 Rolex that I have worn all my life and I like the fake one better and it does everything that my real Rolex does, but looks nicer. I have even fooled people who own real Rolex's into thinking mine was the $10,000 watch. I had the first watch for 4 years but live in the country so it got pretty bashed up, then the clasp on the watch band broke from excessive use, and I had a fear of loosing it. Now a new band is around $55.00 so instead I just bought a new watch for $86.00 plus tax and shipping = 111.00 Thank God I did the new one is even better it has a bigger dial and size, and the winding mechanism is more efficient and correct. ( I did buy a new watch band for the old watch which I use for around home, and my wife bought me the new watch which I wear just for Good) Excellent amazing watch and price and quality.
