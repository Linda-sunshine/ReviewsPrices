review/summary: Great product!review/text: I am a concealed carry holder and I use this for the the first bullet in my gun while I was new to carrying. I liked that they bullets felt real and had weight to them. I haven't noticed any of the red wearing off like any of the other users. They are also great to practice your drawing and firing (double checking to ensure that the gun is ONLY loaded with these bullets of course). Overall I would buy more of these! Thanks for the great product.
