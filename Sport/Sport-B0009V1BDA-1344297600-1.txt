review/summary: Great for small spaces!review/text: I've cooked with this grill a few times now and it works great. I've used other similar grills in years past at football tailgating events, and put a lot of beef across them. A whole lot. This grill is sturdy and the side pullout trays are handy. The grill lights very easy and the entire setup/teardown process is a breeze. Cleaning is pretty simple with the grates pulling right out. I love that the lid locks...you don't find that on a lot of other models.For overall portability and power, you can't beat this guy.
