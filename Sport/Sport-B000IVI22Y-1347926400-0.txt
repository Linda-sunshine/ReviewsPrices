review/summary: Poor design leaks no matter what.review/text: I ordered several of these and have the same problems with each one. The top somehow creates a vacuum and draws up water and actually bubbles up out of the bottle and floods my car's cup holder quite frequently. This happens no matter if the valve on top is left in an open or closed position. Very annoying and messy!! The bottles also leak whenever not kept strictly upright, and the plastic mechanism on top that open and closes can have one of the hinges broken pretty easily, which means the bottle leaks all over you every time you take a drink. I love the concept, but it just doesn't work.
