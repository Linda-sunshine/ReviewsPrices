review/summary: Price vs functionreview/text: I recently joined a health club to improve my balance and strength. I am 80 years of age and have undergone severalOperations which left me unstable. When talking with my trainer he began talking of my heart health.We figured out my maximum heart rate ( 220 - 80 = 140) and the various ranges, I realized Ineeded something to keep track on my heart rate while exercising. At first I was shocked tosee how fast my heart rate was beating.I started looking on the Internet and the price range was large. All I needed was something simple so I chosethe Omron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitor. The price was Low (35 dollars) and it was all I needed.I look at my wrist watch monitor and there is my heart rate. Simple and inexpensive.
