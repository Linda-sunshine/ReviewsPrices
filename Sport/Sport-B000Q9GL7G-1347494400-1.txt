review/summary: THIRD TIME NOT A CHARMreview/text: Ordered BlackHawk CQC(tm) Carbon Fiber Holster Matte Finish Beretta 92 / 96, BLACK, RH. Received a holster that looked different than the one depicted, fake CF versus a matte black finish.Reordered: Blackhawk SERPA Level 2 Holster Matte Finish 410504BK-R, received 410504BK-L a left hand holster.Re-Re-ordered Blackhawk SERPA Level 2 Holster Matte Finish 410504BK-R, received 410504BK-L another left hand holster.Part of the problem may be that an inventory sticker is placed outside on the plastic case obscuring the part number (410504BK-R) inside on the Blackhawk graphics. The shipping clerk has to either open the case to get it right; or just ship "a black holster".No doubt Blackhawk makes a fine holster. Very few customers dissatisfied. Of those who were I wonder how many got the wrong holster and couldn't fit their weapon right.Amazon has been up front with refunds and return authorizations.UPS is the winner. 3 shippings (two of them NDA), 3 returns.Ordered another BlackHawk CQC Serpa Holster Beretta 92 96 M9 410504BK-R , this time from EBAY.
