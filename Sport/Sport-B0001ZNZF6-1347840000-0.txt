review/summary: Best quality and great materialreview/text: What a great pair of boxer shorts. So soft and light, yet very tough material you don't know you even have them on. I have thrown away all my underwear because of the ease of cleaning, fast drying and excellent feel and quality of the shorts. Wash them in the sink let them soak in the suds, rinse, roll in towel, put them up to dry and you are ready to wear them in a short period of time.. They are worth every dime and I just wish i had done this a long time ago. Buy them you wont be sorry.
