review/summary: Works wellreview/text: This has to be given a five star. First is the price, second is the functionality and third is the fact that you can replace the battery. In other heart rate monitor there is no place that allow you to change the battery. This is very important because you do not want to have to throw away a monitor when the battery life has expired. It does not make economic sense. Omron has always been making great and ACCURATE products.
