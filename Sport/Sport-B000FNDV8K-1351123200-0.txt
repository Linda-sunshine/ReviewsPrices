review/summary: Loved....and then...LOST!! So I ordered an exact duplicatereview/text: I have had and used a Swiss army Knife for almost 40 years. They are wonderful -- I still have and proudly use the one I bought 35 yrs ago -- it's in fine condition (well, the scissors spring is another story...)And for FOURTEEN years I carried a little Swiss Army Knife in my pocket -- the little blade so sharp that even after 14 yrs I could stil slit open boxes and take them apart with this small but mighty vorpal sword. No matter that the scissors spring broke - that has happened on all of mine, and the scissors always worked, with or without spring -- but the rest of the knife stayed intact -- the toothpick rescuing me from awkward situations and the tweezer plucking an errant eyebrow, holding a small part like a mini vise, or rescuing the cotton ball in my ears that sometimes decided that it wanted to meet the other cotton ball halfway (kids, don't try this at home!)I rarely use the lttle screwdriver/file combo, but when I do, it delivers. I like to hold the plastic body of the knife and the bottom edge of the screwdriver at the same time while I am torquing up some screws as I feel that this way I will be delivering an equal amount of energy to a bigger area of the whole unit, thus putting less of a strain on the screwdriver blade.I loved mini-knife #1 -- and almost lost it a number if times, but this time, alas, it is gone..... and I can only hope someone found it and will cherish it as much as I did. How did I lose it? I bought a pair of pants from (NOT Amazon) .... and they were so horrible that the pockets literally tried to regurgitate their contents. I no longer wear those pants, as I almost lost my work ID and bus pass too.Yes I will always miss Mini-Knife #1, and am sad that my faithful friend is gone but I am so happy that I was able to get a replacement - Long Live Swiss Army Knives!!!
