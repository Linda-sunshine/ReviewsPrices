review/summary: You get what you pay forreview/text: It's fairly simple to set up and operate but I guess in order to keep you from accidentally changing the settings the SET button is hard to press. I have to use a penic or something with a small point.The reset button resets the entire thing which means you have to go through and set it all up again.For $20 I guess you get what you pay for. Not sure yet how accurate it is. I am going to the track to see if it accurately measures 1/4 mile. That will help me to determine if my set up was correct.Edit: I walked 1 1/2 miles but it said I only walked 1.19 so it's not that accurate. Today I went for a walk and when I went to see the lapsed time/aerobic steps they were both zero so after two weeks it's broken.Another flimsy product from China.
