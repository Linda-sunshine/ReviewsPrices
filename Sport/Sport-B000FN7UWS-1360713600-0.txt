review/summary: Water smells badreview/text: I still use the bottle because I like the idea of not having to buy water in plastic bottles but from day 1 water smells bad in Klean Kanteen! The taste is normal if you hold your nose shut, but the smell is gross. I will do the magnet test like somebody recommended to make sure that it really is stainless steel and not some cheap material used.
