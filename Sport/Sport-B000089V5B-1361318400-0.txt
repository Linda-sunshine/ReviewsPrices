review/summary: Strange fitreview/text: I usually get the more target brand converse in a size 8, which fit great, but when I ordered these in a size 8 they were uncomfortable. They felt just slightly too big and didn't fit well around my foot, I don't think ordering a half size down would have helped. I tried to break them in, but they gave me blisters, twice!
