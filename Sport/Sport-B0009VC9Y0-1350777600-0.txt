review/summary: My Favorite knife for everyday carry.review/text: I love this knife. Not too big, not to small, clips on to the pocket of my jeans and I forget that it is even there. Easy & quick to deploy with one hand. I use this knife multiple times a day, unfortunately I lost it on a hike and I found myself reaching for it again & again only tto find that it was not there, so I bought another one. Every man should have a knife on him at all times, and this is a great one to have on day to day. My only complaint is that the safety lock is make from plastic & breaks of on the Leek & also the Chive. No big deal on the Leek though, I've never had it come open by accident.
