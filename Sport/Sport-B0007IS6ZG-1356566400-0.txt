review/summary: It works!review/text: This jump rope was very easy to adjust!Here are some tips:1) To remove cap at bottom: Use a screw driver to remove cap.2) To adjust rope to appropriate length: There are two metal crimp pieces (one already fastened and the other one loosened) within each tube. Tip: you may have to shake in order to see both crimp pieces.3)Use pliers to cut off the desired length of rope and then use pliers to fasten the loosened metal crimp piece by squeezing the crimp piece together with pliers.4) Jump, jump, jump!
