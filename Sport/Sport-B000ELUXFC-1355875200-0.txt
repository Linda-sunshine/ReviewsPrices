review/summary: i'm happyreview/text: This rack worked well for a ~275 mile trip averaging 70-80mph. It was great that my bike didn't fly off the back of my car. I only had one bike on it, so I'm not sure how it fares with two bikes. I have a women's hybrid bike, but didn't use the adapter that Allen sells--the rack still did fine, although I had to wrestle with my bike a little to get it on the rack. I secured both the front and rear tires with the excess strap material. This is my first bike rack and I hope it lasts a long time! It's a competitive price for a 2-bike rack considering it's brand new. My only complaint is that you have to struggle with some of the bolts to get it set up. I had to use two needle-nose pliers just to unscrew and release some tension on the rack. However, this makes me feel good knowing that it's difficult to loosen any bolts on the apparatus.Thus far, I'd recommend this as a secure rack at a good price. I'll be trying it soon with two bikes.
