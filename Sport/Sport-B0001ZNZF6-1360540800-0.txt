review/summary: Fantastic Pair of Boxers to replace Under Armoursreview/text: First off, I had been purchasing the same brand of boxers for almost 10 years now (the Under Armour loose-fitting HeatGear 6" boxers since 2002). The Under Armour HeatGear boxers were loose, comfortable (with that polyester/cotton/spandex blend that never bunched) and the pretty much the greatest thing on earth.Problem was, Under Armour discontinued making their loose boxers sometime last year (instead opting for their "Boxerjock" brand of extremely tight-fitting boxers, geared more towards athletic competition, as opposed to a day in the office). I was distraught because I didn't want to return the world of stiff, rigid cotton boxers...not after 10 years of unadulterated comfort below.LUCKILY, I came across these ExOfficio Give n Go boxers which fit almost IDENTICALLY to the Under Armour "old-style" boxers. I bought one pair, giving it a test run and boy I am I happy that I did.First, the Give N Go's pretty much have the same feel as Under Armour HeatGears, but with a more textured fabric than Under Armour's smooth fabric. Second, unlike Under Armour's HeatGear which came in two colors (black and white)...the ExOfficios come in black, white, grey, blue, and green, which is awesome because you can switch things up.Very excited about my purchase, and will buy about 6 more of these. Here's hoping they never get discontinued!
