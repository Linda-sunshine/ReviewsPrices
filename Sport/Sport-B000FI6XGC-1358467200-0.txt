review/summary: a good pumpreview/text: Right after receiving the pump, I tested it just to see just how it would feel. I kept pumping until I felt some noticeable resistance and when I took a reading with a pressure gauge (a separate gauge, since this one doesn't have one) it was around 85 PSI. This is after the fact that some air gets released as I try and put the gauge on the valve. So with this, I'll say that this pump could put around 85-90 PSI on a 700cx23 tire pretty easily. Anything past that is definitely doable, but it would take some effort. Also, when using this pump, only do slow, but deliberate and firm strokes in order to avoid a fast heat build-up. Oh and as far locking the head of the pump, if the little lever is parallel to the body of the pump, that is the UNLOCK position. Pulling it is the LOCK position, thus engaging the pump and making it ready for pumping.As far as installing it my bike's frame, it's as if it wasn't even there. The only time it actually made contact with my leg was when I wore a very baggy pair of sweatpants. this was fixed by turning the pump so that the locking lever is what's facing me, instead of the rubber dust cap. Also, the packaging came with its own bolts that you can either use or out away as spares.I have only used this on Presta valve. Like other reviewers have pointed out, the only instructions provided in the packaging on how to use this on Schrader valves were pictures of an exploded view of the components of the head of the pump.All in all, this is a good pump. It would be nice if it had a gauge, but I don't find that to be a deal breaker. Take a good look at the packaging and its pictures of &#34;instructions&#34; before using, especially the lock/unlock part.
