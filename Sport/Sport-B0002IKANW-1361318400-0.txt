review/summary: Expensive and utterly reliablereview/text: What else is there to say? A-zooms are the industry standard and last forever. Everyone who calls themselves a shooter should own a set for each gun they own.They're also really expensive, but I believe each one is machined individually so that might have something to do with the cost.
