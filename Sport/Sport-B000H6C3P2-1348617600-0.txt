review/summary: Should come stock on all new rifles.review/text: I changed out the stock handle on my Stag Arms Model 1 for one of these after picking up another rifle at a store and noticing it had one. I didn't really have any complaints about the basic handle it came with, but this one is just SO much better! The finger swells and the grippy texture make your hand settle onto it comfortably and naturally. The cushioning factor of it being rubbery helps out with felt recoil as well. I've never had the need to, but I could see how this would definitely improve grip in a wet situation. I also notice that it has a recess inside the cargo area to accommodate the O-ring on a handle insert such as a Samson tool. Bang for the buck, this is the best upgrade I have put on the rifle yet.
