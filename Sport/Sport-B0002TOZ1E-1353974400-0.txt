review/summary: Best Brandreview/text: Medium weight for all year use. Fit, cushion & wear very well. Gold Toe makes good socks in all configurations. Proper elasticity without being constricting, cotton softness & comfort without stretching out, while wearing like iron. I wear a size 10.5 shoe & the 10-13 size sock is perfect. Gold Toe has retained high quality for many decades, unlike many other top American brands (of all products) that lost their way over the years; either after being sold or while short-sightedly cutting corners.
