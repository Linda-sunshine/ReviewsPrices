review/summary: My second onereview/text: The title should say it all. I have 2 bikes I ride regularly and when the latest one was purchased, the mirror was soon ordered! It works well on mountain and hybrid bikes - I don't know about road bikes. I found it easy to install, and changing width was quite easy. Since I already have 2, it should be apparent I would recommend it!
