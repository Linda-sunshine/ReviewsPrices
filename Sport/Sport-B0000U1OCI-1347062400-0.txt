review/summary: I like this a lot but wish it had heart rate tooreview/text: The last thing I want is a pedometer I have to clip to my belt or wear on my wrist. I LOVE that I can throw this in my shirt pocket.Having 7 days history is nice, too. I record all of my food and exercise and every now and the I forget - I may never remember to record that extra set of pull-ups, but this pedometer has what I walked.The tracking of aerobic time is good, too. I don't really care what it thinks about calories of fat grams consumed, though.I do wish there was away to shut this off. We live in a community that has private roads and we can drive golf carts here. I drive mine frequently in good weather and this always records at least a few hundred steps in a three mile round trip.Other than that, I don't really care about accuracy - the point is what I did this week compared to last week. It's not whether I did 4.2 or 4.6 miles yesterday, it's whether I did 4 miles or 10 miles - that's what I care about.The price is good, you don't need to be concerned about orientation and it works. I like it! I wish it would do heart rate too - and again, I don't need super accuracy, just an indication of how hard I've been working.
