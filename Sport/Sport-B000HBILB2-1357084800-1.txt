review/summary: COMFY.review/text: I was very skeptical in purchasing an air mattress bed, but I found this to come in extremely quickly. At first, it was a bit hard to sleep on, but after I slept on it for about three days, the mattress material grew softer/more comfortable. I slept on it for three months and I loved it. Be careful though because moving causes slight squeaking noises!its really easy to use though!
