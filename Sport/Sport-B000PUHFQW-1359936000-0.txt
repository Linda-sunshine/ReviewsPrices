review/summary: Not impressed and wound NOT recommendreview/text: I saw the four star reviews and loved the color options, so I decided to take a chance on this mat. Mistake.Regarding the thickness of the mat: this mat was equal to my pink mat I bought from Walmart. I cannot remember back if my orginal mat was advertised as a "thick" mat, but I have to say I was disappointed considering that mat is over five years old, meaning that over a few years of usage it has the same thickness of this brand new mat.I had the same issue may other yogis wrote about - the mat was not sticky. The first time I used this I was sliding all over the place in warrior's pose. This was extremely distracting to my yoga practice. I had to stop halfway through and switch mats. Luckily I was at home. I hate to think about what I would have had to do if I was at a studio. I did notice a chemical smell when I opened the package, which made me wonder if this was the cause. I have now given this mat four times of usage hoping that the slipping issue improves, but it has not yet. The only time I haven't had issues was for a seated hip opener sequence.Overall I personally would not recommend this mat and was disappointed that I spent the money. Now I have a useless mat and will be spending more money trying to find a new mat or still using my incredibly old pink mat despite my cat's claw marks in it.
