review/summary: 100% recommendedreview/text: I heard about this chair from my massage therapist after having severe pain in my paraspinal muscles from years of bad posture and working 10 hours a day at a desk job. I was informed by the therapist and a general doctor that the best to resolve the pain was to work on my posture and strengthen my core. I initially was going to purchase a special ergonomic chair but realized that as long as my chair had a back to it, i was going to slouch. So I decided to invest in the yoga ball chair. Initially I was going to by the one with no back at all to the chair, forcing me to sit up straight, but in the end I decided to buy this one from Gaiam that includes the back. I'm especially glad I did and completely happy with the product. Now, the back does make it easy for you to slouch, but at the same time, sitting on a ball reminds you to sit up straight. I like having a back for those days that I don't feel all that well, or when it's early in the morning and I'm not ready to be proper yet. But like i said, that quickly ends when you are reminded to sit up straight cause your sitting on a ball. Thus, my posture has improved greatly. In addition, sitting up straight and balancing yourself on the chair also assists in strengthening the core. It's not a workout or anything, but it's enough that I have notice a significant reduction in my back pain. Therefore, this chair has done its job for me. Just incase your wondering, I sit at a normal standardized desk and I'm 5'3'', and the chair is at perfect height for me.
