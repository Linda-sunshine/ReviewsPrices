review/summary: Good quality bedreview/text: I bought this to use whilst staying at my sister in laws house for a couple weeks around Christmas. This bed is awesome! It pumps up very quickly and is comfortable and big enough. My nephew is 6ft and 220 pounds and I'm 5'5 and 140 pounds and we could both lay on this whilst watching a movie with no problems. I used it for 2 weeks and only inflated it slightly on the second day, I think the material stretched a little during my first nights sleep to break it in and thats why it seemed like it lost air. After the second day I never had to refill it. I left it there when I went home and my nephews are still using it and love it more than their regular beds.
