review/summary: Not so goodreview/text: I really don't like these sock. They weren't very comfortable and the quality seemed poor. A recent review said the quality has dropped on these socks, so maybe that's the deal. I also recently ordered some Gold Toe Uptown socks, and I love those socks. They are quite possibly the best socks I've ever worn. Clearly Gold Toe knows how to make a good pair of socks, although the Uptown socks are about twice the price, so maybe it's not too surprising.
