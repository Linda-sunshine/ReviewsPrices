review/summary: Great little light at a good price.review/text: I got this for my beach cruiser in case I need to ride on the street or after dark. Didn't need anything fancy and needed to mount it on the rear strut instead of seat post. This little light was just right. I can pop it off when not needed. It's surprisingly bright. Going to order more for my other bikes.
