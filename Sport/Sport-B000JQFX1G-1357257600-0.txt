review/summary: its okreview/text: I own many watches. Movados, Omegas, and even a Rolex. This inexpensive submariner copy surprised me. It has a nice weight, solid feel, and seems to be well built. I got lucky and its keeping time gaining 30 seconds a day, not bad for a cheap automatic. Granted yes, people will come across duds and lemons. But those who get lucky with a good one will love it. This is my beater watch when im in an environment where i dont want my rolex oyster perperual getting damage. I dont know why people compare this invicta to a rolex, there is simply no comparison. Those who say that this watch is just as good as a Rolex has never dealt with an actual Rolex. This watch is good for the price, nothing more. Automatics need regular servicing every 5 years to function right, and servicing is usually 80 bucks per basic cleaning. So this invicta is considered "disposable" seeing a basic servicing exceeds the price of buying a new one. Its not worth servicing unless you have a strong sentimental attachment where you are willing to pay double to fix it. People complain after a while of use that the watch stops working right. Yes, so do cars when you dont tune it up. The inside of this invicta is mechanical like a car engine. Dont expect it to be problem-free for years without servicing it. If you can shell out the cash to regulary service it so it works right, then go for it. If you dont want to shell out the cash to maintain it, look elsewhere.
