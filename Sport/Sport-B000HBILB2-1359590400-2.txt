review/summary: Perfect!review/text: I purchased this for my 6 year old. It's a nice height and is durable. I love the fact that the pump is built in and has a spot inside the mattress for cord storage. It doesn't take long to fill up and the air doesn't leak out. It's quiet compared to other air mattresses we've used that have separate pumps.
