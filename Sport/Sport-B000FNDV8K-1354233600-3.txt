review/summary: Always Dependablereview/text: These little knives are incredibly dependable, always useful, and should be on everyone's keychain. I have carried mine for 7+ years now, and all I have lost is the tweezers. I sharpen the blades and scissors every few months, and they remain incredibly handy! I would recommend getting one of these for everyone in your family. There's rarely a day that goes by that I don't use this tool somehow.Just a side note, the knife I received came in a plastic tube, not blister packaging. Not a big deal, it's being given as a gift anyways, but I'm not sure if the manufacturer has changed packaging or if that is the seller's way of packaging. Either way, not a big deal, just noted in case someone is picky about that.
