review/summary: Invicta Men's 8926OB Pro Diver Collection Coin-Edge Automatic Watchreview/text: Solid watch. Best deal around right here on Amazon for only $85. (retail was originally $300) I've had the watch for about a month now and so far so good. No negatives to report. Many compliments received. Very solid and looks very high end. As a firefighter my main concern with a watch is its waterproofing. I've soaked this watch a few times in the last month and it keeps on ticking. Extra links provided in the box and the adjustments are pretty easy. It took me about 5mins to achieve the perfect size.
