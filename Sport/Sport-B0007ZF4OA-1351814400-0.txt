review/summary: HeatMax hand warmersreview/text: These are great, as usual. I have been buying them for years due to a circulation problem in my hands when the temps are cold. I am never afraid of losing my fingers living up here in the Great White North of MN.The package indicates they last for up to 10 hours, but mine often last for 12+ hours.
