review/summary: Good blade and opening mechanismreview/text: This Kershaw knife has been a fun one to test out and work with. To start with the blade is very good and holds an edge well. The serrated section is easy to sharpen as well and gave me no issues. Overall this is a great knife but I would give a word of caution to people who are clumsy. The flicking mechanism does work very well but the slick sides of the knife also means that its easy to drop or have your finger slide into the blade. Just be careful if working in wet or oily conditions.
