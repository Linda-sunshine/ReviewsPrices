review/summary: Comfy but expensive and pillyreview/text: These are very lightweight, and are just as fast-drying as described. The texture is nice, they aren't too slick or slippery, and are not at all clingy. I can't decide if they're really worth the price, but ExOfficio clothing is generally on the pricier side, but is of reasonably high quality. I have found that these have pilled up especially when worn with cotton shorts or pants over top.
