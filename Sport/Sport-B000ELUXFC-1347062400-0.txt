review/summary: Drove over 1,000 miles with no problemsreview/text: My husband and I drove over 1,000 miles in 5 days with this rack holding our Fuji and Marin bikes. We were nervous about this given the cost of the bikes. We had to tighten the straps once about 2 hours into our 1,000 mile road trip but had absolutely no issues what-so-ever with the product. I should note however, my husband cut up yogurt containers and placed the plastic between the rack and the car to prevent any scratching of the paint. I was very pleased with how well the rack worked for us given the price.
