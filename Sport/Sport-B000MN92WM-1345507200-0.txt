review/summary: Great productreview/text: I spent quite a bit of time looking at pedometers and gps units before I bought this item. I love the pedometer but cannot get the pc portion to work on a 64 bit pc. The pedometer resets daily at midnight and keeps one weeks of steps in history Very easy to use except for the pc portion. Highly recommend the item. The other bad thing is there is no on off button but for the money a great buy and product.
