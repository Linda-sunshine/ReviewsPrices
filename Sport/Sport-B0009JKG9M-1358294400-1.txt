review/summary: Exactly what i wantedreview/text: Bought it for one of my friends for Christmas, she wanted one for a long time. Me and her used it numerous times, and love it. The top griddle part is very useful and you don't have to buy the lid separately. It is deep enough, and preseasoned. All you do is take care of it nicely - do not wash it with soap, just let soak with hot water, do not use abrasives, dry well after washing and season with some vegetable oil.
