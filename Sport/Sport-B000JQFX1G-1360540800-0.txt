review/summary: love itreview/text: When I wrecked my old Casio I decided to upgrade a little... wanted to find something a bit classier. This seemed to fit the bill, and it had free 1 day shipping and free returns, so I figured I'd try it. Well, it arrived about 14 hours after I ordered it and it is great.Really sharp looking and really functional. It took 30 seconds at a watch shop to get the band shortened (no charge; I tipped the guy $2) and then it fit perfectly.At first I thought the date function wasn't working... then I realized I just needed to set it ahead by 12 hours.I love the rotating bezel.The movement is Seiko NH35A SII, with 24 jewels. It's hand-windable and the second hand stops when you set the time. I was able to set it very precisely and it has gained about 8 seconds since I set it 4 days ago.Finally... apparently it's a copy/ripoff of a Rolex. If I had known that (by reading more reviews ahead of time) I might have been slightly *less* likely to buy it, but I'm glad I did. Nobody I know can recognize a Rolex anyway. To me it's just a watch.
