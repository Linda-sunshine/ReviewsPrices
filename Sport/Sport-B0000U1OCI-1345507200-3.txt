review/summary: Accurate, easy to usereview/text: I wanted a pedometer mostly to keep track of steps, but finding an accurate one has been difficult. Most count steps when you barely move, or don't count steps accurately as you walk. I've tried a number of free and cheap ones that just weren't worth bothering to use. However, I felt that the "good" pedometers were too expensive especially for what I wanted. The Ohrom HJ-112 is perfect for me, and reasonably priced. It doesn't have to be in an exact position, it's light enough when put in a pocket, and the carrying clip actually works. You can wear it on your waistband, clip it to a purse, or put it in your pocket. There is a higher level model that has more bells and whistles, but if you just want an accurate pedometer with a few extras (calories, distance, etc.) I'd recommend this one.
