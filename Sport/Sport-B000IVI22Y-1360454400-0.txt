review/summary: dirty nozzlereview/text: one nnoying feature about this product is that dirt seems to collect in the nozzle, promoting bacteria growth. it is very hard to clean that nozzle as a finger can barely fit in there as well. im glad im drinking water more but could be less worried about bacteria collection
