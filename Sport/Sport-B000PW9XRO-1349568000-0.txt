review/summary: Great Gloves but NOT All Weatherreview/text: These are well made gloves and not too thick, but are not good for warm/hot weather as they make your hands sweat (at least they do mine). I had a pair of Hatch Shooting Gloves for over 10 years that were made of Kevlar that I absolutely loved. Maybe I'll see some like them on sale and get another pair.
