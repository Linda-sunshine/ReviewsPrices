review/summary: It does not fog easilyreview/text: I had a pair of Speedo goggles and toss it away after 3 uses, because I had to wipe off the fog every two laps. This pair of Aqua Sphere Kaiman Swim Goggles is superb. It does leak a bit during the beginning 3 laps, but once you adjust them and create the seal, the leaking would stop immediately. Most importantly, I never have to clean the fog because they just don't get fog at all (maybe a bit at the peripheral, but it does not bother me) even after 1 hour of swim.
