review/summary: Buyer Bewarereview/text: Received this watch one year ago for Christmas. Found it could barely make it one day if not worn (self-winding)so had to continually re-set it. It gained over 45 seconds every day which can be VERY irritating. After one month, I found the crystal had shattered unbeknownst to me, and the pieces had fallen into the movement, causing it to stop. Very difficult to get customer service to work with me, and ended up spending $40 just for a new crystal - plus shipping, and also trying to get them to adjust the accuracy of the timekeeping. It has now been over 8 months in service, and they finally (after many, many contact attempts) admitted that they have lost it. My instructions are to pick another one at the same price or less. I am reading the reviews, and just cannot pick one, since they appear to have such inconsistant quality. Will not get another self-winding one, since I want to be able to skip a day or so from wearing it without spending all that time to reset it every time I wear it. So I actually had it up and running for a total of about 6 weeks out of the last year, and it did not keep time during those six weeks and it has a super fragile crystal. I'm used to my Wenger, which can basically be used as a hammer to pound nails for 10 years without any problems at all, and does not claim to be hundreds and hundreds of dollars more in list price.
