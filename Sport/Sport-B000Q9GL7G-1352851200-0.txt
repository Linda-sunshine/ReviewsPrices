review/summary: Holds a 4.5" XDmreview/text: The 4.5" XDm clicks in and holds tight. The muzzle end sticks out a wee bit but it's legit. Other than the nice grip, it draws really well. To re holster just drop it in the slot and it clicks.Some people don't like this holster because they are scared of it. Do not be afraid of this holster. Learn it, respect it, and trust yourself because you have practiced it and have confidence. Remember the saying "Slow is smooth and smooth is fast".Be safe.
