review/summary: Great for my toddler/preschoolerreview/text: Love this sturdy water bottle. It takes a beating from being thrown around by my 4 year old son, and it's not plastic so no BPA worries. It's the perfect size for him to hold and not too heavy when full. I usually bring a bigger water bottle along for me that I can refill his with.
