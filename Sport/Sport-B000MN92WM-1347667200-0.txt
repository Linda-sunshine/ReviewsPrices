review/summary: I"m getting ready to return the pedometer for the second timereview/text: The pedometer is great - when it works. The reports are great and the upload of information is very simple. But that's the best that I can say right now. I thought it was a fluke when the pedometer stopped working the first time after about 6 weeks. There was no warning, the pedometer had not been abused or dropped and it simply quit working. Replaced the battery - nothing. Sent it back to the company for a replacement which came after 2 weeks.That one lasted for 4 weeks. It was working fine in the morning and after coming back from a 10 mile hike, the pedometer display was blank. No flashing display to warn me that the battery was going to die. It simply stopped working and I lost about 3 weeks of data. I'm not impressed with the lack of durability of the unit and am very disappointed. I've only had this since June! Omron - what's the deal?
