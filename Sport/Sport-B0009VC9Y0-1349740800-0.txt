review/summary: Kerflaws leek.review/text: I'm giving this three stars for two reasons. #1 this is a USA blade I have plenty of kershaw knives and this one was so dull out of the box I'd be lucky enough to cut butter. Secondly the handle and pocket clip are so smooth it seems like it would fall out of your pocket quite easily. I'm not getting rid of the knife because I love it and I love the feel. I am just a little unhappy that the blade was dull. That was a easy fix. As far as the pocket clip I'll have to figure out how to make some traction so it doesn't fall out. I love kershaw never diiked any of thoer knives until now. Don't get me wrong I still love this knive and plan on using it as my edc but first I want to make sure it doesn't fall out of my pocket
