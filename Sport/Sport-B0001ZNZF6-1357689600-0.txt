review/summary: My fiance loves these!review/text: I got him his first pair at an REI sale. He loved it!We do a lot of hiking, camping, and cycling. It cuts down on what he calls &#34;swass.&#34; (aka. A** Sweat)Quick dry, comfy material.Bought the second pair from amazon. I meant to buy the boxer-briefs. But, he still loves this pair.
