review/summary: Definitely worth the MoNeY!review/text: I am only going to write about how well this product has worked for me because I have only had them a few days now. I purchased two of these airbeds for my daughters to sleep on while we had company over. I have to admit I was a bit weary as to whether or not they would be as good as they were made out to be. I am very impressed! The quality of the material is impressive and the easy set up is as well! However, I am uncertain at this point if they have a slow leak or if my husband is just not filling them up as tight as they could be; they are a bit deflated by morning. Not enough for me to be discouraged but they are not &#34;tight&#34; by morning (no worries, no one is waking up on the floor). I will definitely up date everyone after I have had them a few more days!!!
