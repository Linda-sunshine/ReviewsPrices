review/summary: Mattress Reviewreview/text: I do recommend if you need an air mattress, get this one!I use this bed for everyday use while i'm in college so I needed a good quality one.I've had it for a little more than a month and it holds up well.I'm not a tiny person but I find it big enough and comfortable.The only problems I noticed is that after about two/three days (if you sleep on it every night), you'll need to plug it in and put some more air into it. Also it does fit queen size sheets, but at least onece a day the corners of the sheets pop up and i'm having to make my bed every evening.
