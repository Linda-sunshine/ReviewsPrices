review/summary: Frustrating Piece of Crapreview/text: I had a pedometer before this one that I'd gotten free as a promotional deal. It was wonderful. When that pedometer had to be finally put out to pasture, I couldn't find another like it in stores, so I went with this one, the top-rated choice from Amazon. It was much more expensive than my old pedometer, so I was excited to see what it could do. My disappointment started the day I got it.Problem 1) Setting it was an exercise in frustration. There is no "reset" button, so I can't keep track of steps on a specific walk. I first accidentally set it for a.m. instead of p.m., so it reset automatically at noon and then continued until the following day at noon.Problem 2) After figuring out how to set the damn thing, I noticed that it didn't record many of my steps. It was very accurate for an exercise walk/ run, in which I was moving at a steady and relatively brisk pace. When I was walking around the house or walking irregularly, about half of my steps were not recorded. It's not terribly helpful to have only my dedicated exercise walking/ running recorded because it's usually pretty easy to determine how far you've walked when you're on a treadmill or at a track. (There are also free iPod pedometer apps that work well for that.)Problem 3) After a few weeks, the secondary plastic clip broke. This was not too big a big deal because the pedometer didn't fall, as it still had one clip intact. I bought another clip, this time of metal and all was well, for a while.Problem 4) After about three weeks of use, the pedometer ceased to work. Period. I've not dropped it, gotten it wet or stressed it in any way. It now just shows a zero on the screen.
