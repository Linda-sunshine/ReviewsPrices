review/summary: Cast Ironreview/text: Loving this pan!!! The only cookware I will use! The skillet is the perfect size for breakfast or cornbread. This combo is the perfect size. I love that my fry pan is a lid for my Dutch oven. Great for stew, chili or beans. Cast iron is so much healthier to cook with too.
