review/summary: Great, up until a year and a half...review/text: Bought this in March of last year. The watch has been great - it's sleek, it stays clean looking despite some abuse, and it's worn to the gym and in the shower with very little wear. The automatic movement is fairly inaccurate and I understand this can be hit or miss depending on raw luck of which one is shipped to you. Mine had to be re-adjusted as it fell short about 5 minutes every 2 weeks; this wasn't great, but satisfactory enough for an automatic and the amount it lagged was very predictable and consistent. However, about a month ago it started falling behind by 5 minutes every 3 DAYS, and while still looking fairly new, is unusable as it can't be trusted for accurate time. I realize I didn't spend much and probably got my use out of it, but next time I'll opt for the accuracy and convenience of quartz. Caveat emptor.
