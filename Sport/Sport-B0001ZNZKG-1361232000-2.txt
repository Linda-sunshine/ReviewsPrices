review/summary: Great fit and very comfortablereview/text: Size chart was accurate. Very comfortable. I usually wear these when running but comfortable any time. Take them on trips when I will be walking a lot and don't want to bring a bunch of clothes. Wash them in a sink hang them up and you are good to go as soon as they are dry.
