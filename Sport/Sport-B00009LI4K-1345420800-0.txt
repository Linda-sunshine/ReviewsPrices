review/summary: Helps a lot in a noisy cubicle office environmentreview/text: I work as a software tester, one of only two men on a team of 12. I'm quite noise-sensitive, meaning I am easily distracted by the conversations, gossip, phone calls and social visits of my coworkers in the cubicles around me. I asked my boss for help, but to no avail. It was causing me a lot of distress and frustration, even self-doubt. I tried to block the noise pollution by listening to music, but that didn't always helped because it was a distraction as well. Luckily I discovered the reviews of Earmuffs on Amazon. I picked up a pair of these and brought them to work. They block out perhaps 95% of the sound. I can still tell that someone is talking, very faintly (I have good hearing), but not what they are saying and it is MUCH less of a distraction. This allows me to control the situation and not be a victim. They do look a bit funny, obviously, but I don't mind. To me, they make a statement. Highly recommended!
