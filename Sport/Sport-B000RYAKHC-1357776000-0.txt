review/summary: Good standard back lightreview/text: I like this light. Could not figure out how to put the batteries in when I first got it and felt like I was going to break it when trying to pry the two halves apart. It swivels slightly on my bike no matter how tightly I put it on or how I wrap the posts. It's bright enough for my commutes.
