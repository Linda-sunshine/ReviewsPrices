review/summary: Great for taming small handguns!review/text: Let's face it, small handguns in calibers above .32 can be uncomfortable to shoot for extended periods of time. This grip sleeve really helps get a solid grip on the smaller pistols, and helps control the muzzle flip very well. If you want a more solid grip on your smaller handgun, look no further than this hogue grip!
