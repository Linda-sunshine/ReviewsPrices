review/summary: I love these!review/text: I have BoreSnakes for nearly all of my guns and absolutely love them. Haven't bought one for my muzzleloader yet. They get so filthy I may stick with patches.For all my regular rifles, shotguns and handguns they work great. Some basic recommendations though. Be sure to pull them from the chamber to the tip of the barrel so you don't deposit the gunk in the firing mechanism. You also need to be careful needing them in until the bristles are inside the barrel so you don't scour and damage the outside finish. I have a friend that sprays Rem Oil on the BoreSnake so it can clean and lube at the same time. It works very well but I don't care for the overspray that gets on the table nor do I want the mess to carry around in the field. If I thought ahead to take a baggie or was at home where I could wash it out it wouldn't be bad.These are excellent products!
