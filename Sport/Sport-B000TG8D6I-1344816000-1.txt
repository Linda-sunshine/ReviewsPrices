review/summary: Great workout, use the "Music & Cues" optionreview/text: The P90X series is a great, varied workout. After only one month, I'm already seeing improvements in my body. My only complaint is that the trainer, Tony Horton, is an obnoxious "bro". It's like being trained by an overgrown 45-year-old frat boy who calls you "boys and girls" or "kids" about 12 times per workout. He talks and talks, but without much substance. I'd prefer him to be explaining proper positions or helpful hints while he's talking, but it's like he's just talking so it won't be silent. Thankfully, I think the producers of P90X realized this and they created an option on the title menu for just "Cues and Music". I highly recommend using this feature. You see his lips moving, but you only have to hear what he says when it's relevant to the workout.
