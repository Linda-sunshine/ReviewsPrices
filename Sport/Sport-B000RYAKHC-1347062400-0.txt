review/summary: Not great for a carbon fiber bike framreview/text: The light itself works great, and I have no complaints there. I have a carbon fiber bike, however, and the seat post is not round but more of an oval shape. There was no way to make the light fit on the seat post, so I will have to buy a different product.
