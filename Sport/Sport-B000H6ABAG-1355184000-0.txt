review/summary: True to Size, Super Comfortablereview/text: Fuzzy, soft, and more versatile accoutrement than pajamas. These are my favorite cool-weather sweats. Oddly, this old-fashioned, reliable style has become difficult to obtain in local shops, which have the misguided idea that all folks want is clingy yoga-fashion. Some of us prefer these classics. Highly recommended for all body types!
