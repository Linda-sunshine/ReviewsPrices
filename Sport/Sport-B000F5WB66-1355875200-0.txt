review/summary: Makes exercising fun!review/text: I bought this watch because I have PT tests once every year. I am an fairly good shape and each time I run I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack (I push myself hard). For just a few bucks I can now monitor my heart and attain a better workout. I was running on a treadmill at the gym and it even synced itself (BPM displayed on the digital screen). I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an inexpensive heart monitor; it is fun to use and increases results!
