review/summary: These glove serve their purposereview/text: I've used these gloves for about three months. These glove are ok, they do serve their purpose.Pros:These gloves do well in the washer and dryer. Mine have not frayed yet and I wash them after each workout.Cons:I found that I have to wash these gloves after each workout. They do build a smell because of the sweat. As long as you wash them you can prevent the smell.
