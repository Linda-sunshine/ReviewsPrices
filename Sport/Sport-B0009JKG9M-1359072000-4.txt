review/summary: Great cookware pieces. Work well on induction. Using pan as lid not so good.review/text: These work well alone, on an induction stove. Being cast iron, and since induction works on magnetic, this is hardly surprising. So, as cookware, they are great, heavy, retain heat well.However, the notion of the lid being a double-duty fry pan, is not so good. It is, of course, very heavy, so you can't one hand it easily, and the cast iron to cast iron doesn't seal very well.I only docked this a star because the two pieces arrived in great condition and work well. I just can't recommend the use of the second piece as a lid. Just get a matching glass lid from Lodge and use that instead!
