review/summary: Good protection. Make weight-lifting a more pleasant experience.review/text: Before I got this product, every time I got back from the gym, I would have red spots on my hands that result from lifting metal weights. However, after using these gloves, these red spots do not come up anymore and I enjoy weight-lifting much more. The thickness of the glove is perfect; the grip is still firm, less harm to skin. Now I can actually lift weights according to muscle tiredness and not how much my hand hurts.
