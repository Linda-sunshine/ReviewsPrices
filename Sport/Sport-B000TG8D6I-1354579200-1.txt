review/summary: Dangerous workouts, unrealistic recipesreview/text: I followed the P90x workouts for about two months before I injured my neck and had to stop. Several of my coworkers had similar experiences where they had shoulder injuries that caused them to stop. It is problematic to do weight training alone with only a video. It is easy to have poor form that makes you prone to injury.Also the recipe book that comes with the program is next to useless. Even if you are super commited, it is very difficult to follow. Many of the recipes are very involved. For instance, there is a whole section on making your own sauces.I'm not a big foodie, and I don't particularly like cooking. I would have been willing to follow simple recipes, but the book didn't fit my needs.
