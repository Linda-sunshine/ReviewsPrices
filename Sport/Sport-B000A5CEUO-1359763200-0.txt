review/summary: don't buy this product!!review/text: Used this heart rate watch on and off for about a month. Heart rate picking right but after a month the watch just reflected zero heart rate! I thought this was only a battery issue. After changing battery, still no reading even though i was busting my ass off working out the insanity program! Unbelievable! For the price of $35 this is not worth buying to only use it for a month!
