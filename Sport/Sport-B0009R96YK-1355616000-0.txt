review/summary: Great mirror set upreview/text: This mirror is really a savior for me. It's easy to adjust while riding, is light weight, has a curved mirror and is not made of glass... features I required. For the price, the quality is excellent. As far as installation, they installed it at the bike shop where I purchased it, but I watched, and it seemed very simple. It also comes with a small tool to adjust it or change the mirror from sticking out or turned inward. At the bike shop they said if the plastic mirror should break, they have replacement parts. This might happen if I fell on that side. I now ride more safely because I can easily see behind me without turning.
