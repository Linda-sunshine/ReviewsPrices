review/summary: Amazing for travelreview/text: I'm more of a boxer-brief guy, but I had heard ExOfficio made some really great boxers that are designed for travel. These boxers hang very well and don't ride up. Extremely comfortable to wear and amazing for travel where may need to wash in the sink and hang dry overnight. Highly recommend for traveling as well as everyday use.
