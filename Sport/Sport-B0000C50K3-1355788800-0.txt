review/summary: Great toolreview/text: Most tools if they are hard to use or not handy when you need them, they don't get used. These are great. Small & easy to carry. Super easy to use. I think its ease of use is its number one benefit. When you have to get out everything to do a complete breakdown & cleaning, it takes time. These eliminate 90% of the bad stuff in relative seconds.
