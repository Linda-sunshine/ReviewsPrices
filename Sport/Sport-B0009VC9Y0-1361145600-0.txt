review/summary: Best knife I have purchased onlinereview/text: Quality of this knife is outstanding. Very sharp, opens like butter and can carry front pocket clip, back pocket clip and waist clip on. It is slender, smooth and the heft is very nice and balanced. Wonderful craftsmanship. Would buy Kershaw as primary knife every time.
