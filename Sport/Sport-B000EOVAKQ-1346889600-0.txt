review/summary: Aqua Sphere Google leaksreview/text: Based on the number of positive reviews I bought the Aqua Sphere Kayenne and Aqua Sphere Kaiman swim goggles. They look great and are built with good materials, but unfortunately they both leak, and for that reason they are useless to me. I use the TYR Nest Pro Performance Goggle, used them before and wanted to find something better but I guess there is none. Any recommendation?
