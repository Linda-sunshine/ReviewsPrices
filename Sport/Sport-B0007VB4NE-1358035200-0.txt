review/summary: Awesome Chairreview/text: I love this chair. It forces me to sit up straight and keep good posture. It has two locking wheels, that I suggest you lock when getting up and sitting down, so you don't fall. The chair will roll out from under you if you don't. I learned that the hard way. I am 5' 0&#34; and it is the perfect size for me. The height is not adjustable. There are some stability ball chairs that have adjustable height, but most people complain that the legs and wheels tend to break more easily. You have to use your legs and core to keep balanced, so it gives you a work out to some degree. It took me a few days to get used to it, but once I did, I will never sit in a regular office chair again. I also recommend getting a stability ball cover for the ball. Without it, it will make you sweat since the ball is rubber. You can use a towel over the ball too, but the covers are nice to have and washable if needed.
