review/summary: Fit and Price Perfectreview/text: While I have only had them for a month I have used them for exercise and biking and they hold up exactly as I had hoped and the quality seems excellent. They are strong but lightweight and the pockets allow me to carry my cell phone and keys with me easily (which was the whole idea of getting pockets). The drawstring makes for easy adjustment for the weight of the cell phone or anything else I might wish to carry would not make the shorts try to drop to your knees. I have no complaints
