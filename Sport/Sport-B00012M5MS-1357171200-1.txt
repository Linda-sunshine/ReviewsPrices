review/summary: fine helmet, quite largereview/text: i wear this helmet for every bike ride and found it to be fine. it is quite large but the straps can make it secure on your head. other reviewers didn't seem to like the sun visor, but i haven't found it to be flimsy and it's still on my helmet six months later.
