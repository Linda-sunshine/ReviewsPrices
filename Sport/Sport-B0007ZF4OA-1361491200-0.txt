review/summary: A godsend for perpetually cold handsreview/text: The HeatMax hand warmers are a godsend to me as my hands are always cold in winter. They last almost 10 hrs. I like that they are a natural product, no need to worry about chemical poisoning. The only fault I find is that after holding them in my hands for awhile, they lose heat and I have to allow them to recharge in the air. I suppose that is the way it is.
