review/summary: Great...while it lastedreview/text: I bought this mattress 9 months ago. I use it primarily when I go visit people or when someone comes to visit me, which isn't all that often. I'm only 190 ans use it by myself, which definitely doesn't exceed the weight limit. About 7 months (maybe 8th night being used) one of the wavebeams separated and caused for a giant bump on the one side of the bed about 10-inches above the regular sleeping height. It was only one beam now making two so I didn't think much of it (other than it obviously being faulty). Yesterday I blew it up for the first time since and when I woke up this morning I was almost pushed off thr bed; the second wavebeam seperated as well, making for a giant bump that's bigger than a second person.I loved how comfortable this bed was the other times I used it and recommended it to my friends, but now it is essentially completely unusable.
