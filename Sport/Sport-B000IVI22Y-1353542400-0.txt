review/summary: They Leak!review/text: I have had about 5 of these bottles, but have come to breaking point with them.I go to the gym allot so pack them in my gym bag only discover they have leaked throughout the bag unless positioned upright.The leak comes through the valve, to which you might also notice if you are shaking the bottle to mix anything in it.CamelBak claims they are leak free and dishwasher safe, this is not the case brand new bottle once through the dishwasher prior to use....leaks like a sieve.
