review/summary: Excellent value!review/text: What great value for such a nice watch. I'm a huge fan of the Rolex Submariner, and this &#34;clone&#34; does a great job of looking the part for a fraction of the price. The watch keeps time very well, and fits comfortably, while feeling solid and not cheap. I liked it so much that I bought a second as a gift for my brother. Both are behaving well in daily use, and since I am a diver, I plan to get mine wet soon. I have not noticed any significant time loss as other have reported, since I use mine daily. If it breaks, or I lose it, I will buy another to replace it.
