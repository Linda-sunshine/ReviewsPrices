review/summary: Good shortsreview/text: Overall these shorts are very good and at a very reasonable price. The only thing off about these shorts was that they appeared to run large. I ordered a large, I tend to run between a medium and a large. I own two other champion long mesh shorts and these are slightly larger than the blue and black shorts. Otherwise, they are perfect; but be warned, do not rip off the tag, as it will tear the stitching.
