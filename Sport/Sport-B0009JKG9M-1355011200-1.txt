review/summary: Amazing deal, with free shipping!review/text: Not only do you get a fine dutch oven, suitable for roasts, the lid doubles as a 10.5&#34; skillet. Works great for cornbread.So far it has proven to be non-stick and the clean-up is a snap. Forget the soap. Just hot water and a teflon pad. No scrubbing. Lightly re-oil and you are set.
