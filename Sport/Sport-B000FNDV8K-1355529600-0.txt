review/summary: Proud to be an Americanreview/text: Always liked the classic knife. I keep one in my pocket most of the time. The patriotic colors encourge all Americans that they are Americans first - race, gender, sport-team enthusiast and political affiliations should be second. Help save America - be fiscal conservative with your finances and carry a dependable classic pen knife.
