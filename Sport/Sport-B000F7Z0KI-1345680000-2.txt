review/summary: Polar bottlereview/text: These bottles hold their chill for an extended period and are very durable if (or in my case, when) dropped on a hard surface. Gatorade appeared to stain the inside lightly, however, did not effect the performance. I would definately buy again (and I already have three of them).
