review/summary: sweetreview/text: This knife was excellent! It is a stylish and slim knife that opens easily for easy access, comes very sharp out of the box. The only issue that I have with this knife is that the safety can get activated when you put the knife into your pocket. That is what kept it from getting five stars.
