review/summary: Better than expectedreview/text: As so many others attest, it looks great, feels nice and pretty much works just fine. My "hour" chron dial doesn't do anything either but I don't care. Stopwatch actually works, which I will never use again either. Date function and time along with looking the part are all I care about. Mission accomplished.
