review/summary: Awesomereview/text: This grill is very durable and easy to travel from place to place with. This grill has lasted us for over 2 tailgate seasons now and shows no signs of wearing down. We have cooked all kinds of foods with no problems and heat stays even and consistent. If you want to cook food in places you can't bring a large grill, get this one, you wont be disappointed.
