review/summary: Great canteen.review/text: This is perfect for taking water on the go -- hiking or to the movies, it really works. I didn't really like the sport cap though, so I bought a regular twist on one after the fact. The sport cap tends to leak if you just toss the canteen in your bag and it turns sideways/upside down. It also makes a loud whistling noise because of the air flowing through the openings. Otherwise, the canteen is great!
