review/summary: Good findreview/text: I ordered two of these, and one is just for a backup. I haven't needed it yet. I have my safety leash hooked to a Fitbit pedometer. I had a leash from an old pedometer that finally fell apart so I ordered this. it's working great and I like that you can disconnect it from the clip easily. No problems thus far.
