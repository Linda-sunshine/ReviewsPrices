review/summary: good little pumpreview/text: This is a great little pump! Nice and compact! It even comes with the hardware to mount it to your bike if that suits you! It is set up to mount right under your bottle rack or any other space with the same standard holes tapped. The valve does need to be revered to use on a standard bike valve though. Just unscrew the cap and flip around the valve. It looks like it has the option to put on a needle adapter for things like basket balls and stuff and is set that way on default. No big deal! Great pump!
