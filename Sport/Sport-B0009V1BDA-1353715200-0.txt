review/summary: Portable, yet large!review/text: My favorite thing: It pretty much comes assembled. The only things you have to do are attach the wheels (super easy, took me under a minute) and attach the back nozzle thing for the propane tank. So easy!I absolutely love this grill! I live in an apartment complex where we are allowed to grill a certain amount of feet away from the building, and this grill is perfect for that. It is super portable: just fold it up and it rolls, making transporting it a breeze. Despite it's portable size, it has a very large grilling surface for lots of food! The side tables are what really make this grill great. I put 1-2 pieces of glass corning-ware on the side tables filled with meat and they held the weight. It's also pretty easy to clean.In response to people saying that it gets really hot--well, obviously! It's a grill. The only thing I noticed (and this is not by any means a flaw, just an observation) is that when the grill does reach high temperatures, the top casing, which is normally a bright red, turns to a dark red.
