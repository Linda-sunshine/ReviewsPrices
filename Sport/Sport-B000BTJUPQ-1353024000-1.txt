review/summary: Daughter loves itreview/text: My 9 year old daughter went to Girl Scout camp the past 2 years and did some archery activities while she was there, so a bow and some arrows was a no-brainer when it came to her birthday. She loves shooting the bow and is surprisingly good with it, especially since her clutz of a father (me) over-tightened the plastic sight after adjusting it and snapped it off. My daughter has been known to have trouble focusing, but she will shoot this bow for hours on end, if we let her.I would have given 5 stars, but it would have been nice to have a metal sight that clutzes can't snap off so easily.
