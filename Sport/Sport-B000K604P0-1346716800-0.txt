review/summary: Water stays ice cold even in the middle of summerreview/text: I bought this Thermos at Target, and it was one of a few in the store that was not made in China.This bottle fits in your ordinary car cup-holder. It pops open with a push of a button. The lid has a small enough opening that you avoid burning your tongue on hot liquids. I will make coffee at 10 am, and the coffee will still be hot at 4 pm. I have also used this Thermos for cold water, and the water stays cold even after being in a hot car for 4 hours during summer.The bottle is easy to clean though it is hand-wash only. I've dropped it several times over the 6 months I've owned it, but it still is dent-free and shiny. A couple of times I've had liquids leak out from under the lid, but that was because I did not put the lid on properly. It needs to be screwed on at a certain angle, but when it is put on properly you can shake it vigorously without worrying about leaks. It is not heavy, so it's very convenient to carry around with you all day.I highly recommend this Thermos to anyone looking for a no-nonsense, reliable travel mug.
