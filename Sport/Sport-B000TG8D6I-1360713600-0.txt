review/summary: toughreview/text: convinced to do this after watching all those late night infomercials, but it didnt seem like a fly by night product like some of the others. then discoverd colleagues that had big benefits from it. I am finishing the first month (out of three) and am noticing the difference. hope i can finish all three
