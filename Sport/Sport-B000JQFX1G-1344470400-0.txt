review/summary: Terrific Value from Amazonreview/text: I've had the Invicta 8926OB for a little over three weeks and it's become the one I wear the most.It has the 24 jewel Seiko NH35A movement which provides both hacking(the second hand stops when the crown is pulled out to the time-setting position)and crown(stem)winding. When manually winding you can tell that you're actually winding the spring. Some of my automatic watches don't provide this positive feedback.The luminous markings last thru the night for me. At night, I lay it on the radio under my nightstand lamp whilst I read a while then I put it on at 'lights out'.It's still legible at six a.m.I'm kinda anal about correct time and keep a digital quartz watch as my 'standard'. If any of my watches gets four seconds off, I reset it. I only reset this one every 2-3 days! Don't expect better accuracy from any Swiss watch.If you're new to dive watches be aware of the screw-down crown. The crown must be screwed down to seal against leakage. Push the crown down against a spring and turn it clockwise. If it doesn't feel right stop screwing and back it out--these are very tiny threads and you don't wanna strip 'em-- and try again. Optionally, you can leave the crown pushed down but not screwed in--just don't put it in water.I'll report back later if any problems develop. Meanwhile, I'm looking for another watch with this movement.
