review/summary: perfect fit & finger dexterity for the modern shooter...review/text: I have the large pair & I got these for my wife. She liked how mine fit me and how I was able to use my fingers to load my rifle & make scope adjustment with them on. These are great if you want some protection & grip on your weapon... Don't keep looking...buy these...trust me!
