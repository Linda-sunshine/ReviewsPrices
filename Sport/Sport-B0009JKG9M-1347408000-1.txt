review/summary: A product to last the timereview/text: I remember how good my Grand Mothers food tasted using cast iron. I know that cast iron weighs more the conventional cook ware, how ever the taste difference is what does it for me. I plan on ordering more pieces and hopefully passing them down to my niece. Cast iron will out last most cookware. I love how Lodge pre-seasoned them for me.I would rate this product 10/1010 for taste values10 endurance10 for ease of cooking10 multi tasking cooking options (from being able to go from cooking on stove top, bbq, oven)heavy but worth it!!!
