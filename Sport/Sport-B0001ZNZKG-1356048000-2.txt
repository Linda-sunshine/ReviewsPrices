review/summary: Great material but fit is wrongreview/text: I really like the material these are made of but the fit leaves a lot to be desired. Namely the inseam is too long. What I mean is that if you want a snug fit with any kind of support then you either have to pull it up way above your belly button (who does that?) or you must fold the elastic band over on itself. Do not recommend unless you are over 70 years old.
