review/summary: Perfectreview/text: If you've seen the original wayfarer before and liked it, then this is an outstanding buy for the price. It's 100% authentic and fits perfectly. I first bought the rb2132 new wayfarers but noticed that they kept slipping down my face due to their build which was annoying. The 50mm original wayfarers have a distinct angle and support at the nose which makes it great for a medium/small face. It's sturdy, and you won't have to constantly adjust them. They are quality, and I will own it for years. Great product.
