review/summary: Slipperyreview/text: The mat has enough cushion for the most part. Some positions are a uncomfortable, like laying on my side due to lack of cushion on my hips. When bending and having hands on the mat, my hands tend to slide even if they are not sweaty. Which is not a good thing when I NEED to stay in position, I am constantly fighting to pull my hands back where they need to be.
