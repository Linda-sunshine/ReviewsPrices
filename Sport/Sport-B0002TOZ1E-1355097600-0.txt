review/summary: Simply The Bestreview/text: Gold Toe white crew socks feel great and hold up to numerous trips through the washer and dryer. Every 3 years or so, I throw out all my old white socks and buy about 18 pairs to replace them.I've tried numerous brands in the past, but these are the best. Accept no substitutes.
