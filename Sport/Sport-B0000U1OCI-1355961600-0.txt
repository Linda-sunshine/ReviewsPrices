review/summary: Decent Pedometerreview/text: This functions exactly how you would expect it to. The only issue i have is with the buttons. For being a pocket pedometer, one would think it was designed to be put in pockets. However, if you put it in your pocket, there's a high probability of hitting the buttons accidentally.
