review/summary: Thick and comfortablereview/text: I bought this yoga mat while looking for one to use in my basement, which has marble tile. In other words, the floor is very hard. I didn't want to have to buy a cushion or additional mat to use underneath my mat. I was a little nervous about picking a mat based on consumer reviews here on Amazon, but this one definitely serves my purposes. It is extra thick, so it is a great mat to use on such a hard surface. I can move through poses without feeling uncomfortable (or cold) and the surface of the mat is good for gripping. However, for those who are looking for a mat to bring to class, this one is unusually heavy and has a fatter roll than most due to the thickness of the mat. I still bring my thinner mat to class and leave this one at home. It smells a little like plastic, but overall, I am very happy with this product.
