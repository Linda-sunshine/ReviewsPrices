review/summary: Love these socks!review/text: Bought these originally to wear with Vibram FiveFingers shoes, and they work great for that. Since then I've stopped wearing Vibrams and now just wearing some different running shoes...but I continue to wear my Injinjis! I feel like I have that tiny extra bit of connection to the road, and let's face it...they're fun to wear.I love the Micro ones...nice ankle length. Long enough to stick up over the top of my running shoes, but not too long so that you look like a dork.
