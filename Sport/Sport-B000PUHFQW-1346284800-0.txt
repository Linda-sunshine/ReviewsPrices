review/summary: Yup, it's a mat.review/text: So it's a yoga mat. As far as being extra thick, perhaps it is in terms of inches, but I really didn't notice a difference. Obviously better than the free ones my gym offers, but still not a good solution to a hard wood floor beneath. Folding the end over or using a towel is still pretty necessary in my opinion for certain postures. At 188cm I give this mat approval for tall people. Throughout my class I had no problems. And while this mat didn't claim to do anything about slipperiness I'll just mention that it occurs so have a towel nearby.
