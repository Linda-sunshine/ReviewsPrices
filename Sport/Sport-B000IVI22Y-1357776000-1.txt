review/summary: Can't leave home without it!review/text: I'm a big water drinker and this bottle has made life SO much easier! The bite-to-drink top was a little strange to me at first and took a little getting used to until I was able to get plenty of water per sip, but it didn't take long and is really a great design! I literally take it everywhere with me and get a ton of use out of it (about 4-5 refills a day since September or October) - I would recommend it to everyone, whether you already drink tons of water (ESPECIALLY if you are a disposable water bottle drinker, in which case you should really be switching to something more eco-friendly like this) or are trying to get more water into your daily diet. Having it around with you WILL make you drink more, just because it's there. I accidentally dropped mine from a desk and one of the things that connects the straw to the top broke, but it still works - just leaks a little. That's my fault though. I haven't treated my bottle very well and it has held up so well.
