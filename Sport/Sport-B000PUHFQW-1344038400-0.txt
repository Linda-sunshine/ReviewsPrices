review/summary: Slippery when dryreview/text: This is a slippery yoga mat. Your hands will slide, your feet will slide. If you like sliding and hate holding static poses you will love this mat.The mat matches the picture and was delivered on time. The new mat smell goes away after a day or so if you air it out.
