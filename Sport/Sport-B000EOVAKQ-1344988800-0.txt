review/summary: Comfortable and provides shade for really sunny daysreview/text: Hands down, the best pair of goggles I have used. They fit perfectly, are comfortable, and do not fog up. An added bonus is that the lens are tinted, so it is like wearing a pair of sunglasses, so you don't squint as much on a sunny day. The only challenge I had was trying to figure out the strap so it wouldn't lengthen when putting them on. There is no clear instruction on how the strap should be looped through the buckle. After some trial and error, not sure if I did it right, but it works. I used a pair of needle nose pliers to pull the strap through the slit in the buckle. If you do this, just make sure you do not pull too hard, or the buckle/strap may snap. Other than that, good buy.
