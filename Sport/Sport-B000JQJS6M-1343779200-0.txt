review/summary: Worthless Junk - Came apart in my hands as I opened the box!review/text: I don't normally write reviews, but I thought it was necessary this time.I opened the box, took the watch out of the box and when I unscrewed the crown to set the time, the stem came right out of the watch!When I examined the stem it appeared to be made of plastic!The watch feels substantial and looks great - but the internals are nothing but cheap junk no doubt made in China.I would avoid this watch.
