review/summary: Learned a lesson, but product is fine if you like the cutreview/text: First off, make sure you know the clothing item you order will fit before you order off amazon. If you do not like the cut or it's to big or small, you will pay half of the cost of the item to return it.I really do like this brand and while this particular cut is not my thing, I'm sure others will enjoy them. The material is the same as boxers ExOfficio sells, so if you own those these are a loose boxer brief version. I returned mine, but own numerous pairs of the boxers and sport briefs (all purchaced here on amazon). I recommend washing on delicate with woolite and hanging to dry. If you do this they will look the sameas the day you bought them.Lastly, since I live in Dallas and have so many options to look at clothing before I make a purchace, I think I will stick to buying local when it comes to any future clothing purchaces.
