review/summary: A "Must Have" for Hot Climatesreview/text: This is one of those products where once you get it, you wonder how you ever got along without it.I am currently stationed in Singapore and while it's a fantastic place to live and work, it's also very hot and humid all year round. Needless to say, if you're cycling any distance at all around here, keeping hydrated is critical. Now having discovered the benefits of an insulated bottle, I'm left scratching my head wondering why the heck I was putting up with drinking warm water towards the end of my rides for the past few years.As some other reviewers have noted, these work so well you actually have to be careful about how much ice put in them. A little goes a long way (quite literally). Using just a few ice cubes, the water stays cold and there's still some ice left even after an hour or so on the road.I now have both the 20oz and the 24oz models. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers who noted that that the 24oz may be a tight fit for some frames. The 24oz works fine on my bike but for most rides the 20oz is quite sufficient and is a little bit easier to handle.Frankly, at the prices these are selling for on Amazon, it's a bit silly to be using anything else. Put simply, if you live in a hot climate, or at least have hot summers, you gotta have this!
