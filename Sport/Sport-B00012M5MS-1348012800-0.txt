review/summary: 2 different helmets fell apart within first week of receivingreview/text: I purchased this helmet based on reviews and when I received it, I was very happy - It looked great and fit great too. Then, within the first week, the plastic shell began warping in several places from sunlight/summer heat and separated from the Styrofoam helmet body. I live by the beach in Los Angeles.I returned the defective helmet to Amazon for a replacement and within a week of receiving the replacement, it also warped and separated from the helmet body, leaving me with the equivalent of a toddler's Styrofoam starter helmet. I am very disappointed with the quality of this helmet and would not recommend for anyone who lives where it is hot and sunny.
