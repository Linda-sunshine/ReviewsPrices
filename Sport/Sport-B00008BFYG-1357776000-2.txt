review/summary: Razor Scooterreview/text: Daughter loves the scooter. Happy that the scooter comes in different colors; Has made fighting over the scooters non exsistent as each child has a different color. Only disappointment is that the handle does not raise has high as I would like. My 5 year will likely out grow this by next year.
