review/summary: I lost weightreview/text: If you do the program and cut the junk food and fast food out then it absolutely works. My family and friends couldnt believe the difference. In 3 months I lost 20 lbs but more importantly I lost inches and 6 pant sizes, so I recommend this program to everyone and have gotten others started on it because I can prove to those in front of me that I have done it and it works. Its a great program and it is tough, as it should be to get the job done. I even gained some muscles which is amazing because I was so weak. And it was a great step for me as one and half years later I kept the weight off and am now a runner/cyclist and have lost a total of 60 lbs and I dont know where Id be if I hadnt started out with the p90x, im a big believer/advocate in this program.
