review/summary: 007 Bond Fauxlexreview/text: I'm a James Bond nut living on average mans salary. Living like Bond on the average mans salary means you gotta look for alternate but look alike items. Bond drinks Smirnoff vodka I drink Nikoli Vodka. He likes his Martini shaken not stirred I like mine as a vodka martini doesn't matter shaken ,stirred, blendered it's a Martini for gods sake drink it.I have enjoyed the priviledge of enjoying more expensive watches but this watch for the money is a great 007 rolex look alike . People have asked how can I afford a rolex on the money I make.I tell them it's not a rolex it's a Invicta but from across the table you or your friends will never know unless they ask. This watch performs as most automatics it looses or gains 5 seconds a day . I'm not upset at all with it and plan to buy more. Invicta has got my attention and will probably get more of my money. Great watch at a great price.UPDATE Jan.30 2013 I have been wearing this watch about a month now and still have people asking if it's a rolex. Some I say yes to some I tell the truth.The watch has some scratches but not uncommon for someone who works with his hands.It is still very accurate plus or minus 5 seconds a day and I still love the look . Check one out for yourself!
