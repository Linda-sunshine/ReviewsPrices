review/summary: Works great, feels great.review/text: I bought three pairs previously for a long trip, it works great. Dries pretty fast compared to normal cotton and feels comfortable too. Recently, I bought two more. Its an overall practical tee for travelling and even normal wear.But, one thing about this product material is that its kinda weak against abrasion and certain parts became a little fluffy over a time. Not a big deal, but something to take note if you know you are gonna wear it out. Same goes for the tees.
