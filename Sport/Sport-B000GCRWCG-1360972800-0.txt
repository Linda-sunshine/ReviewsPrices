review/summary: Nice to have; good for carsreview/text: I bought this product for a survival bag I was making and this was a good price for the quantity received. After putting a couple in my survival bag I then didn't know what to do with the rest, but then I decided to put the rest in all of my family vehicles. The blankets are in individual bags and are folded to a small size so they fit in the glove box of vehicles nicely without taking much space. I haven't used them yet but it is nice to know if you get stuck in bad winter weather that they are there and easily accessible.
