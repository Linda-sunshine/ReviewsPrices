review/summary: I find myself walking morereview/text: and sitting less. I had doubts about spending this much, especially after reading reviews on the poor clip design. But I bought it anyway and generally carry the device in a pocket or slip it into a small drawstring bag and pin the bag on the inside of my sweatshirts. This way, I don't have so many misreads.I just wish there was an option for DST changes without having to reprogram the entire program, but I can live with that.Prompt, well packaged delivery, too. When I did receive this product, along with the Sinus Irrigator, the wrong packing slip was in the box. I tried to notify Amazon of the issue but never found a contact link. I wish they would change this as anyone who has a similar issue and needs an exchange is screwed.
