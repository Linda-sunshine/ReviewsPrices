review/summary: Not as described.review/text: I already own the little knife that I just received, only with a red handle. I paid $8.00 for it last year. But the new white one I just received, that I paid $15.95 for, was described as having six stainless steel tools, instead of just four like my $8.00 one.The item description is wrong. The white model that I just received only has four stainless steel tools, instead of six, and there is no screw driver end on the tip of the nail file.The item description of the one I purchased is at:http://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Swiss-Classic-Pocket-Knife/dp/B00004YVB2/ref=cm_rdp_productThe review I made is lumped in with others that have a different description.
