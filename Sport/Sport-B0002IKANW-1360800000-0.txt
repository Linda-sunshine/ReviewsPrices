review/summary: Snap Capsreview/text: I am glad I have them to practice dry fire with my gun, however I do have two problems with them. 1. I wish they were orange. 2. The last cap in the mag never ejects. I don't know if other snap caps do this, but it is annoying and it often gets jammed in my gun when I unload the caps.
