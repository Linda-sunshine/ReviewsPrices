review/summary: Perfectly fine for kidsreview/text: These are nice, and clean well, and with kid-freindly colors work well for school lunches. For kids' palates, they keep food warm enough. For me, it would not be hot enough 3 hours later. The mouth of the container is nice and wide, which makes filling and cleaning with man-sized hands possible.
