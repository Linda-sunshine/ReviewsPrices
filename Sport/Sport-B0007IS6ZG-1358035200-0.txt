review/summary: Awesome! Better than running!! EDIT! ONE STARreview/text: EDIT*** AFTER TWO MONTHS THIS THING SNAPPED IN HALF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AND ALMOST TOOK MY DAMN EYE OUT! DO NOT BUY!!I never would have thought that jump roping would be more of a work out than running but it really is! I have been jumping for a little over two weeks and my pants already fit more loosely! This is a really great quality jump rope! Very durable and will last a long time! It is also very easy to adjust, all I needed was a pair of needle nose pliers and the rest is pretty simple to do yourself.THIS IS A MUST BUY!Miscellaneous: As I mentioned before I have lost weight after a short period of time. I was in a bulking phase where I wanted to get big but I have realized that I really enjoyed being more toned and slim, and at 230 pounds and only 5'10 (mostly muscle, im not fat and I bench 350 lbs) but I dont care about being strong anymore, being big has made a lot more sluggish and not as fast as I once was. So now I am slimming back down.
