review/summary: Does not fit Sig P250review/text: This does not fit the Sig P250 G2 with the flat accessory rail. Blackhawk knows this and does not make one for the newer P250's. I do not understand why I have to pay the shipping fees to return when Blackhawk says it fits all P250's with and without rails.
