review/summary: Husband hated itreview/text: I had gotten it for my husband but it was a big mistake. He is used to leathermans and apparently these don't really lock. I remembered my Grandfather using them for a long time but then I remembered that was something he didn't like either. I would return it but then I would loose 45% of what I had paid for it so I will just keep it in the stuff draw in the kitchen..
