review/summary: Great Quality, Great Designreview/text: I had this watch for a little over a month and absolutely love it.First off, I was mistaken by many that this was a Rolex hahaSo it does tell me that the design is similar to a Rolex which has wonderful design.Next the quality.The stainless steal casing is durable. The band does get scratched but that happens to all watches.The glass on both the front and the back is pretty scratch resistant.I see no marks after scraping against desks, trees, etc.Time are kept very precisely.I set my time on my computer and even after a month, the time are kept the same.So far 0 seconds.The only down side I see on not only this watch but all automatic watch is that it stops after 2 days inactive.I set my watch down for the weekend (Friday night) and it had already stopped by Sunday morning.And I did have my watch on for the past 2 weeks before I set it down.It is heavy. Dont mistake me for that.The main concern I had was weight and the size but both dont really concern me.My wrist is fairly small compared to most men but it did fit fine. Might seem a little big but not too much.Weight compared with other &#34;solar analog watch&#34; is very different.If you hold one of those solar analog watches and hold this automatic, the weight difference is big.After a while you get use to it on your wrist though so, again, it did not concern me.Iam thinking of coming back in the next 6 month~1 year and report back on this watch.
