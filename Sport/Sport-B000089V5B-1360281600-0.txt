review/summary: Great product and delivered as scheduled.review/text: I've used Converse sneakers for a little over a decade so I knew exactly what size to order, when I got them they were just perfect. Good to get dependable sizing and quality.They're more of a fashion item, in the most relaxed sense of the word, than running shoes.Did not need to contact vendor after placing the order, I got my notification of shipment and the package arrived on the promised date.
