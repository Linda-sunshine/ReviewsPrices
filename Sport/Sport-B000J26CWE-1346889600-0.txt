review/summary: Best Socks EVER!review/text: These socks are everything they say and more!! I bought the injinji Performance Original Weight Micro Toesocks, Black Medium. My shoe size is between a 10.5 and 11 and since that's the difference in a med. and a large I went with the med. thinking I would rather them be tight than loose and they fit perfectly!! I work in a restaurant and I'm on my feet all day these socks never slip down and stay dry and keep my feet at the perfect temperature! The best thing about these socks are that they align my toes making my whole foot feel sooo much better at the end of the night!!! I highly recommend these socks for everyone!! and I will be throwing away all my other socks and buying more of these !
