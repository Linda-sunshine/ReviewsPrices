review/summary: Great but they shrunk in the dryer the first timereview/text: My husband really likes these - to the point that he wants more pairs, and at this price point that will be slow going. I have noticed that the price changes on Amazon very frequently, so watch the pricing a bit before you buy.My only gripe about these is that the elastic band shrunk a bit the first time in the dryer. No biggie, but if they are already a bit small it might be an issue. He has a 34 inch waist, and I bought the medium, which fit well so I would say they are true to size.
