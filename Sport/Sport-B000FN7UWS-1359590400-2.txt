review/summary: Great water bottle...review/text: This is a great water bottle. Lightweight stainless steel that imparts no flavor to the water (that I can tell) and the mouth is wide enough to add ice cubes, if you prefer. It's just the right size for taking to work, camping, etc. And, with the bright yellow color that I ordered, it's really tough to lay this thing down and lose it. :-) I'm very pleased with it.
