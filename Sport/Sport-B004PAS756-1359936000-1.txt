review/summary: I fell slightly jippedreview/text: It's a great workout and I use it so I don't mean to seem ungrateful somehow, however, I feel as if this video was seconds or some kind of practice or trial run for the main Insanity series and they decided to make a buck off it. At more than one point, a cameraman or crew member crosses in front of the camera and at another, one of Sean's exercise buddies takes a phone call. WTF?It seems so unprofessional and disrespectful to the consumer. It also makes me feel as if this routine was not well thought out at all and I second guess sometimes that I even should be doing it.I feel as if he should re-do a proper fast and furious video and give it to previous customers for free as an apology!
