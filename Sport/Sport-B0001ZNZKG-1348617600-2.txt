review/summary: Worth the pricereview/text: I bought two pair for trial and soon bought two more. Light weight, easily washable, very very comfortable. In Phoenix can occasionally generate a little heat but not objectionable. (Hot car, leather seats, mid-August). Appear to be wearing well. I have other brands but these are the best. Reasonable deal when purchased at sale price with free and fast shipping.
