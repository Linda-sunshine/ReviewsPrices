review/summary: Not for long fingers or warm weatherreview/text: SIZEI measured my hand as instructed on the Hatch website: "Wrap a tape measure around your hand at the widest point (usually the knuckles) and make a loose fist. Note that measurement, round it to the nearest inch and refer to the chart above to find your approximate glove size."6" XS7" S8" M9" L10" XL11" XXLI nearly got a M but decided to round up to a L to be safe. I got the gloves, and though the lower half fits okay, the fingers simply aren't long enough. I noticed after the fact that another reviewer said they usually have problems with fingers being too long on gloves, and that that wasn't the case with these.UPDATE: I got the XL size, and the fingers are *still* not long enough. They feel better, but now the lower half of the glove is too loose, particularly around the wrist."ALL-WEATHER"These gloves are not very breathable so I wouldn't recommend them in warm weather, especially if your hands sweat.MATERIALThe material is somewhat thick and the inside seams are uncomfortable, particularly at your finger tips.
