review/summary: Great price and functionality, how can you go wrong?review/text: I love this light! I've used it on my Trek 6500 for several months now, and it works great.Battery life is excellent, the button is strategically placed, and it's quite bright. I feel safe knowing that cars will see me, and that's all that matters. It's also stayed put, even though I hop off curbs and bang my bike around.5 Stars for sure.
