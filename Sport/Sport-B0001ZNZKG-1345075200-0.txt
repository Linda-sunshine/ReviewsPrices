review/summary: Let downreview/text: I was really looking forward to these. I'm about 200 pounds, 35 inch waist, fairly large legs. I got pair of large grab and go boxer briefs after reading the reviews and I must say that they have their flaws. They keep riding up the legs, easily bunch up and ride in my ass. I must say the material is awesome, it doesn't even feel that bad when the ride up, albet it's extremely annoying. I ordered a medium pair of these in hopes that they will stay in play, because the boxers feel really good. I'm starting to run out of options, Nike combat pro chafes ridiculously, Adidas climalite rides and bunches like no tomorrow. I just hope the mediums stay put,
