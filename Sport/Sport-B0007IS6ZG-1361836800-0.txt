review/summary: Good for moneyreview/text: This rope isn't too tough to adjust, only thing is you can't change it back to a longer setting once you get it to a short one (if you do it the way they tell you to). Handles are nice, but the only downside is for me mine gets tangled DURING my workouts. Which is pretty annoying during my boxing workouts. But anyways, good rope for the money, not a 5 star rope though
