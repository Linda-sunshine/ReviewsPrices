review/summary: Don't buyreview/text: I have used a heart rate monitor for many years, so I am very familiar with them and how they work. When I received my Omron HR-100C, I unpacked it carefully to try it out. In a few words it didn't work properly. My heart rate readings were incorrect and as I exercised it went wildly up and down. I know I had good contact with the transmitter as I used a special gel made for this purpose. I should have known better as many reviewer's had similar problem's. Have used a polar for many years and was very happy with them.What I find very strange but interesting is that a few hundred people gave it 5 stars and a few hundred people gave it 1 star.How can this be? If you read the comments carefully you'll find that in the 5 star ratings the monitor worked well. Among the 1 star ratings it did not work properly. I believe both ratings are correct. The logical explanation is that the company's quality control is poor.I believe that many of the monitors are defective, not properly checked and thus passed on to be sold. I believe a company like polar must have a more stringent quality inspection and thus the reviews are quite consistent.
