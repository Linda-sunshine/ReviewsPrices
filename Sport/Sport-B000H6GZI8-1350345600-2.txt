review/summary: Hogue Rubber Grip Handall Jr. winnerreview/text: Slipped this sleeve on a Kahr cm9 for a tight fit, pulled it a little higher up in the back and it was a perfect fit---and at the range, it not only offered a more secure, firm grip but eased the irratation from the aggresive stipling on the front & back of the grip---simple & affordable two way solution!!
