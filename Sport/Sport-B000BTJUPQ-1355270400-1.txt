review/summary: Great product. Lots of power.review/text: We bought this for our 7 year old and he is a little too small to pull back the string. My 9 year old, however, loves it and is able to use it no problem. So, I would recommend it for 9+. It packs a bit of power too, so you have to be careful where you are shooting it!
