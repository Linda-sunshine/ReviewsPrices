review/summary: Nice pantsreview/text: Ok, I get it now. This is my first pair of yoga pants. I understand why they are so popular now. I don't do yoga so I never considered that I should need a pair. But, these are great! They're comfy like sweatpants but they make me look great and not like a huge slob. I wouldn't wear them to dinner or anything but I do feel more "dressed" than I do in regular sweatpants. I found they were pretty true to size and they seem well constructed. I'd buy another pair.Update 1-25-13: I bought another pair in brown. They seem to be pilling slightly inside the legs and I haven't been wearing them very long. It's not very noticable but you can feel it. The black pair has not started pilling yet.
