review/summary: Erraticreview/text: I have a hard time getting this thing to pickup my heartbeat. I wet it ...strap it on.....nothing...... So I start running..10 minutes into the jog I notice it FINALLY starts detecting a heartbeat, despite several adjustments on my chest. When it gets going..its GREAT!!!
