review/summary: High Quality, Great fit, has pockets, has the draw string.review/text: These are slightly different than the pocket-less version.These have a draw-string and fit looser requiring you to use the draw-string to keep them up, especially if you put your phone or wallet in your pocket.I figured out a trick to using the draw-string.1) put on your shorts,2) pull all the excess string out.3) divide it in half from left to right so you can hold half in each hand.4) tie this into a knot.5) you can tighten it up by pulling individual strings on either side.6) once tight, just twirl/twist the slack over and over, then tuck into your pants/underwear and it won't come loose.If you try to tie a bow, it can cause knots which are a pain to unravel when tight.
