review/summary: Best Bang for the Buckreview/text: -comfortable and light weight - barely know they are on-great for sports too - they don't feel restricting and allow plenty of movement-as long as you aren't using these as a replacement for your depends, you can wear them multiple days in a row before they start to stink! :-D-I have some of these that are 6+ years old and they are still as good as they were on day 1 of my purchase - quality product!You won't regret your purchase!
