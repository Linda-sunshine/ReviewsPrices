review/summary: Great Mirrorreview/text: This is a great product! The assembly is not difficult to understand, and the screws are difficult to tighten for good reason. There are brass inserts for the screws, that are tapered and slotted to insure a fit that won't slip. You will be able to tighten the screws to the point that you can still make adjustments as you ride. The picture looks like the mirror stem is flexible, but it's not. The whole thing is made out of a tough plastic. I couldn't be happier with this product. Plan to purchase another for my second bike, and several more for gifts.
