review/summary: Great with long distance trips!review/text: I recently moved from Utah to Texas and needed a bike rack that could go the distance without any trouble. After reading the reviews and checking prices for other racks, this one seemed like the safest bet. Keep in mind I only used it for 1 bike and not 2. My bike and my little 98 Honda Civic made it without any damage/scratches to the car or bike. The trip was 1,200 miles and I averaged a speed of 75mph, some times getting up to 85mph. The rack held up perfectly and only about every 3 or 4 hours of driving would I re-tighten the straps. An overall great product!
