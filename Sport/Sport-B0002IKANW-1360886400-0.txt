review/summary: Bought these for dry practice out of my 4" XD9review/text: These are the second pair of caps I bought from. This'd company. The others were for my 12GA shotgun so I could practice racking as well as leave the hammer down on a snap cap rather than have it cocked empty. Since then I keep the chamber loaded and cocked, so I no longer use those. Regardless the machining and quality was phenomenal.These I solely use for malfunction drills w/o live ammo in the home. I keep one mag filled with them, another empty. The empty one goes in the pistol, while the dummy filled mag is on my belt. I'll set up a type 3. Sight in, fire, dead trigger, step sideways, check the gun, lock the slide, check my mag pouch to make ureone is there, strip the mag, rack-rack-rack, pull the spare, load and rack. Done!I alo use them for Type 2s using one as a stovepipe. Tap, tilt-rack, assess.Thy are obviously lighter in weight than the 12GA ones and feel a bit cheap, but they're well made and I like the rubber(?) primer o as to not harm the firing pin.On the range for live fire, I will have someone load the mag for me with a snap cap or two or three interspersed randomly, to force live firing malfunction drills. These of corse are strictly type 1, unless my buddy puts two together in which case I do an emergency reload.
