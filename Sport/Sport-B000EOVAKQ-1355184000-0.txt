review/summary: Stay put!review/text: I bought these goggles to use during a &#34;Tough Mudder&#34; which is like a half marathon for crazy people involving obstacles and, you guessed it, lots of mud. I was concerned about my contact lenses washing out. These goggles did the job, stayed put even after a 20 foot jump into water! I haven't used them for regular swimming yet but I'm sure they will be great!
