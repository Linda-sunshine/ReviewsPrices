review/summary: Folding razorreview/text: Looks Like a very well made product, but it folds only once. I thought this was a neat concept for transporting , EXCEPT the folding mechanism doesn&#34;t function.Now I'm dealing with all the requirements to prove it is not working. A STRING OF PHOTOS ! The product with full photo, folding lever and model sticker. Along with the receipt.I now have trouble E-MAILING ALL OF THIS. HOPE TO FIGURE THIS OUT!
