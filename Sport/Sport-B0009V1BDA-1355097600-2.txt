review/summary: Good dealreview/text: I got this on a groupon deal for $99 and it was a steal. I love t hat it's portable, yet larger for a crowd. I'm thinking for the tournament weekends we go on for baseball season. Small gas tank makes it very convenient, so you don't have to take a bigger tank. perfect for burgers and brats. Wouldn't use it as a serious grill though, but it would be good in a pinch for any use. Line with foil for easy clean-up.
