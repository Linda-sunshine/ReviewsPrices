review/summary: great pantsreview/text: I love love love these pants I love the length, I have had 2 surgerys on my stomach it hurts to wear jeans or pants with allowed up the front so I buy pants like these wear a long top and some little shoe boots or a shoe with a 3inch heal and they look great. I received these pants today and put them on I'm extremely happy with them and you can be sure I'll be buying more.
