review/summary: Invicta Men's Pro Diver Two-Tone Automatic Watchreview/text: The watch is beautiful. It looks LIKE my REAL Rolex which was stolen from me a while back and is being held as evidence. However the Invicta LOSES FIVE MINUTES TO AN HOUR PER DAY??? So I plan to stop using it. Who wants a watch that's always slow an hour or so???
