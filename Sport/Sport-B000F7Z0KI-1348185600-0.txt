review/summary: Too leakyreview/text: The water bottle has treated me well and leakyness was always an issue but not as big of a problem. Every time I go to take a sip in class, I spill water all over myself and I'm pretty annoyed with it (yes the cap is securely on). Either way I would never recommend this bottle to anyone.
