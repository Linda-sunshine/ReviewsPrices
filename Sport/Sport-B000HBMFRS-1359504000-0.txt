review/summary: best quality mattressreview/text: This mattress is almost as good as my actual bed, and I sleep on a nice memory foam mattress. The fact that the pump stays with the bed at all times ensures that it is never misplaced or anything. The mattress is insulated very well, but since its in air mattress it still gets too cold in the winter. The pump is also useful in removing air form the mattress when you are trying to store it in its cloth pouch.
