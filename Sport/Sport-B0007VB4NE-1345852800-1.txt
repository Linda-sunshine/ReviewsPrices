review/summary: Helping with back and sciatica painreview/text: I purchased this chair and received it two days ago. As other reviewers suggested, I inflated the ball and added more air each day. Today I was able to inflate it to it's full size. I'm hoping it will help with back problems that are acting up.So far, so good. I've had bad sciatica this week and have been able to sit on the balance ball chair with no pain. I'll see how it goes over time.To the person having problem putting the hex nuts on: my chair went together easily and the nuts for the bar went on with no problem. They do have to go on in a specific direction - I think it is with the wide flat side facing down. - maybe check to be sure they are going on in the right direction. It may only work one way.
