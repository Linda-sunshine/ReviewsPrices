review/summary: Never disappointed with a Hoppe's bore snakereview/text: Everyone should have one of Hoppe's bore snakes for every long gun they own. IMHO, it is a piece of gear that is as essential as ammo. Period. Why? Because the risk of damaging a rifle bore, chamber or extractor is greatly reduced by using a boresnake over a cleaning rod and far easier to &#34;pack out&#34;.
