review/summary: This bow is so cutereview/text: It really feels sturdy and comes nicely set up. I love the pink color for my daughter. My kids have been using cheap bows that break for years, and thought they were ready for something a bit more real. I got this for my 7 year old daughter who is tiny but strong (wears a 5-6). She is able to pull the string back, but more importantly she adores it.
