review/summary: Omron HJ-112 Accurate and economicalreview/text: I have used the Omron HJ-112 pedometer for many years and found them to be economical and accurate. My only negative comment is that they don't seem to last for more than 18 months. However, this may be a minor issue given the price compared to other less accurate products that I have tried, This is my top choice. If you are first time buyer of a pedometer I definitely recommend this model and brand.
