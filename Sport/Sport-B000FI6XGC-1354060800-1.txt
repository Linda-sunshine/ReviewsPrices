review/summary: Worthlessreview/text: I saw how to get past the hurdle of having the wrong adapter as the default so that was easy. Everything else was horrible. Attaching it to the plug is hard and so much air leaks that it took about 1/2 hour to pump a tire to nearly full. Detaching it was a pain and since the parts are plastic, I can't see it taking the abuse it takes just to remove it for too many times. By the time the second tire was half full, my patience was gone. RETURNED. I'd rather have a standard full-sized pump that this frustrating gadget.
