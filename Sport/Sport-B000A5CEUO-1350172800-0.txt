review/summary: It got the job done... while it was working.review/text: The HRM- This HRM is decent at what it does. It sometimes is a bit slow to read the heart rate correctly, sometimes gets 'stuck' for ~10 seconds before it changes, and reads way high on occasion. That being said, it works ok most of the time. Gets the job done.Batteries- The batteries last about a month each (both the chest strap and watch battery), but keep in mind that I have to wear a HRM every day all day. Changing the battery in the watch is a pain in the butt, but changing the battery in the chest strap is easy.Chest strap and watch/wrist band- The chest strap is good, though the elastic does continually loosen as you continue to wear it. It eventually got to wear I had to cut and sew it myself so that it would not be so loose even when I had it tightened all the way. This chest strap does NOT have a faint beep with every heart beat like many others do. The wrist band is not terrible, but the Timex T5G971 and Polar FT4 have much nicer, more comfortable wrist bands. The watch screen on this one gets scratched up pretty easily.After almost a year of use, this HRM's beeper stopped working.The only reason I stuck with this one instead of the Timex or Polar is because the chest strap doesn't have the faint beeping with every heart beat. If the other ones didn't have that, I would use them instead for sure. I'll give this 3 stars because of the price.
