review/summary: Great but do tend to fall offreview/text: I bought these for a step contest and they're great. They're pretty accurate once you have them setup. The only problem we've had is they do tend to fall off when clipped (especially in the bathroom setting), but they seem to be able to take many many drops onto concrete and tile. A better clipping system would have gotten this product 5 stars, but I'd still recommend these for anyone looking to monitor their steps, mileage, etc.
