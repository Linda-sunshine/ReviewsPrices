review/summary: Missing Batteryreview/text: Unlike other pedometers I've tried, this one is easy to set and works well. My only complaint is that it was supposed to come with a battery and did not. Batteries can be expensive and when I contacted the company they said to contact the retailer. A lot of effort to try to get something that was supposed to be included.
