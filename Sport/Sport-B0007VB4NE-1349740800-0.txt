review/summary: poor qualityreview/text: To be honest, the ball chair quality is ok. But the hand pump is of terrible quality. It was broken (air leakage) in the original package. I borrowed my friend's pump (same product but he's luckier to have a good pump) and spent quite some time to inflate the ball. Not easy job.When I issued a return request on Amazon, I was asked to return the whole product... which means I have to deflate the ball and disassemble the chair! I gave up. the seller should expect this kind of situation and give a "pump return option"What if I got a broken screw. Do I have to return the whole heavy chair? WTF. so frustrating.I don't recommend anyone to buy this thing online.
