review/summary: It keeps on ticking...review/text: I find this pedometer to work very well, and to keep an accurate count of steps. etc. I have not found it too sensitive, but only sensitive enough to do that job it was created to do. I bought one, and then lost it one night. I immediately bought another, and have found it just as good as the first.
