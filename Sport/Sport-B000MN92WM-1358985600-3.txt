review/summary: Doesn't connect to Microsoft Health Vaultreview/text: I bought this product specifically because it claimed to connect to Microsoft Health Vault and it does not. Plus the packaging read HJ-720ITFFP but the back of the pedometer doesn't. I had already sent back one of these and this time decided I would just give up the Health Vault uploading options for step counting. I'm still not sure whether the wrong pedometer was put in the packaging (it was made in China) or whether it just doesn't work as advertised. At any rate, this reached the point of diminishing returns and with this review I have officially given up!
