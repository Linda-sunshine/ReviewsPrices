review/summary: It is extra thick but very slipperyreview/text: I was so excited to get a yoga mat but was very disappointed in my first yoga class when it turned out to be more of a workout than I had bargained for. Most yoga positions I did had an added level of difficulty with my hands and feet slipping the entire time. I have never had hands and feet that were overly sweaty but this mat makes them that way. I haven't noticed any funny smell like some of the other reviewers. I gave 2 stars because I do like the extra thickness which provides added padding. I have read some reviewers have put it in the washing machine to make the mat less slippery, so I may try that.
