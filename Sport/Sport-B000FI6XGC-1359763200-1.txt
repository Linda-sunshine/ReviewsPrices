review/summary: Small but irreplaceablereview/text: This little pump is awesome. Not only does it have a hilarious name on it, but it's tiny and mounts right onto a water bottle mount. It is supposed to go up to some really high PSI, but I have a mountain bike, so I haven't tested that. Being a small pump, it might take awhile to pump up your tire, but it's way better than no pump at all and mine stays mounted to my frame so I ALWAYS have it!If you like to bike, one of these is worth buying.
