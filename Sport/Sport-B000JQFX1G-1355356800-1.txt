review/summary: Great Product!review/text: This watch has that classic look at the right price. I was a little worried, however, with some of the negative feedback regarding Invicta's QC. I don't know if I just happened to get a &#34;good one&#34;, but this watch is amazing. Nice weight, beautiful styling, keeps great time, and I have not had any issues with the crown or bezel. I highly recommend this watch to anyone looking for an affordable touch of elegance!
