review/summary: Accurate Counterreview/text: I really liked this stepometer. This is the first I have bought so I can't really compare it but I thought it was great for the price. It came with a software that I could keep track of my weekly walks with. I thought it was really helpful in keeping me on track. By the way, when you have something counting your steps, you'll take the stairs to make that number higher! Motivation!
