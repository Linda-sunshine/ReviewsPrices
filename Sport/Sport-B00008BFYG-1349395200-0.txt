review/summary: The best kid toy everreview/text: We love the classic Razor Kick scooters and the pink version is just as good as the rest except...very girly. My son has the red and together our two kids tear up the neighborhood on these things. They help keep the kids active and are considered "cool" at the same time. The glide is exceptional and the construction sturdy. The handlebars move up and down easily and the scooter is extremely light and portable. It folds for very easy transport. We love these so much that we ordered two extras to be shipped to my parents' house in Michigan for our vacation.After a year or two of regular use the wheels will likely wear down, but replacements are easily purchased online for about $10.00.This toy is a great bang for the buck. Highly, highly recommend!
