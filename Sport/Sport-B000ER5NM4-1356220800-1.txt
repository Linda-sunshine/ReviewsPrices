review/summary: Awesome but run small!review/text: After reading others' reviews, I ordered a size up. Honestly that was just barely enough - I typically wear an XL/14 so ordered a XX and they fit like a small 14. But hey they're yoga pants so it works for me. Other than running small, they are awesome & VERY comfy - heavier weight cotton and flattering shape, a bit wider legged from the knees down than I expected, but I like that. No issues with being too long, but I like pants to be longer (ie bit below my heels, I'm 5'7"). And you can't beat Amazon's price!
