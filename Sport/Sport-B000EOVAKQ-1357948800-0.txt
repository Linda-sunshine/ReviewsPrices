review/summary: Okayreview/text: These are nice but they did not last all that long. Starting leaking after a brief 2 months of use. Worked out great until then (2 months has been the average lifespan of all my swimming goggles since they came out with the all plastic seals, I am one of these people who do better with the old school foam seal). Still better than the &#34;base&#34; Speedo or Tyr model (including women)
