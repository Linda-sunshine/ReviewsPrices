review/summary: Victorinox must love TSAreview/text: I can tell you exactly how many of these wonderful little knives I've lost around home or work: None. Not a single one. But I can't tell you how many of these tiny Swiss Army knives with a non-locking 1.25" long blade I have lost to the rule enforcers at TSA airport security lines because I forgot to leave my dangerous weapon at home. I mean, this knife is about the size of a tube of Chapstick. I use it to cut tape, use the inch-long fingernail file for a hangnail emergency or use the half-inch scissors to snip a loose thread. I should caution anybody reading this review that you should never use this knife to slash or stab at anything because the non-locking blade might fold in and cause you to cut your own fingers. Otherwise this little knife is wonderful and I'm always enraged at my thoughtlessness when I forget to take such a harmless thing out of my pocket when I know it'll be confiscated to keep a mild-mannered 63 year old Army veteran like me from even the most remote, improbable, unthinkable chance I would do something foolish. But, boy, I bet Victorinox sure loves TSA.
