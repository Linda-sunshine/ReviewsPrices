review/summary: Fits as Advertisedreview/text: The Hogue Rubber Grip Jr. does what it is supposed to do-it adds a better grip to your small handgun. It takes little effort to stretch it over the handle. Once on where you like it simply cut around the bottom to remove any excess that hangs over the handle. You can use an X-acto knife or, like me, use a good pair of scissors to complete the job. Whatever you use just be careful not to scratch your firearm. It's worth the money and I'm buying a second one for another small handgun I own. I don't think you'll be disappointed if you purchase this product.
