review/summary: recommended by coworkerreview/text: used it for a little while but now it's collecting dust somewhere; couldn't get used to the mouth piece that caused some blistering on my lips, even though I cleaned it every day; made funny noises while drinking during meetings at work too, so it didn't really work out for me.
