review/summary: Very good buyreview/text: I buy these for my husband because he loves them so much. This is the third watch that I've bought (all the same models) because he is kind of tough on them and he always likes to keep one in great shape for &#34;dressier&#34; occasions. It looks identical to a Rolex, if you like that kind of thing, and he gets compliments on it all the time. I have a female version that I love as well.
