review/summary: It is perfectly madereview/text: I appreciate a company these days that makes something to last. There was clearly some conscious care put into the design. I think there are a lot of companies that are making these, and maybe theirs are just as good. But through skillful marketing, I was directed here. This thing is awesome, durable, and inspiring to drink more water. Fine product. Got the 27 Oz Orange with the classic cap. That sports cap does look clever, but i had a concern about it's longevity. Whether unfounded or not for that design, I do however have no concerns about the classic cap :-) If I lose this, I'll buy another.C
