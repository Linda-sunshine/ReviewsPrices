review/summary: Nice productreview/text: These are very comfortable and block the noise much better than other brands that I have used. My husband saw me take them out of the box, and saw they were 3m, he thought they were about $60! He was impressed, but I bought them for myself so he won't be wearing them. They are a good fit for me, but if you have a large head, they may not fit. They are not adjustable.
