review/summary: A real incentive for fitness walkingreview/text: I have used this pedometer every day for the past 8 months. I wanted to check its durability and battery life before writing a review. It has met all my needs perfectly. I carry it in my side pants pocket all day, try to attain my daily aerobic and total step goals, and download into the intuitive software weekly. I love to walk, and this device provides me with positive motivating feedback. As for battery life, the first battery lasted 5 months which is fine with me.
