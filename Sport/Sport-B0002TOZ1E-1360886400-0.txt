review/summary: Are these really Gold Toe socks?review/text: I was rather surprised and disappointed with this purchase. I've been buying men's socks for quite a while as they are less expensive, thicker than ladies' socks and perfect for gym shoes and boots. I bought these in white a few years ago and after repeated wearing and washing are still like new.These black ones must have a lot of polyester or another cheap component not stated on the packaging. They pilled after only wearing and washing once (!), feel &#34;slippery&#34; and generate a lot of lint. Had I not thrown out the packaging I would have returned them. I will say the fit is good; although who knows what will happen after repeated washing?I thought I was buying good quality cotton socks. I wish I had read the other reviews before ordering. I trusted the Gold Toe name but I will be more careful in the future.
