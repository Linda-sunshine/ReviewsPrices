review/summary: Very fast and light jump rope, perfect for Crossfit+Double-Undersreview/text: This jump-rope is probably the best one I have ever used. The grips fit nicely in my hands and the movement is very fluid. This rope has made double-unders much easier for me and I have really enjoyed adding more jump roping to my standard workouts.The Speed Rope comes with instructions as to how to adjust the height. It was really easy and probably took me a total of 5 min. I am 73&#34; tall and I needed to shorten the rope considerably, so I am sure that it is more than long enough for even the tallest of consumers.
