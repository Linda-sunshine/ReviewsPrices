review/summary: Poor quality, looks like factory seconds, bad packagingreview/text: Extremely disappointed with the product and the shipping. The box was mailed in a shipping envelope, not a box so the product box was badly crushed. This was a gift, so I wanted the presentation to be nice. I completed the Amazon form to report the poor packaging and asked for a response but got none.The glasses themselves are poor quality. The lenses are slightly different sizes and the nose pieces are crooked, so they fit oddly. It appears the glasses I received are factory seconds, not high quality Ray Bans. The person I gave them to asked me if they were knockoffs.In any case they are being returned today.
