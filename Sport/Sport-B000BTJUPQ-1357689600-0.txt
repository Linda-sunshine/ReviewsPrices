review/summary: Nice setreview/text: Bought it for my grandson for Christmas. He hasn't really used it yet to rate it but seems to like it and had no problems drawing it back. The only problem I had with it was it was supposed to come with a target and it didn't. E-mailed company and got no response. Had to buy the target.
