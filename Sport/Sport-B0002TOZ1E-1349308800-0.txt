review/summary: Love Gold Toes!review/text: I had ordered the Hanes and these got holes within days of wearing them (which was strange; that doesn't usually happen).Gold Toe has always been reliable. My husband gets holes in his socks quite easily. He's a general contractor but these are working for him.Have had these for a while now (don't remember when I ordered them - around March 2012?) and they are still going stong.I'd recommend these.
