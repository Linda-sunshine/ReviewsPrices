review/summary: Comfortable but worn three times and stiching coming apart alreadyreview/text: Wouldn't recommend. I've worn them three times, washed them twice and the stiching is coming apart in the crotch and leg seam. I bought these to replace an identical pair I got as a gift five years ago that lasted a long time unitl the pockets ripped. Something has changed from then to now in quality or maybe I got a bad pair
