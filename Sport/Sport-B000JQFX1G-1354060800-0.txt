review/summary: Lotta watchreview/text: Runs fast, about 45 seconds per day, but not consistently. Don't know if this is typical for self-winders. For service, Invicta shipping charges kicks up the amount invested in the watch a lot. Will stick it out until later in the one year warranty period to see how it's working. Why couldn't this be adjusted locally? Local watch service would seem simpler.
