review/summary: The 27 oz unpainted version is goodreview/text: I do not recommend painted version or the 40 oz version. The larger ones dent WAY too easily and the paint chips off if you look at it too hard. You also cannot drink from the sport top without making tons of noise through the breather and that is annoying. The taste of water out of these is completely untouched though and that is why I like these.
