review/summary: I like them but a little long.review/text: I ordered a medium, I am 5' 5&#34;, 130 lbs, with a 31&#34; inseam. They are an inch or two too long for me, however I like the feel and fit so I am keeping them, I'll either hem or get used to the length. After washing or drying, I didn't notice much shrinking.
