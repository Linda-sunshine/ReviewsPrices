review/summary: Durable and Comfortablereview/text: I've owned these gloves for almost 2 years now, and they're still going strong. I admit that I don't use them extremely frequently, but I would say that they're used at least once or twice a week. There is some wear and tear near the thumbs, but nothing you wouldn't expect from owning the gloves for this duration. Also, these gloves are very very comfortable and don't make your hands feel wet and disgusting. When they get dirty, you can easily throw them in the wash, but if they're really disgusting, you shouldn't put them in with your nice clothes, as some of the gym odour can rub off.
