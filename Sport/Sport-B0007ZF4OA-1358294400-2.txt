review/summary: Super handy to have a box of these by the door if you live in a cold climatereview/text: I'm more of a cold weather person than my husband and he moved here because of me, so anything I can do to make his life better in the winter is a good thing. These have cheered him up immensely because he can shove a couple in his gloves or pockets every time he has to go outside.I fell in love with handwarmers on ski lifts in my teens. These aren't the hottest temperature I've ever had (I've forgotten what those were) but to me, that just makes them more comfortable to stash inside gloves or clothing for a few minutes. Too hot is uncomfortable.
