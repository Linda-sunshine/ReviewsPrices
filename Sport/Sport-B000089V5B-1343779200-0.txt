review/summary: Glue failingreview/text: Good looking shoes, but...after just 1 month,the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends. The shoe still looks perfect, but I had to use shoe goo to fix it. Seems like for the price, and for as long as this style has been around it shouldn't so this?!
