review/summary: makes me sweatreview/text: I only get to work out early in the mornings (prefer spending time with my toddlers when I get home from work than working out later in the day). So it's a perfectly timed workout to do a quickly in the morning; and the routine is tough enough that I know it'll be a few weeks, maybe months before I perfect the move and need more.
