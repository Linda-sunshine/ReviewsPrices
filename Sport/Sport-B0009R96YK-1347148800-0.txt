review/summary: I can see clearly nowreview/text: This little mirror just eliminated my apprehension on the road. As usual it arrived quickly despite a holiday. Amazon is GREAT! After opening the box you will see that it comes in pieces so you may have to engineer your way through the build. Look at the pictures in the instructions to see which of the 3 bolts and the array of washers go where. On a difficulty scale of 5 with 5 as nearly impossible without an engineering degree I give this one a 1. Really easy once you understand the sequence. You will be tossing one of the angled ramped pieces because you get a large diameter and a small diameter. When you bolt the ramped piece to the mirror shaft keep it loose because this is the end that will go into your handlebars. Once installed on the bike you simple tighten it and the ramp end slides inside the bars to fill the inside diameter. You will have to cut the hand grip before you install the mirror. When you do don't circumcise it just carefully trim it around the inside diameter of the handle bars. I used my mirror for the first time today and it is sturdy, simple to adjust and provides great visibility behind because it is convex. Not sure if or how this would work on road bike bars but on my straight bars it is SUPER. Take a look at my install pic.
