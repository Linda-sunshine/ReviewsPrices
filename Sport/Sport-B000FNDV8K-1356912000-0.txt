review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: My husband forgot to take his small knife off his key chain when he went through Security at the airport. He didn't think he could replace it because it was small, light weight and had a pair of scissors that were very useful. I found what he wanted in this knife I got him for Christmas. He's happy.
