review/summary: Guests said very comfortablereview/text: Our guests have said this was more comfortable than their own bed. It was easy to and quick to blow up, much better than other air mattresses. We left it up for nearly 2 weeks before finally deflating it and it hardly lost any air at all. The only issue is getting it back into the small bag, they never seem to fold up as good as they came!
