review/summary: Favorite yoga pants that I own!review/text: I received these pants, in a medium, as a gift a while ago. I had never owned a pair prior to that but when I tried them on, that changed. I'm 5'6", 135 lbs and they fit me perfectly, just a little on the long side. I would typically buy a medium in everything so all the other reviews saying to order a size up must not apply to me. I love the thick material, the nice flare, and that they are super comfy. I did end up buying all the other colors and they all fit perfectly as well. The other colors don't seem to run as long as the black though. All in all, I will continue to order these!
