review/summary: Seems pretty quality.review/text: I have only used this once so far but its is made out of quality material. Although as i read in previous reviews before buying you definatley need to secure the front wheel and the pedal to the bike rack or it will definatley do a number on your bumper. Also where the hooks attatch to the backside of the trunk lid and in my case the bottom of the trunk lid I think is missing a key peice of foam. You never want to attatch a peice of metal against the paint it will crack it in no time. I cut out 3 peices of foam and glued them to the hooks to prevent any damage. But over all I am pretty satisfied with the bike rack.
