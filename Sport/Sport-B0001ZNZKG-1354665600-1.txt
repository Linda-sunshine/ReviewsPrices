review/summary: Worth the costreview/text: These boxers are worth the price! I HAD been the type of guy who would buy boxer briefs from Hanes or Fruit of the Loom because I thought it was stupid to pay more than $3.00 per pair of boxers but these are truly worth the price! I bought one pair initially and have since purchased three more! Have tried UA Boxerjocks and Starter Premium Boxer briefs and the ExOfficio boxer briefs are the best! They fit &#34;the boys&#34; well and don't ride up as bad as MANY other boxers do...I am a larger man and my search for a comfortable pair of boxers is over so quit reading this review and BUY THEM ALREADY!One other thought...they can run a bit warm, but some talc or goldbond fixes that issue right up!
