review/summary: Mom was right about cast iron!review/text: I should have listened to mom and grandma. Cast iron cooking IS the way to go. You can keep your so called no stick cookware. These cooking products will outlast my grandkids if you take care of them. For you young people who know how to cook, please do yourself a favor and get a set of cast iron cookware.
