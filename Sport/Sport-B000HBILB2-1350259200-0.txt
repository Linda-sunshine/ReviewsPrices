review/summary: Just what I needed. It's perfect.review/text: I recently moved to a very small studio apt, so I got a futon at Target. Due to the small size of my place, I threw the box away as soon as I built the futon. Big mistake. The futon was the most uncomfortable thing I have ever sat on, let alone try to sleep on. I doubt Target will take it back, without a box. So I got a cheap Coleman air mattress to use on top of the futon at night. That way I figure I can still have a "couch" during the day. Worked pretty well for about 2 weeks till it got a huge hole on a seam. The repair patch was useless, so I decided to find a new air mattress online.The price for this one was perfect, and the reviews were possitive so I took a chance. I choose free shipping and was amazed it only took a day and a half for me to recieve it, instead of the 8-10 days my order said to expect. It took less the 2 minutes to inflate, and is extremly comfortable.The cord stores right inside a compartment built into the pump, kinda like a battery compartment. Speaking of batterys, It also has a spot built in to inflate using a hand pump, incase electricity is unavailable. Also, the repair patch included is way better then the cheap little sticker included in my original Coleman air bed, although I hope to never have need of it.At first I was concerned with the height, being taller the my old one was, but I decided to take a chance and order it anyway. Actually on top of the futon, it is the same height as a regular mattress and boxspring, so I lucked out on that as well.I'm definately going to order a queen size for my bf and I to use for camping and Burning Man. I would say to anyone looking for an air mattress, this one is perfect.
