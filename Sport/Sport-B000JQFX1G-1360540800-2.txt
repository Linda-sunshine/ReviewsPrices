review/summary: One of my Best.......review/text: I have approximately 25 watches. I have very good watches that are expensive and I have some that are just "fashion watches".......This particular Invicta Pro Diver is one of the watches I first bought. Even though it is not a highh priced watch it is one of the watches I am most pleased with for several reasons.1. It is inexpensive2. It is well made.3. This Japanese automatic movement is a proven movement that is very accurate. I know this particular movement is well thought of for the price point.I may have been just lucky but this movement is one of the most accurate movements I have and I have some watches with some expensive and well thought of movements.4. The design is the common "rolex type" of copy that goes with anything you wear.5. I use this watch as a "daily driver" kind of watch and it gets alot of wear.I would recomend this watch to anyone.
