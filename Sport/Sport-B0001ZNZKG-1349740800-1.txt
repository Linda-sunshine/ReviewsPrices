review/summary: ExOfficio Men's Give-N-Go Boxer Briefreview/text: These boxers briefs are awesome! I wore them while climbing mount stuart, which ended up taking almost 17 hours of hiking time, and I had no problems at all. They wick the sweat right off of you and they are extremely comfortable. I even wear them to the gym. I highly recommend these to anyone who enjoys physical activities.
