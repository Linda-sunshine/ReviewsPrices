review/summary: Two in One Productreview/text: What a great idea. I have used this combination everyday since i purchased it.I bought two more one for my son and daughter-in-law and a spare for me. This combination has so many different ways to use with the lid doubling as a skillet.The long handles are marvelous for my arthritic hands to grip and hold on to.Thank you Lodge for this product.Would like to see more combinations with longer handles for us that have a difficult time grapping and holding on to things in our later years.
