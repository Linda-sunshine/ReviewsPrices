review/summary: Amazing bow, terrible arrowsreview/text: I ordered this set for my 11 year old daughter and she loved it! The only problem was the arrows. The metal tips were being punched in, the orange quiver hold at the top completely fell off, and finally the entire arrow cracked apart. I would definitely recommend this set if you are willing to keep buying more arrows!
