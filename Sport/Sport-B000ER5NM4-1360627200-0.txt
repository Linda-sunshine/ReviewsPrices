review/summary: Very Comfortable Pantsreview/text: These pants are wonderful. I purchased them for my tap dance class. Very comfortable even for someone who wears 12 in pants. I purchased a large, because I'm quite curvy. They fit very well, they move very well with my body type. Just perfect for my 5&#34;6 height. I highly recommend them.
