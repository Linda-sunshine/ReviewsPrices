review/summary: It measures your heart rate.review/text: A number of people have complained about it not working without some type of gel, but my wife and I have not had that problem. If you wet the strap before you put it on, it works fine. If my wife and I are both wearing them near each other they interfere with each other, i.e. she gets my heart rate.
