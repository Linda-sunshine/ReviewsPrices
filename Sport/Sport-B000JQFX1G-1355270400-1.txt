review/summary: Crown and stem pulled out after two daysreview/text: I was really looking forward to this watch too. The crown and stem pulled out after only two days. I did return it to Amazon and their return policy is flawless. I exchanged the 8926OB for a titanium Invicata model 0420. It came today and so far the crown and stem is intact. The 0420 is much lighter and quite a bit larger than the 8926OB.I'm pretty hard on watches and have read here that the 0420's band is scratch prone. That is not a deal killer for me as my 7 year old Bulova automatic is scratched and dinged.
