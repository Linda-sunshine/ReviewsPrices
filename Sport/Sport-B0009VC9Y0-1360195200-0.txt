review/summary: awesome knifereview/text: a friend of mine gave me one for my birthday and i loved it. it's a smooth operator and you can't beat the price. unfortunately i lost mine and had to buy another one. the lost one turned up with a broken locking mechanism so i wrote kershaw and they sent me the replacement parts right away.
