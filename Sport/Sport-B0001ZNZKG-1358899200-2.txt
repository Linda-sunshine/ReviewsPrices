review/summary: Quite Uncomfortablereview/text: I don't find the boxer briefs particularly comfortable. The angled seams are irritating. I can't speak to the usual, &#34;you can wear them for an extended period&#34;, portion of other reviews as I find them so uncomfortable that I can't keep them on for longer than 30 minutes. The build quality it good, I don't find the material particulary soft and comfortable either. The fit is good as well.I won't take them down below 3 stars as each body is different.
