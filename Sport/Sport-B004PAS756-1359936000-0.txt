review/summary: A good intro to Insanityreview/text: I had been debating purchasing the complete Insanity set but before shelling out the $$$$, I decided instead to get this DVD first. I've been seriously exercising for more than 3 years now and have progressed enough to feel I needed a real challenge to maintain my level. This is a good choice for time-crunched days, or if you're feeling really hardcore, to combine it with another routine like weights or for before or after a short-distance run. The disclaimer at the beginning is accurate: DO NOT ATTEMPT this if you are a novice. Some of these moves are hard on the back/knees and I had to substitute a couple of them. I'm not sure I'm ready for Insanity but I'm glad I got this.
