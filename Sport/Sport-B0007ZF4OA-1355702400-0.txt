review/summary: Great for kids, WITH CAREreview/text: I would never give these unsupervised to a young child. That said, these have proven a real boon for our semi-cold Northwest days. They make it possible for us to extend the outdoor play season without constantly acting like we're in the arctic. Little hands get cold fast. These work great in pockets, giving immediate comfort to cold little hands who just couldn't resist money bars at 45 degrees.I also use these myself for ski days, if the temps get low. Most days they remain unopened in my pack, but when you ice over on the lift, they can really help keep fingers and even toes comfortable.
