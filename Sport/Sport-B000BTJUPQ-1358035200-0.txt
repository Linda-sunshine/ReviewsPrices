review/summary: No Regretsreview/text: My 10-year-old daughter tried archery with a supervised group and loved it. Checked around & read reviews on many bows. Price ranges were incredible. This archery set has been perfect. She loves it. Even her father, myself, and her grown siblings have had fun with this thing. It's a nice set and the price was fantastic. We opted to purchase additional arrows from a local sport store. Two is not enough.
