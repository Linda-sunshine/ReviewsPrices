review/summary: Maybe just a bad one?review/text: We purchased this water bottle for our 5 year old daughter to take back and forth to school. The first day, the plastic around the nozzle cracked and leaked. My husband was able to glue it back together and it works fine, but not sure for how long. Would expect a Polar product to have better quality than that.
