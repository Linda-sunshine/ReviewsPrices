review/summary: You'll get value for your money!review/text: This timepiece is very good looking, and even though I've just been owner of it a few weeks, it has been object for a lot attention and comments already. It keeps time (It takes 3-4 seconds a day) pretty well and fits good for small wrists. My only complains is regarding the relatively loud sound of the second hand. This is not a problem and you won't notice that if you aren't listening for it.Great value for a affordable price!
