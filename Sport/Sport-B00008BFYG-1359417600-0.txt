review/summary: Love itreview/text: My daughter loves this scooter. this is one of her christmas gifts. She's 7 years old and handles it well. It's very sturdy and the prie was unbelievable after the shipping and the handling. Only thing that I would say was difficult is whne you try and unfold it. the clasp sort of sticks.
