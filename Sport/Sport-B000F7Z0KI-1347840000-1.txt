review/summary: Great water bottlereview/text: Purchased this bottle as I was embarking on a trip that involved a lot of hiking (not for biking). It's high capacity, and has a wide mouth so that you can load it with ice cubes. Kept very cold for ~4 hours in 85 degree weather. The valve is removable which makes it a breeze to wash. Very well constructed and made in the USA. Highly recommended.
