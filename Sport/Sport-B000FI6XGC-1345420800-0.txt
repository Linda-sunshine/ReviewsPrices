review/summary: It works for regular valves (motorcycle, car, bike valves)review/text: 5 minutes ago I was about to give this pump 1 start and throw it away in the trash bin. If your bicycle valve type is the same as a car's or a motorcycle's, (a "shrade" valve: [...] ) - all you have to do is unscrew the front, take out the parts inside, flip both of them, put them back in and screw the cap back on. There's a youtube video by Topeak on how to do this, titled: "Topeak - How to change internal pump head parts (updated)"Link: [...]The pump works perfectly, it's made of very high quality parts and it only takes minimal effort to pump your bike tires back up. Tip: when inserting the pump into the valve, do it gently, wiggle a bit, but with a bit of force at the same time. After you pump, remove the pump back out, gently and wiggle a bit. It took me 30 seconds of practice and common sense. Overall, I love this pump, it's small, just under 9"and super lightweight. Everyone that owns a bike should own this pump. 5 star product.
