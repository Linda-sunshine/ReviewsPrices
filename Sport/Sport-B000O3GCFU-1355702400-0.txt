review/summary: Love it!review/text: I love this thermos. Great size, spill proof, keeps things warm for the time it says. Only issue I had to work out was filling it too full (my fault) then putting the lid on. You need to leave a little room or it will overflow when you screw the lid on. Not a flaw, just something I needed to adjust to. I'll be getting more.
