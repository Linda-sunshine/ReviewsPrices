review/summary: Perfect giftreview/text: I was so excited when my 14 year old little sister asked for a swiss army knife for christmas that I knew I needed to get the perfect one. After going over the different options I decided that although this knife has a few extra features that she will never use it has everything I would require from a do everything knife.She was excitedly discovering hidden tools all night after we exchanged gifts at midnight. Couldn't have asked for a better reaction.
