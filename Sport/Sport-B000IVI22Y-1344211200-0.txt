review/summary: I lovED this water bottle...review/text: I absolutely loved this water bottle. It was an awesome color, and it held enough water so that when I was in my spin class I still had some left over by the end. The bite valve was a nice feature especially in the gym> I especially loved that I could throw this in my purse and it wouldn't spill (it is a little big, but it is nice none the less) HOWEVER I have been using the bottle without the bite valve for at least two months with no problem, then all of a sudden water just starts leaking out of the top of the straw (it would only come out when the straw was out, not bent into the lid). Just a few minutes ago (which inspired me to write this review out of frustration) I opened the straw up and water gushed out like old faithful, all over my lap and down my dress. Needless to say I am not a happy camper about it right now.I am hoping that it has something to do with the weather being quite warm and the bottle being moved from my warm car to inside and air conditioned building that has my bottle all leaky (and the pressure in and outside the bottle at dis-equilibrium). Maybe I need to put the bite valve back on..? I am not sure. Tonight I am putting the bite valve back to see if that helps. In the meantime this bottle only gets 3 stars from me.
