review/summary: Great price but a little slipperyreview/text: Perfect yoga mat for someone on a budget. Works well and is a little longer than average so a lot of room to spread out. My house is all tile and I can barely tell when I use this mat.It can get a little slippery during yoga class, so you may want to buy a towel along with the mat, which may negate the savings.
