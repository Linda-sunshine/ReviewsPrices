review/summary: Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirrorreview/text: Installed without a hitch on my homebuilt recumbent. The allen wrench required for installation is included, along with more than adequate instructions. The two cap screws "are an extremely tight fit when screwed into the brass inserts", but the instructions also tell you to "don't worry about breaking any of the parts". It's designed with two hinge points so you can point the mirror at virtually any angle you need. Highly recommended; its' #1 sales ranking @ amazon is justified.
