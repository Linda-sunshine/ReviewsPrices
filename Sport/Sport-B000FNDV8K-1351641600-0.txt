review/summary: Excellent!review/text: First of all, great price. This is the classic small Swiss Army knife, only 2 1/4 inches long, but comes with the most basic tools you need: a knife, scissors, file, tweezers and pick. The best thing about it is it's small and not bulky. You can keep it in your car or office for small emergencies. Both the knife and the scissors are sharp. This is a very well made knife, high quality everything, and a keeper.
