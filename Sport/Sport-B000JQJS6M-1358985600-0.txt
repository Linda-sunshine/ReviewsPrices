review/summary: You get what you pay forreview/text: As my father always said, if something seems too good to be true; it probably is.At first glance, this watch looks great. When I took it out of the box I was very happy with my $90 purchase. However, this did not last long. As with most watches of this type, the band is huge - if you have even a normal size wrist you will need to get it sized. No problem, I expected that - in fact I always do it myself as the process is relatively simple. Not with this watch. Everything is unbelievably tight and jammed on this watch. After a few hours (I even cut myself on the sharp bezel) I was able to remove the appropriate number of bands. The next problem came when I tried to set the time and date. The crown (gold nub on the right-hand side) was just as jammed as the pins on the band. I consider myself to be a strong, in-shape man and I could not pull it out of its original position. After about 30 minutes of frustration, I got a pair of pliers and tried maneuvering the crown with those. I still couldn't get the crown until I yanked on the pliers with all my strength and the entire crown and pin came flying out of the watch. Somehow I was able to get it back in the watch and after much prayer and a little bit of luck I could set the time. After all of this, I examined the watch some more and was very unhappy to find that the &#34;gold&#34; links on the band were already fading. Its such a shame, I had incredibly high hopes for this watch. I haven't contacted customer service yet, but from the other reviews it looks like I'm going to run into problems there too. My advice: think very carefully before buying this watch and consider spending some more money to invest in something a little nicer.Pros:Looks great initiallyPriceNo battery neededCons:Questionable qualityEverything is jammedGold plating fades very quickly
