review/summary: Prepper gear must havereview/text: These mylar blankets are extremely handy... and if you have an emergency pack or are a prepper, then you must have this.They are small and compact. Think of a mylar baloon... That is the thickness of this blanket and it has virtually no weight. It can be used as a blanket to retain heat, a shelter from the weather (rain, wind, cold), a fire backstop to reflect the fire back to you... As a prepper, this could be used to cover a table in case you need something clean to use for a wounded person. It could also be used as a signal device if you were lost while hiking. Yes there are many more uses... but if you don't have one... get it!!!
