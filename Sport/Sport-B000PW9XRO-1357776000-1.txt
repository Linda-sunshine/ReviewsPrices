review/summary: Good fit but not very breathablereview/text: You can't really feel what your are touching as well as leather translate or fabric. If you are OK with vinyl then it should be ok for you. Compared to my 5.11 gloves it didn't breath as well or translate touch sensation due to the vinyl. hands got all clammy inside. Gripped well though.
