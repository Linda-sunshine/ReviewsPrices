review/summary: Basic basketball shortsreview/text: I got these for going to the gym. The price is great, and the shorts are pretty good. The only issue I've had is that the pockets are not very cooperative. They tend to flip inside out (if they are empty). If you have a phone/ipod/something with a little weight to it in the pocket it will not flip out.
