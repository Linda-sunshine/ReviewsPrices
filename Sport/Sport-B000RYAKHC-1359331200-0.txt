review/summary: Works well.review/text: Really love this. It works well on my bike. I mounted it below and snug up against the reflector so it has to be removed with a tool. If not you can just easily unhook and take it with you or clip on clothing. Mounting directly below an obstacle reduces theft and I don't have to think about it.
