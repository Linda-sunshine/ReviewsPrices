review/summary: Every step of the wayreview/text: I'm very happy with my little pedometer. It has a lot of functions to make it very accurate, however that affects how user friendly it is. If you're good about reading the instructions you'll be fine. A great way to take positive action for managing your health. With a goal of 10,000 steps this little gem keeps you on track. My only complaint is that the clip is not as secure as I would like. Fortunately I also bought it a little leash LOL and so it has not gotten lost.
