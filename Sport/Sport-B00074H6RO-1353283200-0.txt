review/summary: Good for price, but a bit small.review/text: These are quality tough gloves. They don't have much padding, but are very sturdy. They are really tight right now and I don't have big hands, but I know they will loosen up as I break them in. This is (at least) my 3rd pair of Harbinger gloves over the years and I'm a big fan.
