review/summary: Patches! We don't need no stinking patches!review/text: Okay, I'll admit that there is still certainly a place for the ever-useful cleaning patch, but the bore snake is a huge time saver without sacrificing the quality of cleaning. In fact, it seems to me that the bore snake gets the bore cleaner than multiple patches ever did. These snakes are super easy to use, and provide the tightness and lots of surface to really scrub the bore clean. What's more, for rifles that don't allow access to the breech for a long cleaning rod - you can now properly clean them in the right direction (breech to muzzle). And, the snake is washable for a long life of continued use.
