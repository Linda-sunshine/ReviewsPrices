review/summary: High Quality, Portable, Affordablereview/text: Length:: 1:19 Mins&lt;Updated with the video from Topeak on Youtube>[...]My old pump hose is broken. I decided to buy a new one instead of fixing it.I bought this one since it is the most popular and highly rated pump. As other people said in their reviews, I am happy with my purchase.Pros: High quality, Very small, inexpensive.Cons: Need little exercise to pump a flat tire (but it is very easy to use).The tip comes with the presta setting. I have to change it to schrader setting which I was not prepared for. It took me a while to find one of the review discuss how to make the switch.1. Unscrew the grey rubber ring2. Press the locking lever to push out the black rubber3. Take out the black rubber thing. It has two parts connected together.4. Pull them apart and reconnect them with the old open ends.5. Make sure you can see sharp tip from one end.6. Put the assembly back with the other end in first.7. Screw back the grey rubber ring. You should be able to see the sharp tip through the hole.8. Now you can pump the air through the Schrader tip. (unlike some other review says, the locking lever actually works in the Schrader setting)
