review/summary: They are OKreview/text: Sizing: I'm 6'3, 220, 37 waist. The large seems to be too big. They are little loose like boxers, especially in the crotch. For $18, I would not go this route again. Hanes sport boxer briefs at the store are about $3 cheaper and fit a whole lot better. These exofficios also ride up the leg with general wear.Drying: I did try out the speedy wash/dry. Yes, they dry quickly. This is a bonus; however, I have not compared this to other makes with the same general material. Is it really that special? I don't know, maybe I am missing something. But these boxer briefs don't seem to be worth the money I paid.
