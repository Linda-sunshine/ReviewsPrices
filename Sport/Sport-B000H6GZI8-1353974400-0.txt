review/summary: What a difference a rubber grip makes!review/text: Was a little skeptical about this but it had received glowing reviews from others and was relatively inexpensive so decided to take a chance. What a difference this little rubber grip makes. Never would have believed it. My grip is much more secure now, but I can still feel some padding without a lot of extra bulk. Does not really change my concealed carry profile.Con: It was a little difficult to get on. The rubber does not stretch as much as I expected and it took some effort to get it to start to slide over the butt of the gun. Once started, I was able to ease it up a little bit at a time. You just have to be patient and keep working at it until you get it to go on. The brochure suggested heating it with a hair dryer first. I was reluctant to do that for fear of damaging it, but that might have helped. Once in place, the heavy elasticity of this grip keeps it firmly in place, making the installation labor worthwhile.I would highly recommend this for any small frame handgun for which it is designed. Unless you are obsessed with appearance, you will never regret this purchase.
