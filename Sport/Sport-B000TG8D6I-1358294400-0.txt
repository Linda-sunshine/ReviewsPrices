review/summary: Yea P90Xreview/text: Okay this is a really fun program. All the tapes start with a really good warm up,(very important) and end with a cool down. Tony and his students do such a great job to encourage you to do your best, push hard, but never too hard and work at a level that you are comfortable with. They DO NOT yell and scream to motivate you like some other programs do. You will be completely amazed at the progress you will make if you stick with it. Different tape for each day of the week keeps it interesting. And the exercises are made fun because they are not the same old boring sit-ups, etc. .No really. Try it.
