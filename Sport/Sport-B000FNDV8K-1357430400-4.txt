review/summary: Petite version.review/text: A lot smaller than I expected but still very nice. I wish I could give it "3.5 stars" or an "almost 4 star" because I like the shine and quality of the metal. However, I was expecting something more hand fitting. It feels awkward closing it, probably due to the size; I ended up nicking myself trying to close the small knife, but in honesty, I'm not used to pocket knives in general. On the plus side, it was very sharp.
