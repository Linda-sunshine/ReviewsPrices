review/summary: not very all weatherreview/text: had been looking for a pair of shooting gloves for duty use but as it turns out the description for &#34;all weather&#34; doesn't exactly cover &#34;cold&#34; weather which was even more dissapointing when learned they're from Safariland, they are comfortable however and even cool nights not bad
