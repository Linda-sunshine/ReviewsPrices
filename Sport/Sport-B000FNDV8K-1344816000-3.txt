review/summary: Love the knife butreview/text: I purchase a Swiss army knife almost every 6 months and not because of the quality of the blades but the handle always cracks or falls off. I don't know why they can't make the plastic sides more sturdy. I have a box full of SAK with great blades but broken or cracked handles. I also think the scissors are flimsy except maybe for cutting paper. I recently tried a different brand and bought a Leatherman style cs and so far am very impressed. First of all the knife is made in the USA! Hurrah I finally found something made here. It also is stainless steel with no plastic sides to break. The scissors seem sturdy. It is a little heavier than my SAK which I am not crazy about since I carry it on my key chain but the knife is good and the file and screwdriver is good. Tweezers? Have not used yet.hopefully SAK will make the plastic sides more sturdy because the knife is a great value but for now the Leatherman is great.
