review/summary: Getting results!review/text: I am on day 15 of p90x program. It seems to be working already!!! I've lost inches and a few pounds. Some days are 1 hour workouts and others are 1 1/2 hour workouts. I feel more flexible and definitely more energized. I would recommend it to beginners. I do adapt some of the moves for my health conditions. My knees don't like the jumping jacks so I jog. You don't have to be very coordinated and I like the fact that the intervals are quick! I don't get bored, that's for sure.
