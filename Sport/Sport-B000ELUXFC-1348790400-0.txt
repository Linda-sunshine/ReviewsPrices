review/summary: Sturdy rack! Does the job right!review/text: I bought this unit to transport my bike to trails and to the toe path and bike paths. It works just fine! It doesn't scratch the car, it's got plenty of padding so it doesn't bounce all around. The tie downs are nice and tight, they have not come loose while transporting. Really, if you are looking for a good quality, well built reliable unit that doesn't scratch your car or bike. Look no further- this is a good unit!
