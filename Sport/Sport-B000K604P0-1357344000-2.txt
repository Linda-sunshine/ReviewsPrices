review/summary: The best insulating travel mug ever!!!review/text: I have put thus to the test. It is perfect. Traveling in my car to drop friends at airports early in the am I was astonished to see that my coffee was nit only still warm after 3 hours but HOT. And stayed warm for another couple hours...i drink slowly.I highly reccommend this for folks who want their drinks to stay legitimately hot for hours. Haven't trued it for cold drinks but venture to guess the same would hold true.
