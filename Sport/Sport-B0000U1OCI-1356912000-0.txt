review/summary: Pedometerreview/text: My first pedometer; and I intend on having this as my one and only brand. I really like this device because it is useful and handy. It would fit snugly in my pocket for easy access.The minute you get a hold of this tool, you would immediately notice that it is of high quality. The best feature that I find useful is the progress chart. You would know what you have done for the past 7 days; this is of great help because you would know which routines take up most of the work and what are the ones that needs work on.I find using a pedometer very helpful for tracking my activity level with my weight loss progress. I suggest it for anyone trying to lose weight.
