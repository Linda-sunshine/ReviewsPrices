review/summary: Good enoughreview/text: Bought the Swiss knife imagining it to be 4-5 inches long and an inch wide. Was a bit disappointed that it was actually 2 inches in length and 1/2 inch wide. Every tool in the knife worked as I expected. Could have given it a 5 star if not for the miniscule size.
