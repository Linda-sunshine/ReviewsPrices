review/summary: Can't go wrong with iron potsreview/text: Maybe cast iron isn't all the same.My original ones don't have a mfr name.Just a no. Stating the size.I bought this Lodge set as it was so versatile. And the second handle on them made moving it easier than the old ones I had with just one.These are what nostalgic cooking is all about.Homemade cornbread baked in an iron pan.Warm apple strudel, or a pot of hot oatmeal on a cold winter morning.Eggs and bacon and some pancakes on the side. A hint of the past.And if someone interrupts breakfast, be careful of the pan upside the head.Cooking meat that requires searing before baking, The cast iron cookware can go from stove top to oven. From oven to stove and even to center of table.But take caution, the pot will be oven temp HOT, a cloth wrapped around pot for table side serving would be warranted.No need to change pots.This is the best for those one pot cooking recipes.Versatile and easy to clean.One of those items, the longer it's used, the better it becomes.I had one that rusted. An overnight soak. Steel wool, some scrubbing, re- seasoning.Black as coal, rust gone, good as new.No more ruined scorched pans.Rinse with warm water and natural fiber sponge when iron is warm to touch, wipe dry.Re-season if detergent is used. Pot is best if left somewhat oily to touch. It isn't meant to be totally rid of oil.If it builds up too much, heat till warm rinse, steel wool to remove rust or grit.Reseason as needed.Find out how. Google, ehow,Or- a coating of a good vegetable oil. Heated in 300 degree oven, 1 hour. Allow to cool, wipe out.This is what keeps it naturally "non-stick"
