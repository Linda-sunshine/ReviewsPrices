review/summary: Unbeatablereview/text: I wasn't exactly set on the color that I wanted to order for the Invicta Pro Diver series but after reading some reviews I was set on buying the Pro Diver. I searched for pictures of all the color tones and I decided on the 8268 OB mainly because of the Old Bezel. I am so happy I did so! This watch looks amazing in person; it looks just like a submariner. I have worn a blue and gold submariner and this watch looks and feels just like it. The only "complaints" that I have about it is that the crown seems a bit flimsy when adjusting the time; I don't know if its just me or if it is really flimsy. Besides that It is perfect and especially for only $90 with tax. Lastly, the picture shows little marks around the bezel unlike the Submariner which only has marks from the 0-15. The watch I received is just like the submariner in that respect so I am really happy about that. I just realized too that it is a 24 jewel movement with a winding and hacking system. For the price this watch is unbeatable.
