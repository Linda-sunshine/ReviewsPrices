review/summary: Good for the pricereview/text: I bought this because it was one of the only ones that I could find that ould fit me. I'm kinda big guy and have a treadmill at home that doesn't monitor my heartrate and this one did the job right outa the box. It's basic and all I needed I would buy again.
