review/summary: Broken on Arrivalreview/text: I read a few other reviews that said that the helmet fell apart when they took it out of the box. I ignored these and thought they must be flukes. However, mine also fell apart as soon as it was taken out of the box. I certainly do not trust a helmet that can't even protect itself being shipped in a air-packet-padded box!
