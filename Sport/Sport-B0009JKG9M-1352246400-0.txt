review/summary: I'll use these forever!review/text: I purchased the Lodge Combo Cooker for my Max Burton Induction Cooktop. It is so great for soups, stews and so much more! The lid is also a handy pan to have, as well. Cast iron lasts forever with the proper care. Yes, they are a bit heavy, but sturdy. I'm very happy with my purchase.
