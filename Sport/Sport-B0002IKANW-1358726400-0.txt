review/summary: Good Snap Capsreview/text: I like these better than other snap caps I have tried in the past. The rubber on the back makes me feel better about dry firing my guns with the added protection.I am able to load these into the magazine and cycle them through my 9mm without any problems. These are great for familiarizing yourself with your gun, and I have gotten my girlfriend used to handling the gun as well. Great training and practice tool.
