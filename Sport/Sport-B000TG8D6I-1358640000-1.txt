review/summary: Not for beginners or out of shape folks -more for moderately fit peoplereview/text: Just a little advice/warning for those interested in P90X.The P90X commericals give the impression that anyone can do this workout program. They show success stories of formerly overweight and flabby people looking ripped and tone, and saying "if I can do it, you can do it." But AFTER you buy P90X and read the material that's included, there's a disclaimer that this program is NOT for the beginner but for people that are already moderately fit. There's even a section in the fitness guide that gives a "fitness test" to see if P90X is for you. The material also warns that this training program is not recommended for people with any knee, hip, and back problems. Too bad they don't inform you of all this in the commerical before you purchase it.The workouts are indeed tough and intense, so if you are totally out of shape or on the overweight side, you will have trouble with the exercises. This may be why the message board from BeachBody.com is filled with users who are suffering from injuries and seeking advice with their painful struggles.If you're out of shape, overweight, a beginner, or suffer from knee or back problems and you're enticed by the P90X commericals, THEY recommend to do "Power 90" or "Tony Horton's 10 Minute Trainer" DVDS first. These workout DVDs should better prepare you for P90X. Something to think about before taking the plunge into P90X.
