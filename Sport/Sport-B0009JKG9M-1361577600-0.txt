review/summary: My everyday skillet/panreview/text: You aren't really cooking if you don't have any cast-iron stuff, and this is as good as it gets. Pre-seasoned, and ready to get down right out of the box. The versatility of this combo is what is great. You can do mostly anything with it. The most used pan in my kitchen!
