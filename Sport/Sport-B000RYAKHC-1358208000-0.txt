review/summary: Great Product!review/text: Good LED taillight. Long battery life using ordinary alkaline batteries. If you want something super bright and visible, you can do better BUT NOT for this price. I recommend. If you're really worried about being seen on the road, I recommend adding a triangular road hazard flashing light. Similar to this http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B004Z6QME8/ref=dp_image_text_0?ie=UTF8&n;=15684181&s;=automotiveI just happend to have one with LED lights from a spare roadside kit. I attached it to the my rear basket using zip ties.
