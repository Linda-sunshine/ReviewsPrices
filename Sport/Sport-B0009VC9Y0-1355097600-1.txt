review/summary: awesome knife :)review/text: this is one of the nicest knives on the market . the speed safe makes it very quick (switchblade quick) . quality of craftsmanship is bar none . these are almost comparable to a custom built knike costing hundreds of dollars . one if not the most favorite knife I have ever owned :)
