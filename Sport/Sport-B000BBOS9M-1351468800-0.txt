review/summary: 5 months of comfortreview/text: I traveled South East Asia for 5 months, and I'd say this is one of my top 5 pre-trip purchases. I loved this pillow, and I used it constantly! It was great on airplanes, bus rides, and trains; it was perfect in hostels with only one pillow or no pillow (or scary pillows); it rolled up tight and hung on my pack from it's drawstring; it stayed clean(repelled water/liquids and dusted off quite easily); it washed and dried well. On more than a few occasions, people were jealous that I had one and they didn't, lol.
