review/summary: Nothing stellarreview/text: The fabric is a bit rough for my skin and my liking, i was expecting it to be moreless a silkier feel of polyester but its not very much a silky feel, they catch easily on things and even worse the waistbad on these runs tight. RETURNED.These might be good if your not sensitive to the way stuff feels and you know how to order them. I returned them because I had no need for an exchange and my rehab therapist canceled my exercise program on me.
