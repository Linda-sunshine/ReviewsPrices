review/summary: Light fell off while ridingreview/text: I have a trek 1.5 and I mounted mine under the seat post. It was a tight fit, apparently my seat post is almost too thick for this light- it was a little hard to get on, but it worked.1 week later while riding a normal ride, I noticed the light wasn't staying in place- it kept lowering and pointing downward. I had to lift it up multiple tmes while riding and keep checking on it. Next thing I know, the light is gone
