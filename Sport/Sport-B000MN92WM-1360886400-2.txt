review/summary: Best Pedometer Ever!review/text: I love this pedometer! I wear it everyday and it's awesome. Fits in my pocket, it has a belt clip too, and lets me know my progress as the day goes on. Love that it also counts aerobic steps as well! Download the software and see the graph of your achievements! Just awesome!! Easy to use and set up! I recommend this item 110%!
