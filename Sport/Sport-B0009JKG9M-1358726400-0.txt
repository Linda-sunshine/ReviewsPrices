review/summary: Love this set!review/text: I purchased this with the 8-inch skillet. I use the lid part a lot to stair fry and to grill. I cooked fish, veggies, burgers, pancake, and more, all turned delicious! For the first use, the food got stuck on the surface, but after that, I haven't had any problem. If you find the food stuck, let the pan cool down a little, then slowly scrape it off. It works for me.My favorite food was fried potatoes. Wash well and cut potatoes with skin on, cook slow with a plenty of oil (but not deep frying amount), season with salt, pepper, and any desired dried herbs... yummy... a big difference compared to frozen french fries!I was scared of using cast iron pans coz I have a glass stove top. So far, I have no problem with a caution. I usually like to shake the skillet when I stair fry, but cast iron pans are too heavy to do so in anyways... This is why I omitted one star &#9734;.
