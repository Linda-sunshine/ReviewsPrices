review/summary: Love it!review/text: Bright, durable, smartly made, is easy to take with you and reattach on the bike as needed. As others have stated the attachment circle comes with a piece of plastic so as to be able to accommodate different widths, so it should fit most frames. The light is bright enough to be seen by any passing cars even in complete dark. And so far (several months) the battery is still going (use site for daily commute to work, with at least one of the trips being in the dark). Would definitely buy again
