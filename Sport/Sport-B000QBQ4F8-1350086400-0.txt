review/summary: REAL!review/text: I only paid around $90-$100 for these, and I know for a fact in-stores they are well over $150. They are genuine, so don't worry about them being fake. My friend purchased a pair from Sunglasses Hut and I compared mine to hers and there is not one difference between the two. AWESOME sunglasses. I love the 54mm lenses, as well.
