review/summary: Good value for productreview/text: I wanted a bike carrier that was an occasional piece - not something to live on my car permanently - and this has suited the bill. It takes a bit of work to get it all strapped on every time, but considering the price and the frequency with which I use it, I am quite pleased with the rack and would recommend it.
