review/summary: Excellent Knifereview/text: What I can say about it ? It's small, easy to deploy and sharp as hell... Let me repeat last point - It's SHARP. I mean it - be very,very carefulI bought it on sale (ballpark of lower forty dollars) and used some of amex points so my total was about under twenty. At this price it's unbeatable, but honestly - at it's full msrp price - it's a highway robbery
