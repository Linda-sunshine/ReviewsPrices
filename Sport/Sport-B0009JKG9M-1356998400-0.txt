review/summary: useful and sturdyreview/text: I used this pot to make stew with the lid on. Unfortunately, the lid started showing rust by the end of the slow cooking process due to the condensation build-up and I had to reseason it. I think the problem was the application and not this very handy unit. It may just need another layer of seasoning or used in dryer applications.
