review/summary: Good off duty holsterreview/text: While I prefer the retention of my duty holster (a Safariland level 3 holster), this one is nice as an off duty/concealment holster. When you reholster your firearm there's a nice audible click to be heard and you can feel it clicking as you grip the gun. There's no way to get the gun out without pressing the button, and if you're pulling the gun up you can't press the button to release the gun, nice if you're struggling with someone who's trying to take your gun.The belt loop is nice because it holds the firearm close to your body, and makes it easily concealed with a T shirt or a jacket, I haven't tried the paddle attachment yet. Drawing the firearm is effortless, though it may take a while if you're used to a thumb break (like my duty holster), but it's nice because it puts your index finger along the slide which is where it should be at all times until you're on target. Overall a good quality holster, my preferred method of carry daily, unless I'm going somewhere that I need deep concealment.
