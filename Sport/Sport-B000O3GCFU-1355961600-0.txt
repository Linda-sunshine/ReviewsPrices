review/summary: Seems to work wellreview/text: I preheated the thermos with boiling water, filled with piping hot soup. At lunchtime my kindergartener reported it was &#34;just right&#34;, which probably means too cool for me, but works well for a child. Just be sure to overheat the food in the morning so it's still warm at lunch time, and don't buy this for an adult who prefers their food super hot.
