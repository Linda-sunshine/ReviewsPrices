review/summary: Gets you in shape thats for sure.review/text: The first few weeks suck, but you will notice that each week you are definitely better than the last. I wasn't really 'out of shape' per se, but I wanted to get cut, and a lot of definition not to mention being able to do more pull-ups, push-ups, ect..
