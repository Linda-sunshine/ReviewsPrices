review/summary: needs one change; otherwise an above average productreview/text: The pedometer does what it represents. It is generally accurate in its step recording. My only complaint is that the part of the clip for the belt is exactly one inch. All my belts are one inch and an 1/8 or 1/4. This meas that when you sit down it often falls off your belt and can be lost. I suggest that the holder portion that fits over the belt be one inch and a half and that way 80% of belts are secured.
