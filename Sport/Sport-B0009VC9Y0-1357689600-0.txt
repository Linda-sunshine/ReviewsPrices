review/summary: One hand opening and razor sharp!review/text: This is a great knife. Nice size for everyday carry. Fits in a pocket with the clip very well. Easy one hand opening. This is my second (Lost 1st) Kershaw with the speed safe assisted opening. Great system! Open with the thumb stud or the finger lever easily and locks open every time. Came to me RAZOR sharp! Knife has a saftey latch but has never opened in my pocket with the saftey off.
