review/summary: Perfect for the Small Caliber Shooterreview/text: What you may not know about 22 rimfire firearms is that they really don't need a deep cleaning. The rod-type cleaning tools tend to make you over-clean the barrel which can negatively impact accuracy.Having said that, this tool is absolutely great. I just run it through my revolver or my bolt-action with a bit of solvent after each shooting session. Just run it through once and you're done. The product is so simple and so effective, there's not much more to say!
