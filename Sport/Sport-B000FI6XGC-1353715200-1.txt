review/summary: Pumps Air Fast, Sturdy & Stylish! Choose This!review/text: Pumps air fast, sturdy body, stylish. overall, you have to choose this product if you're looking for a handheld air pump, choose this.I only rated it a 4/5 because:1. there's no instructions on how to use the pump but the small pictures. just pictures, no instructions on how to dismantle and reposition the small parts, even with the pictures it took me a minute to figure out how to dismantle, reposition and finally use the air pump2. you wouldn't know that you need a hex wrench to remove the air pump's strap to the packaging until you finally get the productand i so happen to be one of those bikers who lost his hex wrench set, now i'm left with an bike air pump starp stuck to the packaging
