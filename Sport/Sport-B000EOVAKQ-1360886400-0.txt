review/summary: pluses and a minusreview/text: As others have written, these goggles are comfortable and are easily adjustable, but I have found that one has to work with them (when one first puts them on) to make sure that water doesn't flood the eye space. I have taken to putting them on, ducking under the surface of the water, and shaking my head to be sure that the &#34;seal&#34; is secure, with no water leakage. It can take several such &#34;dunkings&#34; to blend comfort with a secure seal, and in this sense the goggles are perhaps a bit more high maintenance than I'd like. Still, once a good seal is made, the Aqua Sphere Kaiman googles prove a comfortable set of goggles to wear (my former ones actually used to make me nauseous from the pressure exerted on my eyes...not fun when one is swimming one's mile's worth of lengths).
