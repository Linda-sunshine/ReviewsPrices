review/summary: Ball too smallreview/text: I like the idea of this chair. I purchased it to use at work while pregnant because HR did not like me just sitting on a regular ball with no support, liability issue. However, the ball that comes with the chair was too small and I had to purchase another one in order to be able to reach my desk.
