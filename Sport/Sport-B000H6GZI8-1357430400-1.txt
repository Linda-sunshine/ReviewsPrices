review/summary: Great addition to a compact gunreview/text: Made my Khar pm9 feel allot better in my hand and more comfortable to shoot. Adds a small amount of width to the frame which gives me a better grip but in no way hinders conceal ability. And the soft ruber makes shooting easier on the hands than the rough polymer frame this gun has. Shoot many rounds through a subcompact 9mm and you will like it to. Easy to install, just a little long for the pm9, had to trim maybe an eight inch off. Easy enough to do with a razor after intalling on gun. If you have a subcompact do yourself a favor and get one. Shipping was supper fast, had it in the mail two days after ordering.
