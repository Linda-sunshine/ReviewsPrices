review/summary: Great chairreview/text: I have a scoliosis, bulging discs in the neck and sciatica pain that forced me to look into buying my own chair at work. Looked at several mesh chairs but they were all very expensive. When I saw that ball chair on sale for $70 on gaiam site, I thought "nothing much to lose" since I can always use the ball on it's own if nothing else. Well, it turned out to be a great choice, as my pain overall has significantly been reduced after just 1 week. I'm 5'5 and the height is fine for me, but it does hurt my butt somewhat about a couple of hours, so I make sure to walk around often and sometimes go back to my "normal" chair if I need a break. I think it also has to do with the fact that I'm pretty skinny, hence less cushioning in that area :) I think it's worth a try!
