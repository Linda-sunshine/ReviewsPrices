review/summary: Great water bottlesreview/text: We own four of this size. I use them around the house, in the car, and out and about. Two my wife got are colored. We abuse it and run it in the dishwasher, so the color is wearing off, but otherwise are fine. Mine are plain stainless, which is what I'd recommend. They get some scratches and dents, but overall very durable. We have two each and just toss one in the dishwasher when he run it and use the other.I was particularly interested in stainless because it's non-reactive, durable, and easy to clean. No worries running it in the dishwasher w/ sanitize cycle. The lids have what seem to be a silicone ring and they don't leak.The mouth is wide and rolled for easy drinking. It's also wide enough to easily add ice. The sports top is handy for traveling and not spilling, although it makes a weird noise when sucking on it as air goes through the relief valve. It's like some weird little animal noise.I also own two of the large 40 oz bottles for my desk at work. Also we got some of the smaller ones for the kids. So, yeah, we're fans of Klean Kanteen.
