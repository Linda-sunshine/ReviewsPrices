review/summary: Replaced a stolen Invicta Men's Watchreview/text: My husband had a watch identical to this one stolen that I had given to him as a present a couple of years ago. This is our second purchase of this watch and he loves it. We ordered the replacement after it was stolen, found a problem with the watch and returned it to Amazon, who made it good immediately and replaced the watch in time for his birthday (since it was a birthday replacement gift). Now he has it on and loves it. Thank you Amazon.com and thank you Invicta for such a lovely watch. I am sure the thief thought he had taken a Rolex because the watch is so much like a more expensive watch by Rolex. Fortunately for us we were able to replace it.Thank you again.
