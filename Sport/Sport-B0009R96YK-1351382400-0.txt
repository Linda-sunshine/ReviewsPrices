review/summary: Broke almost immediatelyreview/text: It looks nice, was pretty easy to install - it was very hard to screw the bolts in, and it felt like the plastic would break, but the instructions said "Don't worry that it may break", so I went ahead. It was easy to adjust, and worked great the first couple of times I rode my bike. But then I leaned my bike up against a wall and the mirror tapped against the wall - not even a very hard tap, certainly something that would be impossible to avoid - and the plastic housing snapped into three pieces. The plastic is much too brittle for this use.
