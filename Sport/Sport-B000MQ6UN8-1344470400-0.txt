review/summary: the italian made glasses are great - long waitreview/text: this order took a long time to arrive (4 1/2 weeks) due to it originating in the UK, and customs delays at both sides of the pond.James at Focus Network was great - doing all he could. If you want these glasses soon, this is not the way to go. If you want real italian madeRay Bans and are in no rush, this is a good supplier.
