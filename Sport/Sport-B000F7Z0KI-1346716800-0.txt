review/summary: Got me through R.A.G.B.R.A.I.review/text: These water bottles are perfect as far as capacity, style, and insulating performance. I was able to keep my water relatively cool while riding 50 plus miles during R.A.G.B.R.A.I. No issues with nozzles like those common with the Camelbak Podiums. Cleaned well after loading up with Gatorade as well. Lastly, they fit in both the vertical and horizontal water bottle holders for my 60cm frame. Overall, a wonderful product that I'd highly recommend for the price.
