review/summary: Easy installation and sturdyreview/text: Brought this product by reading other reviews and just like most others have said, this product does the job for the money. Traveled 400 miles with 1 road bike on the rack on my Jetta averaging between 70-80 mph and not one single problem although there were parts of the ride that was bumpy, regardless, I didn't have to tighten any of the straps throughout the journey (make sure you tighten all the straps all the way down to avoid any issues...). I also placed a microfiber clothe under the rubber wheels to prevent potentially dulling up of the paint or potentially melting and leaving an imprint on a hot day - no marks were left behind on the truck because of this.Pros:- Easy to install (5 mins)- Light- Holds up well for long journey- CheapTip: Make sure to secure your front wheel from turning with some bungee cord and lock your rear and front wheel along with your frame to the rack to prevent someone stealing your bike with unattended.
