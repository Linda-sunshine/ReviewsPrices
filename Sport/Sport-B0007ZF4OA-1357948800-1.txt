review/summary: Great for gloves or pocketreview/text: Lasts for hours whether you put them in your gloves or just drop them in your pocket. I was able to keep my hands warm without gloves for most of our Yellowstone trip. Daytime temps were -10 to 16. Just dropped one in each jacket pocket and stuck my hands in when they got chilled. Much better for handling the camera than bulky gloves. And that's saying a LOT for this south Texas gal!
