review/summary: Durable As Hellreview/text: I did not realize how durable the holster was until my brother accidentally sat on it when we were switching out the belt loop holster for the hip holster. Sadly, I don't have my Walther P99 to put in the holster yet, but I'm sure it will fit just fine. Great product
