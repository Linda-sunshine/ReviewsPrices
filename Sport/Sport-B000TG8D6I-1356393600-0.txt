review/summary: i was going to buy this till i saw the reviewsreview/text: too many people state that the dvds are made cheap and that amazon nor beach body will replace the disc free if they come defective that there is a $30 fee for replacement per disc well as someone who is jobless due to the economy and living with family to survive the pit fall of the economy i decided i can't afford to buy a defective product when i rarely have money in my pocket in the first place i will be looking for a better workout dvd
