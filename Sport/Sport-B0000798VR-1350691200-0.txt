review/summary: "Chuck Taylor" Converse All Starsreview/text: I ordered the "Chuck Taylor" Converse All Stars in Black, just because I think they go with almost everything. The packaging was fine and I had no issues with the product. It arrived before the projected date and looked exactly like the photo. The box did include two pairs of laces, both black and white. I've been wearing Converse Chuck Taylors for years and needed to replace my pair that I've worn out. I rotate my shoes, so they had just ran their course. I really enjoy these shoes, I like the look, the style (which is very classic), and the comfort. These are the most recognized sneaker, ever. More people comment on these more than any other pair that I own. The only drawback is that they run large. Make sure when you order them, you order them to your true size. Other than that, I have had no issues. YMMV.
