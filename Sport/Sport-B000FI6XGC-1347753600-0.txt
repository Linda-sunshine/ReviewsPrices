review/summary: Great Pumpreview/text: Great pump, high quality. My only issue was that I had to go online to [...] and find out how to change the internal pump head parts to fit my style of air nozzle on my bike. For experienced bikers, this might have been apparent. Once I found their video and changed it, the pump works perfectly. If the instructions, or eluding to the instructions, had been on the package, it would have made a 5-star review.
