review/summary: A little squeaky?review/text: I usually take off the cap to drink from the bottle. It actually squeaks rather loudly (like a mouse or a bat,) when you suck through the sport cap. This seems to have something to do with the vent that allows air pressure to equalize while you're drinking from it. I haven't tried much in the way of a fix, but if anyone has a suggestion I'm all ears.Otherwise this is a beautiful bottle that's easy to fill, easy to unscrew, sturdy, and of a very convenient size.
