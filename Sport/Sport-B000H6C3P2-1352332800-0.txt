review/summary: Comfy upgradereview/text: Installed this on my Daniel Defense M4 to replace their stock grip. I was originally worried that the extra thickness of this Hogue Rubber grip might interfere with the operation of my Battle Arms ambi-safety. I am glad to report it does not. I have the battle arms ambi-safety with the standard "long version" installed on both sides and it did not hit or scrape on the grip. Mind you, there is very, very little clearance maybe less than 1/32 but everything operates just right without any problems or any modifications to the the hogue grip. As for the comfy factor that is a matter of taste but I must say that it suits me fine.
