review/summary: complete failure of designreview/text: I don't know how all the reviews are so glowing about these, I wonder if they are fake reviews.These underpants are designed so poorly that it looks like you're wearing them back to front, for a man of my size I probably have quite a small bum yet these are so tight on my bum yet it looks like I'm wearing a cloth nappy on my front, there is so much excess fabric that there is no support for the crown jewels, and it seems like they are designed to encourage chafing.Barely suitable for a walk to the shops, let alone hiking.
