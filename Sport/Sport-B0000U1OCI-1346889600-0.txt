review/summary: works greatreview/text: I bought it to just check how many steps i take in a day but found this to be quite an addiction. this helps me keep track of AND avoid low activity days. My parents used this as well when they visited, now they know exactly how much they walked near my apartment so have an idea of what they have to do back home to maintain their workout.
