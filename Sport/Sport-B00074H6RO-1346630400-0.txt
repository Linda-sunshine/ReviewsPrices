review/summary: No calluses compared to other glovesreview/text: Offers good padding against weights. I used other gloves before where I get calluses. Not with these gloves. The only complaint is that it slides too far down, so it gets too tight to the crevices between my fingers, and has to be tugged finger by finger to be taken off.
