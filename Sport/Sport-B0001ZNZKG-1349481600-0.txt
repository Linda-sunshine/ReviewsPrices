review/summary: Not snugreview/text: In general I like this product. The material is soft and wicking. The waist band stays flat and at the waist where it belongs. The legs are not quite as snug as I would like but they generally stay down in position while standing or walking. They cover adequately without binding. I am pleased with the way they feel and wear.They are about twice what I feel comfortable paying for underwear shorts but I guess that is the price I pay for allowing myself to reach the X-Large level.I will purchase more of this product, just not in bulk.
