review/summary: good qualityreview/text: Simple and easy, but with that, a couple of things cause problems. When setting this, you must set all entries at the same time. If you want to change the person's weight or the time due to daylight savings, you must reset everything. Just Annoying. Also I am small and have a small gait. This pedometer is limited in how small the gait you can set. For me it is an 1.5" too big.
