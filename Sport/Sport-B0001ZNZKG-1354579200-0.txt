review/summary: Great For Travelreview/text: I bought these for use when traveling and I was really pleased and surprised at how much I like them. I normally wear regular briefs and these are much more form fitting. Not so bad for me as I am a 33" waist. Not sure how they would feel on a larger person. These are very comfortable and actually do "breathe" and manage to not get all sweaty. I was concerned about this because I much prefer cotton, but they really are great. They will easily dry overnight after a hand wash while on the road. I would consider wearing these all the time if they weren't a bit pricey. I highly recommend these boxers.
