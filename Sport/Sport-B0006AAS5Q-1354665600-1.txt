review/summary: Battery dead within 6 months. $28 "return shipping fee" to have it replaced.review/text: I bought this watch for my boyfriend last year, and within 6 months the hands on the watch did not have enough "juice" to do anything more than quiver. Within a couple weeks of that, it stopped completely.I contacted Invicta about having it fixed, as it is under their 1 year warranty. They will fix it, yes, but I have to pay to have the watch shipped to their headquarters. I also have to enclose a check for $28 for "return shipping fees". This seems like a very expensive battery fix. The problem is, if you take the watch somewhere local to have the battery changed, the second another party than Invicta removes the battery cover, the warranty is voided. Seems to be a bit of a stronghold to me. Pretty bogus.All in all, until the battery gave out, it was a decent watch. I wish someone at Invicta had been willing to take even ONE STEP to leave me feeling like a satisfied, valued customer.
