review/summary: Finally A New Office Chair That Doesn't Kill My Back!review/text: I purchased the Gaiam balance ball chair 10 days ago on Amazon and have been using it ever since. I work long hours... For many years, I have struggled with finding a new office chair that does not kill my back. Even though I work out daily and include ab crunches and core training in my regimen, I have really poor sitting habits in my office . Even after purchasing other chairs in the past, I've kept going back to the same old office chair that I've had for ages because it was the only chair that wasn't killing my back after the many hours I work in a day. With its affordability and great reviews, I took a chance on the Gaiam balance ball chair. After 10 days of nearly constant use now (I had to limit my use on that first day), I am thrilled to say that the old office chair that I've been dying to permanently replace has been finally put in the garage (actually I did that after day 4!). The Gaiam chair, by its nature, immediately showed me how I was supposed to be sitting. It's a keeper.
