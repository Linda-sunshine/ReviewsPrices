review/summary: beautiful watch....review/text: unfortunately you need to buy a winder with this watch. Otherwise the watch stops unexpectedly when you least expect it. This watch must have very cheapautomatic mechanism, it doesn't stay wound for long and goes dead on you often. It's a very nice watch (Submariner copy)especially the color of the dial and the bezel. Should the watch stay wound reasonable time, I'd buy it again.
