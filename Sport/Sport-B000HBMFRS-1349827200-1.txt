review/summary: Leaks. Didn't make it through the 1st nightreview/text: I purchased this item on June 11, 2012 for my 14 year old daughter and her friend to sleep on during our week long family vacation. As soon as it arrived, I inflated it and it seemed perfect. I was so impressed with the ease of inflation that I showed a few friends how nice it was and inflated it again. It seemed perfect. Went on vacation the 1st week of August and the 1st night it was slept on it did not make it through the night. The poor girls woke up on the floor every morning. When I got home I checked my return options and found out that my return window expired on July 20, 2012. My husband checked the air mattress and found that it is leaking around the built in pump. It is a piece of junk. Will never buy an air mattress with a built in pump again.
