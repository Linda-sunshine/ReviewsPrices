review/summary: A Pocket Survival Kitreview/text: I've wanted one of these for years, so it seemed to be fate when it popped up as a daily deal at a huge discount. I've had the knife for about 48 hours now and I've already been able to use it a few times. I'm happy to say that it was more than worth the value at $30 and would have been well worth the list price had I paid that much.The knife is sturdy and heavy in your hands. Once slipped into the pocket however, I noticed that I became used to the weight pretty fast. I tested each implement out and found that they are a bit reluctant to release at first, but with a few uses it starts to loosen up. Each tool also seems very sturdy in itself and I don't think I'll need to worry about any of them popping loose any time soon.Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who finds themself needing the odd tool on random occasions or would just like to have a good knife and a screwdriver handy without the tool box. With this particular knife, you'll have pretty much anything you can imagine ever needing and then a bit more.
