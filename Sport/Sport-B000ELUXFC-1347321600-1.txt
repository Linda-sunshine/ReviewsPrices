review/summary: amazing allenreview/text: I was a little hesitant since some of the reviews said certain bikes don't fit and it doesn't work on all cars, etc. But at 39 bucks what the heck. We have two adult size mountain bikes (male and female) and let me tell you they mounted perfectly, like rocks. No swaying or banging and fit together great when you mount them pointing in opposite directions. Yes, pay attention to the pedals because they can come close to the body of certain cars so just put an old sock on them if there's a question. Not a problem on our 2004 Corolla. It was so easy to mount I had to look back at the instructions because I thought I did something wrong. Nope, I didn't, it's just that simple. Super rack that anyone can afford. Have fun!
