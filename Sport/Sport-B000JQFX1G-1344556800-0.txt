review/summary: Which watch is this?review/text: SELLERS!! Please update your information.There are three different movements for this (8926OB) watch: The 21 jewel Miyota 8215 Winding Non-Hacking movement. The 23 jewel Seiko/TMI NH25A Non-Winding Hacking movement, and The 23 jewel Seiko/TMI NH35A Winding AND Hacking movement. I may be off with the the jewels since they're irrelevant. It's the winding and hacking that I'm looking for.Sellers should identify which one they're selling, or I'll keep returning them.
