review/summary: Pretty Goodreview/text: I ordered these in XL. The material feels very good, however, they fit smaller than XL and don't have as much stretch as some of the other yoga pants I've had. They are pretty comfortable and luckily I'm between the sizes so it doesn't matter as much, but if you need an XL I'd suggest ordering a 2XL just in case (for more comfort)
