review/summary: A GYM Is Required For P90Xreview/text: Your suppose to be able to do this at your house but somehow P90X failed to mention the equipment required until you start. The first disc is the worst because you need different size free weights or bands and a pull up bar! you may as well be at a gym. Instead of supplying the basics for $150 they give you a lame food program of expensive foods you can buy and cant stop mentioning how you need there fitness supplements, what a joke. The disc don't work on my laptop and has problems playing on the Bose system we have. I was gonna buy insanity workout instead but realized that there by the same beach body company that has no quality in there products. So since I have already paid for there crappy made burned DVDs once I'm gonna get someone to burned copies of insanity just to get my moneys worth. This program is not worth the money because you can find lots of people trying to get rid of there P90X mistake online for cheap.
