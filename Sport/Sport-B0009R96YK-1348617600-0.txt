review/summary: Good Product, Excellent Customer Supportreview/text: I bought one of these handlebar-mounted mirrors after trying the helmet-mounted kind. I didn't like having a chunk of my vision constantly obscured, even by a tiny mirror, so I thought I'd try the Mirrycle mirror. I much prefer having the mirror mounted on my handlebar, there to give me a look behind whenever I want it. It's a nice safety feature. If you're a racing cyclist into the latest high-tech gear and carbon fiber accessories, this may not have enough of a coolness factor for you. But I don't care much about looking cool on my bike, so it doesn't phase me.The mirror is a good size and provides an adequate view of the road behind. Installation was easy--up to a point. For some reason, the bolt that connects the mirror to the arm is very, very hard to tighten down. My suggestion is to build the entire unit in the comfort of your house, working with a towel laid out on your work surface in case you drop the mirror (as I did). Save the attachment of the mirror to the arm for last, as the rest of the assembly will give you more to grip, thus better torque to get this bolt dialed in. Then take the assembled mirror out to your bike and complete the job, again laying a thick towel on the ground beneath your handlebars in case gravity tries to do your mirror in. It's really pretty easy if you follow this procedure.And let me give Kudos to Mirrycle's customer service! As mentioned above, I dropped the mirror on my cement garage floor while wrestling with the mirror/arm assembly, cracking the mirror. I thought I'd try my luck emailing customer service, explaining what had happened. They had replacement parts out to me the next day, free of charge! Now that's excellent customer service.
