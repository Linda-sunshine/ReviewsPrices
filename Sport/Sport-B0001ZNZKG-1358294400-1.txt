review/summary: Well worth it-versatile beyond belief!review/text: For traveling in particular, these are absolutely perfect. If you are someone who is reading these reviews, others have covered many of their other glowing attributes and I want to add that with a 30 inch waist-the small size fits superb. I just love the complete package of a light, packable, quick drying underwear that I feel comfortable in with slacks dressed up or in the gym (obviously dressed down haha). Money well spent and this coming from a college student with minimal funds
