review/summary: Great Light.review/text: If you do any night riding or low light riding then you must get this! It has a steady or flashing red light to make you highly visible from the rear. It definitely makes you feel safer knowing you can be seen in low visibility conditions or at night. Has a little push button on the rear to change settings or turn off. Easy to install and operate. Only complaint is to put batteries in you must effectively take it apart..be careful not to break anything during this process.
