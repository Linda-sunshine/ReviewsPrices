review/summary: Best pan(s) on Earth.review/text: Cast iron is a much sturdier and healthier alternative to toxic "non stick" cookware. As long as you don't wash it with soap it will improve over time. This set has two of the most useful sized pans you'll need - a shallow one perfect for omelettes and a deeper one ideal for deep frying. More importantly this set conserves heat when the two are combined for a dutch oven. Put a halved chicken in with a little water, halved potatoes and seasoning, cover and cook on the lowest temperature - it's done in about 30 minutes (steam will start leaking through) while using far less heat than the oven. And if you can get free shipping it's incredibly cheap. This is a Man's cookware, was the set taken by Lewis and Clark on their expedition and was also a favorite of George Washington's mom.
