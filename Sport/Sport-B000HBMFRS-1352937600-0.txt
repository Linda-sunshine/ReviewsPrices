review/summary: Semi-comfy mattress that lasts about 3 monthsreview/text: I have went through 4 intex mattresses now. I swear, I keep them in their bag, in the closet and when I use them, they are used on carpet. For whatever reason, after about 3 months, they start losing air. We can't even find a hole in them (with the exception of 1, which WAS our fault). One of them just lost its ability to DEFLATE after a little while. Overall, these are really cheap mattresses, while pretty comfy, are just not durable. I am going to spend more money and get a more durable one. I could've bought a $200 super rugged mattress by now!
