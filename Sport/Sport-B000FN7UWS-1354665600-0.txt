review/summary: It makes drinking water exciting!review/text: This is without a doubt the best water bottle I have ever had the pleasure of owning! Just as the title says, it really does make drinking water more enjoyable and exciting!Pros:- Not plastic- Doesn't add any taste to the water (like metallic taste etc...)- Keeps water cold!- Water doesn't drip out onto you when you drink (happens sometimes with my other water bottle)- It is eco-friendly (18/8 food-grade stainless steel free of BPA and other toxins)- It feels nice in your handsCons:- You cannot freeze it. But that's not really a con for me because I never intend to.- It is not designed for hot liquids. It means I can't drink tea or coffee in it, but that's perfectly fine with me.- It is not leak-proof. This doesn't bother me but obviously if you need a leak-proof water bottle look elsewhere.I highly recommend this water-bottle for anyone who needs to...well, drink water!
