review/summary: Great incentive creator!review/text: I LOVE this pedometer and it's computer graphs! This is my 3rd one. The other two went through the wash when I forgot to check the pockets! I love getting the green happy faces when I meet my goals and try hard to increase my walking when I really don't feel up to it, just to get my little green happy face. Each week I download into my computer. I print out the month's graph to show my doctor and dietician when I go in for a checkup. It's proof that I've been doing what I'm supposed to do. When I didn't have it, it was too easy to procrastinate and not get in my daily walk. I write in under each day that I don't walk what the reason was, so I can look back and see what's happening when I don't walk. It's just as much fun to get those happy faces as it was so many years ago when I got gold stars in school! It's helping me keep off the 100 lbs. I lost 11 yrs. ago! Go for it! Being a low-income senior, the low price helps me a lot, too! THANK YOU, OMRON & AMAZON!
