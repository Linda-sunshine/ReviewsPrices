review/summary: A lot of work and other program offers better resultsreview/text: There's nothing magic about P90x. It's mostly just a ton of movement and volume. Working out 60-90 minutes a day six days a week is quite a commitment and while I'm sure those who have devoted the time and effort to it have seen great results, you can train your body much more efficiently through a well-designed strength training program that takes 45-60 minutes three times a week. I highly recommend Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength over P90x. You'll build strength, reduce your body fat percentage, you'll be less exhausted and have more free time.
