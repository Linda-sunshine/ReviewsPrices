review/summary: Great Resourcereview/text: This is an excellent resource. I had to pin it t my clothing to avoid having it slip off during the day. It helps me monitor my daily activity so I can try to walk, at least 10,000 steps or 5 miles per day. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and I can already see a difference in the way my clothes are beginning to fit. I love it!
