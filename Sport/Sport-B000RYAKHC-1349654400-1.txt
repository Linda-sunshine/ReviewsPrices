review/summary: Solid, Visible Light with overly sensitive buttonreview/text: I like this tail light/ flasher light/ please don't run me over light/ whatever we're calling it. Unlike the majority of reviews I do not have it mounted to a bike. I live in oregon and don't like to leave anything worth more than about $5 out in the rain if I can avoid it.As a result this light has lived the last year and a half in my back pack making the trek to campus and back probably 6 days a week. Its small enough to fit in the little outside pockets of my bag along with my rain gear and durable enough to not break even though I'm not the most gentle with my backpack. When I ride at night or in the rain I pull it out and use the clip on the light to secure it to a loop (made especially for tail lights) on my backpack.One concern I do have and wish I had considered before purchasing is that since this light isn't out in the open on my bike, the button is always getting pressed. The button on the back of it is just a little rubber nub that cycles you through flashing, constant light, and off. I would say that at least once every week or two someone comes up to me just to let me know that theres something on in my bag. Its not a huge deal but could drain the battery for when I need it later. I wish that the button was either a physical switch or that you had to hold it to turn it on. And on the plus side at least they can see it through my canvas backpack; the LEDs on this are very bright. Certainly bright enough to be seen from several blocks away which allows most cars to give me ample space on the shoulder.Quick overview/TL:DRThe light is brightIts smallIts toughIts got great battery lifeBut its button is a little too easy to press and gets turned on in my bag quite oftenOverall: 4 stars. I've been recommending it to pretty much all my friends that commute on their bikes or just like to ride at night and will continue to do so until I see something better/cheaper
