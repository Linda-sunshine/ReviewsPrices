review/summary: Blackhawk holster PX4/90-Tworeview/text: Excellent product for less than 40 bucks. Had difficulty finding a holster for my Beretta 90-Two. The PX4 Storm holster fits perfectly. Barrel on PX4 is 4.0 inches and 90-Two is 4.9 inches so it sticks out past the end a bit. No problem though. This is a belt attachment holster but a paddle is also included. The draw is very smooth and natural. The retention mechanism is very solid. Can be adjusted for any angle you want. Highly recommended.
