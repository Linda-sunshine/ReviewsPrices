review/summary: optical pleasurereview/text: First thing, I need to thank amazon for handling this transaction with expertise and speed. As always, two day delivery to my door thanks to prime.Now as for the shades, 5 stars. I lost my RB aviator a few months back. Looked high and low and tried a plethora of brands and styles, and came back to what I had lost.Fist off, the price on amazon cannot be beat. Same shades were retailing for 140-165 at sunglass hut and macy's.Lastly, the glass optics are premium in function and sytle.I like this pair so much I just ordered the aviator techs for $153! Two RBs for the price of one at the mall. No doubt a great deal!
