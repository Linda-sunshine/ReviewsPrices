review/summary: Handy!review/text: I love keeping one of these little knives on my keychain. You never know when it will come in handy! I have used mine for everything from cutting tags off clothes or removing loose threads to cutting down cardboard boxes when I couldn't find a utility knife! Don't forget to remove it from your keychain if you will be travelling by airplane. I once had to leave mine behind at a security checkpoint!
