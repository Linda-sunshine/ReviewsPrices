review/summary: Invicta 9212 Mens Watchreview/text: Was a little disappointed to have to order this watch 3 times. Got sent the wrong watch the first time. My replacement order went missing. Although we speak the same language somehow we got mixed up with returns, re-orders and a few promises made by Amazon. Re: my actual cost to return the wrong item was never fully re-funded. A $10 voucher promised to my account never honored. Commission costs by my bank over the 3 orders blew the actual cost of this watch to over $50 more then my initial order cost!However! I finally have the Invicta 9212 watch I originally ordered and I love it! Would recommend the watch to anyone in the world. It is a very smart looking watch both in a casual and formal engagement. A quality watch that has a robust and functional feel.I really hope someone from Amazon reads this review! The Invicta 9212 Speedway watch will live up to your expectations and serve you well!Just wish i could say the same about Amazon!
