review/summary: Great without glovesreview/text: I bought this as my old standard AR15 pistol grip was a pain in the ass and just did not like the feel at all. With the hogue, I love the feel without gloves. Once Loctited in, I fell in love with the grip except with using gloves. With gloves it seems to feel &#34;sticky&#34; and will take time to get used to it, otherwise it's a great grip.
