review/summary: Great Tea! Great taste!review/text: I have been looking for a tea that could take the place of the tea I was drinking which was a wonderful Chai but I drank it with Cinnamon Vanilla creamer and milk. Latte style! I do not need the extra calories. I tried a few ginger teas and disliked them immensely but this tea was great. I get the same warming bite that I got with the Chai but I don't have to have the milk and the creamer. I am forming a new "like affair" with this tea. Great tea! Beneficial! and so very soothing.
