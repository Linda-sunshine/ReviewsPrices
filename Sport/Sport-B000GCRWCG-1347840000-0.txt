review/summary: good budget itemreview/text: bought these to put into survival kits for my boy scout troop/venturing crew. they arrived promptly in a very nice perforated box that you can tear right in to. the folded individual blankets themselves are VERY small (1.5 x 2.5 inches, approximately) though unfolded size is quite generous. these are thinner than some others - think potato chip bag - but very durable and appear effective in my testing. overall definitely a decent product.
