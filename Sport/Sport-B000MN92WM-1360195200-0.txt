review/summary: Not Mac compatiblereview/text: I had another Omron pedometer which I liked very much but it broke and I was looking for replacement. I loved the idea that this pedometer came with software to track steps, etc. I tried to determine if it was Mac compatible before purchasing it but I couldn't find the info, so assuming most all software is now made Mac compatible I purchased it. I was greatly disappointed to find it isn't so I returned it. I'm sure I would love it (based on my other Omron pedometer) if it was could be used with an Apple computer.
