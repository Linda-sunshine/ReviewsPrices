review/summary: You CAN teach an old dog new tricks!review/text: My dad was a firearms dealer so I've been shooting 50+ years. I was raised to never put a firearm away until it was cleaned and lightly oiled even if only one round had been fired through it so I'm a bit OCD in this area. This Hoppe's BoreSnake is a great tool for cleaning my AR. It's compact and light weight so I can put it in a backpack or BOB for field cleaning without the need for all the rods and brushes. This is definately a must have tool for cleaning your firearms. As for my hand guns I still prefer to use rods and brushes because I actually enjoy taking my time cleaning them. It can be just as therapeutic as gardening.
