review/summary: cheap...but not in a good way.review/text: I expected to be able to use the bow set right out the box; this was not possible since the bow was strung backwards, causing the strings to obstruct the arrow from being able to rest on the handle as you aim. Also, the finger roller and arm guard are incredibly cheaply made.
