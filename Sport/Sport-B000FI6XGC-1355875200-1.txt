review/summary: Small, lightweightreview/text: Small, lightweight, easily strapped to the bike's frame. I've used it once (thankfully haven't needed it much!) and it worked well. It took more pumps to get what I needed, but that's obvious. I would certainly prefer my larger &#34;real&#34; pump, but on the road, this is a MUST HAVE. Price was perfect. This is essential for anyone biking more than a few blocks from home.
