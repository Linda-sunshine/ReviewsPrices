review/summary: Surefire way to clean your firearms!review/text: I just love the BoreSnake line and have them for all of my firearms. My .22 cal. pistol &#34;snake&#34; is just too short for my rifle so I grabbed one of these to round out my &#34;collection&#34;. So easy to clean my rifle after an afternoon at the range. As I am shooting round lead, it is a snap to squirt some BrakeFree down the barrel and with two pulls of the &#34;snake&#34;, clean barrel! No muss and fuss with a rod and patches. Life is good!
