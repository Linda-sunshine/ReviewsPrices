review/summary: I can see.review/text: As I remember amazon was a little slow shipping but that is on them. The assembling took some doing but nothing that is beyond reason. This was replacement so did not have to cut off the ends of the grip, had already put on bar-ends. Figure out which plug fits your handlebar and push it in, tighten it up.
