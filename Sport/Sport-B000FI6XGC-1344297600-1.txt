review/summary: Very Handyreview/text: Just the right size. Also, thanks to the previous posters for the tutorial on changing the head for the appropriate valve stem. Everyone is correct, the instructions are not very clear at all. Other than that, it is extremly handy. I keep it mounted (nice mount too) on my commuter bike, and throw it in the jersey or backpack when I ride my road bike.
