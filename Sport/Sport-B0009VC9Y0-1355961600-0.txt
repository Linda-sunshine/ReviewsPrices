review/summary: Excellent & Razor Sharpreview/text: I mainly carry this knife on weekends. It has remained extremely sharp after a fair amount of use. The speed safe mechanism works great and I don't expect to have any issues. The tip is a little thin and could snap off if used improperly, but I don't plan to use it as a screw driver....that's what screw drivers are for.Edit: After using the knife regularly for a for the past month, the thin blade is starting to take a beating. I've been what I would consider overly cautious of how I use it and the blade is starting to show some jaggedness to it. I'm knocking off 2 stars because of the fragility of the blade.
