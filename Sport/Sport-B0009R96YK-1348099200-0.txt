review/summary: Priority Safety Equipment for Biking on Roadsreview/text: In my opinion, a mirror is more important than wearing a helmet in terms of safety on the road. No more are the constant turning of my head 180 to see if there is a truck bounding my way. This mirror is made of durable, robust materials and it was very easy to install. I think it took less than five minutes. I admit, I watched a couple of YouTube videos on how to install the Mirrycle MTB mirror before actually doing it myself. I love how it feels it won't come off my bike and how adjustable and stable it is once adjusted. And it was inexpensive--only $12! High quality at a low price. Highly recommended to any biker who will share the road with larger vehicles.
