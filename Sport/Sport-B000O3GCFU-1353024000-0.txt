review/summary: Perfect in every wayreview/text: I love this thermos so much that I bought another one for my twins to take to preschool. They love the colors and the size, and the fact that their food is still warm/hot when they open it at lunchtime. They have no problem opening it themselves. I fill it up with boiling water and let it sit for 3-5 min then put the warmed food in there. It doesn't take up the whole lunchbox either, which is nice.
