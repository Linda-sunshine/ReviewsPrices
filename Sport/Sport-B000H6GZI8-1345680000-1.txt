review/summary: Gripreview/text: Its make the grip "fat" or a lot wider .After you put it on you have to trim it with scissors or something else ",hope that turn out good". It also makes your finger ride high on the gun ,I install it and removed it ,didn't like it. If you have a bigger or fat fingers, "like mine" this is Not very good item .Hope this review helps.
