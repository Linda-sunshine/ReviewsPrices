review/summary: Very High Qualityreview/text: Very high quality blade. Sharp enough to shave arm hair right out the box. Everything is smooth, clean and sturdy. The locking function keeps the blade on safety, and the opening function is very useful. You might want to apply a little oil to keep everything in good shape. A very good quality knife.
