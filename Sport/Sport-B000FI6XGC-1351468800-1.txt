review/summary: Great buyreview/text: Hands down this is one of my best purchases. This bike pump is small and very easy to use. For seven months I used my bike to commute to work(5 to 7 days a week) and having this really helped. On my days off I'd go for bike rides for three hours plus and have never regreted owning this product. I have filled my tires with this bike pump several times and have never had problems. For the price and durability (I've had it for almost a year and have used it frequently) I recommend it.
