review/summary: Awesome lightreview/text: Very bright light! I ride a lot at night in Los Angeles and need to be seen. This thing does the job! It is incredibly bright and noticeable, and the blinking light is also a very great addition for it. It has a very long life on it as well, and will fit around any bike seat stem.Would highly recommend.
