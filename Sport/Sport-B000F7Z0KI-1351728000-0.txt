review/summary: Water bottle failreview/text: I'm a biker and have other bottles. But I got this one to just keep by my computer so my ice doesn't melt. Liquid flow is a little slow. I'm not sure why as the spout is a good size. The bottle itself isn't level when sitting on a flat surface. So it wobbles a bit. The top doesn't screw down totally tight but also doesn't leak.The double-wall insulation on this bottle is a joke. If ice is put inside, it will sweat, just like a non-insulated bottle. So this negates one of the entire reasons I paid $8+ for this thing. It's got cheesy tinfoil-type material between the walls of the bottle which appears to not really do anything.
