review/summary: Expectations Metreview/text: I've always wanted a Klean Kanteen of my own and just last week I ordered my first 27oz. classic poly loop stainless steel. Shipping was definitely very fast thanks to Amazon Prime. It's so simple and useful & I love bringing my Klean Kanteen with me everywhere when I'm on campus. The first sip I took was great, didn't taste any metal or anything else unpleasant from its material. It's guaranteed the taste of just clean water. I chose the poly loop because it made it easier to clean & it seals with just one twist (maybe 1 1/2) without any leaks! Definitely worth the money!
