review/summary: A Must-Have for Night Time Ridingreview/text: For $10 bucks, this is a great little gadget. It's always great when you buy something especially for its functionality and simplicity, and this is it! It just simply works. The light slips on and off easily but in my experience of owning it for several months, has never fallen off. In order for you to take the light off, you need to slide the light upward, so I can never really see this ever this little guy getting lost in the dark. Also, you can angle the light to the correct degree so its pointing towards car drivers. It comes with that soft rubber so you can fit it to a variety of pole sizes. I highly recommend this product.
