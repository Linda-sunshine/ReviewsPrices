review/summary: WoW, do you get what you pay for!review/text: 3 stars is because it looks nice and your child will love it at 1st sight.-2 stars because this compound bow is 1 step above toy status IMO. You should go look at one in person 1st before you order online.1. The string is not a string, its thick rope that will scrape/pinch your kids arm more than a string would. (Get an arm guard)2. Buy an arm brace! The rope is very rough and will leave some wicked arm scrapes/pinches!3. The Finger Roller twists the rope on release causing some unpredictable flights. (Slightly better flights by not using it.)4. Inside 15ft You're lucky to hit within the bullsye 25% of the time.5. Outside 20ft the arrow will probably bounce off your target unless your using a cheap styrofoam stop or switch the points out for field points.I know the bow is intended as an introduction to archery but the included Arrows have rounded points and have a hard time penetrating actual Archery targets. You will be back to the store to pick up actual Arrows with field points in no time (which does improve the bows likelyhood to hit within 1ft of your target). If you can acquire a Couple Hay bales (less resistance) I think you can postpone the arrow purchase a bit longer.
