review/summary: Good productreview/text: I use these in my vehicle emergency and backpacking supplies... but I mostly use them to put in ziplock bags filled with some necessities and some comfort that I hand out to the homeless. I call them "Blessing Bags" and include things like these blankets to keep them warm or give them shelter. It gets cold up here and it is not uncommon to read about a homeless person who died of exposure during the night. The blankets are small and nicely contained. The cost is great and the product is handy for sure!
