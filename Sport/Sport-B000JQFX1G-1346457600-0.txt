review/summary: Excellent Watchreview/text: Watch is beautiful. For the price it will not be beat. The only weakness this watch has is that if something does happen to it, I do not have much confidence in Invicta to provide great service. However, the watch looks incredible. I've only had it about two weeks and it has already gotten mistaken for a Rolex a couple of times. The movement seems just okay, since I set it, the watch has gained about two minutes which seems like a lot, however, for the price, I am more than satisfied.
