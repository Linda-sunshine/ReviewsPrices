review/summary: Fantastic, but paint chips offreview/text: We bought these for a our boys (age 5 & 3). Already have two without color (stainless steel inside and out). I think they are an exceptional bottle, but the paint does chip. I will say, I read this in the reviews and decided to get them any way, so I'm not upset. I expected it and it was worth it for our needs in the end. I just wish it could be otherwise. We've had maybe 2 months and after about 1-1/2 mos, a 1/4&#34; chip came off the bottom when my 3 yo dropped outside. I would still buy colored again, but only if I really needed to. OF NOTE: this is not leak proof. We knew this buying and are fine with that. If it tips over on a couch or something, some dribbles will find their way out the tiny valve that helps with pressure in drinking. It's very little, but might be a real problem for some. I'm as confident as I can be that the plastic is safe. The water never tastes of steel or plastic. Spent a lot of time researching and pleased with safety.
