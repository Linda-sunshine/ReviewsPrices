review/summary: Great little knife,with toothpic and tweezers.review/text: I've ordered several of these over the years. They are perfect for the "little" needs that might comeup. Just good to have in your pocket. My only problem is misplacing them but at 10 to 15 bucks not a great loss. About once every other year!
