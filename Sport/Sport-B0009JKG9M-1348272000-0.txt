review/summary: Make this your first cast iron.review/text: If you are cooking for two, this is a great cast iron starter set. Go ahead and buy theLodge Max Temp Handle Mitt, Black,RSVP Endurance Fryer&iquest;s Friend,Lodge Set of 2 Durable Polycarbonate Pan Scrapers,Red and BlackandDexter-Russell 4-by-2.5-Inch Stainless Steel and Walnut Pancake Turnerw/ rounded corners while you are at it. Don't make the mistake of getting a larger turner for use with this cast iron set. You've read about "seasoned" cast iron and how foods don't stick to properly seasoned pieces, which is true. Lodge says they have pre-seasoned cast iron ... which it is, but don't be confused, because the pieces are NOT seasoned, they are pre-seasoned. They have taken the first step in the seasoning process, your pieces will arrive without any rust on them, but food WILL stick. Seasoning is an iterative process. Bacon (my preference) or fatty hamburger and the stainless steel turner will be your best tools for the job of creating a smooth stick-free surface on the cast iron. After you've attained a serviceable cooking surface you are going to realize something about the lid-pan, it doesn't have a pouring spout. I use the lid-pan all of the time, as the size is perfect when cooking for two. But having a skillet that you can drain easily, makes the purchase of either a 10 or 12 inch skillet with spout the next item on your list of cast iron pieces to buy. Besides, doing curls with two 10 inch skillets just makes sense. I always wondered how Grandma had such strong arms when all I ever saw her do was cook.
