review/summary: Tough bottle to crackreview/text: I have had my camelbak for about two years. I bought mine from my college with the logo on it, but its the same bottle shown here. I use this bottle everyday while on the treadmill and my kids love to take it to their sporting events. When i started bike riding, i started to take this with me. Now this is not something you should use on a bike ride, i did use it briefly before i got a backpack one. While riding on the roads and rocks, this thing has fallen about 4 times from the strap i tried to use with only a bit of a scratch on it. Most other bottles that are this dense would have cracked. This goes to show the quality of the build on this bottle. My kids have dropped this countless times too and it looks almost as good as when i bought it. Like any other bottle, it has to be cleaned. The bit comes right off and i prefer to boil mine for about 20 seconds. Inside the bit can get mildew in it and boiling will kill it. The other big spot is in the treading of the lid. A toothbrush will scrub it out easily and finish with a rinse of hot water. The straw and bottle i run through the dish washer on the sanitation cycle, but i never see anything build up on it. There isn't a funny taste to it like some generic copies of this and many colleges sell them with team logos and colors which is nice for kids to match to their own school colors. The lid has a nice loop on it to hook it on to things like a belt when not drinking. Something i found is if you blow in it and build up pressure, when you squeeze the bit, it squirts water out. Its something fun i do when outside with the kids and i don't have a squirt gun to nail them with. Overall, its a great quality product that's BPA free, nice looking and you can have some fun with.
