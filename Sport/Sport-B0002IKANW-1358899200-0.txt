review/summary: A-Zoom Snap Capsreview/text: I bought a package of 9mm snap caps and they arrived today. The package contained 5 "precision" units. I tried them in 3 separate 9mm guns and only 3 of the 5 units would chamber properly and it was always the same 2 that would not chamber. It appears that only 60% of the units are "precision".
