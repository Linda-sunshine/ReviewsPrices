review/summary: Works after taking a beating a couple of times.review/text: I commute to work everyday, and I use my MTB with this mirror to get out of the way of the crazy drivers in my town. I also get to ride some cool MTB's trails where I have crashed several times, and the mirror has handled it well. I did not expect it to make it after my last accident, but it is still working great. I would definitively recommend this to anybody.
