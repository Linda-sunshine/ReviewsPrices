review/summary: Very complete and right to the point.review/text: Great product, very detailed instructions, it literally takes you step by step through the program. This is really the way to exercise for a busy but dedicated individual. Most workouts are only an hour long not to say they are easy, in fact they are very intense. Personally it took me about two weeks to be able to keep up and I have always been active so if you are barely going to start working out this might not be the best option for you since the workouts are serious stuff in a great way, I LOVE IT. The diet guide is really good too, it provides ingredients and recipes which makes keeping up with the program really easy. The package comes with everything you need to start exercising right away which brings me to other thing that I love about this product, one barely needs any equipment, bands and a couple of weights, other than that with a little imagination you can work with stuff you find around any household. The only bad criticism I have is that the videos seem to be getting a little old by now but that is just me. I really really like this product definitely recommend it.
