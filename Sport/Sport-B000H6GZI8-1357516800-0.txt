review/summary: Great for my Ruger SR9c -- but upside down...review/text: Just purchased this grip sleeve for my Ruger SR9c pistol. It did take a bit of effort to install, but was well worth the trouble. I actually put it on upside down just up against the trigger guard and this allows ample room for my middle finger (otherwise, placed right side up would put the finger ridge too close to the trigger guard). It also helped a good deal to have removed the rubber backstrap from the gun before sliding on the grip sleeve then putting the backstrap back on afterward. I accomplished this without warming or moistening the sleeve (just take it slow and keep pulling bit by bit). One reason that I really like my SR9c is that it fits my relatively small hand quite well, and this grip sleeve makes it feel even better--it's now a perfect fit to my hand. Highly recommended, especially for its small cost.
