review/summary: Exactly as expectedreview/text: Arista Gold Frame 62mm and Polarized Green LensesRay Ban Aviators. The name says it all. I have tried so many pretenders and once I tried these their is no going back. My eyes are very important to me. Like it is for most people. It is your primary sense and everything else is secondary. These are real deal. No imitation. Ray Ban P on the lense, Made in Italy.They are huge but so is my head. This is the 3025 model 62mm. But the lenses are very clear and truly polarized. Hint, if rotating the lenses makes things disappear (like the radio display or some monitor privacy shields) or looking through certain windows shows you things you have never seen before = polarized.Fit needs to be adjusted. Did it after seeing some stuff on You tube. Needs a pro touch but adjusted to be wearable for the time being.Forgot my glasses at home and need something on a bright day. Looked at some cheap sunglasses...no way. Looked at real glasses...over priced in strict retail. Solution suck it up and deal with the glare.Like I said...never going back to pretenders.
