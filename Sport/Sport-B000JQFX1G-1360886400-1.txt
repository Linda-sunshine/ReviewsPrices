review/summary: Hard to believe....review/text: I have had this one for a couple of months - looks better in person and keeps time fine. Frankly, it is hard to fathom this watch being less than $100....I have paid 5 times that for frankly a poorly built watch what started falling to pieces after a year...Not sure what is stopping you from buying one, but for the price, just get it...
