review/summary: Good gloves, but sizing could be better...review/text: The gloves themselves are good, comfortable, and do a decent job protecting one from the cold. I primarily use it to block wind and chill while biking (coldest around 40F weather). It might not keep your hands that warm in such a situation, but it helps with not letting them get any colder. Size-wise they were too big for me, I wish a medium had been sold on Amazon.
