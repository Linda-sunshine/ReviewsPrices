review/summary: losing air already!review/text: We used the airbed for one guest (my very careful mother-in-law) over the holidays and it was fine. My son took it on a trip and it began loosing air the first night and he has not been able to use it since. I would not buy this again and in fact will try to return it when he returns home with it.
