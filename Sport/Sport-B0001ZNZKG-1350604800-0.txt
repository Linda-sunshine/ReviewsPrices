review/summary: Good, but sadly un-durablereview/text: I just wanted to point out that I only wore the boxers for about 4 times, and they started to rip. The inseam part has already been snapping off(the threads) which is not what I expected from a product like this. I payed well over the usual price for a similar product hoping that It would last, but sadly it didn't.
