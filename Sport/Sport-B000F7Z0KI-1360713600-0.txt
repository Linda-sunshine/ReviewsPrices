review/summary: Best Water Bottlereview/text: I bought 4 of these water bottles before school started in August of 2012. My kids take their lunches to school almost every day & I've never found a water bottle that will keep things cold until they eat lunch. These bottles can be put in the freezer and will stay cold for hours!! The best way I've found is to put just a little water in, freeze at an angle so there is a piece of ice all the way down the bottle, then fill with water or other liquid. (I got this tip from another review on here!!) This will stay cold until after school this way. Even just putting ice cubes in and then cool water works very well, too if I forget to freeze the night before. My daughter uses hers daily for school and dance. My son uses his daily for school & Tae Kwon Do. I use mine a couple times a week when I exercise or just to take to work. I hand wash, even though it says dishwasher safe. Just because I don't want to take chances. They are easy to clean with a bottle brush. We mostly use just water in them, but have put Crystal Light or Mio Drops in them and it washes out easily. These bottles don't leak. They are easy to squeeze and are very pretty. Lots of color choices. I highly recommned these bottles. I read LOTS of reviews before I decided to order. Totally worth the money. I waited to write my reveiw until I'd had them for awhile & could say for sure how they worked. We've been using daily for 6 months with no problems. Great water bottles.....AND made in the USA, too!!!!
