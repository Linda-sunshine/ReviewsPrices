review/summary: the bestreview/text: This is my 3rd, the first 2 were confiscated in airports. I carry it in my purse and use it all the time. The thing I use most often is the scissors. Actually, they could skip the knife and it would be just as useful to me. It's the tweezers and the nail file/prybar that I use occasionally.Hmmm, I wonder if I snapped the knife off, if it would not be an issue in airports.
