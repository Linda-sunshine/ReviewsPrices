review/summary: Good pot for moderate quantity stews and saucesreview/text: Of course this pot and the accompanying lid are heavy for the volume of cooking they provide, but the preseasoning, which is very good, and heat retention qualities make it an excellent pot for cooking stews and sauces from start to finish, i.e., searing the meats, sauteing the vegetables and slow cooking to finish all in one vessel. I originally purchased this pot to use as a chicken fryer, but I find that it is not quite big enough for my purposes, unless you are prepared to cook in two or more batches. There only two of us in my household, but I'd still like to be able to cook more than 3 pieces at once. Still, I am happy with this pot and pan combination, and although the shipping packaging from Amazon was something less than inspiring, the pot arrived in great condition and ready to use.
