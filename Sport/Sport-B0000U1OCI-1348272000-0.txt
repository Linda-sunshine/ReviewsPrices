review/summary: Exactly what I wantedreview/text: I had been wanting to get a pedometer for awhile and my neighbor got this one and raved about it. I ordered two, one for my husband and one for me. It works perfectly all day long and then erases the steps at night. If there is a negative I wish that it counted eliptical steps because my husband goes to the gym. If you are looking for an inexpensive pedometer this is the one for you.
