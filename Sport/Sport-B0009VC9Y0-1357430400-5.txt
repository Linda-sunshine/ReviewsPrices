review/summary: Sharp and Fast 4 years laterreview/text: After 4 years of use/abuse, I felt I should write a review for this awesome knife.Pros:very sharp right out of the box and remains sharpSpeed Safe provides a quick and smooth open action every timepocket clip remains tight even after daily use over the past 4 yearsdurable bladeCons:when first purchased, the lock would sometimes slide and disable the knife on its own. Years of dirt and lint took care of that, but you can also remove it.Other:I purchased this knife 4 years ago and it immediately replaced an old Gerber knife I had. I carry this thing with me on a daily basis and use it every other day for simple tasks, but I occasionally abuse the blade and use it as a scrapper to remove old gasket material from car parts. Ive sharpened it a few times, but never oiled it (I probably should).
