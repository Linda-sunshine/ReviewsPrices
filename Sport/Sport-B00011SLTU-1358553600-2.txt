review/summary: Never leave home without onereview/text: This small knife is extremely handy in all kinds of situations - from opening packages to cutting paper and tape - that you encounter almost every day. It's high quality, but inexpensive enough so that you can replace it when needed. The Victorinox knife is superior to other similar Swiss Army knives in construction and ease of use.
