review/summary: ONLY FAIRreview/text: Not real happy with this product. It looks good but works poorly. Not bad enough to return but not good enough to recommend. The electrical connections seems to be not very good or to make good contact to activate the unit. It jams up the cards on a regular basis. Would not buy another one unless they improved greatly.
