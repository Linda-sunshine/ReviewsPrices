review/summary: White Ray Ban Wayfarersreview/text: I am liking these sunglasses. They are stylish and they fit my face and ears really well. I have trouble often times with sunglasses being too big. I got the 50mm and the ear part fits nicely behind my ear, rather than being too long behind my ear, which is usually the issue. It is frustrating to constantly push your sunglasses back up on your nose because they don't fit properly. I am glad for the smaller sizes available from Ray Ban and I have no issues to report with this pair.
