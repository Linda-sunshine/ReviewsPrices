review/summary: love itreview/text: There are so many different grips out there for AR and i do like the Magpul ones but I have been using Hogue for over 25 years and hands down there is no better grip out there. I even installed them on my service rifles in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are very effective in wet conditions as well as every extreme i could impose on them throughout the years.
