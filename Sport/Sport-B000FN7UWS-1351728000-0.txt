review/summary: Tastes great!review/text: I gave up my plastic bottle habit once I discovered how good GE Fridge filters made my city water taste. The Klean Kanteen stainless steel bottles don't change the taste of my fridge water in the least. If you don't mind the funny noise the vent plug makes when you drink, it's a five-star product.
