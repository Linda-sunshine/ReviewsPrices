review/summary: Compact, effective, gets the job donereview/text: Not much to say here. It attaches to my bike just fine, does not get in the way of any motion, and pumps up tires relatively quickly for such a small device. Has an attachment inside so it works with both kinds of bicycle tires. If you find it difficult at all to pump, you haven't secured it properly. Should be a smooth pumping action.
