review/summary: Works greatreview/text: These work great, when you follow the directions. You must let them warm up and activate for the 15-30 minutes on the instructions. If you open them up, and put them directly in your glove, there NOT going to work. Its like when you plug in a new refrigerator, it doesn't become instantly cold inside it.I work outside all day, before I'm outside I open these up shake them, and let them sit in the passenger seat of my truck for at least 10 minutes to activate as I'm driving to my location to be working outdoors. They also from time to time need new oxygen so when I'm back in my truck, I re-shake them and let them get that outside of my glove. Great product.
