review/summary: Great mirrorsreview/text: Counter intuitively, a friend told me to put the mirror on the right side. Because I thought he was wrong, just in case, I bought two, one for each side. My friend was correct and it is easier to see what is behind me in the right hand mirror and I didn't need one on the left side. However because I cut the hole in the rubber grip, I will keep it there and I can look in both. I was nervous cutting the hole in the rubber grips, but it turned out to be a breeze and the mirrors installed easily. They have several pivot points to be able to properly adjust to see behind way down the road. The mirror itself is clear and big enough. Because they are installed into the grip, unlike other mirrors that install on the bar, these extend far enough out past your shoulders to see behind you. They are a great safety feature. Instead of riding only along the curb, on less traveled roads, I now ride like a car down the middle of the road. When I see in the mirrors that a car is coming, I move over to the curb. Also when I come to an intersection and want to turn left, it is so much easier to look in the mirror and if there are no cars, to go into the left turn lane just like a car.
