review/summary: Uselessreview/text: This is calibrated wrong or just defective because it nearly doubles the amount of steps you take, making it completely inaccurate and useless. It also added steps when I was sitting down. I also couldn't figure out a way to reset it once it started (inaccurately) counting my steps for the day.Save your money!
