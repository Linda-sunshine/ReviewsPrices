review/summary: Worth the price but some details not too fine.review/text: Just got my long awaited Invicta Men's 8926OB! The watch looks nice and the weight are surprisingly heavy (normally a low price watch would be light). Good to wear and it works fine. However, the paint finishing on the bezel is a bit not fine, the word &#34;50&#34; there's a bit of paint overlap on it, make it not perfect. I turn the date to &#34;1&#34; as today are 01.01.2013, I found a small dirt on the no.&#34;1&#34; date. It's very small thing but it make my watch inperfect. The crown are a bit light compare to SEIKO SKX007, but still easy to screw. Conclusion, an automatic watch with Rolex Submariner alike outlook with this kind of price, you just can't complaint much and it worth the price. But just pray it won't spoiled within 1 year or 2.
