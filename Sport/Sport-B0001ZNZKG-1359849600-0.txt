review/summary: Mt Everest and back with 3 pairs.review/text: These shorts are awesome. I spent months in the Himalaya with one &#34;shower&#34; over several months, which I'm assuming is not as the product is intended. However, with no washing, these bad boys had little to no odor after simply airing them out on my pack and rotating three pairs. I am thoroughly impressed with these and they're all I wear now. Perfect for months in the mountains with no showers, backpacking through Europe for years and now I've found they're fantastic in the military field environment. I highly recommend these shorts to anyone that likes to pack light, rough it, and/or just enjoys comfortable underwear. 10 stars!
