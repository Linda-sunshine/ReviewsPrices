review/summary: Slithers through my barrel like a champreview/text: In my opinion, bore snakes are a must when cleaning. I don't recommend this to be the ONLY method to cleaning but should be a supplement to the cleaning rod and patches.I typically use the bore snake after the rod and patches to make sure I really purge whatever junk is in the barrel. Then I would run a light coat of oil afterwards. That may seem excessive to some but with the possible threat to our gun rights nowdays, we must take good care of the wonderful firearms that we have!
