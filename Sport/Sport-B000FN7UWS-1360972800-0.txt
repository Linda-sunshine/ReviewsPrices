review/summary: I love Klean Kanteen, Just not the sport capreview/text: I've had my Klean Kanteen for almost four years now. I bought this one for my girlfriend and she wanted the sport top so that she wouldn't have to remove the top every time that she needed to take a drink. What I've noticed from drinking out of it: You get a lot of air and the d-mn thing tweets like a bird when the air passes through the valve. Cool, but she's a teacher and it gets a laugh out of the kids every time she uses it.
