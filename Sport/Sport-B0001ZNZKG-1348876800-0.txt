review/summary: Not what I expectedreview/text: I did a lot of research before I bought these, after all you spend more time in your underwear than any other clothing..I found that these weren't really for me.The downsides:1. They ride up my legs- I longboard, and by the time I push off a few times these are riding up pretty badly.2. They don't wick away moisture- The weird thing about these boxers is that they don't really get wet. They don't absorb any sweat so it just lingers on your body. As a result, you start to stink way quicker.The upsides:1. You can wash and dry them in just a few minutes.2. They keep you cool.3. They look decent.
