review/summary: Just what I wantedreview/text: Loving this rack! I have a Ford Explorer and wanted to transport my bike without breaking the bank. There are 2 bars that hold the rack extended that I had issue with instaling, my husband was able to assist. Other than that the instructions were simple to follow and installation was a snap.I made the top straps as far to either side of the hatch on the truck for tension which worked very nicely. Very happy with this rack!
