review/summary: Comfortable. Great sound reduction.review/text: I do target shooting indoors. So good earmuffs are important.These are very comfortable and work even though I also wear glasses. They keep down the noise of other people (especially those who breing in enormous guns and rifles) and allow me to concentrate better.They adjust in size easily and haven't worn out in more than a year of use. These seem to be very good and a sensible purchase if you don't want to use the range-provided earmuffs.Note: I haven't tested them on how well they keep out the noise of my teenage girls. I will have to try that too and report back sometime... :)
