review/summary: Nice color, easy to use, the sport cap does leak a little.review/text: Overall, a good klean kanteen product. My wife loves the color and the size is just right for her. The sport cap is the only complaint because it leaks if the bottle is held upside for a while (i.e. in a diaper bag or purse). When the canteen arrives, there is a slip of paper that comes with it indicating the sport cap is not leak proof.
