review/summary: I bit tight for Large Sizereview/text: I bought this for use with my Mountain Bike & for fitness exercises, after the other ones I had fell apart. They seem well made, and do offer protection. I bought the large size since I didn't want them to be too tight, but unfortunately, they still are and cause some pain after extended use. I'm hoping they will break in eventually. Comfort level could be better.
