review/summary: Good addition to a bike driven on the streetreview/text: Installation was relatively straightforward. Quality seems good -- i.e., mirror and mount seems sturdy. I can move the mirror out of the way for the trails and then back to being useful for seeing behind me. For the price, you get a big bang for the buck in terms of usefulness.Just one note of advice: if you carry your bike on a rear bike rack, be sure to face the mirror way up or way down so that sunlight (or another driver's headlight beam) isn't reflected into a driver's eyes behind you.Thanks.
