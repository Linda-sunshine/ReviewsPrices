review/summary: Flimsy bottlereview/text: I bought two of the Klean Kanteen water bottles after having used Sigg's for awhile and hearing about how they weren't entirely bpa-free. Since the bottles were (Christmas gifts) for my kids, I also got the water tight lids, since they would be tossed in backpacks and lunch bags. 7 months later, both are useless. My daughter's started leaking apparently out a seam that is close the the bottom of the bottle. My son's is so dented on the bottom that it won't stand up on a table (it tips over). Needless to say, I am very disappointed in the quality of the product.
