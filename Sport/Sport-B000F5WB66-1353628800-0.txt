review/summary: One use, and toast.review/text: Received the item, well packed, and shipped quickly, in perfect shape. Threw it on to test it immediately, worked fine. Took it off, and on the next trip to the gym, no HR readout would come up. Went to the gym frustrated, picked up some batteries on the way home since there's no way to tell if the batteries in the transmitter are good or bad. Swapped the batteries in the monitor and the strap for good measure. Still no heartrate, so back to Amazon it goes and trying the Polar brand this time around.
