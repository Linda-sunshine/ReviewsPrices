review/summary: Anti-Glovesreview/text: I purchased these gloves as lightweight driving gloves to wear from the house to the car to the office. I wanted something that would not impair my dexterity and they are thin and form fitting and you can pick up a dime while wearing them and even operate a touch screen. The problem is that, despite the fact that I generally do not have cold hands, I think my hands are actually colder with them on than off.The synthetic palm material actively conducts heat away from your palm and fingers making these gloves very cold in cold air and particularly useless for holding cold objects like a metal tool or a cold steering wheel. I am really unsure under what conditions you would wear these gloves because if it is warm enough to not be bothered by the negative insulation effect, then I don't know why you would be wearing them...they are not really sturdy enough to protect your hands from anything dangerous and while they are not unattractive, they don't look that good.I relegated them to running glove duty but even in this use, my hands got so painfully cold wearing them at about 30F that I had to cut my run short. Simple jersey cotton work gloves do a better job than these of keeping my hands warm.
