review/summary: Safety leash for pedometerreview/text: Item was as described with quick delivery. However, the clamp that attaches to the pedometer isn't strong enough to hold onto the pedometer. It kept popping off and dropping the pedometer. So, I bought a black string type shoelace, tied one end to the pedometer (thought its clamp) and made a big loop on the other end that was big enough to slide the pedometer through. Push that loop through a belt loop and then the pedometer through the shoelace loop. Haven't lost the pedometer yet. Simple and cheap solution.
