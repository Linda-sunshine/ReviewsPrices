review/summary: We like this product!!review/text: Bought these for our grand-daughter's to be used on the firing range. They are lightweight and do a great job protecting their ears from the sound of guns being fired. The girls (9 and 11) really like them as well. Would I recommend this product... absolutely!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they are relatively thick and more difficult to carry and store. Other than they we couldn't be happier.
