review/summary: Great goggles, super affordablereview/text: I love these. However, I am one of those people who have a very high standard for a "perfect" score, if even attainable.When I first jumped into my pool with these, I was immediately impressed. However, after about swimming 10 laps, I did notice a small amount of water seep into the goggles - but I think this may have been because I didn't suck the suction part of the goggle to my face until after I jumped in.Great goggles, great prices. Buy them!
