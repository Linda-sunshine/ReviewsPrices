review/summary: Very good, not exactly what I thought they werereview/text: These gloves are not as warm as I thought they would be, but they provide the best tactile sense I've ever gotten from a glove. Tight fit and compact, they work well in shooting, but do not have extra padding if you are considering them for use with a .454 Casull.
