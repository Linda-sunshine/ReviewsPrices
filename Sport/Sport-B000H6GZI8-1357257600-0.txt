review/summary: Worthy addition... can be difficult to installreview/text: I got this for a Polish P-64. I spent about half an hour just trying to get the darned thing on. After much heating and making fingers sore, I finally got it into place, and I love it. The P-64 is not super-comfortable to shoot, but this helps with ergonomics and aiming tremendously. It is so much easier to get follow-up shots on target now. Highly recommended for any small pistol, but don't expect an easy install.
