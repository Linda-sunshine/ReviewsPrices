review/summary: Poor workmanshipreview/text: The first pair of these that I bought had a 2" long hole in the leg along the seam. I returned them. The second pair turned up with a hole in the crotch after about 35 days. The sewing of these sweatpants is not on a par with the quality of the material. I like the color and the feel of the cloth. These are very comfortable sweatpants. I sewed the hole instead of going through the hassle of another return -- although I'd like to add that my returns through Amazon are always a breeze. I'll keep these, but what a pity when a five-star item gets reduced to two stars because of the poor quality of overseas craftsmanship.A couple of notes: One reviewer said there is not much elastic in the waistline. I didn't find that to be true. Another reviewer said these were a bit snug. I didn't find that the case, either. I like these sweatpants. They are very comfortable in feel and fit. I usually wear large and I ordered large. I'm 5'8", and I imagine these would fit someone up to at least 6' tall as well, as the legs are long; this doesn't bother me, as they have elastic around the ankles.
