review/summary: Plastic lenes not glassreview/text: I ordered this because I was replacing a lost pair. The description says "glass" but this is not true as they sent me a pair with plastic lenes. Wayfarers come in both plastic and glass lenses. I had a pair with what Ray-Ban calls their G-15 lenses (real glass) and you know it when you look thru them.
