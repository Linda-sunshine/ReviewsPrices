review/summary: Ideal "Gentleman's" (and Ladies) Pocket Knifereview/text: Large enough to be useful, but not so big that it's intimidating or a burden to carry, this classic model pocket knife has been in my pocket for decades. In fact, I'm so accustomed to taking this indispensable knife everywhere that I've forgotten to put it in my checked luggage. Several of them have been confiscated at airport security checkpoints.After trying various colors and designs, including ones displaying the American flag, I still gravitate to this red color because it's easy to see and to find and is one of the less-expensive versions. The nail file, small screwdriver, scissors, tweezers, toothpick and blade are all obvious features shown in the illustration. What isn't shown is that how durable, for its size, this knife can be under stress and that the factory will replace the knife under warranty if it fails.So many small items are over-packaged in tough plastic nowadays that having a knife is a virtual necessity to get them open. Tweezers for removing splinters or an unwanted hair is always handy. The scissors and nail file are great for taking care of a broken fingernail when away from home. Even phillips-head screws will submit to the little screwdriver. Having all of this in a lightweight, durable two-inch-long package is not only handy, it's empowering. That's why my wife also carries one of these in her handbag.
