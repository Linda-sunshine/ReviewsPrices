review/summary: Awesome and so versatilereview/text: First of all the pre seasoning is fantastic because it is all around. The combo cooker gives you two great cast iron pans with endless uses. The other day I made cast iron cornbread in the smaller pan and it was so easy to just wipe up the mess and the cornbread gets crusty all around. Iv also made butter steak with the small pan which came out with the best crust on a steak I have ever had. The deeper pan is perfect for making stews or braising meats. I still haven't full utilized it but I cant wait.
