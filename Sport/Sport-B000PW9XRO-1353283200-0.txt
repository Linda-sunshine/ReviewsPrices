review/summary: They feel like they "clip" on and work iPhonereview/text: I rarely write a review, but when I love a product, I do. I have a skin condition on my hands which causes them to crack and bleed badly. I hate wearing gloves because they usually don't come bigger than large and they are bulky. I researched to find thin gloves with dexterity and found these. When you are putting them on and get them just past 3/4 the way on, they seem to pop on perfectly. It feels like they clip on and my hand is in there perfectly. I have great dexterity and can forget that I have them on. They look great and I can use my iPhone with them on. It's not with great precision, but I can swipe to answer and do very basic iPhone things. I do own guns and can easily get my fingers in the trigger guard even on my pocket 9 and 380. I am not a cop, gladly my package was of sufficient size such that I do not need a badge.
