review/summary: Great, inexpensive air bedreview/text: This air bed is great for the price. The built-in pump allows you to add air easily. I found that if I use it more than a couple nights in a row, I needed to add air, but it was very convenient with the built-in pump. The pump is noisy, but that is to be expected. Twin sheets fit well. The top is quite bumpy when fully inflated, so you can let some air out, or add a mattress topper for more comfort. I do no care for the built-in pillow, so I just sleep with my head at the other end. My teenage son has also used it, and loves the built-in pillow, so I'm sure that is a personal preference. Overall, I'm very satisfied. It inflates and deflates in a matter of minutes, and come with a storage pouch that it will fit into easily.
