review/summary: Comfy Undiesreview/text: I have had a few pairs of these briefs for years now. They are my favourites. When they went on sale recently I decided to stock up and discard all my other "lesser" brands. They are comfy, last a long time, dry quickly, don't get smelly and even look good. I have some ExOfficio shirts and pants and they have all served me well.
