review/summary: Some of the best underwear...review/text: Next to some anti-microbial, moisture wicking, flame retardant underwear I wore while deployed, this stuff is the best thing going. Spending an entire day working outside in the summer AZ sun can be brutal, but these boxers did a better job of keeping the moisture away than any cotton boxers would have. There were times while traveling that I also tested the &#34;wash and wear&#34; theory, washing them at the end of the day and hanging them to dry for the next day. Worked very well. Using a towel to gently wring out excess moisture, these dried overnight and worked great the next day. The few times I ended up having to wear the same pair for multiple days, they still did a great job of keeping me dry without smelling too foul. After many positive experiences with my first pair, I ended up buying four pair total.I also wear these daily to work as well as out working on the property. Having retired from the military, I now work in an office that requires business casual. The flat seams and smooth fit make them extremely comfortable under slacks.All in all, it is really hard find a better pair of moisture wicking underwear. I can highly recommend these if you don't need a flame retardant capability.
