review/summary: Great little machinereview/text: It works as described. It is easy to set up and does record your steps in almost any place on your person. This is the fifth one of these my family has owned. Only had to replace when one got lost in a slot canyon in Utah. One went through the wash, but took out the battery and dried it out, put back the battery and reprogrammed it and it was good to go.
