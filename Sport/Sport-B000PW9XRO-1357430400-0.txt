review/summary: The Glove OJ Should of Wornreview/text: So far these are the best gloves I have worn and they're great to wear on a daily basis without having to take them off. I am glad I got the XX-Large because I have big hands with long fingers and they fit perfectly. If you're someone who doesn't want to leave fingerprints behind, these are the gloves for you.
