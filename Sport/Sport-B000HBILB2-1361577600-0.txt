review/summary: fairreview/text: I am not sure whether I should inflate the bed for 4 minute as instruction said, after two minute the sound of the pump make me feel like it's going to explode so I turn it off. The bed need re-inflate every two days because it gradually deflate I don't know if it's normal or not. This is my first air bed, in general the price was fair and the quality is fair.
