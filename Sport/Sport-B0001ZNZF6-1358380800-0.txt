review/summary: Traveling Boxers....review/text: Simply the best product that I am aware of on the market, especially if you travel...I've used this ExOfficio product exclusively since discovering them in 2005. My only negative comment is not about the boxers themselves, but that I cannot buy matching tees because at 6'7&#34;, I need a tall size, which does not seem to be available.
