review/summary: Perfect for gloves and pocketsreview/text: I bought these for skiing and general snow play and they worked wonderfully in both instances. Fit them in your glove or jacket pocket after you 'break' them in and they provide general warmth for a number of hours. Its not intense heat and its definitely localized to where the sit. so bear that in mind. Unless you stick them all over, they wont warm your whole body.they are pretty cheap and I keep a set in the car in case I forget my jacket and have to be outdoors.
