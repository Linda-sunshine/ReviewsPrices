review/summary: Great product, but getting smallerreview/text: I've been buying boxes of these handwarmers for years now, mostly for my daughter who has raynaud's. They work fantastically, better than any of the other similar products I've tried, and absolutely do stay warm for the whole working day. However, the most recent shipment I received (december 2012) contained significantly smaller pockets than previous ones. The outer foil packaging was actually larger, with the seal orientation changed so that you have to open each package individually, which I don't mind at all and think it smart so that you don't accidentally open both if you only need one. However, the actual warmer was smaller and flatter, and considering that this most recently box was the most expensive this product's ever been, I'm somewhat disappointed that the company made the choice to cut the size of these handwarmers. Still recommended, but it'll be irksome if it keeps happening.
