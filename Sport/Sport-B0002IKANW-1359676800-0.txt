review/summary: I'll never dry-fire a gun without these again!review/text: I'm not a huge gun nut, but I do own a couple handguns. These snap-caps are a heaven-send for all the times I've needed to dry-fire a weapon and was afraid of hurting something. They do a great job of cushioning the firing pin and have lasted very well. I recommend these if you're new to shooting and wish to get comfortable with the functions of your firearm, including the trigger feel, before you get involved with &#34;live&#34; rounds. All in all, a great value and Amazon had them at the best price I could find!
