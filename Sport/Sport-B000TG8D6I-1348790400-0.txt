review/summary: P90Xreview/text: P90X is touted as a way to get a beach body. I'm happy to just exercise. I'm no athlete but this set gets me up and moving. My first goal was to just finish each set at the minimum level. I did ok with that. Now I'm expanding ever so slowly. It'll be a lot more than 90 days to a beach body but at least I'm exercising and this set of DVD's gives me enough of a range with each exercise to continue to grow my goals for years. It's a great product.
