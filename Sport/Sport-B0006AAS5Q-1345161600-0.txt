review/summary: Not as picturedreview/text: The Invicta 9212 watch pictured on Amazon has a bar at each hour on the face. The watch I received did not have bars at the 3 an 9 position. In my research I found that the difference in appearance was an indication that the chronograph movement has been changed from the original version of the watch which is pictured on Amazon. The original version had a Miyota OS20 movement, with the large second hand at rest until you activate the chrono function. The watch I received had the large second hand continuously running, which indicates an inferior chronograph movement. I returned the watch. Buyer beware.
