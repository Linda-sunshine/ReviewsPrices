review/summary: Coleman Grillreview/text: I really like Colemans road trip grill for a number of reasons. One I like its size and ease of storeing,the side trays for holding dishes, being able to use a small 1 lb propane bottle.And most of all how fast it cooks everything to a 'T&#34;. Also it's a tailgaters perfect grillfor the weekend.
