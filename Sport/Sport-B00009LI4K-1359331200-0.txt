review/summary: Two happy customersreview/text: We bought these earmuffs so we could take on chainsawing and chipping around the house. The sounds were greatly reduced. Our ears didn't ring after the yard work. We used ear plugs before, but those were a hassle to take in and out with gloves and dirty hands.These fit well on my and my wife. They were comfortable even after four hours and as a bonus kept our ears warm while we were working with these this January.
