review/summary: Solid construction, flexible usereview/text: This is one solidly built product. The tough plastic has expanding brass threaded inserts, which allow the screws to easily be tensioned to the desired setting, while providing long life. Overall, a very flexible and durable product. It does take more effort to assemble and mount than most mirrors, but it is well worth it!
