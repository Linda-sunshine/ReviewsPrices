review/summary: Love this thing!!!review/text: This is my first dutch oven and although some reviews talk about having the pan/skillet as an awkward combo to the pot of this tag team, I'm actually okay with this. I've used this so far to make a stew instead of using my slow cooker as it's worked great since I used the top to brown my meat and vegetables before throwing it into the pot and then some stock and water and then covering it with the pan I just used. Better efficiency of using stuff I'm already cooking with. I had planned to try baking bread with this thing but as far as cast iron it's relative easy to clean and haven't seen any issues with this type of cooking instrument. The size is just right for your standard 2 to 3 serving meal. Would recommend if you're into cast iron cooking (that means you don't just cook with this but have to understand how to cook with cast iron as well as taking care of it).
