review/summary: Functional and colorful yoga matreview/text: I am in love with this yoga mat. Our living room has a wood floor, so this thick and cushy mat comes in handy when I'm working out to a video or lifting weights in that room. I also got a darker color so that I could lay it on the back porch to tan on in the summer months. :) After a year of regular use, this mat is probably too slick to use for yoga (at least, it is for my sweaty hands), but it's held up nicely to workout abuse from me, so I won't complain.
