review/summary: love em!review/text: These ray bans are awesome. Great classic look that can make any geek look cool! The lenses are very soothing on the eyes and with a little tweeking of the frames the fit is great. The reason I don't give em5 stars is because of the design your going to get some side glare. If your looking for perfect vision you need more of a wrap style frame. Oh and the lenses are very scratch resistant. Would I buy them again? Yes! I'm on my second pair. Also I think under $100 for a pair is a great price!
