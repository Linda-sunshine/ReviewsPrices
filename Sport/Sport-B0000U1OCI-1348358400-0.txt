review/summary: My first pedometerreview/text: As promised, it was very easy to program. The clips work very well, even with my overhanging waist fat! My only "want" would be an on and off button. I would also like someone to explain how it knows I'm taking a step: put it on my waistband and it 'knows'? It's voodoo magic to me, LOL
