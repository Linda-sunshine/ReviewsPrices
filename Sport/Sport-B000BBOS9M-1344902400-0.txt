review/summary: Perfect pillow on the goreview/text: I got the pillow in medium and it's the perfect size. It's really spiffy how it can roll up into itself and how it has a drawstring as well. It really did surprise me how fluffed up it got (maybe even *too* fluffy, but I prefer flat pillows!) after I unrolled it and let it sit for a couple of minutes. I've washed this 2x so far without it going flat or it getting clumped up, so all the negative comments might be a quality control issue... Maybe let it sit out longer?
