review/summary: Love this!review/text: I have been using this pedometer every day for 9 months and I absolutely love it. I just had to change the battery about 3 weeks ago so the battery life is decent. Easy to use. I used google to find my stride length based on my height. The instructions on how to measure your stride length are kind of confusing.
