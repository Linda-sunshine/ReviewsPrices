review/summary: Great for Unexpected Cold Weather Situations!review/text: When I got my package ofEmergency Mylar Thermal Blankets (Pack of 10)(Yes, ALL 10 Blankets were included!) I immediately distributed several of them (in a car trunk, in glove compartment and into my bags. Soon I was caught coming home in what began like a warm day - so I was lightly dressed. I took this blanket out of my bag and wrapped it around my chest. The immediate positive effect was that it insulated me from the cold wind, which definitely prevented me from catching cold. So, this purchase paid for itself right away!
