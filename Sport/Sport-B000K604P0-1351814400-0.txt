review/summary: Plastic bottom crackedreview/text: The Thermos kept my coffee hot all day long and I was very happy for the first week. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the cheap plastic base. The base of the Thermos is made of some cheap plastic material that cracked in the first week. If it wasn't for that plastic base, I would have given it 5 stars.I did not drop it...
