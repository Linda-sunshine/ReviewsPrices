review/summary: Slippery!review/text: This mat is thick and good sized. But, it is way too slippery! I have used maybe 5-10 different yoga mats in my practice, and this is the first time I've had this problem. I do not recommend this mat unless you are only using it for padding. I need to purchase a new mat, or figure out some way to make this one less slippery, because it is unusable as is.
