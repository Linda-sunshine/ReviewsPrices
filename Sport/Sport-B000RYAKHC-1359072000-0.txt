review/summary: bright, good blink rate (not slow but not super-frantic) and long battery lifereview/text: I have been using this for about 3 months and even with light being left on or accidentally getting turned on in bag I have still not had to swap out batteries yet. The LED's are bright. The flash rate makes it very noticeable without quite crossing the line into being annoying. And the mounting: versatile, durable, holds light well in place even through flipping bike completely over, and most importantly it is not stiff and shows no sign of weakness from being removed daily. No stiff, cheap plastic here. As a lifetime biker I very highly recommend this, especially to other MTB riders and commuters who need something capable of either taking a beating or being removed often.
