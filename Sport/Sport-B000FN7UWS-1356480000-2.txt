review/summary: Handy car water bottlereview/text: My son wanted to keep himself hydrated when he ran errands or was on the way to and from work. This water bottle is the best solution for anyone on the go. Never spills. Doesn't break. Very handy and compact. My son would take a sip then toss the bottle into the back seat without worry of breakage or leaks. I have yet to replace this water bottle because it's that durable.
