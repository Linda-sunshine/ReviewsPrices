review/summary: I would buy againreview/text: This is a great bottle for the bike. I MTB in New England throughout the year and this is my primary bottle. I use a Camelbak for water and keep an electrolyte repalecment drink in the bottle. I really see a diference in temp with this bottle. Not so much in cooler months, but huge difference in the summer. I had two bottle mounts when i got this one and it was worth the extra money. Because of the insulation, the 24oz bottle seems to be the same size as a 28oz bottle that is NOT insulated. It is the biggest bottle I can fit on my new FS MTB. Bottom line... it is a great bottle that works as it should. I will buy another. The easy cleaninf nipple it great.
