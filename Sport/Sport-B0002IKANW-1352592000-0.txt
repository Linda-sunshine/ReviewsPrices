review/summary: Work Perfectly & Important Safety Devicereview/text: These work flawlessly and I think everyone should have dummy rounds as an educational tool. I think they're an incredibly valuable tool for helping a new shooter become familiar and comfortable with a new pistol - semi-auto or revolver. I highly recommend.
