review/summary: ZERO STARreview/text: This is my worst watch ever. PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE STRESS AND SAVE YOUR MONEY. This watch started changing color day 2, not only changing the gold colour but even the stainless steel. Nice looking watch but such a waste of money, i cant even give it out as a gift cos it looks all scratched up now. SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY ON AN OTHERWISE GOOD LOOKING WATCH.
