review/summary: Very nice mirrorreview/text: Nice mirror, good field of view, nice adjustability. I have two problems with it: 1) you always have to turn it in when you are storing your bike due to the fact that it makes your handlebars that much wider, and 2) it occasionally comes a bit loose and I have to snug it up with an allen key. Other than that, it is the best mirror I have come across for my bicycle. I am a city rider so a rear view mirror is absolutely indespensable. This piece is solid and well made, I've been using it for about a year and a half and it is still working fine.
