review/summary: Raving Fanreview/text: Underwear isn't something I would have thought could be much different from one brand to another - but these ExOfficio briefs are great. I purchased several pairs of these about 5 years ago and they have been great. Recently, I finally had to purchase some additional pairs. There was no decision to make - it was right back to ExOfficio. Although they cost a little more, they are extremely comfortable and last much longer than standard briefs.
