review/summary: Nervous twitchers beware!review/text: This pedometer is tops and was even rated #1 in Consumer Reports. I've only been using it for a few days and I'm very happy with it. Just be mindful that if you have &#34;sewing machine leg&#34; like I do (i.e, you nervously bounce your leg up and down as you sit at your desk) be sure not to have the device in the cargo pants pocket of the leg that you twitch. I accidently racked up almost 1000 &#34;steps&#34; before I made the connection :)
