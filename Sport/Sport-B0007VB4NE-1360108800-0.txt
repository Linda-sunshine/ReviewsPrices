review/summary: Great desk chairreview/text: I ordered this for my home office and have used it regularly (5-6 hours/day) for a week now. So far, so good! It's much better than the old desk chair I had. I was looking for something more comfortable and functional since I spend most of my time working from home.I'm 5'0" and the ball and chair are a good working height for me. I give the ball a few pumps every other day or so. I find it makes a big difference and that extra inch of height helps when I'm typing at the computer.The chair was easy to assemble -- I had the chair put together and the ball inflated in about 15 minutes or so.
