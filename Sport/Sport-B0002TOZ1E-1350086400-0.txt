review/summary: The only socks I wear in the fall/winterreview/text: The gold toe socks are perfect for me, I generally have very cold feet in the fall and winter and nylon socks just don't do it for me. I picked these up from a store last winter and they have been a blessing. Now these are the only socks I wear. They keep my feet warm without adding thickness to my feet, so my shoes still fit the same as they did earlier. They seems to be made pretty well, no tearing or threading so far. Love these!
