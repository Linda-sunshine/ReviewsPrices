review/summary: A MUST HAVE!!!review/text: This is a must have for any LEO!! Recieved the wrong size at first but Amazon quickly sent another when I messaged them. Theses gloves are a good tight fit, keep the chill off you fingers, and allows for maximum grip. Perfect for quick patdowns of suspects, does not intervene with shooting, and amazing for those long hours directing traffic at 2 am when its 12 degrees outside. Hope everyone else enjoys as much as I have.
