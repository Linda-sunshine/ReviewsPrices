review/summary: This is a thumb saverreview/text: I have arthritis in my hands and love to play cards. It came to the point I could no longer shuffle multiple decks and this does the job well. I have used it for about a year now and the only thing I have had to do is replace the batteries once. It even works on plastic cards.
