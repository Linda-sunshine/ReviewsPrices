review/summary: Absolutely NO Support - Ripoff in my Viewreview/text: The Omron device is certainly robust and perfectly acceptable. The software, however, is very poorly written and supported: think Windows 95 to get an idea of how antiquated this software really is. Once you have it installed (and that took considerable time searching the internet for a download site), pray that you do not have a computer glitch as did I. Trying to re-install the software was virtually impossible and finding even a modicum of support for the device proved the same. BEWARE! There are far better SUPPORTED devices on the market than this pedometer.Omron HJ-720ITFFP Pocket Pedometer with Advanced Omron Health Management Software
