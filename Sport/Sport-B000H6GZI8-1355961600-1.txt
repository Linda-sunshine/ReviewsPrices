review/summary: tore during installationreview/text: I didn't have a good experience with this product. I followed the instructions closely, but somehow tore the grip during installation. My experience is probably due to my extremely huge muscles and lack of patience. For 7 dollars it isn't really worth returning and I'll never buy this model again.
