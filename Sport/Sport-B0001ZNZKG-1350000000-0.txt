review/summary: 2 years on, still going strongreview/text: I initially purchased 2 pair of these for a trip to Thailand over 2 years ago. They worked perfectly, I would wear one for a few days then hand wash and pin to the outside of my pack to dry while I slipped into the other pair. They are very comfortable and also durable! Fast forward to present day: they show very few signs of wear and are still my favorite pair of undies to slip into. I will be purchasing more.
