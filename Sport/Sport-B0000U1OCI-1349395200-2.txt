review/summary: great pedometerreview/text: Works really well. Very reliable & robust. Gives good, accurate readings - it's really useful to be able to see the number of steps you have done in the last seven days. Great to have distance setting in miles instead of kilometers. Best pedometer I have had, I bought a second one for a friend!
