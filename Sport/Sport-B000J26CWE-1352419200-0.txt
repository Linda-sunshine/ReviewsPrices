review/summary: Absolutely a must with Vibrams!review/text: They say that you don't have to wear socks with vibrams however I do NOT recommend it, you only get a few days use and they start to stink. These socks extend the use before having to wash the shoes. They are comfortable, and watch out on linoleum or other smooth surface because you will be doing a Tom Cruise slide if you don't pay attention. Extrememly comfortable and they seem very durable I have had a pair for about 7 or 8 months and wear them quite frequently.If you are military tho you can actually get a better deal at a Navy Exchange, a few dollars off and you get them without having to wait. Found this out AFTER we order them lol
