review/summary: Works Greatreview/text: To make a long story short: My bike pal and I ride a lot every week. He got same mirror installed at local Trek shop and liked it. I ordered from Amazon. Took a few minutes to install. Fit nicely on my Trek handle bar. A great and needed safety feature. Not a problem of fit when I load bike on car rack. No problem with it hitting things as I ride. Buy it.
