review/summary: Problems with crown functions...2nd one in a rowreview/text: I have ordered two of these watches in the last 3 weeks and both of them did not function properly.I unscrewed the crown out to the first position (Hand Wind Position), and it does not hand wind, it only spins freely and does not function. The date position works fine. The 3rd position (Hand Position Adjustment) the second hand remains ticking while you are trying to adjust the hands to the correct time which makes it impossible to set the watch to the exact time that you wish. Also, if you move the hands backwards, the second hand will actually tick counterclockwise. This is unacceptable!I sent the first one back immediately and then the 2nd one arrived and it's having the same exact issues. I contacted Invicta directly and that is a waste of time, unless you are OK with paying to ship it to them, and then waiting 3 months to get it back or hear from them.
