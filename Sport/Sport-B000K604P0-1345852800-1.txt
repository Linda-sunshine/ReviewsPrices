review/summary: Incredible!review/text: I brewed tea in this thermos at about 8pm and fell asleep on it just a bit later. When I woke up, I accidentally kicked it off of the drink stand and it didn't spill a drop. Opened it up at around 3PM intending to reheat, and it was still warm! Great thermos.
