review/summary: What a Beautiful Watch!review/text: First of all, the watch arrived on time.Right out of the box, I was impressed. This diver is not too big or too small. I've got small hands and small wrists and it sits very nicely after having two links removed.I've been wearing it now for the last few hours and can't wait to show it off at work tomorrow! The black dial is sharp and this particular Invicta certainly appears to be a lot more expensive than it really is. As a matter of fact, I've already had one person ask if it was a Rolex! The second hand sweeps smoothly and the minute and hour hands are just sweet. The clear back is a really cool feature as well. There's nothing cooler than seeing your watch's guts!This is my second diver. My other one is a blue Orient Mako and I think that this guy will get just as many compliments.Normally I am not a fan of Invicta watches. I find most of them to be over the top tacky. This one, however, hits the spot. It's got a classy look, a nice fit, and I look forward to turning some heads tomorrow!
