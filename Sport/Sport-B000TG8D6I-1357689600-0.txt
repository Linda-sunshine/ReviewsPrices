review/summary: p90xreview/text: First off, i would like to say that this is a great product...Ok, so p90x is suppose to transform your body in 90 days and it will do just that.However there are some important things that i would like to cover.I have been working out for close to 10 years. I dont claim to be the most amazing athlete or a body builder by any means but i do know what im doing in a gym.I am going to start off by saying that this is not for begginers. Of course p90x is ment to challenge you physically and mentally and if you are a begginer it might start off by being to much, all though you can go off at your own pace.This is also not just a disc that you can pop in and start doing. You will need to have somewhere to do pull ups and have a good amount of dumbells. You can also buy bands for this if you wish but i would reccomend buying multiple weight bands for the different excersise.Each work out is about 45 minutes to an hour long with a couple 30 second breaks to a minute long.The diet guide in this is also pretty nice. It is easy to follow along and has some pretty good recipes in there. this also comes with a calender showing you when to do what work out and what to eat that day. It pretty much tells you everything from how to do it and when to do it.Pros-hardtells you everythingpretty decent pricereally workscons-need to buy some equipment
