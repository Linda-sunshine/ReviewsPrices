review/summary: Went Cross country with 2 bikes - needs better support and some modificationsreview/text: Pros: Easy to put on the car, easy to take off, stores well (small), light weight but strong.Cons: Roller pads on the bottom cover our license plate can be an issue if you're pulled over. The straps that are supposed to hold the bike on the rack actually do not hold the bikes unless you flip the them. When you flip them you find that the straps are secure and wont come loose as easily because you just put them the way they should have been in the first place. Otherwise you're straps will come loose with just a few rides on the car seems like a mfg oversight?I feel that it needs a better support (more or larger hooks on the trunk so it doesn't just pull from the 2 straps to make it more sturdy). Noticed that when the bikes are on the rack, the 2 straps that hook to the trunk bend our car's trunk a bit, so far it has gone back in shape, but I'm not sure how it'll hold up overtime.Overall decent buy, petty good for the price, my DH went cross country in the car with our two bikes on the rack (with the above changes. Don't know if I'd buy it again, we'll probably just get roof racks on our car eventually.
