review/summary: Good quality , not very good size for people with small hands.review/text: Good product ,I like the looks and texture of the grip .Installed on M&P 15-22, fits perfectly . I have medium size hands and this grip is slightly big for me .I wish that it would be slightly smaller .Not going to buy it again. Gave 5 stars , If I had large hands this grip would be perfect.
