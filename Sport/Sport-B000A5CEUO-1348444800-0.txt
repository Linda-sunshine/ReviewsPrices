review/summary: Flatlinerreview/text: As other reviewers have noted, it takes a loooooong time before the monitor even begins reading a pulse, no matter how much spit or sweat or gel you use. Worse, it died completely after about a dozen bike rides despite impact free use, careful cleaning and storing after every outing. I would not recommend this product.
