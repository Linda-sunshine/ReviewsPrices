review/summary: Perfect for Target Shootingreview/text: I bought these for target shooting. They are the highest earmuff protection in the price range I looked at. I usually double it with ear plugs since indoor target shooting can be loud. One draw back is that it's a bit big and I wish it can be fold it smaller. Otherwise, really happy about the quality.
