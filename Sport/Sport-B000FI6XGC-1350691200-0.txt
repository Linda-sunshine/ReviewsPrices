review/summary: It's a convenient portable pump, but...review/text: It almost destroyed one of the tires's Schrader valve! You have to be real careful because this pump can have a tight grip on the valve and you won't be able to detach it once you're done pumping the tire or else it'll almost rip out the valve. I got it this afternoon and tried to put some air in my bike tires and that's what I observed. You have to use it real careful when taking the pump off the valve. Lastly, it does take a little bit of more work to pump air into tires using this device. I guess you could say I'm outta shape 'cause I broke into a sweat after pumping only two tires.Now, to go from Presta to Schrader wasn't that big of a deal since I saw a YouTube video demo of how to work this [and other] Topeak pump(s). That's actually pretty nifty and easy to use. It's also very lightweight and surprisingly sturdy. The price was very reasonable.Overall, it's an okay device as long as you're aware that it can damage your tires if you're not real careful with it.
