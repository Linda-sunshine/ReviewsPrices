review/summary: Defective helmet out of the boxreview/text: Based on decent review, I just purchased this product yesterday, and received today. Hooray for the fast delivery, but man my happiness didn't last long because I found a defective helmet when I opened the box. The black plastic piece that attaches to the rear of the helmet had come off while shipping I think. Glue was poorly holing the pieces together and the styrofoam which is pretty much the helmet itself is very cheaply made. I gave a light fingernail poke and it almost made a cut itself, but left a visible nail scar. I called customer service immediately and agent offered to send a replacement overnight if I send them pictures and proof of purchase. I just sent the email back and am waiting for the replacement.I tried it on anyway to see how it fits, and it was pretty comfy with head adjust. Light too. Just wish it wasn't as poorly made.The whole gluing is very visible from outside. I wonder how long this will last, but then I once again realized that most of the time YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.Will use the replacement for a while, and will update this review. But for now, 2 stars.
