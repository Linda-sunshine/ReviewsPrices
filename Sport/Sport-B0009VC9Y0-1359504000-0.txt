review/summary: New favoritereview/text: I have always been a Gerber knife fan until a coworker showed me the Leek. I must say that I am now a Kershaw man. I have had one of these knives for a few years now and the blade is just as sharp after many uses as it was when I bought it. I have since purchased 2 more and will keep getting them as gifts for others (and myself).As a side note, the Speed Safe is great for 1-handed opening, but the lock can occasionally engage without knowing which can be pretty frustrating if you have your hands full. I now take off the safe lock as soon as I get one of these knives to avoid this problem. All you need is a small star key. So far I haven't had any problems with the knives opening unexpectedly without the lock.Highly recommend these knives.
