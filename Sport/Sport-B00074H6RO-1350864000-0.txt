review/summary: Wouldn't Use Any Other Glovereview/text: I have been using these gloves for years and I have no complaints. My hands are quite soft and I have no desire to callus them all up. Say what you want about that but it's true. It also lets me concentrate on my lifts more as it makes it easier to retain a grip when lifting several hundred pounds. I usually buy these gloves as they are readily available at most stores around the area like Walmart and Dick's. However they are horribly overpriced at those locations. The stores don't usually sell the tan gloves either so I am trying those out and so far they are nice. The gloves I am replacing are the same model but black color and I have used them for about 2 years. Those gloves were shredded but they still kept on chugging along.
