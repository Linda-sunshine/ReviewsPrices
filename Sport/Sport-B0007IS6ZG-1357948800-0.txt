review/summary: Good Quality, Not that I can Judgereview/text: I'm new to jumproping, so me reviewing this product after a few weeks of use might be no good to anyone, but it seems to do well. The rope is resisting stretching out when I accidently step on it, the handles are comfortable to hold. I mean, its a jumprope, are there more ways to assess it than either 'yep it sure is a jumprope' or 'no its actually not a jumprope'? I wouldn't be the one to tell you. I was tempted to take another star off for hittimg myself in the face with it the first time I tried to use it, but its unfair to blame that on the jumprope I guess.
