review/summary: LOVE THE PRICE AND QUALITYreview/text: Installation was easy, at times the supplied screws are super tight which I thought would snap the supplied allen wrench, but it didn't. The modification of my handle rubber grip took majority of the install. The mirror looks good and it feels strudy enough to last for a long time. Overall I would recommend this. For the price of $9.00 how can you go wrong?
