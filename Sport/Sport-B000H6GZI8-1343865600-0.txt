review/summary: great gripreview/text: I really like this grip for my LC9. It is very easy to install. I had to trim a small amount for a better fit and then went to the range for some fun. It is more comfortable to shoot now making it easier to shoot more rounds without getting tired and losing accuracy. Overall I am very satisfied and will recommend it to others.
