review/summary: Sharp!review/text: Awesome knife, came with an edge you can shave with. Seems to be holding up well although I don't like to use it for fear of it getting dull. I suppose investing in a good sharpener would help.If you want to flip the belt clip take care to not strip the screws. Mine was not well tapped and stripped the screw. They are apparently a #2-56 thread in case anyone needs to find a replacement. I stole one off my leatherman that this knife replaced.Love the knife, Highly recommended.
