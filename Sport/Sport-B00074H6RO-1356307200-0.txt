review/summary: Great Glovesreview/text: I think these are a great pair of gloves for the money. Some people say the sizes run small. They should be a snug fit. They will go on fairly easily, but, be a little difficult to pull off (especially when they are brand new). They will stretch out a little bit after a couple weeks of regular use. If they are loose, you will have the leather in the palm bunch up between your hand and the bar. That is extremely uncomfortable and adversly affects your grip. Hear me now and believe me later.
