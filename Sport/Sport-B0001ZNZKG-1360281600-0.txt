review/summary: NIce, nice, very nice.review/text: These are great if you are a traveller. Honestly, I think I could go on a long vacation with just a couple pair of these. Wash them up in the sink at night, they are usually completely dry by morning. Also, they are VERY comfortable! No binding or chafing, don't bunch up either. Waistband comfortable, too. Honestly, these are the most comfortable underwear I own!
