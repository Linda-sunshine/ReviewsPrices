review/summary: Cupholder Friendlyreview/text: Finally, Nalgene came out with a cupholder friendly bottle. I spend a fair amount of time in my car during rush hour. I found that I was drinking more soda than water as the soda cans would fit into my cupholder. With this new bottle, I have changed and now drink water during my 45 minute commute. I recommend this product to anyone!
