review/summary: Mylar thermal blanketreview/text: This delivery was prompt- HOWEVER- I have opened 3 so far and all of the 3 are not cut properly and are torn on one side. If you have ever worked with his item you know that it will tear very quickly if there is the slightest cut. The first is in the garbage and the other 2 had to be taped. I have to assume that the other 7 are the same.
