review/summary: I can not recommend these shortsreview/text: I have other short of this type for working out at the gym and I find the waist band on the Champion Mesh Short With Pockets is not a tight as the waist band on the Champion Rugby Short with pockets or the Russel Mesh Short with Pockets that I purchased in a local sporting goods store and it is for that reason that I can not recommend this product.
