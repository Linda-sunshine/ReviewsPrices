review/summary: great knifereview/text: This is a great lil knife. My son worked at a sports store where I first saw it. I liked it and so I bought one (with his employee discount ... Lol) I carried it for almost a year. Then I lost it. I found it again after almost 2 months at the bottom of my wood pile. It looked and operated the same as the last time as I used it. I have since lost it again and instead of looking all over Gods creation for it, I ordered another one........It came with a razor sharp edge and holds it very well. It feels well in my hand. This is a fine knife for under $40 (well, that's what I bought it for) I can hardly wait to have one in my pocket again....
