review/summary: VERY sturdy!review/text: My kids don't do tricks on their scooters, so I can't say anything about that, but I will say that the ones we have were definitely worth it. Our younger daughter got a pink one for Christmas last year and a year later, it is still in working condition and rides smoothly. You can probably read that in 100 other reviews, but the main reason I wanted to write one was because my husband actually ran over the scooter with his truck (both sets of wheels) and the thing still works. I'm not sure which part he ran over, but the kids had left it out one day. I had to break up so many fights between my girls (since they both wanted to ride it) that I'm glad my older daughter got her own this year. My kids are 8 and 10 and really get a lot of use out of these. I recommend this product!
