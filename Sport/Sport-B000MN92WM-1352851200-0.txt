review/summary: Great Productreview/text: Purchased this to keep track of my steps each day. It is extremely accurate for both regular and aerobic steps. It also lets you know the number of minutes it took to do your aerobic steps so you can figure your walking speed. Entered my stride length and walked 4 laps around the local HS track. Gave me a reading of .99 mile. Have downloaded data several times and have experienced no problems. I've only had it a month but have had no problems and I'm looking forward to many more. My last 2 pedometers purchased from my pharmacy provided very little data and didn't last very long.
