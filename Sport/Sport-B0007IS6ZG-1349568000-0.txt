review/summary: Great!review/text: I really like this rope! I am tall and whenever I would use a rope at the gym it would be too short and that would make it difficult to jump rope. This rope is great because you can adjust the length of the rope and the handles of the rope aren't hard plastic so it doesn't hurt your hands. I love that I can jump for longer intervals with this rope because of its adjust-ability! Definitely a good buy because I haven't had any complaints or problems!
