review/summary: Durable long lasting and very handyreview/text: i have had the same swiss army knife for almost a decade now and i have had no problems with it what so ever i have had a lot of time using most of the tools on it the knifes hold an excellent edge, the file is well a file, the saw is awesome it cuts through just about anything i cut through a 2x4 very quick with no problem at all, the scaler works(but i have only used it once), the pliers are probably the best tool on the knife, the magnifying glass is okay a little small i really have no use for it but I'm glad its there, the pen doesn't always work first time but it does eventually(black ink btw). those are just some of the tools on it it has some other great features that i didnt get to. But bottom line is if you thinking about buying the knife DO IT!!!:) it will serve you well.
