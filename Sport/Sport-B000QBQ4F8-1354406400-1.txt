review/summary: Great sunglasses - but size mattersreview/text: These are great sunglasses and a good value, although I am no expert in this area. I only want to add -- to save others the time and trouble -- that the size does matter. I bought my teenage son a pair of 54mm glasses and they were way too big for his head (and he is a normal, 5' 9&#34; 18 year-old). I sent them back and the 50mm pair fit him perfectly. There should be someway to measure one's face to fit these better initially -- and maybe there is and I just don't know of it. So beware: size matters.
