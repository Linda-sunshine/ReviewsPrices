review/summary: Great Little Mirror!review/text: Bought a couple of these for our bicycles.Had to slightly modify my handlebar grip to install.When installed, the mirror is very secure, can be easily adjusted and maintains its position.I guess it's about the perfect size for a bicycle.I wouldn't ride without this mirror now.Highly recommended.
