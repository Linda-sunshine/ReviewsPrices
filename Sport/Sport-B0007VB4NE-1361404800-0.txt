review/summary: Just what I was looking for!review/text: I have an office job and on most days I sit in front of the computer for more than 5 hours. I love this product because I definitely feel myself balancing and straightening my back while sitting. The ball encourages me to move more often and practice what is known as &#34;active seating&#34;. It was really easy to assemble. My only complaint is that the hand air pump is kind of cheap and I had to fix it after only one use.
