review/summary: Very Coolreview/text: The products were exactly as described.I bought these for my church outreach to the homeless and the blankets were individually wrapped and cost a lot less then the other sites I visited. These were perfect for my church to hand out to the people that really needed them and the blankets were very easy to fold back to reuse. They seemed very durable and could handle being outside in the snow or the rain.If I ever need these again, I would definitely buy this type again!!!
