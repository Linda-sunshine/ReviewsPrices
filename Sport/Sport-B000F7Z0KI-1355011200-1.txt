review/summary: Does a pretty good job in insulating, but lid tends to leakreview/text: So this bottle does a pretty good job in insulating cold water. My major problem with this is that for some reason, the lid doesn't always screw on tightly enough. I believe that this is because of the plastic ring handle. So what ends up happening is that even though I would screw the top portion as tight as possible, more often than not, water still leaks out. Sometimes it's a little bit, sometimes its a good amount of water. It is definitely an annoying problem to have.
