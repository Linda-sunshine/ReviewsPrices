review/summary: Snapcapsreview/text: I use these for dry firing and cycling my weapon when working on trigger pull. Knowing these reduce the stress on my gun is nice, but honestly I doubt my gun would break after 100,000 dry fires. Although there are rare instances of it happening, so whatever, I'll use a snap cap. Also it reduces the noise of the trigger pull.Another use is to put these in magazines randomly with live ammo, so when you are firing you can correct any trigger pull issues, such as anticipating recoil.These are very durable, and pretty cheap. I'd recommend buying 5, as I have lost 1 or 2.
