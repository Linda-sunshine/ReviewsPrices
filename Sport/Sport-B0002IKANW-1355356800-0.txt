review/summary: Great productreview/text: The circumference of these caps are a tad bit smaller than a 9mm round but they function perfectly. Exactly what I needed for practicing loading and dry firing. Also helps me at the range by putting in a dummy round in the magazine to help me quit jerking the trigger.
