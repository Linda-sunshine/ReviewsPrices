review/summary: Comfortable but did not last long.review/text: This airbed is great at first. The pump is included inside the bed, so it's easy to pack and travel with. It is comfortable, too. However, I have used it only four times and the bed is already losing air significantly over night. There must be a hole somewhere, but good luck finding it.
