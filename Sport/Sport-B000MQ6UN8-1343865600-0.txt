review/summary: SiZE MATTERSreview/text: I got these for my birthday and they are WAY too big! I've got another pair, so after checking the lens size I saw that I needed the 58mm. I suggest going to a retailer to try them on first and make sure to get the lens size.. just a few mm's make a HUGE difference. Mine were also NOT polarized, even though the RB box says they are.
