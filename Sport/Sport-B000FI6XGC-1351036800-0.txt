review/summary: Nice emergency pumpreview/text: This pump works very well. If fits and holds the stem securely. Attaching pump takes some getting used to, but easy once you get the hang of it. Pumping up 29er MTB tire takes some time (few minutes more or less), but I'm used to using a compressor.I fixed 3 flats using this pump in the last week! That's far more than normal for me. I was pleasantly surprised how well this little pump worked. So far its holding up to the use. I also use it regularly to bring tire pressure up before rides.I especially like the way it mounts to my water bottle screws with the water bottle in place. No extra mounting hardware or bar space needed. Very neat, good looking, light weight, and functional little pump. Highly recommend.
