review/summary: Great feel but don't hold up well.review/text: I purchased two pairs. I live in Florida where the summers are 95 degrees with 90% humidity. You sweat just standing out side.PROS: I use these each weekend while working outside (yard work, exercising, etc). They do work very well on wicking the moisture away and they feel cooler even when your paints and shirt are drenched in sweat. I typically wear a large (size 34 - 36). However, after reading other reviews I ordered Medium. I'm glad I did since these run big. Mediums worked good.CONS: I used these under a pair of heavy cargo shorts while working in my attic. After one week the sides of these boxer started to chafe and show wear. This was after just 3-4 uses. It did not destroy them but did make me realize that these are not durable.I have hand washed these since I have read how they can deteriorate quickly if you put them in the dryer.If you have the $$ to buy these knowing they won't last long then I'd recommend them. They feel great compared to the standard cotton briefs/boxers.
