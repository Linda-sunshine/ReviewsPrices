review/summary: Looks great, works perfect!review/text: as advertised, arrived in perfect condition. I don't have the largest wrist and was easily able to take 3 links out. watch looks great, feels a little light compared to some of my more expensive watches. band is a very light and feels a little cheap. crown is a little difficult to unscrew to set date.time and date holds well overnight, but if you go more than a day without wearing be prepared to set the time. watch lost about 3 minutes first few days.
