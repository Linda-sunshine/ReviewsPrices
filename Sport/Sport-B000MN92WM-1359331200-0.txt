review/summary: No after-purchase product support by Omron for Detachable belt clip replacementreview/text: I have purchased this product for multiple family members. We all love it and have had pretty excellent results. However, more than one of us had our detachable belt clip break. That in itself is no big deal because we have utilized the product daily for a few years...all that bending; twisting; and clipping on and off takes its toll. However, we were upset to be notified by Omron that they do NOT sell a replacement part for this beltclip. Pretty upset about that. Short of buying a new unit, we are out of luck as the product doesn't accurately work except when placed in the clip. And of course, this isn't a warranty issue. BUMMER Omron -> shame on you!
