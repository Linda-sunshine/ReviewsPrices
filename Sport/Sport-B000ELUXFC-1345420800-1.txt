review/summary: Good bike rack- expected quality for costreview/text: I Bought this to carry two bikes back and forth to beach in 2012. The rack is easy to set up, fits well on my Honda accord 2011. The straps seem to be as one would expect- lunch box quality, but they held. I had no issues. My concern is that the strap quality will shorten life of product, but at this price I can buy 2 or three for what other stores want!
