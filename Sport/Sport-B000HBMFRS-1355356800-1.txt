review/summary: Guestroom sub bedreview/text: My mother loved this bed when she stayed over at my home! She is in her 60's and had a wonderful weeks worth of nights on it. She had ordered a sleep number bed for her own home after her stay with me. She did not like it the sleep number so she sent it back and purchased this bed! Haha. Very comfy!
