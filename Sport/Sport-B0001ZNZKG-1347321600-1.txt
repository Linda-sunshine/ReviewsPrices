review/summary: I own 2 pairs and am eventually replacing the rest!review/text: I was looking for some great travel underwear for a trip to Guatemala during the rainy season. I picked up a pair of these to try out. I wish I would've gotten more right off the bat because the pair I had performed beautifully. It gave support where needed, and kept me dry and comfortable all day. I'd wash them in the evening and they'd be dry again by morning. I have since bought a other pair and plan to wear nothing but these, but the price will make it take some time. Don't hesitate, you'll be glad you got these!
