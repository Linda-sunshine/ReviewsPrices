review/summary: Happy So Far...review/text: I think the watch is good looking, but after reading other people's comments I was concerned over the quality of the watch. I was concerned over the watch keeping good time, being waterproof and general overall quality (given a review saying the crown fell out during initial winding). So far I'm happy with the watch and it works well.When I received the watch I put it in a cup of water overnight and then went swimming. The pool is a lap pool and is only 4 feet deep,but so far the watch still works. Like others have mentioned, there is a large &#34;Invicta&#34; engraving on the side of the watch (opposite the crown). While I don't like the idea of it, I actually don't notice it much when wearing the watch. The band is made of soft metal and the clasp does have scratches on it after wearing it about 10 times. So far there haven't been any scratches on the polished links - as mentioned by some. I've had the watch for about three weeks and the watch keeps good time. I haven't spent a lot of effort measuring the exact accuracy, but I think it is slow by about a minute and a half after several weeks.The hour marks (the dots) are smaller than I thought they would be and I would have liked them to be bigger. I needed to put the watch under a bright light for half a minute for it to be seen through the night (it becomes dim after an hour). The glass on the underside allowing me to see the inner workings of the watch is cool.The watch seems old school with the trinite and perpetual winding - but that is what attracted me to the watch - along with it's good looks.There were enough low ratings, with comments of the watch breaking down after a while, that I remain concerned over the watch. If it continues to function well, I'll be very happy with the watch. :)
