review/summary: Purchased for Walking Programreview/text: These pedometers were purchased for a walking program. The only downside has been with people having trouble with them falling off. The clip does not seem to work as well if the person has a thicker mid-section. The pedometers are very accurate, and the memory function is very useful for tracking during the walking program.
