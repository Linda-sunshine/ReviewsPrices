review/summary: Excellent for the pricereview/text: I bought this for $30 from Amazon - more than half the price of the other heart rate monitors. So, what do you get for $30? Well, it measures your heart rate, if you make sure to get the band wet before putting it on your chest. It provides the time/date, a stop watch, an alarm, and a light, in addition to measuring your heart rate. What it doesn't do - provide calorie count, review your workout max/min heart rate, etc. The watch band and watch are pretty big, clunky and heavy, but the read out is large, which is helpful and the buttons are easy to operate and logical in what they do. I use it primarily for biking and works fine for that.
