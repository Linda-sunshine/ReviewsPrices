review/summary: Inconsistent but nicereview/text: We ordered four of these chairs for an event we were hosting and wanted to put these out for people to sit on. The first issue we had was that one of the placstic frames did not have the holes drilled through that you use to attach the back support to so we had to drill through. The second and weird issue was that three of the four balls were smaller than the fourth. They did not fill the space for the frame and sunk through to the ground. It was like the "mold' was changed or something. The fourth was fabulous and we wished they would all have been as useful.I wish the quality would have been higher. Maybe another brand would have been better?
