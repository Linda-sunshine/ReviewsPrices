review/summary: Thermos Soup Containers are the only way to go!review/text: I gave this container 5 stars, because &#34;Thermos&#34; is the only soup/food container my kids have had success with keeping their lunches warm. We have tried many, many different types and brands and I will NEVER go away from Thermos.We chose the blue, because my son doesn't like characters on his stuff so when I found a plain one I bought it. They price was great, as these are rarely found under $15. The container seals, yet is easy for smaller hands to open without adult help.10oz size is perfect for an elementary child's lunchbox.
