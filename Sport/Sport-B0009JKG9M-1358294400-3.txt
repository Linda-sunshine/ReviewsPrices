review/summary: Wonderful! Wish I had done this sooner. :)review/text: There IS a difference when you cook using cast iron, and I wish I had made the switch sooner. I bought the five quart dutch oven and was so pleased, I bought the skillet and am now waiting for this piece to come back in stock so I can buy it also. The dutch oven has been used for everything from roasting chicken to making soups, stews, chili and bread. For a lover of winter comfort foods, it's a dream come true. I like the versatility of starting something on the stove top (stew) and dropping it down into the oven to slow-cook for a few hours making the meat tender as can be. I never made corned beef in the oven before, but this past weekend gave it a try...tender and juicy! After the combo cooker, I'm going for the grill pan :)
