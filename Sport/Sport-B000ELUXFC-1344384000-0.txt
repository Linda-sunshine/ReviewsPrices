review/summary: Works well. Watch for broken foam protectorsreview/text: I purchased the Allen Deluxe 2-Bike rack for my sedan about two months ago, and I've used it on multiple occasions and 5+ hour drives. The bike rack is really secure, and I had no worry that the bikes were going to fall off. However, several of the foam pads have broken off. Also, on one occasion the bike closest to the car managed to get under the lower bar and scratched my bumper up pretty badly. Unfortunately it was a long drive, so I didn't notice that it was touching until a few hours later. It's definitely a good bike rack for the price, but be careful with how you position the bikes and watch for breaking foam padding.
