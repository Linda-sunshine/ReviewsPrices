review/summary: LOVE these.review/text: I now own 2 of these bottles, they are exactly what I was looking for. I work outside most of the time and I needed something that would stay cold on the hot summer days. I actually ended up having to fill this only halfway, freeze it, and then pour liquid over top when I was ready to drink it, because if I filled it to the top and then froze it, it would stay frozen for hours, even sitting in the sun on a hot day! They've held up well all summer, and things don't have that plastic taste, even after freezing. For the price, you just can't beat these. The loop on top is also a huge help, since I work with dogs and have to stash it out of their reach on a tree branch or fence post.
