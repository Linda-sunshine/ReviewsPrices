review/summary: Love it (and arrows aren't that bad either)review/text: After reading all the reviews, had some concern especially about the arrows, but decided to take the chance for my 12 yo daughter's birthday. Her desire for one escalated after Hunger Games came out so, even though I had no clue what to get, decided to get an inexpensive starter set.Firstly, the bow quality and power. Works very well, very good quality for this price in my book. Was slightly concerned that it would be too weak for her, but it's perfect - not too hard to pull, and not too toyish either. It doesn't have so much power that I have to be as worried about an errant arrow flying over the fence, given at least that she's a pretty responsible girl (I told her that if just one arrow went over the fence even once, I'd take the set away for good). Turned out the arm guard I got was a good purchase as she showed me how her arm got scraped pretty good when she had it in the wrong place. With it in the right place, no problems.Secondly, the arrows. Zero problem. Now then, I'm using a bale of straw with a target on it, so even after lots and lots of shots over the past couple of weeks, not one tip has been lost. And I know darn good and well she's had to have hit a tree or the fence at least a time or two. Sure, they're cheaply made, but I'm not looking for high quality or even that much accuracy on them, just enough use so I don't have to go thru dozens of them.After lots of use she still says she loves this set a lot, so if you're looking for a happy kid around that age, get it, you can't go wrong.
