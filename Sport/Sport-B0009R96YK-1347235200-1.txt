review/summary: Works Greatreview/text: The installation was a bit frustrating, but once it is on the bike it works perfect. You cannot see a great distance behind you however. If I have someone trailing behind me about 200 feet you can barely make them out. If there is anything within close proximity however you can see it clearly. The glass on this is not the strongest it only lasted me about three days, but this was after very a few intense rides. Still overall I am satisfied with this product. It stays in the handlebars snug and does what I need it to do.
