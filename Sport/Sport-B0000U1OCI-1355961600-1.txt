review/summary: Nicereview/text: This is a great pedometer. Be sure to use the clip that comes with it though, because otherwise it could slip away from you easily (lost one this way, then it was found in the car). I also recommend keeping the outer case on so it is a little bulkier and you are aware it's in the pocket. Otherwise they are so sleek you might run them through the wash like I did mine, which ruined it.
