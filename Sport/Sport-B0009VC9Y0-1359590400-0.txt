review/summary: He loved it!review/text: My husband has been looking at switchblades lately. I thought I would surprise him with a new knife, because 10 isn't enough already. I looked at fast opening knives, since the real switchblades are not legal. I found this Kershaw and read the reviews and figured It was worth a shot, especially since I could return it if he didn't like it. The night before this order arrived, he tells me that he found a stiletto he wanted to order. Well, that kind of ruined my plans of surprising him,, so I told him to just return his package when it arrives. He fussed at me saying my buying him a knife is like him buying me a purse, it just isn't any way I could get it right. Before I got home the next day, he calls me and says there is no way he's returning his knife. He. Loves. It. He likes how sharp it is, how fast it opens, how it's not too shinny. It's so perfect that when he showed his co-workers the next day, they reminded him that he had bought the exact knife about 8 years ago. HA! Oh, and it arrived so much faster than my other orders I placed on the same day!
