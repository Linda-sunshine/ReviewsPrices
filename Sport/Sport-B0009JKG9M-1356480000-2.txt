review/summary: Absolutely love the combo cooker!review/text: Ive been using Lodge cast iron for about 2 years now so this isnt my first time so this review may not be applicable if youre buying this for the first time. Cast iron has a bit of a learning curve at first, but once you have it down you form a bit of a working relationship with your cast iron so that you just seem to know what it needs at any given point if its acting up a bit, which doesnt seem to be often unless you really overheat it.The GREAT thing about cast iron, as we all find out pretty quickly, is that if you somehow trash the surface, unlike teflon and other nonstick cookware, you just reseason and your looking at a brand new pan.Ive intentionally ruined the seasoning a few times just to see what was involved with getting it back to new condition. I even used a steel brush on my drill to remove all of the seasoning down to the cast iron and started from scratch with no seasoning at all. A couple layers of seasoning and the next morning I had a really nice black pristine cast iron pan again that cooked eggs without sticking at all.So to anyone buying these for the first time, just have patience if youre having trouble, once you get the hang of it you're going to love Lodge Cast Iron.I mainly wanted this combo cooker because I love to make fried rice and wanted the extra deep pan to use as a wok. Needless to say it outperformed my old high carbon steel wok by leaps and bounds. It was the best fried rice Ive been able to make to date.I have 7 or 8 other Lodge items, including the hibachi/grill, and we love them all.
