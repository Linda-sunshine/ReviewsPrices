review/summary: Not Up to the Insanity Parreview/text: I've completed the Insanity program and jumped on this when I saw it was a 20 minute mini-insanity workout. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met:First the good: it is a good workout; if you're used to the Insanity program, nothing here will surprise you, and it is 20 minutes with warm up & cool down. I burned just under 300 calories during the workout. For comparison, I burn about 580-600 calories for a 45 minute Insanity workout and about 900 for a 60 minute workout.Now the bad: for the price (about $25), I was expecting more than ONE workout! The full insanity program comes with about 10-15 40-60 minute workouts, so the price per minute here is way higher than the original program. Keeping that in mind, we come to problem #2 - this is a cheap production. Instead of the full gym they used before, Shawn T and two of his students are confined into what looks like the corner of a second floor boxing studio. I feel bad for them as they looked cramped, and the camera is so close it struggles to get a full body shot (don't remember one, actually). There are two cameras on this shoot, and it just looks amaturish and cheap when compared with the original.Bottom line, I'll be using it regularly, but it should have cost no more than $10.
