review/summary: Great Bottle!review/text: I bought the 27-ounce bottle for my runs instead of taking smaller disposable plastic bottles with me. I don't run with it, but it's great post-run since the bottle keeps the water cold in the mornings while it is in my car and the water tastes great! Wish I bought this way earlier.
