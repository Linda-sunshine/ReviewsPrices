review/summary: INVICTA - looks will deceive, this is a cheap watchreview/text: I have owned many watches in my life and never had trouble with any of them EXCEPT the Invicta 8926OB. This was my first Invicta watch and it will be my last. It arrived defective. I was able to set the time but not the date and the crown would not go back to its original position. By not doing so, it will allow moisture into the watch which voids the warranty. Worse, Invicta charges the customer to send back its merchandise under warranty - even if its defective from the factory AND it takes 90 days to return it to you. Don't let its handsome looks deceive you - this is a cheap watch and not worth the trouble.UPDATE: I FINALLY received the watch back from the factory from repair (so far I have not been able to wear the watch) and it is STILL BROKEN. Unbelievable. POOR QUALITY, POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, POOR WORKMANSHIP
