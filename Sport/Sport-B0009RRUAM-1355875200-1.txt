review/summary: These are awsomereview/text: You don't need a big pillow. If you are trying to save room in your pack just get the small and when you go to bed stick some of your clothes from your pack under the pillow to lift it up and to simulate a bigger pillow. DO NOT LEAVE THESE ROLLED UP WHILE THEY ARE IN STORAGE AT HOME!!! when you are not using it, wash it and tumble dry and LEAVE IT OPEN! The little foam cubes inside take several days to re-expand if they've been crushed for months because you didn't open it up. If you leave them open and then roll them up for a trip when you re-open them the expand quickly.
