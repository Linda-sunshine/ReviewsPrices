review/summary: Great deal for the price!review/text: Like many girls since watching The Hunger Games my daughter has been asking for a bow. I found this one on Amazon and thought for the price it was too good to pass up. No one in my house has ever had a bow or any experience with them, but right out of the package my 12 year old daughter was in the back yard sending arrows into a couple bails of hay we had. She absolutely loves it, and has probably shot it 1500 times in the last few weeks since she got it. The 2 arrows that cam with it have held up well and show no signs of wear,an the bow seems to be of good enough quality to last her for a long time to come. She has already got enough enjoyment to more than cover the purchase price, and I'm sure after school and homework today she will be out back again shooting up bails of hay. This is not quite the toy I thought it would be, so we don't allow her to shoot unless an adult is present.
