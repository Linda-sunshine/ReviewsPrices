review/summary: just rightreview/text: so I just got this bow and it works great and I would even recommend this for small game hunting 'cause this thing packs a punch I was so excited that I shot it at the cement wall (weird) and made a hole in the wall and it measured to be a few centimeters long.The arrows are cheapish so I do recommend getting extra arrows.It does not come with targets and arm guards as said so to make a substitute just get an old sock and cut out finger holes.The bow string is actually quite easy to pull.Hope you enjoy this product
