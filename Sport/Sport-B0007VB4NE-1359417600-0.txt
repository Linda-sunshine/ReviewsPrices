review/summary: Pump is worthlessreview/text: I can't get the pump that comes with the ball to put enough pressure to actually blow up the ball to full size. Since the opening is so large, it's impossible to use a tire pump to take the place of the hand pump. Maybe I'd like the product if I could get it to the point that I can test it out.
