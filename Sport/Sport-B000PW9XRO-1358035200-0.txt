review/summary: The gloves are really nice, but XX-Large is more like just a Large.review/text: Ordered XX-Large, but right when I opened the package I knew they would be small. I would say that XX-Large is like a standard Large that you would get at a store like Dick's or Gander Mtn. I actually got a similar pair of a different brand at Gander Mtn that were labeled just X-Large and they fit much better. With all that being said, other than the fact they are pretty tight, they do seem well made and look nice when they are on.
