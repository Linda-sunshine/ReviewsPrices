review/summary: Good for walkingreview/text: This pedometer is excellent when walking... but if doing other cardio work such as on an elliptical it may nopt be accurate. During a recent workout in which the machine recorded 10,000 strides, the pedometer recorded 8400. I have never had issues when walking.
