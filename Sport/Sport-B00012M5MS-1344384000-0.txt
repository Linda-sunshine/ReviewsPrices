review/summary: Affordable and high quality helmetreview/text: This helmet doesn't break the bank, but offers comfortable, reliable protection. I particularly enjoyed the dial in the back that allows you adjust the width of the helmet, which helps secure it tightly to your head. I typically use it for my trail rides, and unlike other helmets, this one has always managed to stay firmly planted on my head. There are also several straps on it that can be adjusted to the perfect length for your face. Another thing I enjoyed was the modern-design and front visor that offers some protection against the sun.
