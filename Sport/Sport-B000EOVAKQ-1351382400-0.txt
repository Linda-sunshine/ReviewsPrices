review/summary: Amazing no-fog goggles that fit comfortablyreview/text: I had put off getting these for some time as they were about twice the price of the goggles I'd been using, and I tend to have trouble finding goggles that fit my face. I didn't want to get ones that didn't fit and then have to return them, so I kept using the Speedo Vanquisher. Which I liked, which was inexpensive, but which does fog up every half lap on me.But I finally got a pair, and I'm never going back to anything else. They fit my face perfectly, are easily adjustable and comfortable, never ever seem to fog, and are simply completely awesome. And they're not even really that expensive at circa twenty bucks, and I should've gotten them sooner. Highly recommended!
