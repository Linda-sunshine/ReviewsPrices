review/summary: BEST HAND WARMERS ON THE MARKET!review/text: I have always used HeatMax Hot Hands 2 hand warmers and they keep your hands really warm when I am hunting and ice fishing. I tried the others and they were not as warm or last as long as Hot Hands 2. We had a major power outage a few months back and we have a reptile that requires warmth and I told my wife that I have these hand warmers i use for hunting that work really well and could work to keep our Chinese water dragon warm until the power come on. It worked like a charm as my wife surrounded him with the hand warmers and he loved it. strange way to use them but it was all i could think of at the time.. LOL. I would highly recommend them for anything that requires warmth. :)
