review/summary: My 7 year old loves itreview/text: My 7 year old loves this scooter. it was a Christmas present and she was thoroughly excited when she saw it. It is a quality built scooter and seems like it will last her a while. My only complaint is that it is hard to store. We keep it inside the house and there is no way to lean it up against a wall because it will roll down and fall in the floor. Even when its folded its hard to put it in a corner for storage.Overall a sturdy, high quality scooter for a great price of $19.99! In stores it typically ran about $29 so its a great deal.
