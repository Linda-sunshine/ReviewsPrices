review/summary: Loved this bottle.... until I realized how filthy it was!review/text: I bought a bunch of these bottles for myself and my daughter. I disassembled them once a day and cleaned all the parts (bite valve, top, straw and bottle) thoroughly. I even bought some pipe cleaners and used them to clean inside the top piece and around where the bite valve swivels. I thought I was keeping them clean, but when two of the bottles broke I realized how wrong I was. The way these bottles are designed it is impossible to clean them properly. I am disgusted that I was letting my daughter drink out of something that had black mold inside! Not to mention the replacement bite valve and straws cost 6.99 for one valve and two straws- what a rip off!! I've now bought thermos brand sippies for my daughter to use (replacement straws are only a buck apiece!) and have gone back to a plain stainless steel bottle for myself. These bottles are a great idea but they need to be redesigned to allow you to clean all parts of them. I wish I could upload a photo of how disgusting they were inside. Ick.
