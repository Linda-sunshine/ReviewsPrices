review/summary: Keeping It On While Truckinreview/text: My husband and I are walkers who have been using pedometers for about 12 years . I clip my pedometer at my waist on my underwear primarily because I rarely wear pants with pockets. While wearing a pedometer has motivated me to add miles to our weekly walking, keeping it safe on my person all day has been quite the challenge. Just going to the bathroom, I have lost 4 pedometers to toilet water over the years. NOW when it falls off, I DON'T LOSE IT!!! Thank you, SAFETY LEASH!
