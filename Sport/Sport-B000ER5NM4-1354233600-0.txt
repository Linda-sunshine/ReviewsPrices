review/summary: I can't get enough of these pantsreview/text: I bought them in black and now I bought them in brown. Not only are these pants THE most comfortable pants I own, but they can be dressed up or down depending on the top or jacket and a nice pair of heels or boots. Although they're technically yoga pants, the nice flare really makes them versatile. My friend who's a little larger than me feels that they're comfortable but not sure if she feels comfortable enough to wear them to work. When I do wear them to work I make sure my jacket or top ends below my rear. They are after all a bit form fitting and although I'm 5' 9&#34; size 8/10 (Medium) I believe some things I didn't cover when I was 27 should be covered now that I'm 47.
