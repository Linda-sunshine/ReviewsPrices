review/summary: Great sunglasses...just to big. I returned them.review/text: I couldn't give any less that 5 stars due to the fact that they are really nice sunglasses. They were just to big for my face which isn't Ray Bans fault. I ended up sending them back and getting the cockpit style which fit way better. I have a narrow face and the tear drop style which these were just looked ginormous. So, I guess if you have a larger face these would be perfect. I just love the aviator style...it's timeless. I remember my uncle who is a pilot wearing them 25yrs ago and the style is still going strong.
