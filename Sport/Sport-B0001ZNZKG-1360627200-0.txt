review/summary: High dollar skidsreview/text: I just had to try a pair of these new fangled undies on a 6 weeek trip overseas. They look great on me and do dry fast but I think twenty bucks for a pair of skids is pushing the envelope. I think a three pack of Hanes at Target is probably a much better deal. I gave it 4 stars because of the high price.
