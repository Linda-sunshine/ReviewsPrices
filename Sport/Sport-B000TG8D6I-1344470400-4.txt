review/summary: I use it six days a weekreview/text: I don't even know how to workout in a real gym because I never have but I've finished the p90x program three times and working on my fourth now. It's tough but really the hardest thing to do is start. I had the program for about four months before I finally got myself motivated enough to try it and been hooked ever since. Nobody can do it for you.
