review/summary: Good-looking watch but setting time/date requires care.review/text: I like the watch - it keeps good time and is well-made and attractive. Only caution is that, as other reviewers have noted, the stem seems very fragile when unscrewing and pulling out to set date/time. Not a very solid feel, like it could break off or pull all the way out if not handled delicately.
