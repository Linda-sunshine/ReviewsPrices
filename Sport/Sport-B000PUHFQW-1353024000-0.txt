review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I was very disappointed with this mat. The thickness is great, but after a year the mat started falling apart. It started pilling and i find little pieces of it everywhere after i use it. It has also made my hands and feet start to slip and i will constantly have to readjust or put something under my hands. Although great at first, this mat won't last as long as you would like it too.
