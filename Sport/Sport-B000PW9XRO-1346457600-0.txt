review/summary: great shooting glovesreview/text: Ordered a size L which was a perfect fit. I love how the wrist velcro is designed. With cool weather coming, these will come in handy at the range which isn't heated in the winter. I'll be back to get a pair for my wife and all the children. Great gloves!
