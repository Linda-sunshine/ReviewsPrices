review/summary: Great compact grillreview/text: We wanted a compact grill for our patio, and this turned out to be the best option because its compact size and quality. We also purchased separately a stove grill so we could cook directly with pans and pots on the grill, this helps a lot if you don't want to be washing grills (and the interior of the burners area) after cooking food directly on the grills. The auto ingnition works very well. Very convenient!
