review/summary: Sizing seems off, still a good glove.review/text: At first I ordered them in size: Large. They seemed to fit nicely and I maintained great finger dexterity. After a while I realized they were very tight on my fingers and reduced circulation in my fingers. This did not help temperature-wise. I re-ordered in X-Large and they are the perfect tightness on my fingers..........BUT........this size are a pinch too long in the fingers. I normally wear a Large and have pretty normal hands so don't feel I should be having issues. There seems to be quite a bit of extra material left inside of the fingers, along the seams, after the sewing and trimming was done. This could be easily corrected in manufacturing and would help ease the tight fingers a bit. After wearing for a while the inner seams leave deep imprints down the sides of your fingers.I can't complain too much as these seem to keep my hands warm to the low 40 degree range, in 10-20 minute outdoor intervals. I noticed the added length of the X-Large annoyed me when I deployed my rifle. I did not expect to be fiddling with extra length in my gloves as I was covering my buddy's, who were approaching a hostile environment. I was still able to maintain a high level of dexterity and trigger control.I might try to contact the manufacturer and see if there was an issue with my first pair. If these would only fit properly they would be my favorite gloves. It almost doesn't seem worth the time though for such an inexpensive set of gloves.All told I am still wearing the X-LG and will until I find something better. These would be very good for those with abnormally thin fingers.
