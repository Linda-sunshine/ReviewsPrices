review/summary: Perfect Pocket Knifereview/text: Great everyday pocket knife, slim and small yet large enough for most jobs. High quality and has a VERY sharp edge. Be sure to use the safety lock if you wear somewhat tight pants as the pressure can open the blade and ruin your pants. The safety lock is made of plastic and if you close the blade on it several times, it will break. I did this and called Kershaw, they send me several replacement locks and screws for free, no questions asked. I asked the customer service rep why it was made of plastic and not metal like the rest of the knife, and what he said made a lot of sense. He said &#34;Well it&#8217;s less expensive to replace a plastic safety then the whole blade since the lock is located near the tip of the blade, a metal lock could break off the tip if accidently closed too hard on it.&#34; Excellent knife, excellent customer service, couldn&#8217;t be happier with it.
