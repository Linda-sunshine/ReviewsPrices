review/summary: Great price, but not that comfortablereview/text: I wanted to pick up a pair of cheap shorts with pockets for wearing around the house when it's warm. These fit the bill -- they're inexpensive and pull on easily, just the thing for lounging around. Also would be fine for working out in since the pockets are nice and flush to decrease the chance of catching the pocket with your hands if you're running hard. The mesh material is cool in warm weather and feels nice and soft against the skin.However, the cut of the shorts feels odd. I can't quite put my finger on it but it feels like the thighs are too tight or the front is too small; as I move around there's a bit of restriction on movement. Not enough to feel like something might rip, but I definitely feel it whenever I wear these.Still, for $10 shipped, it's a fine purchase.
