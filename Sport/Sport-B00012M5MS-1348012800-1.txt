review/summary: It Sucks.review/text: The helmet itself does not seem to be firm at all, it both looks and feels cheap. I could tell at the first time that if I wear it for a ride, my head would no longer stay. And the shipment was also terrible, when the helmet was delivered, one of the plastic part literally fell apart.Anyway it sucks.
