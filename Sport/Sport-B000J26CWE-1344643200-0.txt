review/summary: Celebrate toe independence!review/text: I almost always run in Vibrams with no socks. But when I hit a rugged trail, I prefer a little more protection for my feetsies and wear a regular trail running shoe. My toes have become so independent in the Vibrams! I couldn't force them to get along all of sudden. Ininji socks helped me out! They feel good on the feet, the toes are happy, each snug in his little toe sack, not rubbing up against his brothers. Feeling good, blister free. I was a little surprised to see how quickly they wore through on my forefoot. . . . But I'll still buy them again. In fact, I bought two pair today while wearing one!
