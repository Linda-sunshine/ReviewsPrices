review/summary: Buy CamelBak instead.review/text: The only thing that really sucks about this bottle is the top spout. It is very loose and slips down to close when you are using it. When desperately trying to get some water during or after an intense ride, you shouldn't have to worry about the bottle closing. Do yourself a favor and buy the CamelBak Podium Chill bottles. They have a very cool twist nipple on top that is sturdy and lets the water shoot through in a much more satisfying way.Camelbak Podium Big Chill 25 oz Bottle
