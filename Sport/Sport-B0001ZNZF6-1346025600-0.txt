review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: These are phenomenal but run a half size big. Be careful how you order them. I've worn a medium my whole life and am exchanging them for a small. Surprising...even for me. The small's keep my stuff a little more snug which is why I bought these over the plain boxers. Regardless of having to change sizes, I LOVE them.
