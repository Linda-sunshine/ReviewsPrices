review/summary: 14+ my footreview/text: This is supposedly a 1 size fits all (14+) helmet, but the only way I can get it to be tight on my head is to have one of the straps hook up all the way up the side of my chin, not under the chin like you're supposed to.Also, the "dial fit adjustable system" does NOT add ease. It is so loose that you have to readjust it every time you put the helmet on.I was expecting a good helmet and was very disappointed.
