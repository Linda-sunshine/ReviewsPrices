review/summary: For Racing/Road Bikes Only!review/text: First off, I want to say that this pump is amazing and works great.... If used for a a racing or road bike with very small tires that require a high pressure. My low rating is here to help those who might accidentally buy it for a hybrid or mountain bike.This thing is not capable of filling up tires in hybrid bikes or mountain bikes. Even using a skinnier tire (35mm) this pump failed to pump at all even after several minutes of trying. In fact, I LOST tire pressure. I took it in to a bike shop, thinking the pump was broken, and the employee showed me the error of my ways.So if you are trying to fill up a hybrid or mountain bike, pass on this pump. If you want to fill up a road bike, this pump is amazing.
