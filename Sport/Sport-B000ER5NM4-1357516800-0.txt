review/summary: Not Badreview/text: These pants are very nice.. they are a nice light material however I am 5'2 and they are long for me. I am still going to keep them because I dont mind the length long as with my sneeker on they are not dragging on the floor.. Possibly they may shrink a bit in the was. It would be nice if they can in petite or averge lengths. These seem to be somewhere inbetween an average and tall. Other than that they are very nice pants. Also review the size chart before buying. I'm glad I did because it runs exactly as they state on the chart. Without it you may order the wrong size. Happy shopping
