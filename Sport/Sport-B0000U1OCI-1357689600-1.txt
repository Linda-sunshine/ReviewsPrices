review/summary: Excellend Pedometerreview/text: I initially had to buy my husband a 2nd one, since we accidently washed it.So I decided to purchase one for myself. I usually just keep track of steps walked.I love this how it tracks for the past 7 days, along with both aerobic, and regular steps.The miles tracked is also a great feature. All in one!I will not go back to my other &#34;simple&#34; pedometers. Best purchase for the new year!!
