review/summary: balance ball chairreview/text: I've been using this at work since it arrived. I have back issues so it has helped keep the back pain to a minimum and is actually more comfortable than company issued ergo chairs. I gave it 4 stars due to quality control with the hardware provided like other reviewers the company sent metric nuts in stead of the 1/4 inch that were required to attach the restraining bar. Easy fix from your local hardware store.
