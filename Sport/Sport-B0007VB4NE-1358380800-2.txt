review/summary: Too shortreview/text: I purchased this chair with ball based upon a recommendation from a colleague at work. The quality of the chair is okay I had to get a replacement part for the bar that goes across the front of the chair and the company was very willing to send it to me almost as if this happens quite frequently. The biggest problem though is that the ball is too short so if I sit at my desk with the chair Its a not so friendly ergonomic position that I'll probably end up with carpal tunnel. I'm going to try buying a larger ball and see if that will fit in the chair. I am 5'10 but I don't think that is so tall that I should be a good 6 inches too short of my desk
