review/summary: My new watchreview/text: My purchase of the Invicta Men's 8928OB watch from Amazon was delivered promptly and I have worn it daily for three weeks. I must say; before one tries to set date and time READ THE INSTRUCTIONS as they are quite detailed. This watch keeps accurate time (when compared to my Atomic Clock). Unless you have wrists the size of a NFL Tackle, be prepared to have a watch maker remove some links in the bracelet!
