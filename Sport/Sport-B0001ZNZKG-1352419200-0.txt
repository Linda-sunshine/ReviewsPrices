review/summary: Very comfortablereview/text: I am very glad to have found these boxer briefs. I was in love with the spandex/polyester shorts I bought from REI 15 years ago and lasted most of those 15 years. When I finally had to start replacing them, REI no longer carried them. These are not exactly the same, but they're about 90% as good. I haven't tried to use them for extended, multi-day wear like they are advertised, but they are very comfortable and give and stretch as needed. They don't have any seams or panels placed in awkward or uncomfortable places like Jockey and Hanes. They feel very good against the skin and the breathe well to reduce that sticky feeling in the summer.
