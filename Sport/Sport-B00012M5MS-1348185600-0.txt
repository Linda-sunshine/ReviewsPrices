review/summary: Yikes, another defective onereview/text: When I read some of the one-star reviews, I wrote them off as bad luck. Based on the dates I'd say Schwinn must have had a bad run on these helmets. The plastic fell off the sides as soon as I took it out of the shipping box. The only thing keeping the top shielding on was the package label zip-tie.Won't order a helmet online again, will take a rare trip to a B&M; store to find one -- and will go with another brand.
