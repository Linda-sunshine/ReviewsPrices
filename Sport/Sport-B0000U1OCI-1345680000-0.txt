review/summary: Love This Pedometer!review/text: I have owned many pedometers over the years, and always fell short of my expectations. After researching, reading reviews on Amazon on various models and Consumer Reports I purchased the Omron HJ-112 Pedometer. I have been totally impressed by the ease of use/setup AND the seven day memory function. I have tested the pedomoter on stairs, walking, running etc..it has performed excellently! Several people in my workout group own this particular model and all are positive, the only negative remarks, there is no reset buttom to zero out the current workout you have to wait until midnight when it rolls over to zero ( I actually like this feature). The clip which attaches to your clothes/shoes etc...(not the clip that hold the pedometer) appears to be flimsy and will probably break over time. Excellent product for the price!
