review/summary: Not that greatreview/text: I bought this bottle with the sole purpose of using it in Bikram Yoga (hot yoga). I read the reviews first and since many said it lasted all day in the heat I figured this would last through 90 minutes of being in a 105 degree room. Well it only lasted about half way through. I had put ice water and ice cubes in it before I left and the water was luke warm by the time class was over. It was only $10, so I will use it for other things, but not yoga. I was trying to avoid dropping $30 on a hydro flask but I guess I'm stuck.
