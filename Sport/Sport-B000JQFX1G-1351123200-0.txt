review/summary: Great watchreview/text: This is a great Rolex submariner look alike watch. The only reason I give it a 4 out of 5 star is because its either slightly too loose on my wrist and when I take a link out its too tight. But that's about it I guess I could just bulk up a little more to have the perfect fitting watch. This won't be an issue to others most likely. It has a screw out cap to adjust time which I like and it's automatic so with daily wear it won't ever stop on you. It lasts about 24 to 35 hours with no movement so if you let it sit for that much time or longer you will need to reset the time which is t a big issue. Just give it a few shakes the night before so it keeps ticking. All in all its a great watch for the price and looks far more than I paid!!
