review/summary: Best gloves so farreview/text: I was looking for a pair of gloves for fit,function,and protection. These gloves provided that and a pleasant grip that is hard to find in most gloves.These are my go to gloves regardless of how cold it is because I have pockets.I ride my bicycle, drive my car, allows me to use the touchscreen on my gps and iphone, mag change drills with my M4 and MP shield without fumbling.There was some mention of a slow break in period because they're synthetic but, I use them for everything and if you really needed a pair of gloves in the first place then it is only an indication of how tough they are.Thanks for making a great product, I will be ordering another pair just incase something changes in the future ...
