review/summary: Bewmreview/text: Probably the coolest sunglasses I have ever seen. I bought them for my wife's 55mm peanut head and they fit her perfectly. the reds are very red and the white is bright white. The case is even cool. I had a scratch on one of the first pair I got, promptly returned and exchanged the week before Christmas. Highly recommend. The grey gradient is not mirror so you can see what people are looking at, but dark enough to mask the Texas sun. Very happy with the purchase
