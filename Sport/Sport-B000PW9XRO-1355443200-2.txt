review/summary: Good cool weather glove.review/text: I wanted something for shooting in about 50 to 60 degree weather and I've got it. I tested them out today in varying temperatures starting with 68 degree room temperature, did well, wore them for about twenty minutes and my hands started sweating. Then I went outside to 40 degrees, I immediately felt the cold through the gloves. Laid on the ground, watched some meteors for half an hour then my hands were getting pretty cold so I went inside. So for 50 to 60 degree weather I think they'll be perfect. As far as fit goes most large gloves fit just a little loose on me to where these were quite snug but not uncomfortable. FYI I ordered large. Finger lengths: index is 1/4" too long, pinky is 3/8" too long others are perfect. All of my rifles I have no problem operating the trigger. However most of my pistols the extra glove length on the index finger gets in the way of the trigger guard when coming from the side of the slide down to the trigger, which is pretty annoying.
