review/summary: Nice piecereview/text: Overall, I give it four stars. It seems well made and put together. I like the heft and feel of the watch. The band is a little flimsy but nothing really wrong with it. A band that seemed a little more robust would be appreciated. The bubble over the date is 'slightly' off center but not enough to really worry about. Mine came with the NH35A movement. It seems to be keeping very accurate time. I would recommend this watch.
