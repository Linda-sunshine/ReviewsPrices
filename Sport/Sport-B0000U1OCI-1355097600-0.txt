review/summary: Very motivating!review/text: I have been doing Weight Watchers and I wanted to be able to keep score of how much I was walking (how many steps and distance). It was very easy to set up once I measured my stride. I had one pedometer by if I just wiggled my butt, I could add about 20 steps onto my total ! This pedometer uses a different technology, much more accurate (and the step count didn't change when I wiggled my butt!. It presented me with new challenges. I was wanting to walk 10,000 steps a day, so this was great. I'd stop and look at my total step count and it kept me pushing myself to go on.
