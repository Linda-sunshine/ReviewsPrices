review/summary: Great to have on your key chainreview/text: Over the years I've owned several of these and I find it amazing how long they last and how handy they are. The blades are all very sharp and really don't seem to dull down. Although the scissors are very small they really come in handy and its alway great to be able to open something that's taped shut so the knife comes in handy too. These things are built strong and can put up with you putting them in your pocket with all your keys and change.
