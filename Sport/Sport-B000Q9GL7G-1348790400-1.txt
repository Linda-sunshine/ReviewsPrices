review/summary: Problems with holsterreview/text: Great idea, poor execution. At least that's been my experience. I used the paddle option for a CC @ belt line. Within 15 minutes it was broken. Not broken in, like when you practice the draw with an empty magazine, just broken. As in retaining pin fell out, spring went somewhere downrange, and pressing the trigger release button gets you nothing.The quick fix is to super-glue the pin back in AFTER you have ground off the retaining nub that sticks into the trigger well. Sound like a good experience to you? It works, but only as a LEVEL 1 (no retention). I'll see if I can get another, but I'm not sure why I'd want one. Take your time researching this holster, and all BLACKHAWK SERPA system products. Some ranges won't let you use BH SERPA holsters. Too many self inflicted wounds. Which ought to tell you something.Google this:blackhawk serpa issues. Definitely NOT for the noob shooter.
