review/summary: Getting me over my workout humpreview/text: I workout most days and I have for many years. I have just felt like I had hit a workout hump. I have used personal trainers and nothing has felt as much like a workout as this program. I have a love/hate relationship with it and that was exactly what I have been looking for! I love this workout and my whole body hurts after I do it... Love that!
