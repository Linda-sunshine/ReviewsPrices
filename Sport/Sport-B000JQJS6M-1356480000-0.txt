review/summary: Beautiful watchreview/text: I have been wearing Invicta atches for about 5 years now and I am impressed with the workmanship of the product. This automatic watch is no exception. The only problem I have is that I don't wear a watch 24/7 so it will run down and stop. I would recommend that you look into an inexpensive winder that will keep the watch wound when you are not wearing it. I found one for $40 that I haven't received yet but I'm sure it will keep the watch running for me. Great value for the price!12/28/12 - I received my watch winder today and it's the ticket for an automatic watch. It's a must have if you don't wear this or any automatic (self-winding) watch all the time.
