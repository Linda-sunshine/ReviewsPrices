review/summary: Big price - poor qualityreview/text: I'm not sure if these were 'seconds', but the quality was terrible. The socks pilled, leaving chunks of black fluff everywhere, whenever you took them off. They also showed signs of wear in the heels after only a few times. Will never buy these highly-rated socks again!
