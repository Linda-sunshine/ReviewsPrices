review/summary: Amazon sold me a Dutch oven Burger Cookerreview/text: I purchased this in Oct 2012, I have used it ~8x and found it sends a great smell of onions, butter, garlic, salt and fresh cooked turkey burger scent into the air at a nearby camp site where my family camps. The kids love it and the burgers are cooked to perfection. Just before the burgers are done I pull the lid off the Dutch oven and flip it over on to another burner and toast the buns in the lid. I use 2 old Coleman propane 2 burner camp stoves; they sit side by side on a picnic table. These pans make cooking fun even my kids 10, 12 & 16 yrs like to get involved. I have also used it to warm up flour tortillas, saut&eacute; shrimp, and prepare steak to make fajitas. I think one of the greatest assists of the cast iron cookware is the ability to use the pan FOREVER. Cast has been around forever and it still works. I have purchased plenty of FOREVER nonstick PROFESIONAL aluminum pans and it's heart breaking they turn to junk in two years even with nylon cooking utensils---I guess 2 years these days is forever. It's heart breaking because they're so stupid expensive. It's like those stupid fluorescent lights that they say last 7 yrs but you're replacing them in two. The only drawback is the weight when camping. Regardless, I'm considering the purchase of a couple of 12" and 15" cast pans from Amazon for the same long lasting reasons. Maybe, even the Hibachi grill too. By the way, I'm an avid shopper of eBay and you cannot---cannot by cast for less on eBay or even at Wal-Mart--just try it! But it might be possible at Harbor Freight but you sacrifice the quality. I don't want to even tell you what this dutch oven is selling for at my local Wal-Mart--
