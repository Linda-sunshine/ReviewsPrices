review/summary: Excellent Quality, Reliability, and price!review/text: I bought this Hogue grip over the popular MOE Magpul grip because of the finger groves and soft material it's made of. It's not too cheap feeling and holds up well in many conditions and sweaty hands! It's a bit difficult to get the bolt tightened enough on the inside when installing but make sure it's tight and it'll never come loose during handling of the weapon! There's even an insert you can buy to store extra batteries and such in the grip!
