review/summary: Used in Africa and Americareview/text: Me and 5 other girls used this to get in shape while we lived in Kenya, Africa from January 2012 - May 2012. I started out very out of shape and the African heat (and of course no AC either) made it even harder, but it was definitely do-able and worth it! When I came home from Africa I didn't exercise all Summer so I finally decided to buy this for myself. In just 2 weeks I've been able to fit back into jeans that were super tight on me before (I'm wearing them right now actually!). If you're out of shape, you can still do it! If you stick with it, it will work! Some days will be harder than others, but then just do part of the workout and then strive to do more of it the next week. When I say stick to it I don't stick to it EXACTLY (though that's not a bad thing of course), I mean don't let yourself get discouraged! Be happy for what you CAN do and don't focus too much on what you can't do. Kenyan proverb: Haba na haba, hujaza kibaba. This means: Little by little, fills the pot. Work hard, give yourself grace, and little by little you will get there.All of this to say: If you're ready to commit, buy it! :)
