review/summary: Just what I neededreview/text: Easy to install. I can see well. It was a decision between a set of these (one per box), and helmet mirrors. I read a lot about the helmet mirrors being distracting. These were the best choice. I feel much safer being able to see behind me. Highly recommend.
