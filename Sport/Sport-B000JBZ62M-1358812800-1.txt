review/summary: Quality shorts at a good cost but size is offreview/text: The shorts are well made and are the length I wanted. I use them for exercise or sports. I like having the pockets but only use them on the way to the gym, court, etc. Don't actually keep things in them when I am in the activity. If these were sized correctly and not mislabeled, you should order a size down. The large swallows me. I can barely pull the drawstring enough to hold them up.
