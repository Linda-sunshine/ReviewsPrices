review/summary: Best quality sunglasses I have ever owned.review/text: I have owned Rayban sunglasses since 1979. The Outdoorsman model. I have since bought other brands. Their quality has not stood up like that of Rayban. I once broke a lens on a pair of Outdoorsman's that I had for 20+ years. They sent me replacement lenses that fit perfect. Now that is a quality product when it has not changed after that many years. These polarized are my first pair made by Rayban. I have found them to be the best quality also. The glare is cut down more compared to other brands where sometimes you have to tilt your head to get the glare to cut down. They are worth the price.
