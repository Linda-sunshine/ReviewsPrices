review/summary: Easy to adjust, here's howreview/text: Reviews I read before buying this rope complained about adjustment difficulties. It is easy to adjust this rope, so I uploaded a couple of pictures to show you the ropes. :&#62;)Adjustment: The end caps easily unscrew from the handles, and the rope ends can be pushed back out with a little manipulation. Each end will have a crimped ferrule and an extra, un-crimped ferrule on it. To shorten the rope, figure out where you want to cut it, and cut off the end, including the crimped ferrule that is on it. (Good scissors will cut the rope, but needle nosed pliers make the perfect tool for this whole operation.) No need to try to remove the old crimped ferrule from the scrap end. The un-crimped ferrule should be left on the rope, and the rope should still pass through the handle. Now crimp the new ferrule on the rope about a half inch from the end. Don't try to totally crush the ferrule. (Out of spare ferrules? See below.) Finally, pull the rope end back into the handle, put on the end cap, and go jump rope.Rope length advice: You will find advice on the web about how to determine how long to make your rope. I'm not an expert, but I can tell you it is easier to shorten a rope than it is to lengthen it. Err on the long side! Don't worry about running out of metal ferrules (two extras come on the rope). If you need to make more than two adjustments, you can use a small nylon cable tie instead (see picture), just be sure it is tight. I found that until the rope was short enough, it was hard to jump well. When it was the right length, the rope no longer felt loose and sloppy, but it didn't cramp me either.This is a good jump rope!
