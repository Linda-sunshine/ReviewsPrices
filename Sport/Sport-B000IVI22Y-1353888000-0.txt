review/summary: Greatreview/text: This water is perfect for my morning spin classes. It fits tons of water, actually, just enough to get me through an hour long spin class. Make sure you clean out the mouthpiece as it will get funky after a short amount of time. I tend to use a q tip to get into the mouth piece since your finger tends to be too big to get around the sides. Plus, the purple is a beautiful color
