review/summary: BEWAREreview/text: I have purchased Ray-Ban glasses for many years. Recently, I got a bad pair and I was happy that I was dealing (though I was dealing) with a high end company. Well, this is not the case with Ray-Ban. The warranty department is nearly impossible to reach and they do not honor the 1yr defect policy. Mine fell apart at the hing and they wanted about 3/4 of the price to fix them! I'm not going to purchase from this company any longer and I recommend that you do the same.
