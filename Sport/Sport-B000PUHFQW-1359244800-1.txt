review/summary: Met my needs for yoga at homereview/text: This is the first yoga mat I have purchased and I use it on the hardwood floor of my apartment to do a pre-natal yoga DVD. The material seems of good quality - it's comfortable and I no longer slide all over the floor. I don't know if it's a standard size because as I said I've never bought one before, but it's very long which I appreciate as a tall person. I've used ones on loan at the gym or at yoga studios that were too short for me. This mat also comes with a nice carrying case so if I decide to take a regular class it will be easy to transport. Good first mat for me, thanks.
