review/summary: great single guest bedreview/text: Had a full house for the holiday, had a queen Intex (same version) in one room for my 6'+ 21 yo son, and the twin in my home office for my 24yo daughter. Everyone slept well. Works to expectation. Make sure you let it warm to room before blowing up, and get it blown up prior to first use.
