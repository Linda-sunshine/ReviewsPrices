review/summary: Like it for my small carreview/text: I like that it folds up into my bag, flew with it cross country in my carry on bag, and used it on my rental car and with rental bikes for a Florida adventure. Meanwhile, at home in California, I use it on my tiny subcompact car for local adventures with my mountain bike.
