review/summary: Comfortable, but a little smaller then some.review/text: I like a firm bed and found that I needed to physically pump in the additional air pressure. There is that option along with the electric/fill, deflate which is very helpful. I took it camping for five nights and though I topped it off before bed every night, it didn't deflate enough for me to notice in the morning.
