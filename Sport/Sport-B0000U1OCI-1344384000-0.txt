review/summary: Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometerreview/text: This little gadget has been so helpful as I attempt to become more"precise" about my exercise program. It is very easy to use and seems quite reliable. I've used other pedometers in the past, but they seemed too complicated . I highly recommend this product.
