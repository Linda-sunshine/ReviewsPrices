review/summary: Cool product, bad quality controlreview/text: We bought this for my autistic son to sit on while he uses the computer. It's a great way for him to "bounce off" some of his excess energy. But don't even THINK about trying to pump up the ball with their enclosed "pump". Every 4 or 5 pumps, the thing seizes up and must be disassembled and the rubber gaskets inside re-seated to get 4 or 5 more pumps out of it. You'll need your own bike/ball pump to get this product working.
