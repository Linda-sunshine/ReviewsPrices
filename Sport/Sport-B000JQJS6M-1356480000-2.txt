review/summary: Great copy!review/text: Great copy for a watch. Keeps time well, Easy to make needed adjustments on the band also. Face is not to large for an Invicta watch. Now it's nothing like my Omega Sea Master, but a great knock around everyday watch. And for those who do not know, this is a self winding watch - &#34;no battery&#34;.
