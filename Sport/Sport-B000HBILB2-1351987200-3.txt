review/summary: Would not inflate RETURNEDreview/text: I've bought several air beds from various manufacturers. I bought one identical to this one 1 1/2 years ago. It was comfortable but lost air after 3 months. I justified this as the user may have not taken care. However, I now believe its the brand. This one would not inflate at all. I will not buy this brand again. I've had great life from a better brands.
