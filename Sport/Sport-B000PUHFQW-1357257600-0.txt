review/summary: LOVE the colors!review/text: My favorite color is purple so I was looking all over for the deep purple I wanted. I eventually found it! Great length. I am 5' tall and I have PLENTY of room for my mat and bolster/blanket/blocks. Super comfortable, easy to clean, and lightweight. I wish it would unroll as easy as it rolls up, but it is still new and I am told that it gets easier.
