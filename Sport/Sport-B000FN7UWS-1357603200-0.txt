review/summary: Love My Klean Kanteenreview/text: This bottle is stylish, rugged, better for the environment and free of chemicals that can leech into my tasty water. Plus, if you ever really needed to you can boil water in the bottle itself without too much of a problem (aside from a ruined paint job.) I bring this with me daily, it's one of those products that you just really can't complain about.
