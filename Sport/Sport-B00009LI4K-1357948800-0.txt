review/summary: Great for indoor range shootingreview/text: I went to my local 10 stall 100 yard indoor range today to do some shooting. I wore my new ears acquired from Amazon and they worked perfectly. I shot my 45 Kimber, 380 Sig, and Hi-Power 9 and did not have any problems whatsoever. At one point I was reloading my mags and the range boss called a cease fire because someone had shot down the wire holding their target and it needed repair. I could hear well enough to hear his cease fire command and also had excellent protection from the very loud environment of an indoor 100 yard range where you have everything from pistols to rifles. I have a big head at 7 1/4 inch and did have to stretch these out just a little but no big deal as they do what they are supposed to do - protect my hearing. I recommend these to anyone who likes to shoot guns and especially if you shoot at an indoor range.
