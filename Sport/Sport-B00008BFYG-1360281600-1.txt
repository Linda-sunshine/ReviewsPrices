review/summary: Nice tryreview/text: We've heard lots of good things about these scooters and decided to give it a try. After only a single day the bearing ring broke in the steering column and now it will barely turn. I'm going to have to buy replacement parts already. Apparently the factory ring is made of plastic, but the replacement is metal. Hmmmm....
