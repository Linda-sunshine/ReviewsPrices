review/summary: Perfectreview/text: I've owned a couple of these over the years and recently received a new one for Christmas. They are excellent and I carry it on my key chain every day. It's lite, small, well crafted and offers a variety of very useful tools for everyday tasks. And at around $12 they're basically giving them away. For me, it's the perfect key chain tool.
