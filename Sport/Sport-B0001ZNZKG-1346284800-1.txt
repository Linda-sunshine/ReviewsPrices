review/summary: ExOfficio - The real dealreview/text: Ok, I finally understand what the hype is about regarding this boxer brief. I have tried many different brands in the past, but always felt that I could find something at a cheaper price that was as good. I was wrong. I found many products that were very good for the price they were at, but this boxer brief is the best I have ever bought and used.The fit was perfect. It is true to size. The length and feel of the product are the two things that gave it the edge in my opinion. It has a very non-intrusive feel and the length on the thigh is not too short that it rides up and rubs between the legs.If you want something that is almost as good and cheaper, look elsewhere, if you want the best boxer brief on the market, this is it!
