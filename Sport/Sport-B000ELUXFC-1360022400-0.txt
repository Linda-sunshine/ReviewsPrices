review/summary: Great for my mountain bikereview/text: Pros: 1 Easy to put together and put on my car (Ford Contour). 2 I have had it for months and have taken it on and off my car numberous times and the straps are holding up well. 3 It stays in place on my trunk.Cons: 1 I have a small bike frame (15.5) and had to have my dad squeeze the bars together to get my bike to fit, BUT even though he squeezed them together pretty easy it does not effect the rack at all. 2 The bike rack and actual bike metal on metal contact has scratched some of the paint on my bike off BUT that was an easy fix (wraped some felt using a hot glue around the areas). 3 Kind of a tight fit for 2 mountain bikes but after playing around I finally got it figured out.
