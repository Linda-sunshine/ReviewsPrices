review/summary: Poor Workmanshipreview/text: We have used one of these products for many years and it is getting worn out. I ordered a new one and upon opening itand installing the batteries I went to try it out. The first thing I found was the middle holding try that goes up and down didnot slide, you had to push it. That could have been fixed with a little sandpaper but I tried the old one and it worked ok.I installed the cards and went to push the start/stop button and it was real hard to push. When it started, it did not grabany cards to the center area. The motor was going but no shuffling. VERY BAD !!
