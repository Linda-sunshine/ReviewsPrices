review/summary: Totally worth itreview/text: I am a pillow hound, I sleep in bed with 4, but I obviously don't do that when I camp. When I found this, I was so excited! It rolls up really small (approx. 3"x3"x12" medium size). When you unroll it, you just need to fluff it with you hands a little bit and let it sit for a few minutes and its perfect. It is way more comfortable and soft than some of my flattened pillows at home! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who camps often.
