review/summary: Yoga matreview/text: I am disappointed in this product. I can't use it because yoga mats are suppose to be "sticky" so you can hold postures and not slide or slip....this mat is not sticky. My yoga instructor suggested that I put it in the bathtub with dish detergent and water, then wrap it in a towel and run it through the spin cycle in the washer. I have not tried that yet but really I shouldn't have to. I have bought many yoga mats in the past that were fine, no prep neseccary. Maybe there were instructions that came with the mat on what to clean it with to make it sticky but I did not see any.
