review/summary: It is what it is, but it does that part greatreview/text: This unit will not calculate calories burned and other things that the $400 units will do. But it does monitor your heart rate and give you averages during your timed sessions.I bought it mostly for learning about my body, and did I learn a lot.I learned that I wasn't doing very much aerobic exercise during my aerobic exercise time. It took too long for the heart rate to rise to the right level and I'm not fit enough or able to go to the extreme aerobics levels. But when I went outside to mow or rake, or when I vacuumed and did laundry/dishes/made beds, etc, it immediately zoomed up there. I learned which activities/exercises worked best from among those that I prefer. That alone made it worth while. No more boring walk-aerobics or dancing alone. My Bowflex, which I use mostly for rowing, is much better - and I can do that while watching a movie. I was also surprised to see how resistance training increases cardio. I didn't expect that.I also learned that I had been overestimating BY A LOT the number of calories burned during aerobic exercise. As I am on a diet, this was important information. When I'm done with an exercise, the watch lets me look at time spent, high heart beat, and average heart beat - which I use to determine calories burned from web-sites.This is a great little tool at an affordable price. It doesn't pretend to be something that it is not. No bells and whistles. Just a tool.
