review/summary: P90X rocks! Even for old farts who are somewhat out of shape!review/text: P90X: Tony Horton's 90-Day Extreme Home Fitness Workout DVD ProgramWe bought these DVDs (used) after our nephew brought them for us to use. My husband and I thought we were in reasonable shape. NOT SO! These excercises are not for the faint of heart but soooo amazing if you are willing to put in the work.What is amazing, is my husband is starting to get normal movement back in a knee where he requires surgery!How is this possible? He does the exercises on "super lite" version. He carefully listens to his body and every day he (although sometimes painful)is seeing more and more muscle growth and is doing amazing!I may actually get my husband back to hiking with me again.Ok => I am a jogger / cross trainer. THESE exercises are amazing and man I was out of shape! I love the 12 different kinds of DVDs which work on different muscles groups.If you are around 50 years old...you are just not as flexible anymore. This workout will be a huge help! I am still not able to do the max 58 minute work outs...but do more everyday.So be patient! Take a day off when you body says its enough...My hubby and I get a kick of out it now...still grown on some of the exercises. Starting to look good. Note: We are not doing any of the other program e.g. nutrition etc but may look into it.Do it because you want to be more fit! If you are careful, and keep trying you may find you are doing things you havent done in year! Its worth it!!!!Important note: there are a ton of complaints regarding the quality of the DVDs, I don't know how they managed it but they are extremely poor quality. Even though mine are hardly used they are already skipping. The good news is they are not copy protected so can be copied using Nero, so if you own this or plan on buying them it's important that you make and use a copy not the orginal.
