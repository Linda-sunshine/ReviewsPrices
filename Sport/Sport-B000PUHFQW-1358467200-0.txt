review/summary: Squishy!review/text: This mat is super squishy and I use it as a cushion for sleeping on the floor aside from it's normal role as a yoga mat. My feet only slip when I'm doing hot yoga, which I bring a towel for anyways. I let it air out for a couple days after it came in and it doesn't smell at all.
