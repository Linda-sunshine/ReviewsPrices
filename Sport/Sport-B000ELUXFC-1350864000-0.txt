review/summary: Pretty much what I expectedreview/text: So this bike rack is pretty much what I expecteds it to be for the price. But it works well enough once you know a couple of tricks.You need to put felt down under the metal hooks so that they don't scratch your car, you need to tighten the straps to within an inch of their lives, You need octopus straps to secure the front wheel/handle bars/peddles while you're driving, and you can't speed along bumpy roads while it is on.I have found that it is ideal for driving in the city, but as soon as you can speed up it gets a bit jumpy.Also I have a hatchback car, and there is no way whats so ever that I will be able to get 2 bikes on it. Whick doesn't worry me so much, as I only have one bike. But If you needed to put 2 on all the time, I would invest in the 3 bike holder.I am really happy with it,it's easy for one person to put on/take off once you get the hang of it.
