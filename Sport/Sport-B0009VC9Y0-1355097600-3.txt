review/summary: Damn this thing is sharp!review/text: They weren't joking when they said this knife was sharp. I was closing it with one hand and my finger accidentally pushed slightly on the blade and it cut me pretty good. It was a good enough cut to make me bleed for a good hour!Despite the knife trying to kill me, it's amazing. One of the best made knifes I've ever used! My only issue is the assisted opening mechanism on it. You really have to be careful when opening and closing the knife because it can pop open right away if you don't stop it.
