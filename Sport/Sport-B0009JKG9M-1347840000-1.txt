review/summary: Definitely a must havereview/text: Used it for the chilli for 4 adults & a 2 yr old. Was absolutely perfect at the campfire. Clean-up was easy -following cast iron cleaning. I did not get a chance to use the lid as a skillet yet but I'm sure it'll meet my needs. Will review after I use it.
