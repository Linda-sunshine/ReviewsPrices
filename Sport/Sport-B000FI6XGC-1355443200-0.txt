review/summary: Pretty Terriblereview/text: This pump was put back into the box for return within about fifteen minutes. Not sure if mine was defective but I wasnt even willing to do an exchange to find out. Piece of junk. It seemed to create a seal, but either didnt pump any air or pumped so little that it wouldve taken me two days to pump up a tire. Highly recommended that you buy a different pump
