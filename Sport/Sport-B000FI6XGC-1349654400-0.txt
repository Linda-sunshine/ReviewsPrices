review/summary: It kept me riding!review/text: I went on six different rides on my new bike, five of them without this pump. No flats or punctures. On my sixth ride and the first time I had this pump with me...I got a puncture. Go figure.Putting all thoughts of it being bad luck aside, I found this pump to be very good. I deflated the tube to get it off and so I had to pump for a while to get the tube up to a useable pressure. It got a bit warm but it worked and that's pretty much all you'd ask for in a pump. It would be great if it had a gauge on it, but then it wouldn't be as small and light, and it would be more expensive. Good pump for the price! It got my tube pumped up so that I could continue on my 15 mile ride and it got me home as well.
