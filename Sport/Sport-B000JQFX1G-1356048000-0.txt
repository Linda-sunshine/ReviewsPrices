review/summary: You can't beat the price for a very good watchreview/text: I bought this to replace one that I had for about a year, I also own 2 Rolex watches. It costs 3 times the cost of this watch just to get your Rolex serviced. The only problem I've had was the one I dropped about 3 feet unto a tile floor, landed face down and the crystal shattered into dust. It cost as much to replace the crystal as the cost of the new watch, so I just bought a new one. Just don't drop it and you will be very happy with this water proof automatic watch. I love mine. I would give it five stars if the crystal was a bit more rugged..
