review/summary: P90X is a great workout if you want to see amazing results Even after 30 days! I also completed Insanity too!review/text: This p90x program is awesome for toning and getting rid of fat. I love P90x man Tony Horton! There are lots of variety in the P90X workouts too which you never get bored from. P90X is a 90 day program! I submitted my P90X before pictures and can't wait to submit my P90X after pictures. I am on Day 34 as of now and am loving the results!! I also have other people that workout to P90X with me through facebook we keep in contact and we all log our daily P90X workout so it really helps with motivation too. P90x has given me trim and toned arms and legs and abs!!Before I started P90X, I completed Beachbody's Insanity! I loved loved loved that workout too! So if you love P90X check out Insanity too!
