review/summary: Smallreview/text: Smaller than expected. If you're looking for a pocket knife you're better off going to a gun show. Comes with tweezers,toothpick, blade, scissors, and I don't remember what the other thing was. I got it for a gift and was shocked to see how puny it was. Victorinox is over priced, I got a much nicer knife for $6 at a local gun show and would highly reccomend looking other places first.
