review/summary: High quality cast ironreview/text: This is a real quality cast iron and you can't beat the price on this one. Used for cooking all the time and there is a big difference between a cast iron pan than a regular non stick pan. Cooking quality and ease of use is great. I usually use this to sear first and shove it to oven to finish my recipe. Food taste great everytime!
