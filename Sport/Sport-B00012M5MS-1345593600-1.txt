review/summary: Junk.review/text: Straps are uncomfortable and had to be readjusted every time I put the helmet on. The plastic piece in the front was constantly coming off from the day I bought it. Then after a few months, the whole top cover popped off. The plastic pieces in the back followed shortly after.Buy a better one.
