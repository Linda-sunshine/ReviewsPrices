review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: The product arrived needing to be put together, was not too difficult to do nor did it take too long. Fitted onto my bike without an issue. The mirror has a nice wide angle, clear and easy to position but stays in place well. So far I like it, and I am glad I purchased it, I had a smaller mirror before and it was getting hard to see the traffic behind me.
