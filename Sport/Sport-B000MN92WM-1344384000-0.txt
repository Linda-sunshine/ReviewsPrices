review/summary: Pocket Pedometerreview/text: After some research I decided that one of the most accuract pedometers are those by Omron. I like this item very much. Took it to track at the nearby Hi-school to calibrate for my stride. It is easy to use, very consistant, and has a nice holster to clip on your side. Also come with the ability to keep track of all your runs with your computer, nice program. Can review what you have done daily, weekly, monthly, and yes by the year. Counts how many caleries you burn, distance, and steps. Distinquishes between walking and jogging. However, to clear the pedometer after a run you have to wait for it to do this automaticly, no manuel button. That's cool if you run only once a day. Otherwise you must write your distance down and subtract from the total after the second run. No problem.It is what it is, does what it says it will, and makes me feel good at the end of a run. Did recieve it within ten days from my purchase and would recommend it to others.
