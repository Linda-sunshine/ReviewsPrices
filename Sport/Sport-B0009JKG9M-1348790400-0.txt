review/summary: bust somebody over the head wit itreview/text: This is the real deal. Cooks food to perfection. Nothing like it. My recomendation for cleaning is vinegar. Dont use detergent you will strip the seasoning(oil). Just use salt and vinegar. Vinegar cleans better than any detergent anyways
