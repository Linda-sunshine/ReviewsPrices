review/summary: Old Standby!review/text: To me this is the perfect pocket knife for personal use. It is small, yet the quality is high and the edges hold their sharpness extremely well. The scissors are study and tight, not loose at all. For personal grooming and hygiene this is a &#34;must&#34;. I have carried this same type of knife for decades. I often put it on a key fob to make it easier to find in deep pockets or packs.I only purchased this one because of having to remove it for airport screening and unable to find it later (I did finally after this one came - oh well, never too many of these).Highly recommended, none better - thank you.
