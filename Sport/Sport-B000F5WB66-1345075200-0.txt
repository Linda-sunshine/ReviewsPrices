review/summary: great monitorreview/text: This thing is fairly simple and inexpensive. It isn't particularly stylish, but it shows your heart rate on a large display and you don't have to/can't mess much with buttons during your workout. The metrics it remembers aren't that useful (average heart rate, peak heart rate and time monitoring), but it doesn't really matter - it performs the basic function very well. It works MUCH better than a Timex heart rate monitor I bought 8 years ago in that the strap immediately picked up my pulse without needing to build up a sweat first or wetting down the monitor strap. Wetting the strap with tap water does help with erratic readings when you begin your workout, so it does help some. I bought 2 of them, one is perfect - the other has a sticky button on top (which has gotten better with use). Hopefully it will retain it's water resistance since I wash these things under the faucet to clean them. If it breaks, I would definitely replace it with the same thing.
