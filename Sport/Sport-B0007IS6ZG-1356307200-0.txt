review/summary: Takes a little practice...review/text: I bought this speed rope as an alternative to running for my cardio workout. Plus I know it builds coordination...but if you've never used a rubber speed rope, it can sting your arms and legs immensely when you miss. Just a heads up.But overall a good purchase!
