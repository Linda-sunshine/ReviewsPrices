review/summary: Bad disksreview/text: This review is specific to the disks I received and not in anyway a negative review of the program itself (as I didn't get to try the program, I cannot provide a review on its effectiveness).I was very excited to receive this product. I've suffered numerous injuries in the past year and was hoping to get started on a new routine. I suffered an injury that prevented me from beginning this workout for about 8 weeks after receipt of product. The first disk skips and pauses on its own, which was annoying but I thought I could deal with it. I tried to use the second disk today and it does not play at all in my DVD player. I then tried to play it from my laptop and it crashed the machine. I was quite excited to begin this workout but now I will be returning the defective product.
