review/summary: Excellent value for the price.review/text: There have been many other positive reviews on this product, so I won't repeat what they've said. I found the XL gloves to be about right for me and I have med/lg hands. I'm looking forward to field testing the gloves soon. They might also double as driving gloves on cold winter mornings. Nice product.I have to give Amazon an attaboy as well. This product was delivered to my front door within 24 hours of the order. That is outstanding service! Thanks.
