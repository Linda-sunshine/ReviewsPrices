review/summary: Sharp as promised, but small size make speed open irrelevantreview/text: The good: This knife might be useful for everyday tasks around the house. As others have said, the extremely sharp but thin blade can slice through quite a range of materials without much effort. I, too, do not trust the thin knife point for any kind of high-pressure prying, as an example.The form factor is sleek and attractive.The not good: To my thinking, this is a largely impractical knife. People with medium-large to large hands are goign to find it frustrating. I have large hands, which makes this a difficult knife to handle properly and perhaps safely if your hands are wet.The grip is simply too slippery. (My favorite for grips is Buck -- I have a blur open I use for everything. My Gerbers have generally good grips but some are plastic and can feel flimsy.)Other notes:-- The gravity open on this knife works a majority of the time, probably about 8 out of 10 opens. Again, other than the gee-whiz factor of a pseudo-switch blade, I'm not really sure what that a knife this small needs with a speed open.-- It's certainly not an EDC knife. The locking mechanism for the blade makes me think it's there for a reason -- that is periodically opens up on accident. Also, it seems to me the lock defeats the purpose of a quick open.Final thought: I would recommend this to collectors (I'm certainly keeping mine), since its all metal finish is excellent and the size, despite my gripes, has its charms. However, if you're looking for a knife that can handle moderate torque or can be used for more elaborate tasks than opening packing tape on a box, it's simply not going to meet your needs.
