review/summary: Great gloves, just a bit smallreview/text: Based on the sizing chart that came on the packaging, a Large should have fit, but I think that my fingers are thicker than average, so the gloves were a bit too tight. Aside from that, they're excellent. They provide excellent tactile feel and are fairly warm. I shoot a 1911 pistol in steel plate matches and the gloves really improved my grip.I've ordered another pair in XL.
