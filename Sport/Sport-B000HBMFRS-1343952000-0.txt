review/summary: It won't last and you might end up hurtreview/text: Warning Warning Do not buy.I bought this back in May 2012 and now it August 3, 2012. I wanted to wait to write my review to make sure I wasn't giving bad advice. All the bad reviews are true. This past week it turned to shit quick and I ended up hurt. This is not great for long term use. I thought I could use this instead of buying a normal bed and I was wrong. The past few days the bed stopped being even and while I was sleep parts in the bed started to rise last night it got so bad I fell on the floor and hurt my wrist and nose. When I first bought it I love it an thought it was great now I think I should have just saved my money and bought a normal bed. It seems great at first but later you might get hurt. I will try an add a picture so you can see what this can turn into.Update 8/16/2012Now you can't even sit on it and the bottom is popping it just a big mess and still in pain from my injuries stay away for your safety. If I could I would give it negative stars.
