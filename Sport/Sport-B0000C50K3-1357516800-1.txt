review/summary: It Worksreview/text: I am used to the old style GI issue cleaning rod kit that I use for 20+ years in the Army. This is easier to use as there is no assembly required. I would be hesitant to use it if you are shooting cast bullets tho. I just don't think it would remove the lead as well as the old style bore brush.
