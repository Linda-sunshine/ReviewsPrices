review/summary: Poor Qualityreview/text: I have always purchased Gold Toe extended sizes at JC Penneys but thought I could save myself the trip. I ordered 2 pack (12 pairs) and have been completely disappointed with the quality of the socks. None of the socks are the same-different widths, different heights and the quality is not the same as Penneys. Isn't Gold Toe the manufacturer? I didn't think they would offer a lower quality on the internet. I would return them if offered.
