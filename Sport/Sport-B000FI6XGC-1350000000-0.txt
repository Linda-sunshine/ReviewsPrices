review/summary: Doesn't fit valve wellreview/text: I tried using this frame pump because my rear tire seemed a bit low. The valve fitting was tough to figure out without having read the packaging explaining how to reverse the inner fittings, but I finally got it to work.When I tried attaching the pump to my tire valve, it was too tight - it kept pushing the valve into the tire, and I couldn't get a good seal between the valve and the pump. I eventually gave up and decided to fill my tire at a gas station, but I couldn't get the pump off my valve. It took my a good five minutes of struggling with the pump, trying to force it off the valve before I figured to unscrew the cap of the pump.Unless I'm using this pump incorrectly (which I don't think I am, but would be willing for someone from the manufacturer to correct me), I would not recommend this item.
