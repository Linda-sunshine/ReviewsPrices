review/summary: Substandardreview/text: The visor on this helmet doesn't stay on. It's a design flaw. I hate when people sell something with known design flaws. Basically it's styrofoam glued to a plastic shell and a visor that doesn't fit. I don't know what else to say. Not much good to say. Well it's light weight.
