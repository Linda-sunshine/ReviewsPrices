review/summary: Kershaw Knife and why you should open your packages when your kid isn't aroundreview/text: I needed a new knife as my last Kershaw was murdered by me, a blackberry bush and a chainsaw - it was a complete lack of thinking through the situation incident. I decided on the Kershaw Onion Leek (I had the Random) as my new pocket knife and ordered it Wednesday and I received it Friday. I knew what was in the package so was imprudently excited and opened it in front of my 22 year old son. He's all "What The...??? Why do you get a Kershaw Leek Mom?????" So yes, I was able to use it for a whole weekend and can say it's extremely sharp out of the box, it's opening mechanism is absolutely perfect for someone with generally small hands, it locks tight so there is no chance of a pinching cut and it fits perfectly in my front jeans pocket. Perfect one handed operation all the way around. It's as close to a legal switchblade as you can get and not get funny looks if you have to use it in public. All this said - it has already disappeared in the 22 year old's truck when he left. Whether you buy the Onion leek or any of the other Kershaws - these are excellent knives and you'll never be sorry you bought it (them). Ordered two more this evening as the hubby was "What The - why does HE (kid) get that Leek??". And they are both knife snobs so that says something too...
