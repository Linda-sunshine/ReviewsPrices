review/summary: Works great for my son's preschoolreview/text: While I can't say how hot it keeps his food (I'm not the one opening it for him for lunch), his teachers haven't told me anything to imply that it's not keeping his food warm. My two gripes is that 1. Its large for a kid's lunch bag (especially a toddler), and 2. the lid has a gap where it screws onto the jar that can be hard to clean in the crevices. Otherwise this is the smallest food thermos I've seen available. It matches his Thermos Foogo straw cup, which is also a nice design.
