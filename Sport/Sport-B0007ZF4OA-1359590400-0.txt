review/summary: Perfectreview/text: These little beauties have done exactly what I need them to do. My job puts my hands in some very cold temperatures,anywhere from 25 degrees to well below freezing. Ever since I have been sliding a pair of these into my gloves before I head outside, my hands have been very warm. The length of time these stay warm allows me to pass them on to a co worker as I am leaving work and they are just clocking in. I WILL get another batch of 40 next winter. They also make great stocking stuffers.
