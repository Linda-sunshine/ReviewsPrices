review/summary: Better than Grabberreview/text: I tried these after becoming disappointed in the quality (and odd 2-in-1 packaging and slow ship speed) of Grabber brand warmers. Working out great so far - I prefer Hothands' rounded pouch to the flat Grabber style. Hothands also last the full 10 hours as listed on the package (tip: use a felt-tip pen to write the time on the warmer when you open it), and last consistently - I'm getting as much heat during hour 9 as I did during hour 1.They do take a few minutes to warm, so if you're going to be outside at 0700, open the Hothands up at 0645.
