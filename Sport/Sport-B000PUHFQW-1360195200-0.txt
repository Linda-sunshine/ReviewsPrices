review/summary: Love this mat!review/text: This was my second mat of this kind. My first one lasted for years but I was ready for a fresh new color. I teach yoga four days a week. This mat is superb due to its thickness and has just the right amount of stickiness. I ordered the olive green this time and it's beautiful. Its not a dull color --its a nice medium tone green. My first mat was the forest green which was also nice. Its more like a dark teal color and not a dark green.
