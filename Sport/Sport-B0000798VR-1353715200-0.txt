review/summary: Not badreview/text: For the price these were good converse that lasted a little over a year and a half (I wore them a lot). The one thing I noticed is that when they arrived they smelled like spray paint and over time as the black faded it started to look like a dark green. Not that bad, but something to take into consideration.
