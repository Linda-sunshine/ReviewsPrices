review/summary: Amazing Product!review/text: I just recieved this product today, and right out of the box I was amazed! The product quality is incredible. The tube itself is made out of brushed aluminium, the plastic has that high quality feel to it. It's also very compact (9 inches) and useful. I could inflate my tire to the max with no problem in 1 minute, you dont have to pump hard at all. Even though it costs 15 bucks, but its money well spent. I saw some "Bell" road bike pump for 9 dollars, but it was very cheap and flimsy.I would recomend this product to everyone, and I will defenitly buy other Topeak products!Hope this was helpfull.
