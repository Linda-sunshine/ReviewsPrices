review/summary: Best All Aroundreview/text: I've worn lots of different brands of boxer briefs and these fit and feel great. These are NOT Cotton but they feel just as soft. They don't feel scratchy or rough at all. They dry very quickly. I noticed &#34;lint type&#34; fabric balls developing after drying these in a traditional clothes dryer. Since they dry so quickly naturally, I now let them air dry in order to preserve the life of the garment. They don't ride up on me at all. I'm an ex-offensive lineman and these are not so tight on my thighs that they dig into my legs. They pack down to a very small size.These are the best all around boxer brief I've ever worn.
