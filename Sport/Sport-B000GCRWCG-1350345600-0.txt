review/summary: Excellent productreview/text: Very good for emergency use for the upcoming cold season. Very small and compact can be stored in your glove box or in an emergency kit, taking up very little space. Very fast delivery actually arrived 3 days prior to the scheduled delivery date. I would recommend this product and this company.
