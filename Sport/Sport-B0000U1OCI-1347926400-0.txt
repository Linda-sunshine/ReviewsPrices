review/summary: Good but not perfectreview/text: I bought this pedometer to keep track of how far I walk on the golf course. It is easy to set-up and use however the one feature I found lacking is a start and stop button. It resets every night at midnight and keeps track of all steps within a 24 hour period. And it does a good job at that. However it has no way of isolating one specific event. Other than that, I think it is a great little gadget.
