review/summary: Excellent looking watch for the price, quite a bargain.review/text: I was very satisfied when I received this watch in the mail. I paid $80 for it with no tax or shipping and it cost me another $10 to get links removed at a local jeweler. It looks really nice on my wrist and I like the fact that I'll never need to buy a battery for it, it is a self winding automatic. If it stops running, which it hasn't done yet because I wear it every day, from what I understand you can wind the spring by turning the crown (the knob you use to set the time). I have gotten many compliments on the looks of this watch and I am glad I bought it!
