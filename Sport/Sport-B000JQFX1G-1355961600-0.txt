review/summary: Excellent Product from Invicta...................review/text: I am extremely pleased with this product. Fit, functionality, appearance and ruggedness is what I wanted and the watch delivered. One comment is that the watchband is heavy on my wrist and difficult to change links for my arthritic hands. I had my jeweler place a heavy duty strap on this unit for me. It is more comfortable for me. An optional (included) rubber strap may be considered by the OEM in the future.
