review/summary: Emer Bivy is betterreview/text: I bought this because I liked the size, weight and cost. I end up having several different types. Each quarter I review what is in my basic overnight pack, which is a single strap over the shoulder. I have replaced these with Adventure medical kits 8.5 ounce Bivy. Much more expensive; but for the weight and size it offers much more capability. i would not buy these again.
