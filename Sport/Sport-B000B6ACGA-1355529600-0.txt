review/summary: If you are shuffling six decks this is the only way to goreview/text: We have gone through a half dozen of these shufflers, but they are inexpensive. I once purchased a six deck shuffler for over $100 and it didn't do any better than this. The price for these on Amazon is all over the place. I once ordered one of the cheapest I could find on Amazon and a second for around $24 - they were the same machine.
