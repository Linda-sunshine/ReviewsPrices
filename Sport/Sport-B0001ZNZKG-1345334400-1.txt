review/summary: A great pairreview/text: Honestly these are great. When I bought them I thought "why not take a shot ans see if you like them". I mean, worst case scenario is wasting a few bucks.The main reason I picked them up was that my cotton boxer briefs loose elasticity throughout the day and don't hug my thighs like I'd like. It just stinks that at the end of the day they are stretched out. Although these new undies don't stay just as tight as when you put them on, they really do a great job of barely loosening. It breaths well, stays cools, and feels great too. Now my new problem is how much I'm gonna have to spend to replace my other pairs :)
