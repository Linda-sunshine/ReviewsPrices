review/summary: Inaccuratereview/text: This is the first review I've ever done; I felt compelled to write. I've had the pedometer for a month and there's no question that it's inaccurate. It doesn't come close to counting all of your steps (as confirmed by numerous checks / tests). The price was right but that's about it. I'm in a fitness contest and way behind due, in part, to the fact that the pedometer doesn't give me credit for all of my steps. And, yes, I'm using it correctly. Look elsewhere (as I'm about to do right now).
