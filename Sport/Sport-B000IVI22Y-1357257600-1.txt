review/summary: I bought 2 of these, sorry I didreview/text: These bottles are VERY HARD to keep clean. The inside of the lid(where the straw attaches, and up through the valve) gets moldy very easily. The first time I put a small bottle brush in there, I couldn't believe how much "yucky stuff" came out. The valve also gets moldy, and it's impossible to get all the mold out. Of course, Camelbak will sell you replacement straws and valves, but they are ridiculously overpriced(in Jan 2013, six bucks for 2 straws and 2 valves).A simple hand washing is not enough to keep the bottle, valve, straw, and lid clean and mold-free. You'll need a very small bottle brush to keep the lid workings clean, a toothpick or some other pointy object to try and remove mold in the valve, etc.I recently purchased the Thermos Nissan Intak Hydration Bottle(http://www.amazon.com/Thermos-Nissan-Hydration-Bottle-Purple/dp/B001EGO64U/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1357306279&sr;=1-2&keywords;=Thermos+Nissan+Intak+Hydration+Bottle). Simple design and very easy to keep clean. Only drawback for me is that the largest size is 24 ounces. The only positive for me on the Camelbak bottle is that it's 32 ounces.
