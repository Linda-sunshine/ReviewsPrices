review/summary: Great L.E. holster!review/text: This is a great L.E. holster. I work in a plain clothes capacity. I was concerned with this holster's actuated retention. I was worried about my muscle memory, and the gun hanging up under stressfull situations. It works fantastic. The release button is very easy to actuate, and is in precisely the right spot for a master grip as you draw the weapon.
