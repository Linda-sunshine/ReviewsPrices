review/summary: Should have bought it a long time ago!review/text: My kids have overnight guests pretty frequently and this thing is sooooo easy! Also nice for movie nights when the kids want to lay in front of the TV to watch. It's as tall as the seat of the couch so those who aren't laying on it can use it for a foot prop in front of the couch. There's plenty of room so it's easy to share a little foot room with the one reclining on it. Pumps up fast and easy. Harder to get all the air out of it to store but so worth the money we paid on sale!
