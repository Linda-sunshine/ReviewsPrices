review/summary: Missing Instructions . . . Read Herereview/text: Failed to attach to my 2010 Trek 7.2 FX. Played with it a while. Unscrewed grey piece with rubber plug, flipped lever to project the inner black insert out, plucked it out, split the black insert into two, reassembled in a configuration that seemed right for the valve on my tire, reinserted and screwed they grey plug-bearing piece back on. Works like a champ!
