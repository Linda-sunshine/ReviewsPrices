review/summary: For the price this can't be beatreview/text: This monitor and the transmitter for under $40 is a steal. You can even use the transmitter alone with other equipment that have the monitor installed. This uses the 5k hert wave to transmit and most of the equipment out there is compatible with it. This unit is easy to clean and the monitor is easy to read when I am cycling. The trick to getting a good reading is to moisten your body or the transmitter with water. I was planning to buy a transmitter alone but when I saw the reviews and the price for this whole set I could not resist and I bought it. There are other units out there where the batteries die out and you must throw away the whole unit. I could never buy something like that. Why would I have to spend so much money on new units when all I have to do is change the batteries. This was a big reason why I bought this item as well. Just be careful when you change the batteries not to mess up the o ring that makes the unit water resistance. I would recommend this to anyone.
