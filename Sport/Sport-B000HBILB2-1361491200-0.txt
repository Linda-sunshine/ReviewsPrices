review/summary: Awesome guest bedreview/text: I had to sleep on this on various trips, etc., and it is a great bed!I am 6'4&#34; and weight ~245lbs. This had adequate room for the length of my body and gave me great support.Unlike other airbeds I've used in the past, this one holds air really well. As in, I've been testing this out for a month and haven't had to top-off the air yet.Tip: After filling it all-the-way, let out a little air so it has a little give. Also, if able, pile 2-3x heavy blankets on-top will muffle the feeling of it being an air-mattress.
