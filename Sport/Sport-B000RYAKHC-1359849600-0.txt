review/summary: Cheap and effectivereview/text: I'm not a big biker. I just need it to bike to and around school a bit. The light was exactly what I needed, cheap, easy to use/install, and bright so (hopefully) I'm clearly visible when it gets dark. Easily detachable so that you can take it with you for whatever other purpose you might want a light for.
