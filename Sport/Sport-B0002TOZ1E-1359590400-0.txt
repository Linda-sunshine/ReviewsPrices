review/summary: Good socksreview/text: I have been wearing these socks from Gold Toe for several years. Not only do I wear them during the day with loafers, but I also wear them at night with slippers. They do tend to fall a bit, but I do not consider this to be an issue. They are comfortable and durable, too. I recommend these socks.
