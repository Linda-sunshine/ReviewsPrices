review/summary: Comfortable and durablereview/text: If you read my other reviews, you'll see that I'm something of a travel undies connoisseur. The ExOfficio are probably my favorites (over Smartwool, Icebreaker etc), especially for travel as opposed to hiking/camping. I like the loose boxer brief style, the odor prevention is great, and they are super durable. If you have two pairs of these in your bag, you don't need anything else.If you are camping, and especially hiking, you might prefer the extra support and nonbinding design of the other brands I just mentioned.
