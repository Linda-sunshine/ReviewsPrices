review/summary: Boxers for the backpacker/hiker.review/text: I got these for a backpacking trip i took last September, and these were awesome. They definitely wick any sweat and moisture as you're hiking, which is important, because in high altitude areas the outside temp drops drastically at night and you need to be dry.I'd recommend these to anyone!
