review/summary: A nice mat with a wide choice of colorsreview/text: I decided on this mat because of the generous length (74 inches long and 24 inches wide) and the reasonable price. It was also nice to have such a large choice of colors. I chose the teal. The 1/4 inch thickness gives it just the right amount of cush, making it easy on your feet and knees. It's appropriate for both hard floors and carpet to give you stability while doing yoga poses which seems to help with balance. It lies flat once you have it unrolled and has a good amount of stick to it. It had a little bit of a plastic smell to it when I first unwrapped it, but that went away after a couple days. It wasn't strong and I sort of expect that with any plastic or foam mats or other articles. I suspect that they leave them out in the open before wrapping and shipping them.Their website states the the mat is made from PVC material and is completely latex free. Since I'm allergic to latex that's a good thing. When it gets dirty, they suggest washing it by using mild soap diluted in warm water and gently rubbing it down with a non-abrasive sponge. Then let the mat air dry. Another option is to wash the mat in a front-loading washing machine on a gentle cycle, and then let it air dry. I never knew you could put this type of mat in a washer, but it's good to know.All in all, I'm very satisfied with this mat and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.
