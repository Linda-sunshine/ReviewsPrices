review/summary: Bore Snake is the way to go!review/text: I bought the Hoppe's 24015 cos I needed something to clean for this caliber. This beats patches in the barrel but if you're really devoted I suppose you could do both. Expect it to be a tight fit, which is desired. Most importantly make sure you take the time to pick the right caliber of bore snake, when ordering, or you may order the wrong thing but that's on you! Great product, timely service! I'd recommend to a friend :)
