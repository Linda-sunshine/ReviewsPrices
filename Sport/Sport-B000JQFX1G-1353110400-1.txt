review/summary: very nice for 79 bucksreview/text: I received the watch yesterday. It came in a nice box and the watch is well protected with plastic.I adjusted the band and tryyed it on. It Looks and feels like an expensive watch. It does have the Rolex submariner look. I have owned high end watches before and love automatics. For $79 you are getting a nice looking watch. Who knows how long it will last. It's a very low investment for this quality. If you must have a Rolex, then buy a Rolex. Just be ready to fork over BIG MONEY!I recently received a compliment on this watch from a customer of mine. He said "Nice watch, Is that a Rolex?"
