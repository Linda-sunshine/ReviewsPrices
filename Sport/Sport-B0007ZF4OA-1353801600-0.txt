review/summary: Long lasting Handwarmers - as advertisedreview/text: Each morning I open a packet of the HeatMax Hot Hands warmers and enjoy their warmth while feeding my cats and horses and doing chores in the barn. They really help, just wish they had a magic beam that would warm the tips of my fingers!Right now I'm siting at the computer typing this review with the ones I opened this morning in my pockets. One is still very warm after 12 hours, the other from the same packet is almost dead.I'm sure I'll be ordering more next month to get me through a cold winter.
