review/summary: Good, but Under Armour BoxerJock is betterreview/text: I bought two pairs of these. Size small, I'm 5'7&#34;, waist 32&#34;. The fit is good, but I feel like the Under Armour boxerjocks offer much better compression. Just a tight feel all around. The problem with both is that they make me hot. It's hard to wear these on a regular basis because they don't offer the breathing room like regular boxers do. I was hoping that these ExOfficio boxers were a little &#34;cooler&#34;, but they were not. I'll be wearing these to play sports, but not for daily use.
