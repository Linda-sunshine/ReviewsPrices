review/summary: Excellent value, no issuesreview/text: I bought this for my '96 Chrysler Sebring Convertible not sure if it would work but couldn't beat the price. It worked out great and was able to take a couple of bikes for about an hour drive and a single bike for a 4 hour drive without any issues. With the shape of my car this was pointing more upwards than out like it was designed but I didnt have any issues with that. It left a little scratch on my trunk where the handle bar was leaning against it but nothing too noticeable.
