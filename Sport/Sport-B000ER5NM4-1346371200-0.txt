review/summary: okay but not what I was looking forreview/text: this pants fit good. Wish they were a little longer. I'm 5'9 and I like my pants to go to the ground. Thicker matieral than I expected. Won't be wearing these to my pilates class! Pj's will be perfect. Scared to dry them too, will they shrink?
