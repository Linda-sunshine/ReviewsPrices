review/summary: Big Improvementreview/text: This grip is a nice tight fit and has a very comfortable slightly tacky feel. Far better than the plastic grip it replaced. Fits perfectly on an Anderson lower receiver with Del-ton lower parts kit. Some have commented that the grip is thicker than stock where it mounts to the receiver and interferes with the safety lever. While it is somewhat thicker the safety just clears on mine.Though not manufactured in the USA (made in Mexico) it's very good quality. I like it so well I will probably also get the matching forend. I absolutely would recommend this grip..
