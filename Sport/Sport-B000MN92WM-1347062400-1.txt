review/summary: this is my third Omron, I love them all, there great.review/text: This is the third one I have and I only wore one out so far in eight years. I just got this new one yesterday. Today I wanted so see how accurate it really was. I set up the new one which is so easy and attached it to my belt along with my older one on the other side. I did my elipitcal for forty mintues and walked for forty mintues so far today. they both where the same in steps. I can't say enough good things about these pedometers. I have in the past purchase other brands and they never lasted very long and where not that accurate. Once I got the Omron I knew I had the best. Hope this helps anyone looking for a good pedometer.
