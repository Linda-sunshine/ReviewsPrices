review/summary: You get what you pay forreview/text: This was my 1st heart rate monitor that used for my cycle training. I wanted to start with something inexpensive so I can determine how effective these are for training. The item worked well for about 5 mos then it started to give false (low bpm) readings. I replaced the batteries, but it did not solve the problem. I just think its a very poor quality and hence the low price. The inability to download is also a negative on this product. My suggestions is to pay a little more and go with a more reputable brand in this category.
