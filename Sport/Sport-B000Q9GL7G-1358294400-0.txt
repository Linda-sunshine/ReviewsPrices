review/summary: Blackhawk Serpa Holster for Glock 26/27review/text: This is the only holster that I will trust to carry a loaded Glock. If my Glock (26 or 27) is carried in a non-locking holster, I do not have a bullet chambered and rely on a rack of the slide to fire the first bullet. The Blackhawk Serpa is lightweight and gives me confidence that if I have a serious slip or fall while hunting or hiking, that I won't have an accidental discharge. While the holster does not pull the gun in as close as I would like to my hip, the safety afforded by the locking mechanism drove my purchase
