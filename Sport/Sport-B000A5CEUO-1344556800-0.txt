review/summary: Love it!review/text: This heart rate monitor works just as it is described. I use it while running and doing a bootcamp. It's convenient to be able to look down at the watch on my wrist and see what my heart rate is registering. I don't use the other bells and whistles on this product, just the heart rate monitor and it works perfectly!!!
