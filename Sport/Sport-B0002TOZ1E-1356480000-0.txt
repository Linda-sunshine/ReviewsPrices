review/summary: Wintry, black gold toed socksreview/text: I bought these for my grandson for basketball games, but he felt they were too thick! Sorry. I gave them to my husband instead because he thought they would be great for most things in his wintry life--ice fishing, scooping snow, and just being outdoors.
