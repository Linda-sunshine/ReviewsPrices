review/summary: Perfect for what I need!review/text: The description is exactly what it says it is. The pump is super easy to use, and it inflates the mattress really quickly and isn't too noisy or anything, and the cord stores away so it's not hanging out or anything and is really long, so it shouldn't be too difficult to connect to an outlet. The bed is surprisingly comfortable (it's an air mattress, people) and holds its air really well (I sleep on it for up to a week at a time when I am visiting my bf in his dorm and I maybe need to top it off once or twice?). It collapses and store really easily and my bf and I agree it was a very smart investment!
