review/summary: Pros & Consreview/text: I bought an aero bed about a decade ago and it finally got a hole in it that couldn't be repaired this year. I needed a replacement and this one was a deal on Black Friday... so I ordered it. I haven't slept on it overnight yet, but I did lay on it for a while after blowing it up and here are my Pro's and Cons:PRO:Very comfortable - much more so than my old aero bedSits up higher off the ground than my aerobed didThe plug has a nice hide-away spot that my aerobed did not have for after you blow it up.Cons:Takes longer to inflate (Aerobed was done in under a minute - this one takes about 2 minutes)Takes MUCH longer to deflate - Aerobed could be deflated and put away in it's oversized bag in less than a minute... this one took over 5 minutes and was a struggle to fit back into the much smaller bag it came with.Overall... if you have the patience to mess with the added deflate time, It's a bargain. If you don't... buy something else.
