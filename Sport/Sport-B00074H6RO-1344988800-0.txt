review/summary: ORDER LARGER THAN YOU THINKreview/text: followed the instructions on how to size and fell right into the mid range of x-large. Still very tight after about 10 wears they are starting to loosen-up slightly.The thumb area on rt. glove is starting to unravel. I suppose not a big issue. I would order xxl if doing over.
