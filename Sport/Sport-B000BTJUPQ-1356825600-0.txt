review/summary: Solid!review/text: My 10 year old daughter LOVES this bow and arrow set. I decided to get a good yet inexpensive set, because she was obsessed with archery since she watched The Hunger Games. This gift didn't disappoint. It's solidly made and she was able to hit her mark during her first practice session!
