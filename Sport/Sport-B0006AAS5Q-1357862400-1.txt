review/summary: Small, Cheap, Unimpressive...review/text: I was really disappointed when I opened my new Invicta 9212. It was much smaller than I expected, and felt much cheaper than my older Invicta. I suppose I should have actually determined how large 40mm was before I ordered. Just to be clear, a 40mm watch face is NOT large for a men's watch. It is, in my opinion, a small to medium size for a modern men's watch (it actually looked better on my wife's small wrist). As a result, it does NOT stand out, does NOT look impressive, and does NOT make the impact I needed it to make. If you are looking for a two-tone watch that is really going to "POP" and grab attention, keep shopping. This doesn't even come close. In fact, this would have been the smallest watch in my watch collection (and I have several "medium-sized" watches). Furthermore, there are images of the watch that demonstrate a nice texture in the white portion of the dial. This texture is not very noticeable in person, and does NOT look intricate. It looks cheap. Yeah, it was only seventy-five dollars, but I think I can do better. I am thinking of exchanging it for a Bulova or Michael Kors that are similar in appearance, but larger and more expensive. I probably won't buy another Invicta. I think they have lowered their quality significantly over the years.
