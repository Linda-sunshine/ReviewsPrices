review/summary: Maybe its just me...and a few othersreview/text: After doing some research and reading a number of reviews I purchased this product. 1)I totally agree with the previous posts that said that the gloves ran small. I too ordered an XL since all my other gloves were XL and they were at least a size too small. And to the person who says this complaint is idiotic because leather stretches...leather also tightens when it gets wet. No need to name call, it is what it is. 2)These gloves have ZERO padding whatsoever! I got on the bench press and couldn't do what I normally do due to the discomfort. Felt like all the weight was resting on my wrists. 3)The stitching is perfectly imperfect!All in all, if I had baby hands and lifted 10lb weights these might be ok gloves. Unfortunately for me that's not the case. The search continues...
