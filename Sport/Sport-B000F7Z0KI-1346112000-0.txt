review/summary: Takes a lick'n and keeps on tick'n. Thanks Polar!review/text: This was my 4th purchase of these great water bottles that DO KEEP THE WATER ICE COLD FOR HOURS. Aside from loving the function, the customer service of Polar is Awesome. As their site says, "Accidents Do Happen" and well, I accidentally left 2 of my water bottles on my rear bumper. After driving away and reaching for my still cold (after a 3 hour ride) Polar Water Bottle, I realized what I had done. I turned the car around and drove back to find both water bottles in the middle of a busy 5 lane Blvd. Retrieving the bottles was the biggest downside here. After retrieving the bottles, I found 1 of the 2 had been run over by a car and the cap was sheared off from the pressure. The act of retrieving the bottles was the worst part of the story because a simple visit to the Polar Website revealed that they stand behind all their water bottles with a FREE CAP REPLACEMENT OFFER. In less than 30 seconds I completed the form that confirmed they would send me a replacement, including postage, for FREE. Thanks Polar!Polar Insulated Water Bottle
