review/summary: Leaking!review/text: This is my second Camelbak bottle, my first bottle a 750ml was so perfect to carry around and easy to dring from (I would give 5 stars) I decided to acquire a second one. It turned out to be leaking under the lid. I must keep this bottle in the vertical all the time, so I cannot carry it in a bag under the risk of leaving my bag all wet.I hope this is just a manufacturing issue. I will contact the manufacturer to sort out this problem.
