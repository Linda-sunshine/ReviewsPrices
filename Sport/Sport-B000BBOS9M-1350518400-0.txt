review/summary: Impressed!review/text: The other reviews were enough to get me to try it, and I am glad i did! This thing really does fluff up to be a full height pillow, and is actually even a medium firm - firm pillow. I thought that even if it did fluff to look like it was filled all the way, the stuffing would have to be soft enough that weight of my head would flatten it out. Not at all! It gives plenty of support all night long. The only thing that might bother some people is that it does have a bunch of cubes of stuffing material, and you can feel them through the cover. Doesn't bother me at all, and after a while I don't even notice it. I wish there were some other color choices, but a pillowcase fixes that anyway. Great little pillow!
