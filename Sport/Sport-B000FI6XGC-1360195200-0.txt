review/summary: Terrible and a Hasslereview/text: I have a shimano 21 speed bike and this barely fits my bike!!! It was hassle that I put it in ALL the way and it was a HASSLE taking it out! I'm going to return this because it barely fits and have possibly made a tear in my valve tube...I wouldn't recommend this for shimano 21 speed bikes.
