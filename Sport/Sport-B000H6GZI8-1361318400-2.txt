review/summary: Good grip, big improvement.review/text: This is used on a kel-tec pf9 and I wasn't easy to get on, but not hard either. It did hang over by a millimeter or so, which was easily trimmed off. If there is even a fraction of overhang, you'll want to trim it because it will interfere with the fit and function of your magazine. After putting it on, be sure to adjust it by holding the gun upside down, muzzle away from you, and link up the mag well with the trigger guard and then centering the finger notch of the new grip between those two reference points. I you don't, to might not notice it, but it certainly won't hurt to have it lined up correctly. The feel of the grip is more natural than the stock pf9 and makes it much more manageable and tacky when you want it to be. The only improvement I would want is to have the grip extend up underneath the beaver tail to soften the kick of the compact guns these grips are made for. For 8 bucks, it's hard to go wrong!
