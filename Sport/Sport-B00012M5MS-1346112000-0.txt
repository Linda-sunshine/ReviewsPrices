review/summary: styrofoam & gluereview/text: This is just Styrofoam with thin plastic decorative plates glued on, arrived with pieces falling off and loose.Styrofoam may work, but badly made and very cheap, nothing good to say... just get out the low temp glue gun to stick decorations back on, i guess... very poor product.
