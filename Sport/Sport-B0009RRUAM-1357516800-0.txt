review/summary: favorite piece of gear i ownreview/text: i bought this pillow for a backpacking trip down to havasupai. all my friends made fun of me because of how bulky it is.when we got down there i unpacked everything and set up all my bedding.at first this pillow is lumpy. but at the end of the day when it was time to go to sleep, it was all plush and comfortable.everyone kept stealing it to use it because it was more comfortable then their blow up pillows.yes it is a little bulky, but the comfort makes up for it.now most of my friends have bought them.also my family is going backing packing this summer and they all bought them as well.
