review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: This is a great small and light weight pump. No problem keeping my tires at 70 lbs. Construction seems good. Be careful when you first set it up. It has a rubber insert that has to be positioned properly depending on whether you have Schrader or Presta valves. The instructions are ambiguous. Also, I have trouble with the pump fitting too tightly on my valve stem (Schrader). Getting it on is OK but difficult to remove. Note that the screw cap covering the rubber piece that fits over the valve controls how tight the pump fits on the valve. You can loosen this cap to make it easier to remove the pump but that lets out air. Hard to find the right balance. One other thing that might not be obvious: the lever on the back of the pump should be folded down when inserting and removing the pump. It should be up to hold it securely on the valve. This is opposite to what some other pumps do.So, don't get me wrong. I'd buy it again. I even use it at home when getting ready for a ride.
