review/summary: Two days and it broke!review/text: It could have been a great product except it broke already after only two days of use, no abuse or anything, never hit anything while using it on a very open space with no obstacle. The cable snapped while I was using it, However, it was great when it didn't break it was a little pain adjusting to it but as long as you have pliers it easy to adjust (I actually used two pliers.) I gave it one extra star, it may be just a fluke that I had a bad one but I'll give this another shot.
