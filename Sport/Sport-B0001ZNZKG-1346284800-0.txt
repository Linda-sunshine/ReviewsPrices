review/summary: Perfect to prevent chafing.review/text: I've always had problems with chafing when I walk or run long distances or for long times. These really keep chafing from happening and are nice and soft. The only thing I don't like is the price. I'm kinda cheap so maybe it is just me, but the price is holding me back from buying more pairs. I might anyway because they are a great product.
