review/summary: Sometimes my water bottle farts...review/text: This is what I have to tell people when I fill this up and drink the first few sips... it makes a farting noise... but what can you do. I love the straw in this style of bottle as it means I drink more water quickly, although I do have to recommend buying extra mouth pieces as these things can start looking pretty nasty if you don't clean them regularly.
