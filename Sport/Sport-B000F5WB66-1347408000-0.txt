review/summary: Faulty On/off Buttonreview/text: Received as a gift, out of the box appeared ok.Attempted to use it and the on/off button was sticking and would not depress. Attempted to use for a couple of days, then the button would not depress at all. Sent back and chose a different product.Also noticed that it has no decent memory of last work out and if you accidentally press the button again, your previous information is erased.
