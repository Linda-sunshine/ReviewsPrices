review/summary: My first quality pocket knifereview/text: I've had inexpensive pocket knives in the past, but never really owned a quality one. The discounted price attracted me to this model and I've not been disappointed with it as yet. Quick open using either hand is excellent and the &#34;lock&#34; switch is easy to move with one hand when I've secured it previously. I would highly recommend this knife (and have done so when people ask me about it) to anyone who is looking for a quality tool to carry with them.
