review/summary: Next best thing to owning a gun.review/text: I dont stab people everyday, but when I do I prefer the Kershaw. In particular this knife is so sharp it will cut anyone at anytime, including yourself so be careful out there.I liked this knife because it is very small and light weight, i carry it my hand while walking and it is far less obvious than a portable mace can. It is a must have in the park at night or in remote jogging trails. Makes me feel safer when I am in an unsafe area.Ultimately, you want a knife that is extremely sharp and somewhat difficult to see. The element of suprise is more important when you only have a knife for defense. The key hear is the blade. This knife cuts on contact with no binding. A quick swipe or stab at a persons leg will leave them unable to persue you any further. Do not underestimate this blades sharpness. I have personally seen this blade slice right through a cornea, which is tougher than you might think.I strongly recommend this knife to anyone and everyone, as it is my personal care weapon for daily defense.
