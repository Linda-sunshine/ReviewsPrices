review/summary: SUPER SHINY and great to have when neededreview/text: Quick review of these - - YES they work great as a thermal blanket - YES I keep them in out vehicles in case of an emergency ( all of them including my motorcycle ) , YES they are cheap enough to be disposable, YES they are super reflective ( can almost be used as a mirror if flattened out enough so they double as a rescue mirror if needed ) they are pretty strong BUT if cut or torn they do rip very easily. For the price here they are awesome.
