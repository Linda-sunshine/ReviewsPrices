review/summary: Perfect!review/text: I wasn't sure how I would like this but, it worked perfect for a guest we had for about 6 weeks. It was easy to get in and out of, it held air very well but, we did air it up a little each week to be sure it was nice and firm for sleeping. It has a switch on the bed and all you do is flip it to air it up! It's so easy! I didn't have a twin sheet so I just used a full size and it stayed on and worked fine even though it was bigger than the bed. I would definitely recommend this.
