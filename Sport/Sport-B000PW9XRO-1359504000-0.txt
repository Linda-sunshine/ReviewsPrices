review/summary: Christmas gift for sonreview/text: I purchased these because my son participates in therapeutic horseback riding every week and during the winter and late fall, his hands get very cold. I thought that he would be able to use these gloves to keep his hands warm. For some reason, his hands are still cold!! So the gloves LOOK very nice and are great quality...they just don't work for what I got them for. :-( Not sure what else to do since he won't ride with bulky gloves and these are thin enough for him to feel the reins in his hands. Oh well, the search continues..... ;-)
