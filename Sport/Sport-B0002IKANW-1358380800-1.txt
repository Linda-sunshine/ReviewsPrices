review/summary: Another Great Snap Cap Purchasereview/text: The A-zooms are by far the best snap caps you can buy, and I was happy to find a few more in the package in this pistol caliber than you tend to get in the rifle and shotgun packages. As always, they load, cycle (manually) and dry fire flawlessly, and I only purchase the A-zoom brand now. Out of 5 calibers of these that I have, I've never had an issue with any single snap cap.
