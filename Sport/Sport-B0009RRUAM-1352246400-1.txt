review/summary: Solid Productreview/text: I was looking for a good camping/travel pillow. Based on prior reviews, I decided to purchase this Thermarest Compressible Pillow.When I first got it out of the bag, it was compressed, and I got it out and did my best to try and fluff it up. I also waited about 30 minutes to an hour to see if the individual stuff "cubes" would expand on their own. They didn't really.Needless to say, you MUST wash this the first use, or after a long storage. AFter washing and then drying 10-15 minutes on the tumble low setting, it was completely expanded and ready for use.It is a very comfortable pillow. THe product seems to be well made and sturdy. I can't wait to try it out in the field.
