review/summary: Why arent you using this?review/text: These bore snakes are much easier to use and cause much less damage to the barrel than your traditional push rod and brush. I find that I can spray in, or simply add a few drops of, bore cleaner into the barrel and allow it to soak in for a few minutes and then just pull this through a few times and the bore is clean. An extra wet patch sometimes if I have gone a few days from when I last shot the gun. I have them in multiple calibers and they all seem to work equally well.
