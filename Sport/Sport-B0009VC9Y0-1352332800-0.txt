review/summary: Best knife I've ever ownedreview/text: I'm not a weird knife collector or anything but I believe when you pay good money, a well-known product will last a long, long time if you take care of it. I always wipe the natural oils from my hands off before I slip it back in my pocket.I had originally looked for an automatic knife but found they were illegal in my state (and looks like most), so I decided to go with this speed "assisted" knife. It is -almost- automatic. With a flick of the little bump on the outside it slaps and locks open.I thought the straight blade would be weird but it is very beautiful. Came very sharp, haven't had to sharpen it yet.Buy with confidence, another great Kershaw blade!
