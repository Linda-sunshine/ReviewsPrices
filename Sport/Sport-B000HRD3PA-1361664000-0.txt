review/summary: Terriblereview/text: They have one of the loop style drawstrings which are a huge pain to tighten. I have many other brands of shorts like these (all same size) and these also run considerably larger than the other brands. The end result with flawed drawstring and running too large for size is that these shorts are constantly sliding down. I regret the purchase.
