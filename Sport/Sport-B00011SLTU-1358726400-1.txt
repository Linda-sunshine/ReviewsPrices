review/summary: Perfect for my needsreview/text: When visiting my daughter, I found that I had a plastic 'string' on a new item of clothing I was wearing that I'd failed to cut off when I took off the tags. She pulled out this little Classic SD Swiss Army Knife [about 2 1/2 inches long] from her purse and popped out the scissors. It snipped through the plastic with ease. I knew I wanted one for in my purse as well. I love green, so I was completely sold.I put it on my Christmas list and Santa included it in my stocking. :) I've already used it several times for opening packages. How many times have you wanted to open something while in the car, like a CD case, and went looking for a nail file or tried to use your keys? This little Swiss Army Knife has a blade, scissors, a nail file/screwdriver, tweezers and even a toothpick. There is a key ring on the end if you want to attach it to something. I've only used the blade and the scissors, but I'm sure the tweezers and screwdriver will come in handy in the future. I doubt I'll have use for the nail file or toothpick, but they would be handy for some people.There are numerous Victorinox knives with a plethora of attachments that come in a variety of sizes. The first Swiss Army Knife was made in 1884 by Carl Elsener for [no suprise] the Swiss Army. It was named after his mother, Victoria. After WW2, American GI's brought the knife to the US. Today the knives [and some other products] are sold all over the world. The manufacturer's website has interesting stories of how the knives have been used to save lives, etc. Customer support is located in CT. There is a lifetime warranty for workmanship and defects.I expect to use this knife for many years to come.
