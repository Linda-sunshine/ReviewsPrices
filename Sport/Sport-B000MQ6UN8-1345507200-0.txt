review/summary: Superb Sunglassesreview/text: These sunglasses are perfect for most everything and provide good eye protection from the sun. Perfectly clear, and the lower gradient coating allows driving to be safer and much easier and quicker to read the dials, buttons, controls, yet when looking back up to the road the darker tint is there preventing glare even when driving directly into bright sun. I would recommend these glasses to anyone who drives, walks dogs, shops, rides bicycles, jogs, enjoys the beach, just about any possible use where eye protection from the sun is desired, but with glasses that you can see through very clearly. The fit is perfect, almost no adjustment was required, and very comfortable to wear. The glasses stay put on the nose and ears, do not move about or slide down, they are well constructed, yet light weight. I am going to purchase a second pair, and maybe even a third, I like them that much! These glasses are worth what you have to pay for them.
