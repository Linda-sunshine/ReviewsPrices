review/summary: It's okayreview/text: I suppose it does what was intended. It holds water. But, condensation builds up on the outside, when you drink through the cap it sounds like a turkey call, and it doesn't fit in standard cup holders. All of these things could be stated are just part of the package, but I wasn't thrilled with it.
