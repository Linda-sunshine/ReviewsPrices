review/summary: Works great, easy to use.review/text: We had nine family members staying with us over the Labor Day holidays, and needed additional beds that didn't take up a whole room. These "beds in a bag' were perfect and the kids (older ones) slept comfortably on them. Easy to inflate and deflate when done to get out of the way each day to use the room they were in. Wonderful and economical for unexpected overnight guests. Worked pretty well with single or twin bed sheets.
