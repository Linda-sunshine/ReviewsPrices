review/summary: Great bottlereview/text: Great bottle with no strange taste when you drink from it. It doesn't leak as long as you put the lid on correctly. It also keeps the liquid quite cool too.Worth noting that we also bought a blue one of these. Unfortunately after one use the blue kanteen had rust form in the inside screw where the lid goes. Thankfully, Amazon agreed to let us return it and we can get our money back - must have been a dud. We know of others who have these kanteen's and are very happy with them. And we intend to keep our plain stainless steel one.
