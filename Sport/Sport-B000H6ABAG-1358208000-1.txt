review/summary: Terrible Pilling!review/text: These pants are terrible. When they were brand new and before being washed, they began to pill. I put them in the wash and when I took them out of the washer I couldnt believe my eyes! They were pilled so badly that they are totally not wearable! They are so badly pilled with white balls I would be ashamed to wear them in public. Dont waste money on these. Spend a little more and purchase pants with at least 80 percent cotton content. I found out that the hard way......
