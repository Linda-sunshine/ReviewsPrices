review/summary: smells bad, hard to openreview/text: Have had this rather expensive bottle, paid $18, for several years. I carry RO water to work and have several brands/types of bottles. No matter how I clean this one, it smells foul if water sits in it for over a day or so. The lid is also so hard to grip to open that I often have to stick a pen through the hole for leverage, and it makes an obnoxious squeak noise. I avoid drinking from this one while driving because the wide mouth always splashes water down my shirt. Much prefer the taste of water from a cheap aluminum bottle. Have other brands of stainless bottles that don't stink like this one too. I assume it is something with the lid that makes it smell bad, but don't really know.
