review/summary: You get what you pay forreview/text: I bought this helmet because it was the cheapest one, so I kind of knew what to expect. It is what it is, for the price. Upon opening the box I found that some non-essential plastic pieces had come unglued. Sure, the helmet still functions, but that seems to be the general quality of assembly. Just sayin', no one's happy to buy a new product that's falling apart.In short, if you want to wear some styrophome on head while riding your bike to prevent serious injury both to yourself and your wallet, this is it. If however you want to wear a decent quality helmet, I would suggest forking over another $10-$20 on a nicer one.
