review/summary: Winter Cycling approvedreview/text: I live in Maine and have commuted through the winters for years. This year I wanted to keep training through the winter as well. I couldn't find gear that would keep my feet warm below zero if I were going out for a while (2-3 hours). I ride early, so when I wake up I open a package (two hand warmers) and allow the air to activate them. I leave about 20-30 minutes after I wake and I toss them in my boots. Because I'm pedaling they don't bother me if they move around a little so I don't bother with the foot warmers. They give off enough heat that I can go ride 30-40 miles in cold weather (-5 F) and my feet stay warm. For the price of this box, they are well worth it. They're not bad in your gloves either if you need them.
