review/summary: WOW.... comfort plus!review/text: This is my first review here at Amazon, after hundreds and hundreds of purchases on all sorts of things. Not that many items didn't warrant it, just that I was never that moved to come here and actually write something about an item I bought online. Until now. Like others, I was hesitant to spend over 20 bucks on a single pair of underwear. I am going to be travelling soon and figured what the heck, let's see what all the hooplah is about. I ordered three pair, in different colors. It is August in Massachusetts. That translates to 90 degrees with 90% humidity and no central AC. HOT, sticky miserable HOT! Everything sticks to everything! Well, after sliding these babies on, nothing is sticking to anything! Incredible, best money I have ever spent. I have been talking to everyone I come in contact with about my underwear since I put them on a few hours ago! As far as how they wear over the long haul, I have no idea... all I can say is right here, right now, the most comfortable, best underwear I have ever worn, period!As time passes in my travels, I'll try to get back here and update my review in the coming months...
