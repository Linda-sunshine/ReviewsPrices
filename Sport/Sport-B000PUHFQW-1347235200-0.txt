review/summary: Love this mat!review/text: This yoga mat exceeded my expectations. Based on the reviews, I thought I might have trouble with slippage and tearing, but neither have been an issue, knock on wood. I've been using it almost every day for two months, and it looks and feels like new.It's very sticky, and provides good cushioning during poses that are hard on joints. Plus, you can't beat the price. I definitely recommend!
