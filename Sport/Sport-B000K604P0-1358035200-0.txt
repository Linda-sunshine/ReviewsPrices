review/summary: This is my thirdreview/text: I love the Thermos Backpack Bottle because it doesn't leak. Or, well, it doesn't leak so long as I am careful not to overfill it. Do not fill it past the line! When I am careful not to overfill the bottle, it keeps my coffee hot all day, and I can carry it in my bag without worrying about leaks. The pop-up lid lets me drink without having to unscrew the lid or pour, so it's very convenient for commuting. Best. Thermos. Ever.
