review/summary: Bite valve is easily broken.review/text: The water bottle is fine itself, but even through casual use the hinge which connects and allows the swing of the bite valve and the bottle is already broken. I have used mine for about 1.5 months and it already broke when trying to take off the plastic bite part for cleaning.
