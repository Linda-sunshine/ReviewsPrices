review/summary: great workoutreview/text: it is a great set of workouts and i love it. everything about the system is fabulous! i lost 40 lbs in 90 days and i eat healthy. the nutrition plan teaches you a new way to eat and following it 90 days breaks old habits. the only issue i have is that my set feels like it must have been a returned item. there arent any visible scratches, but some of the discs skip. i can play through the skips without a problem but still for the price you pay you want perfect.
