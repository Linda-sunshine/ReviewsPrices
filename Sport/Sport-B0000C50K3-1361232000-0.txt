review/summary: life saverreview/text: i couldn't find a .17 bore snake anywhere except amazon believe it or not, but i'm glad i got it. because it's smaller diameter, be very careful, no snap yet but i always feel like it will on first pull. not a manufacture flaw or anything just how it is. somewhat fraying, not alot, after a few uses.
