review/summary: Useful beyond beliefreview/text: This knife's 2 big advantages are (1) its light weight and small size (2) its multifunctionality. Only 2.25&#34; long and weighing only 0.8 oz. it's easy to have one with you at all times & it comes in handy every time you turn around. Even on a wilderness backpacking trip I use it ALL the time. I carry a Buck folding belt knife with 4&#34; blade in a belt sheath but I find this little Swiss Army knife more useful for 90+% of the things I need to do. It's perfect for cleaning mountain lake trout. Whether I want to use the blade, the scissors, the screw driver, the file, the tweezers or the tooth pick I'm always pulling it out of my pocket. When I get home from most trips I find I haven't even taken the Buck knife out of its sheath. Buy one and put it in your pocket. You'll find that you too will never leave home without it. I have several backups in my desk drawer in case I misplace mine.
