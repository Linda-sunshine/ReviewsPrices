review/summary: Invicta Insightsreview/text: First, where I'm coming from: I own and wear a Rolex Datejust, 3 Invictas, a Seiko and I Skagen.Not all at once.Before I buy, I carefully take in reviews and comments from here and elsewhere. While I'm a big Amazon fan, I did receive some incorrect information from one of their representatives about this product. I ordered this watch 8/29/12 and was wearing it about a week later.Although there is no no model number change, Invicta themselves had told me that current production is the new TMI/Seiko NH35A movement, not the older NH25A or the Citizen/Miyota 8215. It has 24 jewels, not 21 as in the others, and beats at 21,600 vibrations per hour. Accuracy initially seems good at about +7 seconds per day average, it can be hand wound, and it can be hacked for convenient and precise setting (all hands stop when the crown is pulled out 2 clicks). The date magnification is larger than on the Miyoya version, and through the view back, the mechanism itself is much more stylized and attractive.I am very pleased with this watch and would recommend it to others. I hope this clarification helps.
