review/summary: Great Mat ... for beginnersreview/text: Pros: I've had this mat for a couple months now and am thoroughly satisfied with it. I got the purple one and the color is fantastic. The mat provides more than enough padding for my concrete and tile floor. The length is fantastic as well. There was, of course, that fresh new yoga mat smell when I opened it up, but I left the mat unrolled in my room for a couple days with the windows open and fans blowing. After that I could only notice the smell when my face was on the mat and even that's gone away.Cons: I just started doing yoga so I'm not sure about slippage when in poses where that is really important, but I definitely notes some slipping when I'm sweating and in downward dog. My only other complaint is that the mat holds onto every piece of dirt or dust that was on my floor or my feet so I have to vacuum it almost daily.Overall, I love this yoga mat and it's great for the level that I'm at so it's staying around.
