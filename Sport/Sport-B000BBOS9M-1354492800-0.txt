review/summary: Not a pillowreview/text: I thought that I may have gotten a defective product but after reading other reviews it seems that it has a design deficiency:- to make it compressible its filled with roughly 1/4 of foam that it really needs to and as such it is very flat and lumpy - there is more air (nothing) in it that the filling material. Whatever filling material is in there it is lumped together after being rolled and unrolled.Mine went back, would leave 0 stars if could
