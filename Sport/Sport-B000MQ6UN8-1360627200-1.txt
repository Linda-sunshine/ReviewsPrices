review/summary: Looks cool, works greatreview/text: These are awesome, the only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because of the price. You definitely feel a huge difference between these and regular $5 gas station sunglasses. It's light, fits perfectly, and spectacular in blocking UV rays and reducing glare. Definitely recommended.
