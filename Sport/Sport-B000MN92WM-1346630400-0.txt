review/summary: Don't be a Couch Potato!review/text: Works great! Software is not a strong suit but I purchased this pedometer to track my walking exercises not provide eye popping charts... Light weight and easy to review last seven (7) days of walking exercise. Counting of all steps taken per day lets you know your "Couch Potato" status!!! Software works well with "Windows7" when compatability is set to "Vista".
