review/summary: All-In-One Bottle, but Beware of Mold!!review/text: This is a great bottle and is always a great go-to present for friends that work out and work in an office all day. I can definitely say that these bottles increase the amount of water you drink each day. I love the quality of the product and even though I've had a few for a couple years, I have yet to see one break.Beware of the mold build up in the bite valve! I use a Q-tip to clean it or simply put it in the dishwasher. Black mold forms in everyone of the bite valves I have and they need to be cleaned every 3 weeks or so. Just a heads up.
