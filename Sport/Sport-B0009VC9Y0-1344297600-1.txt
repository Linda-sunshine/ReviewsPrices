review/summary: Good introduction to Spring Assistreview/text: The Kershaw Leek is by far the knife you should buy if you are interested in spring assist. I switched from a Vapor 2 and couldn't be happier. As with all Kershaw products this come out of the box Razor Sharp. If you're interested in switching to spring assist this is the knife for you.
