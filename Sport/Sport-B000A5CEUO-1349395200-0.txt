review/summary: Doesn't keep and average, but it is the best bang for the buck.review/text: I bought the Omron HR-100C after researching heart rate monitors to death. This seemed that it would be the most reliable for the money spent. The Timex didn't have the best reviews for reliability, and the Polars were too pricey.It isn't mentioned in the description but I was pleasantly surprised when the exercise equipment that my gym uses (Octane Fitness) picked up the signal from the HR-100C. The equipment only mentions Polar as the monitors that they work with. It seems to be very accurate and there is no problem with the chest belt losing contact. It says to wet the contacts and I see a contact jelly that they sell but I have had no need to even wet it let alone use a gel. the watch looks huge in the photos, but it is actually pretty small. Somewhere between a ladies size watch face and a man's.The only downside and this is my fault for researching too many monitors and getting them confused. I thought it would calculate the amount of total exercise time spent in your personal target zone like the Polar RS100. But at almost half the price I think I can live w/o that feature for a while. Besides, the elliptical machine will do that for me when I use it.All in all, a very good monitor for the money.
