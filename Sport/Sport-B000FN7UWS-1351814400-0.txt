review/summary: One for everybodyreview/text: We finally got a water bottle for my youngest and we purchased this one because the rest of us each have a klean kanteen of various sizes and shapes. The two year old needed one that was small and easy to carry full, so this was our first choice. Be careful when you drop it, it will ding.
