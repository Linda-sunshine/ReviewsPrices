review/summary: How awesome is this thing?review/text: Just great. This little pump works really well and inflates quickly. Like 30 seconds quickly. Also it fits on the stem well and is durable. I haven't mounted it on my bike yet, since it will most likely get stolen, but to throw it in a backpack it works great also. Definitely get something like this if you have presta valves! I hate the adapters. This thing is great.
