review/summary: Mold water anyone?review/text: So, I love the idea of this but it just didn't work for me. I never felt like I could get it clean, especially up into the straw. And after a while, in the mouthpiece part, it got all moldy. Granted, maybe that was my bad, just didn't use it enough. But I tried to clean it out, totally impossible. Once it's gone, it's gone. Which is gross because even if you don't have mold growing in there, who knows how nasty it can get if you can fully clean it. Yuck.
