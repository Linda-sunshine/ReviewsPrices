review/summary: Invicta 9212 Speedway Watch (Invicta keeps pumping out the hits!! LOL)review/text: I liked that the gold color looked like real gold. I own a Rolex Submariner and it is pretty much the same hue as the 18kt solid gold on that watch. The Invicta watch at under $80 on Amazon was a steal. It gives you that Rolex Daytona look at a fraction of the cost. It has two additional crowns that function as additional time keepers. You will need to unscrew them in order to engage them. The watch was not as heavy as my last Invicta automatic watch. One thing about Invicta is that something will go wrong in about 1-1 1/2 yrs.. This is my fourth one and the other 3 all had problems but I keep buying them because they mimic the Rolex look and plus they give you the option of extending the warranties on them and I like their watch lines (They are unique and look fabulous). The other three that had problems still keep excellent time, it's just the user, me. I use them everyday at work where they get beat up pretty good. If you use them in an office setting or at school, etc. then you shouldn't have them break on you with the frequency that they broke on me with my heavy everyday use. Two of them had glass on the back that broke but it was my fault. When I wear them, they fog up--that's how I found out they had sprung a leak. If you drop them once, they will probably break from the glass lens portion (Front or Back). The other watch had two hour markers fall off and are bouncing around inside on the face. I need to take it to have it glued back on. I base my 5 stars on looks and timekeeping out of the box. Once I tried out the watch for 3 weeks I will say that the gold is coming off already. Also, the watch feels very light for a bulky looking timepiece.
