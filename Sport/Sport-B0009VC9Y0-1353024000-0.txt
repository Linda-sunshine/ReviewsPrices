review/summary: Wonderful Once You Make Some Adjustmentsreview/text: Great knife. The problem is that the safety which was not needed anyway, engages all the time when you need the knife. It can be adjusted but you will be adjusting it all the time. You don't need that worry if your knife will open or not. I removed the safety with an Allen tool and all is well now.Leek has flipper and thumb nub which is great so no matter what kind of blade you are used to it will open without fumbling. I just got another ken onion knife the shallot and it has only a flipper, that was a letdown.Removed a star for safety problems and sometimes week spring opening that fails to go all the way open even when you adjust the scale screws..Good knife, one of my favorites.
