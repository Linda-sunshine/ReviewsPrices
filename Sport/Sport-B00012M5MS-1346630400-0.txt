review/summary: OK helmet, but buy it elsewhere if you really want it!review/text: This is an OK helmet for an amateur biker but beware that purchasing it on Amazon, the warehouse packaged it in a box that was too narrow, resulting in the glued-on plastic pieces coming off and laying loose in the box. Lightly glued-on plastic pieces that came off pretty easy, really? I returned it and could have bought it at a local store for about the same price but noticing the plastic pieces coming off that easy made me go with a GiroGiro Indicator Sport Bike HelmetSave yourself the return hassle and the crappy lightly-glued on plastic covers!3 stars for a semi-ok cheap product but 1 star on shipping. Since I am rating the product, not the shipping, I will leave it at three stars (It's amazing how many people will reduce stars for reason that are not the fault of the product itself!)
