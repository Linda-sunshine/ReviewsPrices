review/summary: Makes the Taurus PT709 Slim even betterreview/text: I put these on my Taurus PT709 Slim. The process was pretty easy, I rubbed a little bit of glass cleaning fluid on both the grip and the sleeve before starting and that helped shift the sleeve in the right position. Used an exacto knife to remove the excess. This has improved the grip of my Taurus significantly... I would recommend this for anybody with that model and medium size hands.
