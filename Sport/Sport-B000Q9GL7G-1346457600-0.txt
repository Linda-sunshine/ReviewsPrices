review/summary: The BESTreview/text: I LOVE this holster. I watched and read several reviews between this blackhawk serpa and the fobus. I knew I wanted an active retention holster not passive. This holster comes with the paddle and belt loop which I messured would fit up to a 1 3/4" belt but it is adjustable for smaller belts. Im using the paddle with the extra belt hooks. This thing stays right where you put it and dont even pull away from your body much even if you try. The tension screw lets you adjust the drag the holster has on you firearm. The release lines your trigger finger up right where it belongs. And the 3 screws that attach the paddel to the holster allow you to adjust the cant. I can not say enough good things about this holster. You will not be dissapointed.
