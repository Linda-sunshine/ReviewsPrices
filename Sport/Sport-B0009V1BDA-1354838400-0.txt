review/summary: Coleman Road Trip Grill LXEreview/text: My husband I and love this grill for tailgating! It is light weight and very portable. Fits great in the back of our SUV. Folds up in a snap and cooks well. The only reason I did not give it a five star is b/c the one slide out broke the first time we used it. We still have the one side and it works fine. Would be nice to have both sides but overall I think this is a great little grill for football games.
