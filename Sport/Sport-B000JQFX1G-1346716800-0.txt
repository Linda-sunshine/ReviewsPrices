review/summary: What's not to like?review/text: Okay, I hear the nay-sayers already; 'It's an Invicta....'. Aw, just shut up! Are you knocking it, having owned it? Or are you knocking it, cuz people knock em? This thing is wonderful. Classic looks, decent movement (it tells me the time and date accurate enough for my intentions), super fit and finish for the pricepoint and no battery changes to boot. Again, what's not to like? Kudos to the Invicta team for continuing to provide fine quality pieces at very affordable prices! I teamed this with a MODENA rubber deployment strap just to give me options. Both are great. I'm a watch guy. Ask my wife and she would say; 'No. He's a watch fanatic.'. I own a lot of watches. She allows me my 'hobby'. I have stuff from this 8926ob to old Vacherons. I only own automatic or manual movements. This one fits nicely with the rest. It is becoming my 'go-to, i might hurt it, but so what?' rig. This holiday weekend, watch and band took a whitewater kayak beating with no ill results. Every Invicta I have owned has faired just fine. I like my Rollie Sub just fine and if I MUST do something foolish while it's on my wrist, I will. BUT, if I am PLANNING to do something foolish (wife thinks whitewater is foolish), on goes the Invicta.
