review/summary: Hi Tech Undies.review/text: I have had a few pair of these boxer briefs, or as they should be called: "Technical primary layer garments". These are the real deal. I have used them backpacking, kayaking, and traveling. In wet conditions and sweaty hot weather these undies have worked great. They dry fast and wick moisture. On a trip I have washed them at night, hung them in the hotel room bathroom, and they were dry and ready the next morning.
