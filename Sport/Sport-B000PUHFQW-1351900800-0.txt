review/summary: Slippery!review/text: I hated this mat, it's so slippery I can't even hold a down dog properly. Really sad as I was expecting much more given the reviews. This was a total let down for me. I would suggest you invest $30 more and get a decent mat that can make your yoga practice as pleasant as it should be.
