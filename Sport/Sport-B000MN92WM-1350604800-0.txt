review/summary: Pedometer usereview/text: I have worn this same pedometer for over two years and it definitely helps me in my weight loss goals. My goal is 10,000 steps per day and even though I may only reach that once or twice a week having the pedometer on my hip compels me to walk more. I have an artificial hip and Arthritis in my other hip so it is good for me to build up the muscles around both hips and by using the pedometer it shows me when I need to walk more. This is a good tool for everyone to wear.
