review/summary: Classic Mens Socksreview/text: I've been wearing gold toes as long as I can remember. They have always held up well, looked great and are reasonably priced. I've read some reviews that they have changed the quality of the sock recently. I have to agree, yes, these are different then some older pairs I have laying around. However, I don't feel these are inferior to the older versions. It seems there is less cotton in the new versions which at first concerned me, however after extended use I have noticed that they retain their shape much longer then before. I have yet to find a "quitter" (sock that no longer stays up). Also there is less beading/pilling (those little fuzzy pills that appear on wear spots) then the older models. Because of this I feel these socks will look better and last longer then the older models. However, that being said I do miss the breathability of having more cotton and the slight increase in comfort. But for the price you really cant beat gold toe socks.
