review/summary: Great product and service, thanks!review/text: We bought the last one of these when our son was 5 and are only replacing it now.. he is 12. And only because the foam handle has finally given up the ghost on one side and slipped off, and it is a teeny bit rusted, so really we could have fixed it but we felt a new one was ok after seven years!We hope this one performs many years of service like the last one..And a special mention to Charles in customer service for fixing up the hiccup with our first order and magically making sure there were no delays in receiving this one very promptly, I really appreciate your help.
