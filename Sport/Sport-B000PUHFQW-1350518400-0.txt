review/summary: best mat i've ever ownedreview/text: I like the extra length and thickness. The only slight downside is that it is just a tad slippery when doing poses like downward dog. This could be because it is new. A recent knee injury and surgery had me looking for a little extra cushion for my knees. I also appreciate that it is Phthalate Free.
