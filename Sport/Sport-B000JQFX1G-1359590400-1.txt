review/summary: Fantastic bargain!review/text: Simply love 'em. I was searching through Submariner a like watches and found also Pro Diver 8926OB. They have very similar look (including most of the details) like Submariner and I personally like it a lot. But it's still Invicta with it's - let's say traditional - details and that's the way it shuld be. No stupid replica. For last few months a quality Seiko NH35A 24-Jewels is put inside. The accuracy is -7s/day, which is the best you can get from watch with frequency of oscillation 21600/day. It doesn't need any COSC ("making the price higher") certification.I made few scratches during wearing and must say now I love the watch even more! My personal relation is deeper thanks to this. I assembled blue/grey NATO military strap, which looks so cool on diver's watches. Perhaps the best thing of all is the fact you'll get such fantastic watch for such a low price!Buy it, I bet you'll love it!
