review/summary: Thin, yet surprisingly strong and essentialreview/text: I bought these to include as part of a bugout bag, or camping. Thought to test them out before an actual need to use them, and I was extremely surprised to find how thin and strong the material was.It's long enough to cover a 6'2&#34; man and wide enough to wrap around my legs, but not completely around my chest. In snow emergency, use one blanket under your body, then use another one to cover yourself; since the blanket works by reflecting your own body heat back to you, but if there are openings, your own heat will escape and you won't be warm. Having the blanket under you and over you will keep the heat on you.I strongly recommend keeping a few with your camping gear, in your car, and in your luggage for when you travel.Just don't tear it intentionally or it will unravel.
