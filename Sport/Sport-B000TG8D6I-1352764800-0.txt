review/summary: Great exercise routine, if you can hack itreview/text: Beware, this is not for the out of shape. If you are obese or havent been active in a long time you're in for a RUDE awakening. These workouts are rough, even when I was in decent shape. I couldnt even imagine using these DVD's before when I was 240lbs. I'd probably puke or pass out about 5min in.That being said, if you're willing to make it work by going lighter, or working your way up to the level expected you can make it work for you.Just remember exercise alone won't do it, you'll need to fix what you're eating if you're over or under indulging. This is definitely recommended within the system, but you must make it work as a whole.Although fancy programs like this arent necessary if you can build your own program, I have given this to people I know who may benefit but don't have the ability to build their own plan (and I don't have the time to do so for them). I found this to be motivating for them, and a good all-in-one to get them to the next level.
