review/summary: I do love it.review/text: This is the perfect size for most cooking chores. The pan is deep enough to fry chicken or cook up some soup. The lid doubles as a shallow pan. Wonderful value for the price and the quality is exceptional as is all Lodge products that I have purchased. It is perfect for my wood cookstove in my vacation cabin.
