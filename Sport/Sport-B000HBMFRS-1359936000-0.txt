review/summary: Very handyreview/text: Needed extra bed for visiting relatives. This was perfect. Easy to inflate and deflate. High enough off the floor as not to be an issue getting up or down. The hardest part is to get all of the air out and fold it sufficently enough to put back into the storage bag. But it is a great air mattress. Would recomend.
