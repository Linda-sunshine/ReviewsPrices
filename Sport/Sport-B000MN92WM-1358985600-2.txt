review/summary: tolerablereview/text: This was great while it worked but having to replace the batteries so often has been a nuisance. My husband really likes his. We do a lot of walking and keep track of mileage with this unit. it is helpful that you can download the information to your pc. This way you can track yourself on a daily basis.
