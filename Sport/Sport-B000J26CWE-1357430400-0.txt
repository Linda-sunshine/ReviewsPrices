review/summary: great socksreview/text: bought these for my fiance. he loves them. though his shoe size is on the outer edge of the size indicator so they *just* fit. overall he's quite satisfied with the quality. this winter he's even been wearing them as a liner under regular socks when he's not wearing his toeshoes!
