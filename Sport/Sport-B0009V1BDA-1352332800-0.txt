review/summary: Burns too hot even on lowreview/text: I like the portability of this grill and the availability of different attachments, but this grill simply burns too hot even on the lowest setting. Food that is high in fat like chicken or foods that are delicate like salmon, or small like kabobs get scorched within 60 seconds on this grill. Either thick steaks or indirect heating is all that it is good for. If I keep one burner off and use the other on medium, the cooking time seems to match a larger grill, but then the grilled flavor is also diminished with indirect cooking. The gas canisters seem to last long, which is another good feature.In summary, while I won't dump this grill and get a different one (cost prohibitive), I will not buy the same brand when it comes time for replacement.
