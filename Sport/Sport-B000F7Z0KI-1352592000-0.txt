review/summary: Keeps water cool, fits standard cages reasonable pricereview/text: I ride to work and ride to train for races like the MS150. The Polar bottles keep water cool, they fit standard cages, the spouts are as practical as ever other water bottle spout and the finger loops to pull them out of the cages are handy. Great product. No complaints.
