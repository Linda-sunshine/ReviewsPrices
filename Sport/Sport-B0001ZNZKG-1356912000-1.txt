review/summary: Best Underwear Everreview/text: I bought these initially for travel, based in large part on the great reviews. I have always thought that ExOfficio products were good quality, although they tend to come at a high price. These are so comfortable I don't ever want to wear the other styles and brands I own, so I found myself constantly washing these. Finally bit the bullet and just ordered more pairs and am a fan. Highly recommended!
