review/summary: So far so goodreview/text: Daughter wanted one of these for her work-out/ walking regimen and this appears to do the trick. She programmed it in a matter of minutes and was excited to report how far she went on her 'power' walk.She likes the way you can simply put this pedometer in your pocket and it will function. Clipping in on her DVD belt has become the permanent location lately so she doesn't mis-place it as it is a small machine.She's happy with it and i'm impressed that so much info ( calories burned, for instance ) can be gleaned so easily. Enough said.
