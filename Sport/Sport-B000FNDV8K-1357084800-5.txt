review/summary: STARS & STRIPES CLASSICreview/text: I have only this brand of pocket knives for me, family, and friends. All have had the standard red casings. Now there are many varieties in many colors, designs and all have the same extremely high quality from the smallest to the largest. The 2 I got as Xmas gifts were hits and are being carried around proudly already. Blades seem to stay sharp forever and all love the scissors for coupon cutting etc. Easy to clean and maintain as always. Excellent service in getting this popular style to me before Xmas was a bonus. Service, Quality, Style, Features, and Dependability make this little knife one big gift for anyone!
