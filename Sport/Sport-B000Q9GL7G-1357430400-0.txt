review/summary: Perfect grab and go for carry!review/text: This holster is tough as bricks and secures my S&W M&P9/C very well. Completely covers trigger area and weapon will not pull or fall out without using the finger release. Put some blue thread lock on the cant screws--they tend to loosen up.
