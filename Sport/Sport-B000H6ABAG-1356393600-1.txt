review/summary: Very soft, size is true after multiple washingreview/text: I got these to wear out at the barn in ugly weather. The pants are very soft inside and out and they ride well when shoveling stalls and tossing around bales of hay - no twisting etc with ackward movements. They are pretty warm and the fabric is thicker than the el cheapo no name sweatpants from the local big box discount store. After three washings in warm water, they have not shrunk and that is a good thing. And the pockets are big enough to hold a Samsung Galaxy Note phone easily. I'll buy these again.
