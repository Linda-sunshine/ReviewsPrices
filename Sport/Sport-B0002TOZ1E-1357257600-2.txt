review/summary: these socks are greatreview/text: Been wearing these socks for a few weeks now and they feel great and wear well. comfortable elastic band at tops keep them up but not too tight. I have not exerienced the lint balls as others mentioned but then again i followed the advice of another purchaser of thes socks and washed them inside out before wearing them. No lint on my feet when I take them off after all day. I've been wearing gold toe socks for years normally purchased from big name stores and these feel just like all that I have bought before. $3/pair makes these socks a pretty good value.
