review/summary: perfect design for hot or cold with protected mouthreview/text: I have had this product for about 2 years now. I originally purchased it because of the brand name's reputation and the fact that the part that you drink out of is kept clean when it is closed. It also had a nice easy to use lock that keeps the top sealed even if it is tossed into a bag. It is my experience that if you prime it (add hot water and let it sit before adding coffee) it will keep the coffee too hot to drink for about 4 hours (even with a half hour driving commute in a Michigan winter). My only complaint is that it is not dishwasher safe. I have noticed some staining on the gasket but it does not impart a taste if cleaned with soapy water and a soft cloth. There is a trick to prevent it from "leaking": that is that you must ensure the top is completely dry on the treaded side and that there is no liquid above the inner lip of the thermos or on the threads of the thermos itself. If there is any liquid then it will drip until the liquid that is trapped is all out (a few drops max) but those parts are easily dried with a paper towel if you are worried about drips. One time I neglected to rinse the thermos after use and it got funky inside. I soaked the top in vinegar for a few minutes and cleaned the whole thing with soapy water and the smell went away (with no lingering effects.) I also bought this product when it was first introduced and feel that it is well worth the 35$ I paid.
