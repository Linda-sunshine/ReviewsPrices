review/summary: Pretty great glovesreview/text: Awesome gloves, only issue...on my left hand right between my middle finger and ring finger the gloves bore down really hard. I finally broke them in but geez it took almost 2 months. I work out 3 times a week, and its just a tad annoying/hurtful. But another reviewer suggested making a little slice on em. I didn't want to cut my new gloves. So i sucked it up and now there great. Overall a good pair of gloves. You may try maybe getting a size bigger.
