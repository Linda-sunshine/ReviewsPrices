review/summary: FAKE, DONT BUY THIS!. THIS RAYBANS ARE FAKE.review/text: Well i received the box yesterday and when I opened the it seemed a litte bit damaged. The glasses are ok, they have no scratch or things like that , but the RB label on the left side of the glasses, keep me thinking about its originality. Two weeks ago i bought i fake pair and when I went to the optic shop, they told me that was very 'rude-made' because you actually could feel the label like it was maded by a sharp object, this happens again with these glasses, I can feel the label 'scratch' from behind the glass. So I'm not pretty sure if a real one or not.I will carry them to the optic again (2nd time, buying fake stuff) to see what happens.UPDATE:FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE THEY WERE A GOOD REPLCA BUT IN COMPARISON WITH THE ORIGINAL RAYBAN'S THEY SEEMED BARBIE-PLASTIC!I'M REALLY ANGRY WITH THIS SELLER AND WITH AMAZON, SELLING FAKE STUFF, AND STEALING MONEY.I DON'T RECOMEND YOU BUYING GLASSES FROM THIS SELLER, EVEN THE CASE, BROKE AFTER TWO OPENINGS!I LIVE IN COLOMBIA SO ITS PRETTY HARD TO REFUND THE ITEM AND IS EXPENSIVE AS WELL. IT'S REALLY BAD, IT GIVES A BAD IMAGE TO AMAZON.SO THAT'S IT I LOST MY MONEY.
