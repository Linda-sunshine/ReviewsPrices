review/summary: Its Ticking Me Off in a Good Way.review/text: I started a more disiplined workout regimen and decided that I need to work out more efficiently - so I bought this device without any recommendations. As soon as I got the package which arrived yesterday, I immediately broke open the package. The watch was on my wrist in 10 secs - setup was easy and user friendly (instructions not really needed). The heart monitor band was next. I used it this morning during my morning run. Nothing more need be done other than moistening the band and slipping it on to just under the breast area and pressing the &#34;on/off&#34; button on the wrist band. Heart rate icon cam on immediately - Yes I'm alive. During my warmup, run and cool down, I was able to monitor everything and I knew when I needed to kick it up a notch. Love it. Thank you.
