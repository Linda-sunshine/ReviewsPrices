review/summary: Finally!!!!!review/text: Let me tell you, finding gloves for a big old hog oar of ands isn't easy, but, by God, I've done it! He loves them, hasn't had a pair that fit so well in he can't remember when! XXL was his fit, he is 6'2 at 260 pounds and has hands, (from wrist to middle finger tip,) of bout 8 inches. These allow full movement of his fingers for great gripping control. He, and I, highly recommend.
