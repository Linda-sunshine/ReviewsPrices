review/summary: The bestreview/text: If you don't have multiple pairs of this underwear, you are missing out. They're the best I've ever had. Not too tight or too loose, not too short or too long, not too heavy or too light, the material feels great and stretches a bit when it needs to. I've got 6 pair and I feel like I'm set for a few years. I've had them for about 4 months now and they aren't falling apart at all and they don't seem to be fading. I'm around a size 30 waist and I've got a couple small sizes and a couple medium sizes. Both work fine.
