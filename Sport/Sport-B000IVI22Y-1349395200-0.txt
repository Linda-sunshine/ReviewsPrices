review/summary: these are the best!review/text: I have CamelBaks at home and work and they help me drink 3 liters of water per day as you can sip so easily and fast. In no time a liter bottle is finished and you are filling up the next. The only thing is you have to bite the plastic straw opening to get the water to come up so over time it tears a bit.
