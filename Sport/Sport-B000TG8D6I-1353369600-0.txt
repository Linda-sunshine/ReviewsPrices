review/summary: pace yoursellfreview/text: I began this program, average guy of 43 years old not especailly in or out of shape. I just needed a program to do at home. First off, the product is well packaged and simple to follow. I found the meal guide very helpful in the way it was organized and more importantly it wasn't limited to what you could or couldn't eat. I like the way it's organizes different food categories with different values and then provides a budget. I really liked how there's an easy calculation to determine how many calories you should have base on your size starting out. I never felt like I was starving. I always had energy. There's a good variety. There's also a meal guide if you need recipes. But after while you can figure out for yourself to make your own creations. I didn't bother with the official protein bars and protien drink mix. You can certainly find something comparable at GNC or Vitamin Shoppe. I got results with Cliff bars and a shake mix that actually tastes really good, Fruitien Exotic Red Fruit.As far as workouts. They're tough, but not impossible. I thought they are reasonable. But it does take a big commitment of time. Especially tough for my schedule of a four 10-12 hour day work week. I managed. That is until I hurt myself. I don't blame the product at all. Each and every workout video has warm up stretches and cool downs. And they're always encouraging breaks if needed. Above all I believe strongly that safety is a primary concern on the videos and that I just over estimated my own abilities paired with my long days.It's about 6 months since I got hurt and I am almost ready to give it another try though I will be taking it easy on the yoga.
