review/summary: Does the job!review/text: This was what I needed and wanted - a simple, light jump rope. I anticipated having to struggle to shorten the rope (as per other reviews), but it really couldn't have been easier, so maybe the manufacturer has improved the product. Or maybe I lucked out. Either way, it was a great buy.
