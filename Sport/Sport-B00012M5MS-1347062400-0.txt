review/summary: inexpensive comfortable helmetreview/text: I'm surprised at how comfortable this helmet is. I recently started commuting to work on a bike and wanted an inexpensive helmet. It's very comfortable and seems very solid. I would recommend this helmet to others. Not much else to say - just a good comfortable way to protect your head.
