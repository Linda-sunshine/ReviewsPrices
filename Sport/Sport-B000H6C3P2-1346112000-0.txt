review/summary: Hogue qualityreview/text: This is your standard quality Hogue grip that they've been making forever. It fits your hand perfectly and is easy to install. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would like to see some stipling on the rear of this grip like the stock grip has. It would assist in the grip not twisting in your hand during magazine changes and manipulating the safety. Overall, it is great quality and a must-have.
