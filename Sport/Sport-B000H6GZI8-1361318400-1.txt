review/summary: Hogue grip for my LCPreview/text: I read many reviews before I decided to order this grip and was a little skeptical whether it would be a wise choice. It arrived in just a couple days and it slipped on easily on my Ruger LCP. I did not have to put it on upside down, or lube it up, or heat it in hot water like others have said, only three minutes of patience and a little careful trimming with a fresh exacto knife. I use a simple Ruger pocket holster for CCW that came with the gun and it slips in and out of my front pocket flawlessly. It gives me a much better controlled grip with much tighter target groups. I know it's not going to slip out of my large hand in an emergency. It was definitely a great purchase.
