review/summary: Good product!review/text: I was afraid that this workout would be way too much for me to do since I'm still recovering from a severe ankle break (after 18 months), and I'm really out of shape and a large girl. But I've been doing the program for about 2 weeks and I just modify everything I can't do. For instance, when he's doing the power jumps, I just do knee lifts as high as I can. When he does the jumping jacks, I do single jacks. I may not be anywhere near being able to do all the stuff on this DVD but at least I'm finally back to a regular routine. I definitely recommend it. Don't let it intimidate you! Let it be something to work towards. I look forward to the day when I can do some of those harder routines!
