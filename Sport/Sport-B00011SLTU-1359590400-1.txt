review/summary: A miniature version of its big brother!review/text: Needed a new key chain version of the larger Swiss army knife in my tool box. Had to give up the older one b/c it was confiscated by TSA while boarding a flight (yes, you can't take the smaller version aboard aircraft any more than the larger versions!). This mini version has all steel blades which can be repeatedly sharpened, working scissors for cutting small items as needed, nail file, tweezers and fiber toothpick, all functional and durable. Amazon offers a variety of color choices (various pricing), plus, the Amazon price was great, too. It does ship separately from other Amazon items. Other web sites offer a lower price, but S/H prices were too much for such a small item.
