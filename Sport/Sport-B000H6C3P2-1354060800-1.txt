review/summary: perfect fit for m&p15-22review/text: bought this grip after seeing a picture of it and never reading anything other than reviews of hogue grips. Best purchase I've made so far for my 15-22 and fits perfectly with no gaps. Oversized just enough to make it more comfortable than the stock grip. My brother in law liked it so much he bought two of them the following week. It's got just enough tack to keep your hands on the grip but still easily let go.
