review/summary: Good pillow for hiking and on the couchreview/text: This pillow gets daily use on the couch, as well as coming with me on outdoor adventures, which is what I bought it for. It's not the most comfortable I've used, not the lightest out there, and certainly not the most compressible, but if you like the feel of foam pillows over air bags and the simplicity of packing it, then its worth the money. I would definitely get the small--it's plenty big for any size head. Frankly don't see why they make larger ones unless you are looking to share a pillow with your wife.
