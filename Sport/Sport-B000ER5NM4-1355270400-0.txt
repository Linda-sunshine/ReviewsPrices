review/summary: Great for Yogareview/text: I'm 5'9" and these fit perfectly. Not too tight to be so revealing in my local la fitness, but not too loose to get in the way. They're very durable as well, I've scraped them against weight machines several time by accident but they held and didn't embarass me in my gym.
