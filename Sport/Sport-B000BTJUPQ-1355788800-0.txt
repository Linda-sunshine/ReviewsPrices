review/summary: Don't buy unless your child is atleast a young teen!review/text: I purchased this thinking my son would be able to use this considering this is a &#34;Junior&#34; bow. I would call it a &#34;teenager&#34; bow because there is no way a kid can use this. It's way too big and it's too hard to pull back. I shipped back. Huge disappointment! Purchased a different bow from another place that is smaller and less weight to pull back and is actually a kid bow. I would only recommend this if your child was a young teen or teenager. It would be great for that.
