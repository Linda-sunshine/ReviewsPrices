review/summary: Comes in handy!!review/text: This may sound funny but I am a 31 year old female who keeps a swiss army knife in my coach purse! I had come across a lot of situations where I need a tool so I decided to purchase this swiss army knife to keep on hand. You would be surprised how many times I have had to pull it out either to use the scissors when Im on the road or if I buy a new toy for my nephew to cut the package open or even to screw on a license plate or even use the nail file if I break a nail! This swiss army knife has anything you might need for random tool needs. It has come in very handy for me in many situations and I am very happy with it.
