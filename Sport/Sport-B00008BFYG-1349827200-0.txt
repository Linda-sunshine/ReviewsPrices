review/summary: My daughter loves it!review/text: This is a great little scooter. A perfect match for my daughter (4) who was absolutely excited to receive it. A bell, streamers, and pink (slightly darker pink than I believe is shown in the picture) to top it off! But aesthetics are just that, the streamers are useless and will begin to fall off at the first use. Not big deal though. That's my only gripe. The body/frame construction is good and it's definitely a plus that the Razor folds down for storage and travel.
