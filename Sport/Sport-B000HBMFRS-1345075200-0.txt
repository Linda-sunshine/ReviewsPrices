review/summary: Gets the job done!review/text: I bought this air mattress 4 months ago and have used it a handful of times since then. It's very comfortable, easily fits two people on it and seems sturdy and durable. It plugs into an outlet and self-inflates, which is super convenient. My only complaint is that it seems to lose a noticeable amount of air overnight, so it needs a little re-inflation come morning. Other than that, it's great!!
