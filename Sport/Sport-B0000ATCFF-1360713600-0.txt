review/summary: Great shoes for squating, lunges, lifting and boxing. Not so great for walking long distances or running.review/text: I bought these shoes a few years ago for walking around, but didn't wear them much because of how uncomfortable they are for long walks and/or running.However, I've found that these shoes make excellent and inexpensive shoes for weight lifting, especially during squats, as well as for heavy bag work when boxing. These shoes have very little cushioning other than the hard rubber soles, but this gives you an excellent and stable plant so that your can perform squats with much better traction and balance than in heavily cushioned running shoes.The material of the outsole, the bottom of the shoe, is such that it gives you traction when you need it, can be easily avoided when you don't. My feet are squarely planted for squats, lunges, and heavy lifting - they don't slide. They plant well, and I get good form.However, when I'm doing heavy bag work, they are extremely easy to pivot in and let me easily pivot my feet and hips to delivery quick and strong punches and round house kicks to heavy bags - a much better feeling than even going barefoot, unless I were to use a lot of talcum powder on my feet.
