review/summary: Lasted only 6 months...review/text: My Klean Kanteen bottle lasted only 6 months before becoming unusable, due to 2 serious problems:(1) The cap is next-to-impossible to clean. The cavity of the cap is not uniformly circular: it has 2 concave holes. Even though I tried to wash the cap dutifully, I couldn't get the few remaining spores of mildew that always burrows into porous plastic. As a result, water kept in the bottle for over 24 hours gets this unpleasant old smell, similar to week-old water in a plastic water bottle. I have to BOIL the cap regularly to prevent this.(2) The paint on the bottom of the bottle started peeling off, and now leaves pieces of paint everywhere. I have only set the bottle down on wood and plastic tables, so there wasn't any heavy wear or tear.Perhaps if I had chosen brushed steel colour and then purchased an additional cap, then this wouldn't have happened. But now I have a sub-par water bottle. (I used the magnet test to verify that this is a genuine Klean Kanteen.)
