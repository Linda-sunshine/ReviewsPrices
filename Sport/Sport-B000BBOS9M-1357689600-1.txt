review/summary: Durable, Compact, and COMFORTABLE!review/text: Now I know rating a pillow is a very personal thing. There are as many pillow choices as there are coffee choices at a Starbuck's; but when you find yourself camping life becomes simplified, and choices are limited to practical choices. That being the case, the Thermarest Compressible Pillow is a practical choice, and I think a great value for the money. I've been sleeping with it, solely, for a couple of weeks now. I'm a contractor overseas and go from outpost to outpost sleeping in &#34;transiet billeting.&#34; The pillow, when traveling, packs up very small (as advertised), it's super lightweight (another must), and it takes about 12 hours to reach it full 'puffiness!' That is the only problem I can see with it. If you are camping it will suffice 'cause campers typically go to one spot and camp, but if you are a hiker by day, and moving to a differnet bed down location each night, the pillow most likely wont expand fully before you have to pack it up again to move..That's the only reason I gave this pillow a 4 out of 5 starts, 'cause it won't work as well for those constantly on the move.The material is a little scratchy on the face, but again, if you're camping most of the time you collapse on your bed at night and egyptian cotton isn't as important as a pillow that compacts to the size of a small men's overnight shaving kit (I have the medium sized pillow).
