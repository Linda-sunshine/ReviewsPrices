review/summary: Returning to Biking, a little tip for you all out there.review/text: It has been roughly ten years since I last biked. Bought a cheapo bike to ease into it for getting to work, and of course, stuff starts breaking. I started buying up the essentials, and I decided on this. When I received the package this was in and tried to change the rear bike tire, there was a fair bit of frustration when I couldn't figure out how to even inflate the tube. Just take the black rubber bit that's inside the pump head and turn it around so the pointier end is outward. THEN you can fit it to the Schraeder valve that's probably more commonly seen in the bike inner tubes. Once I did that, oh, it worked beautifully. Inflated quickly and without ridiculous strain. For a first time, this worked well. Down the road, (pun intended), it remains to be seen.
