review/summary: Top Knotchreview/text: This chair is wonderful. Our children use it at the desk in their room and it's amazing how much they love it. They seem to be able to sit for long periods, whether they're reading, folding origami, or building Legos.Assembly was easy and the instructions were very clear.
