review/summary: Great workout videosreview/text: I love these videos... they are effective and all... but they are long! I don't have a problem with doing the videos when I'm off work but its difficult after I work a 12 hour shift (I'm a nurse) to do them. I actually tried to do it prior to going to work but it's just really difficult. I had to wake up at 4 am to do them because they are so long... then going to work and sometimes not getting off until 8pm makes for a really long day. That's only 5-6 hours of sleep after you account for work and workout. I don't know how some people managed to get this done in 90 days.I guess you can always improvise and do half the workout before and half the workout after... or even if you just did half the workout on the days you work... anything is better than nothing.The workout themselves are advanced in some videos. I find that I am capable of doing most of them and some things I have to improvise. I consider myself to be semi-athletic. I am overweight but not foreign to working out and I used to play sports in my younger years. I find that even after a week or two of doing the moves you can already see a difference in your performance and what you are capable of doing.Just in a week I've already seen a 4 pound drop...that's also following the diet provided.Overall, with the holidays that just passed and working 4-5 days (12-hour shifts) I find it impossible to keep up with... but perhaps I should work less to make this a priority for it to work.
