review/summary: Run large, elastic seems weakreview/text: I purchased two pairs of these shorts in size Large, I found them to be very loose on my waist and all my exercise shorts are size Large. The main thing is that they seem to run very large at the waist. I laid them next to a pair of Nike shorts (similar style, also size Large), these Champion shorts were almost 2 inches wider at the waist (unstretched). In addition, the elastic doesn't seem as strong as the Nikes (but it might be fine if I get a smaller size). I also don't like the "stretchy shoelace" style of drawstring, it was tough to cinch the shorts tight enough. Finally, as other reviews have noted, the shorts aren't lined and aren't very thick - this is good for ventilation, but might give a show under bright gym lights.
