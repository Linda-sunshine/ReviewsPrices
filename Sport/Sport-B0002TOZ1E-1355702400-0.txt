review/summary: Gold Toe not so &#34;Gold&#34; anymore...review/text: Been wearing Gold Toe socks for over ten years. A brand I once trusted is no more, and gone the way of the cheap manufacturing. These are comfortable, and they stay up, but like others have said, one or two washings, and they'll pit and look old and shabby. I'll still wear them, but only as long as they're covered in the gym. As a reference, I compared them to a pair I had for over ten years (back of the drawer, didn't wear them anymore because they had worn through the toe) and the old socks still looked great (except for the hole). I don't expect them to last more than a year or so, but they were cheap. I don't know if the more expensive ones were better because Gold Toe provides no description differentiating them. If you want a cheap sock with a short lifespan, get these, otherwise look elsewhere. Maybe the retail store socks are of better quality, but again, how are we to tell? Shame on you Gold Toe, what happened to your QC?
