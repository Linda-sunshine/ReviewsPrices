review/summary: Ok for the pricereview/text: Description says it will record minimum heart rate also. It does not. Manual also says only max and average. So the description should be corrected. In addition the heart rate is not steady. It jumps back and forth 4-6 beats. My experience with the Polar was much better in terms of getting a steady heart rate. I have another timex which cost twice as much which I bought a couple of years ago, it has a digital signal, and it has the same problem of having a jumpy display. Nothing like the good old Polar I guess. But for the price I cant complain.
