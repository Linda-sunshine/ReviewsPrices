review/summary: Decent, but cheaply madereview/text: I expected better from hatch. Stitching in cuff came apart after typical normal wear. The elastic cuff came apart from the glove material. Otherwise I really like the gloves. Maybe I got a defective pair, but certainly not the sturdiest gloves, and not cold-weather gloves.
