review/summary: doesn't workreview/text: Length:: 0:42 MinsI need to return this product. The cards do not shuffle. I have bought two or three of these exact shufflers in the past as gifts and they normally work great. The one I have does not feed the cards through hardly at all. Sounds as though some of the gears are stripped when you activate it.
