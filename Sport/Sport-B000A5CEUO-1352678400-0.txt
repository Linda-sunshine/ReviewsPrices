review/summary: Look for something better.review/text: Bought this in 2010. The transmitter fits well and is comfortable. The transmitter battery is easy to replace. The receiver, however, is a completely different matter. It is big, bulky, and when the battery dies, you need a jeweler to change it. Mine is in the trash as I write, and I'll be buying something else to replace it.
