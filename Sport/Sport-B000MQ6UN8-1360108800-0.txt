review/summary: if you're looking for real ray-bans... don't get them from herereview/text: I purchased the Arista Gold/Crystal Green Polarized, 58mm from Star Eyewear... fake. the price was slightly discounted but still north of $100. nowhere in the description did it say that the product was not authentic. everything from the case was fake. the glasses had "ray ban p" etched on them on the wrong side of the glasses. once the product is purchased it cannot be returned.this is my first bad experience purchasing from amazon but i'm immensely disappointed that they would allow a seller to provide such a misleading product description.
