review/summary: Useing them to function check and dry-fire a Glockreview/text: Per recommendation online, I bought these to dry fire a Glock 34 Gen 4. They do and fit exactly like they should.The only thing is when I was racking the side to function check, one somehow got jammed in the ejection port. This didn't damage the firearm but there was a burr in the snap-cap. So, I threw it away -- I didn't want to damage a $700 gun to salvage a single snap cap. I never had one get caught in the ejection port again and now I don't even rack the slide all the way; just enough to reset the trigger.I'll probably buy more soon just to have a few more to stretch out the magazines. (I don't keep live ammo in my home for safety).
