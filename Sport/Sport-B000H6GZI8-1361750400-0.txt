review/summary: What a difference!review/text: I was told about the Houge Jr. by a good friend of mine. He told me how much better he liked his Kahr CM9 with this grip on it and that i had to try one... boy, was he right! I have the Kahr CW40 and the difference in feel is amazing! This grip let a smaller carry gun like mine fill up even a large hand and make it feel like a full size! Would recommend to anyone, even if you dont have large hands!On a side note: If you are having trouble stretching this grip on to your pistol, put it in a pot of warm water on the stove for a few minutes. This will make is plyable enough to stretch fairly easily.
