review/summary: Good off duty holsterreview/text: I purchased this for my Sig p229 as an off duty holster. It is extremely popular with my co-workers, and that is why I purchased it without really trying it first.I was a little concerned about the negative reviews of the index finger lock release, but after several uses I just won't have that problem.I use the holster in a vertical/straight up position, and my finger still stays on the slide of the gun as it releases. It's nowhere near the trigger guard.If you have short fingers and if you have an alternate holster setup (Canted,etc.), I could see how you could curl your index finger and maybe get it wrapped into the trigger guard.The basics:Fits the Sig p229 perfectlyLocks tightly and snugly, with a loud audible snapIndex finger release lock is smooth to operateKeeps pistol close to your hip and rides a little high, allowing this to be concealed decently with a long shirt/jacket combo.Comes with an optional paddle holster (haven't used and probably won't use, but you never know, it could be useful)5/5 stars, exactly what I wanted for the right price
