review/summary: Great Product and at OK pricereview/text: I went on to buy about 10 more pair to make this my primary underwear.Pros:1. Good Snug fit and keeps everything where it should be.2. Supposed to be easy to clean if you're on the go and not washing them (haven't tested this yet)3. Good Length - Not too long or too short4. Comfortable fit - true to size5. Waist band is comfortable6. Wife said I look good in them :)Cons:1. Price is a bit expensive for underwear, but still cheaper than Under Armour or similar type boxer briefs.I would recommend you buy 1 pair and see how you like it before upgrading all of your boxer briefs.
