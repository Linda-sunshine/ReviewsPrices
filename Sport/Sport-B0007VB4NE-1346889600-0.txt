review/summary: Tinyreview/text: Despite the description that this is suitable for heights between 5'5" and 5'11", when I assembled it and fully inflated the ball, it was about 4 inches too low to use on a standard sized desk (I'm 5'8"). You'll need at least a 65" ball, maybe bigger, for this to be a usable desk chair.
