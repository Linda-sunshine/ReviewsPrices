review/summary: Very goodreview/text: I have used these gloves for paintball. I have had those gloves on during different weather conditions. The gloves are very comfortable; provide excellent grip even during rain. There is no problem opening a zipper on a pouch, use small tools, count money etc. You can do pretty much anything in those gloves.
