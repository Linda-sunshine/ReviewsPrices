review/summary: Great for reducing household noisereview/text: Our son who is 7 uses these earmuffs while he completes his schoolwork. It blocks out most of the household noises (even his little brother) so that he can concentrate. They are well made and very comfortable. They are adjustable and can fit everyone in the family from our 5 yr old up to my husband. Great deal, so glad we purchased this earmuff....we probably should have ordered two sets!
