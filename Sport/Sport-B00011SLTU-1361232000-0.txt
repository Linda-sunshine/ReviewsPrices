review/summary: Great little toolreview/text: Since I've lost three of these courtesy TSA now, I still enjoy having one. It's so small and integral to my usual pocket stuff I forget it has an actual knife on it which TSA does not approve of. I use the tweezers and tooth pick all the time and the little scissors are very useful. Good quality.
