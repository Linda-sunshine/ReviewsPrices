review/summary: Great Night Bicycle Safety Lightreview/text: This was my first rear facing night bicycle safety light so I can't make direct comparisons of awesomeness to other models.I can however say that I am pleasantly pleased with how well this light performs.The blinking function is very bright. Installation was very easy and is secure on the seat post. I didn't use the rubber inserts supplied with the light since the clamp wouldn't fit my seat post with them. (Specialized HardRock Sport)The light is at least 2x as bright as any other bicycle light I have seen on my college campus at night. I've ridden my bike at night for years without a rear safety light, and after a close call with an inattentive driver I felt the need to get a light so maybe it wouldn't happen again.Great light for the price.
