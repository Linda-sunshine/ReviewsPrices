review/summary: Better than any of the competition.review/text: I can't really say this is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but against any other of the lightweight packable competitors it easily takes the gold medal. It is a little heavy @ 12 oz. but makes up for it by allowing a better nights sleep.You ---NEED--- to let this thing fluff up after you receive it and keep it uncompressed when you aren't actively using it. When you set up your tent at camp just unroll it and leave it until you turn in for the night. It takes a while to uncompress but provides a nice alternative to cold, hard and possibly damp clothes as a pillow.
