review/summary: P90Xreview/text: I think the commercials really sum this program up. If you want to get into shape in 90 days, this program will kick your butt. I loved the plyometrics and ab CD's but has a very nice variety to do. The only downside to it is that because it is everyday, you really don't get a chance to do any other workout. Since I like to do other outdoor activities, that was hard for me to take. It is great if you don't want to think about your workout and follow along. If you stick to the plan and follow through, you will notice a difference!
