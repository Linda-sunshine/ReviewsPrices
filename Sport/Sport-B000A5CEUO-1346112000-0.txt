review/summary: Missing a key featurereview/text: I started using my husband's heart rate monitor while he was away on business and decided to buy my own when he wanted his back. I am returning this one without using it because I realized after I got it that it doesn't track and save any of your workout stats. I read in a review of the item I'm buying to replace this one that it is "useless" information, but I completely disagree. I am getting ready to start training for my 1st 5k and plan to record my data, but even when I wasn't I found it extremely useful to check out the data from my last workout (saved in the watch) before I got started. I have definitely had days where I thought I was working out much harder than the day before, only to check my data and realize I was actually way behind. It definitely helps motivate me to try to beat, or at least match, my past performances. I never even turned this one on and can't speak to it's quality or performance as advertised, but since they are the same price, I would definitely recommend getting one that at least gives you the option to track your performance, even if you don't think you'll use the information.
