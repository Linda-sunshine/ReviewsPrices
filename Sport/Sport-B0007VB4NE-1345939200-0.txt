review/summary: screws for retaining bar were the wrong type!review/text: Just ordered to address back issues on the basis of other recommendations. When I tried to assemble it, I discovered I could not screw the nuts onto the wire which helps keep the ball on the base. They were the wrong size/type, possibly metric instead of the needed 1/4"-20 flange nut. Don't force if you have similar problems. We got the right size at the hardware store, which was the quickest way to solve the problem.
