review/summary: very cool little devicereview/text: We purchased this for use on our BOB jogging stroller & it has been good thus far minus a few times when puttin it on the valve it doesn't seem to bite quite right & the pump won't engage with the valve. After some mashing & twisting and wiggling onto the valve more it seems to finally bite, but that one bit gives me reason to give it 4 stars, and it could even be the fault of the BOB stroller tire valve. I am amazed at how much and how quickly this little thing can pressurize a tire though. I have no doubt in my mind that I could keep pumping to the point to where the tire would completely explode. Very powerful.
