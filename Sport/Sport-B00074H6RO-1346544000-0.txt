review/summary: Harbinger 143review/text: I'm perfectly happy with these Harbinger 143 gloves. It's true they fit very snug but after a few weeks of workouts they were the perfect fit. You might want to order a size bigger than usual. I've been lifting weights for 33 years and these days I lift lighter weights so I don't know if these are good for power-lifting and so forth.
