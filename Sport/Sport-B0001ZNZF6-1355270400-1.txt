review/summary: This are great but not as durable as I would like.review/text: This look and feel great, but not as durable as I would like.-This can be used over and over again for a couple of days if needed and won't smell. These can be helpful for those long travel/excursions one might go on.- After about three months I started to notice that the fabric began to disintegrate in some parts, so while the fabric is not very durable, they are still very comfortable and useful.-One more thing, these are made in China.
