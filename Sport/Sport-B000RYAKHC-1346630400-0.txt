review/summary: nice and bright, 2 different mounting optionsreview/text: Length:: 0:08 MinsWhat can I really say, bright, nice, seems reliably. The only issue I had was no instructions to get the batteries in or placing the clip on. When you get it, it looks like you have to remove the belt clip that is already on it, but the fact of matter it don't move so the mounting clip goes over the belt clip. I would assume this be easy release so if you did wanted to go jogging or something in the dark. Just a idea.
