review/summary: Very nice light !!!review/text: Just install the Blinky light on the rear of my ElectraTownie bike. It was a snap to install on the seat post and the batteries were included. The first setting will turn the light on with a constant bright red, when you press the button again it blinks very fast! The Planet Bike Blinky light will make me feel a little safer if ride when it's getting dark out. You can't go wrong if you buy one from Amazon!
