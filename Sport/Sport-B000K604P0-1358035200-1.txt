review/summary: Great Productreview/text: This keeps beverages hot for a long time (hrs). Our only complaint is that the flip open top tends to break. This usually doesn't happen for many months. We cannot find any replacement screw on tops and need to purchase a new thermos. Despit the breakage, we love this product and have purchased several as gifts.
