review/summary: Best Socksreview/text: I am hard on socks. I used to be a Gold Toe business socks fans years ago. Then I tried these socks 1 1/2 years ago. I bought 12 of them. They have lasted until now. I am the kind of person who runs out into the gargare or down the sideawalk in my socks. I know I should put shoes on but I don't. I did try several other brands a few years ago but they didn't fit right or holes soon developed. As you know you can't mend holes. These socks fit right and cushion my feet. I wish I could say some thing bad about these socks but I can't. Also, I like all my socks black as they go with anything and makes washing them a much simpler task. I highly recommend these socks.
