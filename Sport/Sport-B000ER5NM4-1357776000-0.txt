review/summary: Comfortablereview/text: I love my yoga pants. I bought the pants for meditation, because my daughter always raves about how comfortable they are and she was right. I spent an hour and half meditating the first time I wore them and was surprised that my legs did not go to sleep. Perfect for just relaxing around the house in as well.
