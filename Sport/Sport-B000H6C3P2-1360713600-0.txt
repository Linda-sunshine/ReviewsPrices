review/summary: AMAZING!review/text: Hogue grips are superb in terms of ergonomics! These are priced very reasonably and provide an enhanced level of control over stock grips. I utilize this particular grip on both my AR-15 (CMMG Piston 16&#34; Bull) and my Mossberg 500 (Mesa Tactical LEO Adapter).Hogue Grips: I've also utilized Hogue products on 1911's, Revolvers (Taurus Tracker), Ruger P90, Ruger 10/22, AK47 & AK74 variants and love them! You can't go wrong with their products!
