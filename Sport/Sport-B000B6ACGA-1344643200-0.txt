review/summary: Warntee Policyreview/text: I PURCHASED A CASINO 6-DECK AUTOMATIC CARD SHUFFLER THROUGH AMAZON. WHEN I RECIVED THE ITEM IT HAD A BROKEN PART, i CONTACTED AMAZON AND TO MY SURPRISE THERE WAS NO TROUBLE AT ALL. i RECIVED A REPLACMENT WITHIN THREE DAYS. One game we play we use 22 decks of cards, we don't have to shuffle so often.
