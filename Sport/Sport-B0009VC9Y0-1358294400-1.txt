review/summary: Freaking Awesomereview/text: This is what's up. You don't carry a knife regularly but you are thinking about it. You want to get a knife for everyday use and a bit if protection. This is the knife that you want. This knife is slick, meaning that it feels good in the hand. You can't tell that you are carrying it because of it's nice design and pocket clip. The blade is sharp. The action is flawless. THE KNIFE IS MADE IN AMERICA. I am proud to own this knife. Just buy it.
