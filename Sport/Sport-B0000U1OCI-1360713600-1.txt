review/summary: works greatreview/text: I used this all day every day to monitor my steps. it was very accurate and I was able to look over past days. It also automatically resets every 24 hrs so you know what your steps for that day is. it even counted my steps when I walked in the Avon breast cancer walk (39.3 miles over 2 days). unfortunately, I was hit my a car walking across the street with this on and it was unable to withstand the impact :( I cannot really walk recreationaly now so I have not ordered another one. Once I get to the point I need a pedometer again I will order the same model.
