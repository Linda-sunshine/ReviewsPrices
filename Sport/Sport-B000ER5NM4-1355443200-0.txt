review/summary: comfortablereview/text: I took the advice of others and ordered one size up from what I expected. The pants are a little looser than I prefer and did not shrink any in the wash/dryer. These do have the cut and shape I like though. Next time I will order the large instead of XL. My typical size is a 10-12 depending on the pattern cut and brand. I have a 33 inch instead and found these a bit long - that could be an issue if you have shorter legs.
