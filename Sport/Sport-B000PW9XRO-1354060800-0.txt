review/summary: Good gloves, but not the best insulatedreview/text: Pros: These gloves have a great feel and it is easy to grip with them, shoot and work with them. They look good and I've gotten compliments on them. They work decent with touch devices I.E. my ipod touch. And also they are reasonably priced.Cons: Do not pick these up if you think that they will provide an adequate amount of insulation and keep your hands warm in the winter months. They work fine for a little while, but if you are outside for extended periods of time you'll definitely start to feel your hands freezing over. Particularly if you're handling anything metallic.
