review/summary: Nice Knifereview/text: I've bought a couple of these & use it as a pocket knife for work. Sharp blade with a quick & easy release that feels really comfortable in the hand. Great knife for opening packages, letters, cutting string, etc. I use it a lot outdoors as well & it has shown no signs of rust or malfunction. The blade is pretty thin & the tip of one did snap after I tried to pry something open with it but I chalked that up to improper use & purchased a second. Made in USA.
