review/summary: Not your standard air mattressreview/text: Just before a long planned visit to my son's house for the first time, I badly injured my back. I was not sure I could sleep on an air mattress on the floor. My worry was getting up off the floor in the morning and having enough support at night. This Air BED worked great. I slept ten days on it and was able to get out of bed every morning due to its height off the floor. We inflated and deflated it several times as instructed and it maintained very well throughout the ten day visit. Temperature change and high attitude did require a couple of 'fluff' jobs but with the built in pump this was not a hassle. The switch is in the center of the top and as long as its plugged in, I could have hit the switch without getting out of bed. Turn it on, wait a few, turn it off. I have discarded my air mattress. I now own an AirBED.
