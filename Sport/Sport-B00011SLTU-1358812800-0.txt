review/summary: best pocket toolreview/text: i tend to get a few of these a year since I misplace them due to their size. But they fit nicely in any pocket. I work in IT and they are great for opening boxes, trimming asset tags and even the flat-head screwdriver works in many phillips or flat-had screws in IT hardware.
