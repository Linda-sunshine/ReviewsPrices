review/summary: LOVE THEM!!!review/text: I have always wanted a pair of Ray-Ban Aviators. I have worn pairs of cheap aviators from clothing stores like American Eagle but all of them had issues. The frames were always made of cheap metal or plastic that was easily bent and the lenses never protected my eyes to the degree that I would have liked. I began my search for Ray-Ban Aviators by going to the Ray-Ban website; the cheapest sunglasses they had were $145 and I did not have that kind of money at the time. When I found my sunglasses on Amazon for $86 I ordered them right away. Amazon has a large selection of Ray-Ban Aviators and luckily had a style that was under $90 which was perfect for me. Using Amazon-Prime I had my sunglasses shipped to my house within two days. I wear them every chance I get and they effectively protect my eyes from the sun. The frames are made very well and are not easily bent, and the glasses come with a really nice leather case with the Ray-Ban logo to store your glasses in when you are not wearing them. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a pair of Ray-Ban Aviators to go straight to Amazon because you will get the same Ray-Ban quality for a lot less. And trust me, they are worth every cent!!P.S. I was a bit confused when I had to choose a size because I wasnt sure what to pick. I went with the standard size of 58mm and it fits my face perfectly. If aviator style glasses usually look very big on you, go a size down. If they typically look too small on you, go a size up. Over all though, the standard size of 58mm should fit anyone's face and look awesome!!
