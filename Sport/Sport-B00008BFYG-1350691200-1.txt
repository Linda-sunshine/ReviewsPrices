review/summary: A great gift that is durable and fun for lots of kidsreview/text: We have previously bought other Razor products and have been very satisfied. They all seem to cost a little more, but are very durable not to mention that not only our kids, but their friends enjoy riding them and playing with them as well. So, the durability is a key factor. Of course, we were happy with the purchase and shipping process as once again Amazon delivered BEFORE they said it would be delivered!
