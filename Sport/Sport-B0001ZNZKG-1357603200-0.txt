review/summary: Literally the best underwear i've ever hadreview/text: I'm slowly replacing all the underwear I own with these boxer briefs (in various colors). It seems ridiculous to say, but they really are the best. I wear them to work every day and they don't ride up, they don't stretch out of shape, and they keep everyhting in place without being constrictive. I also use them for running without a problem.
