review/summary: Serious good stuff...But too good to last long.review/text: This knife is AMAZING!!!! It is so darn cool that you get addicted to it in seconds!!The problem is that I flipped it open so much that I broke the spring or something. :(Also the clip is not so amazing. I lost my first on a hike. :( I had to send in my current one twice for a spring repair. The second time I had it repaired, I told myself. "Do not open this too much" and guess what happened...It's broken now..It's a 5 star knife if you love it enough not to have fun with it..... :\
