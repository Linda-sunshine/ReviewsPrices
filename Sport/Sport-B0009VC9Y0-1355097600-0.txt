review/summary: One of the best knives everreview/text: I love this knife, razor sharp out of the box, easy to sharpen, love every bit of the blade.. I also like to carry this knife with me everywhere, so i love the sleekness and the thinness of it, making it comfortable to carry. The assisted opening is a great extra, would recommend this to anyone
