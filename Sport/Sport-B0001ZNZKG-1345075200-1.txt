review/summary: Wow, incrediblereview/text: Another thing to stock my bug out bag! Had to get two. Expensive, yes. High quality, yes. Best pair of boxer briefs I've ever worn? Hell yes. I'm used to wearing Pima cotton Banana Republic boxer briefs, which are about $25 each. I thought those were the business until I wore ExOfficio. I'm sold for life until somehow these are topped. Price is well worth it. Expensive usually means quality, and it definitely does in this case. Worth every penny!
