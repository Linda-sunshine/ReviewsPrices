review/summary: P90X Dvd good program but one of the dvd's didn't work.review/text: This was a Christmas gift for my son. He is, overall, very happy with the P90X. The problem is that one of the Dvds didn't work. It is all pixilated and won't play. We tried to exchange for a new one but no exchange was available. We were refunded immediately and ordered from the Tony Horton website.
