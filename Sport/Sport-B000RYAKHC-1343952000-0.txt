review/summary: Very brightreview/text: I bought this because I thought it would be easy to mount to my new Planet Bike Eco rack. However, I ordered the one that does not come with the mounting bracket. Silly me. It is very bright and much larger than the current blinky light I have been using. It will be a nice addition to my bike when I'm out there at night.
