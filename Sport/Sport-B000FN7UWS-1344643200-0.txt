review/summary: Bottle sweats with cold drinks insidereview/text: I bought this for my daughter's school bag, hoping she will have cold water to drink during her after-school tennis class with the Klean Kanteen. We wanted to try the bottle today before school reopened. Added a few ice cubes, and filled the bottle with cold water to keep us refreshed for the rest of our afternoon outdoors. Soon after filling it, the bottle started sweating. Very disappointed with that issue. Otherwise, the sports lid is wonderful. Need to see how well the contents' temperature is held.I have another stainless steel water bottle that is made by Sub-Zero, and it has absolutely no sweating issues. It keeps the water nice and cold, and even in a hot car, the water in the Sub-Zero is held sweat-free and cold.Writing this part of the review later in the day, upon our return home.I had taken my Sub-Zero bottle and Klean Kanteen today. After about 8 hours, the Sub-Zero provided us with refrshing cold water during our ride home, while the water in the Klean Kanteen had come up to room temperature. Rapid heat exchange with excessive sweating. It's not double-walled, like I assumed - product description says it is single- walled. My fault for not paying attention to this property.The product as such is good, but will not solve our purpose well. In Texas climate, we prefer to drink cold/cool water from our stainless steel water bottles, and the double-walled Sub-Zero works best for us.
