review/summary: The bottle itself is fine, but the top is really its undoingreview/text: The CamelBak BetterBottle is a hard plastic, BPA-free reusable water bottle. It comes with a bite valve, where by biting down on a plastic nub, you can suck water up through the included straw. The assembly can be disassembled for cleaning.The plastic bottle is comparable to a Nalgene bottle in strength. It even has the same screw threads, so you can attach an MSR Miniworks water filter to it. Cleaning it is a cinch with any normal-sized dishwashing brush.But the problem for me, and it's a serious one as you might lose the precious fluid within the bottle, is the top. The bite valve leaks, and if you have it on the outside of a backpack, and the backpack gets turned upside down -- for example, you turn it over as you shove it into a car trunk -- then water will dribble out. If the bite valve is lost (which can happen during washing more easily than you'd think outdoors), then water flows out steadily and there's no way at all to keep the bottle sealed. Furthermore, the bite valve gets dirty if you are using the bottle outside much. Now, CamelBak does offer thebite valve coverandhydrolock topwhich seal the top, and the former keeps dirt off, but when one has already spent so much money on this piece of hard plastic, it's objectionable that the company would have you spend so much more on another piece of soft plastic.The bite valve having been lost, I need to replace my Better Bottle, but this time I am going with the competition.
