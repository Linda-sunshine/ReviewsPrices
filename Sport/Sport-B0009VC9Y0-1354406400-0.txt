review/summary: AMAZON IS FASCIST, WONT SELL TO NY RESIDENTS NOT IN NYC!!!review/text: I WILL NEVER BUY FROM AMAZON AGAIN. THIS KNIFE IS LEGAL TO HAVE AND CARRY IN NY. JUST NOT NYC. I DONT EVEN LIVE CLOSE TO THE CITY!!! THIS IS BLOCKING MY FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO BUY AND OWN A KNIFE WHICH IS LEGAL WHERE I RESIDE. I BOUGHT THIS FOR $10 MORE SOMEWHERE ELSE, THE KNIFE IS 5 STARS AND AWESOME, SHARP, FAST, LOOKS SLICK AND IS DURABLE. AMAZON, YOU NEED TO STOP THINKING WE LIVE IN CHINA.
