review/summary: Aerobic Steps Does Not Showreview/text: I bought 2 of these products. One works well but the other one is a lemon. Even after i run, the aerobic steps do not show. I thought maybe i wasnt running fast enough, so i wore both the pedometers and ran and one registered the aerobic steps and other did not. By the time i realized it it was out side the return window so now im stuck with a bad product. Very upset that after paying good money the product does not work.
