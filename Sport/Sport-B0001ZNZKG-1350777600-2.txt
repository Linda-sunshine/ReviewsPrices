review/summary: I wear these regularlyreview/text: These underwear are a great investment! Not only are they great for traveling or hiking but they are super comfortable and I wear them to work or to go out.The only concern anyone should have is the price. But look at this way: you can buy your 3 pack of Hanes at Kohl's for $18 and have those last you 4-6 months or you can spend the money on durable, comfortable underwear that will last.My best experience so far: I jumped in the Hudson River for a swim wearing these. After swimming I wrung them out and put my shorts back on leaving me ever so slightly damp as compared to my friend in cotton boxers who was soaked even after wringing them out.Scroll up and buy these.
