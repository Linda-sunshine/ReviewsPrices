review/summary: Apartment grillingreview/text: We gave this grill to our son who recently moved into an apt. My son had a Weber grill but wasn't allowed to use any grill on their deck that required charcoal. This was perfect. Nice size and did a good job grilling a pork tenderloin in zero degree weather on Christmas night. Easy to assemble and collapse.
