review/summary: Great for sightingreview/text: After my first tri, i realized i needed better google for sighting in the open water. I did a ton of research and ended up with the Kaiman google. I love it, very easy to see. Some reviews say they are close to your eye, and they are for me too. I noticed that when i blink, i feel my eye lashes touch the lense, but after a few minutes I forgot about it and it didn't bother me.
