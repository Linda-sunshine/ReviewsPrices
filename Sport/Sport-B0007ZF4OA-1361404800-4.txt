review/summary: Need warm hands? Get this!review/text: I recommend this product to anyone with cold hands. My hands are often cold, and this really does help. Sometimes if I keep on holding it with my hand, it doesn't seem that warm anymore. But it helps if I put it in my pocket, and when I take it out again, it's nice and toasty. It really does last about 10 hours. I love it. If you have cold hands, try this. Easy to use. When my eyes are tired, I've even tried to put it on my eyes for a few seconds, and it helps soothe my eyes.
