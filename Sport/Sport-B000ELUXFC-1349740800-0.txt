review/summary: Great Buyreview/text: I've only used this bike rack with one mountain bike and it performs perfectly. I've used it on two cars one with spoilerand one without works great on both. It's Very well built and looks comperable to racks cousting twice as much. I do recommend putting duct tape on the inside of clips to prevent paint scratching and tying several snug knots on straps after they aretightened to prevent them loosening on bumpy roads.
