review/summary: Not as expectedreview/text: I bought one pair of shades from defineyoureyes and was amazing, but this second buy was horrible. The product looks like a replica. One arm crooked, the RB logo in the glasses was done by hand on the glass. The sunglasses looks cool but the product doesnt looks like i expected.
