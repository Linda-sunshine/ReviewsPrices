review/summary: Sending back, screws don't fit threadreview/text: It seems like it should be a decent enough product, however, the screws do not always fit the thread. Trying to assemble this, I have about half an inch of the screw that will not thread into the mirror fixture (yes, I am using the correct screws in the correct location), leading the mirror to jostle freely and not stay in it's intended position. I am very, very annoyed.
