review/summary: nice fit but....review/text: they got a hole in it right away. :( i got these for my husband and he likes the pockets and the fit but i was annoyed they got a hole after the first wash. luckily it was right on the seam and i have a sewing machine so i could fix them easily but that just seems like poor craftmanship. but now that they are fixed he's been wearing them pretty regularly to the gym for a few months and he is satisfied with them.
