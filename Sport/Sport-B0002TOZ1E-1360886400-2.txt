review/summary: Still great after all these years!review/text: I bought 12 pair of these on December 2, 2008. Today is February 15, 2013. I wear a pair of these EVERY DAY. I still have all 12 pair. Although they have faded a little over the years, they are still structurally sound. They are comfortable, well-fitting socks that I think may last forever. If I ever buy more socks, it will be more of these!
