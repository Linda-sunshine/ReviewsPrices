review/summary: Great productreview/text: I bought these for my boyfriend. He usually goes through two 6 or 8 packages of socks a month. These have held up, keep their elastic, stay up, and aren't wearing thin. I will definitely be buying them again and they are worth the little bit extra money than standard socks at Wal-Mart or wherever!
