review/summary: Omron HR100c- Great Product and easy to use!review/text: My product came in a acceptable amount of time. The packaging was secure. right out of the box it was easy to use and set up. Once I was in the gym, I realized that the actual monitor that belts round the torso also sends a signal to the wireless receptive cardio equipment that I am working out on. It also has great accuracy as the numbers matched the machine. I am able to get a really good gauge on what workouts are effective for me.
