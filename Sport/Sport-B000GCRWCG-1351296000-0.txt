review/summary: great feral cat shelter insulatorreview/text: This product really keeps feral cat shelters warm, meaning I have less steps to take when making a shelter. This is a very shiny product, so if the shelter needs to be hidden, something must be placed on or around the shelter to hide it. Household scissors cut through the mylar easily, though can leave a jagged edge if the material is bunched together.
