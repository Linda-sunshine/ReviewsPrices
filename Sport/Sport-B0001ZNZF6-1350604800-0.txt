review/summary: Best Boxers, Travel or Leisurereview/text: I originally bought these boxers for travel, but quickly replaced all of my boxers with ExOfficio boxers and boxer briefs. There's no "ride" with these that I experienced with cotton/poly boxers. When you're sitting down this makes a long plane/train/car ride much nicer as you're not shifting around due to uncomfortable boxers.The downside (for some people) is they are cut for a thinner/athletic build. I've had some pairs going on 4 years now-- the elastic waist bands aren't as resilient as they once were (not surprising), but they're still wearable.Overall, the comfort-level is second to none. I've tried suggested alternatives (Under Armour), but nothing compares. If you're concerned about the cost, get one pair. You'll be on board.
