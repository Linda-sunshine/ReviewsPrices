review/summary: No better way to clean a barrelreview/text: I don't know how many cleaning rods I've broken over the years, but it takes less time to run the bore snake through the barrel a couple of times than it takes to run a single solvent patch with a rod. A product long past its due. I picked one up for all the common calibers and two for some. The best thing to happen to cleaning in the past century.
