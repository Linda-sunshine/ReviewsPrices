review/summary: Great knifereview/text: I have had one of these knives for at least the last 10 years. They are great. I also bought one for my dad and when the blade pivot bolt stripped out on him, Kershaw replaced it at no charge. Made in the USA and great customer service too!! That is hard to beat.
