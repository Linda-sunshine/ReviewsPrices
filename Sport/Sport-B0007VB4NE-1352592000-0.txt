review/summary: very happy with this productreview/text: I have been using this chair for a couple of weeks now and I'm pretty happy with it. It's been very good on my back, my posture has been much better while sitting for long periods. I really don't want to complain about this product, it's price is very good for how comfortable it is. The only thing that I did need to change had to do with the wheel locks. The manufacturer put them on all four wheels, which is needed if you are going to use this chair for exercise, but I would randomly step on one of the brakes when sitting down. A few days ago I cut the plastic brake tabs off of the wheels and haven't had a problem since. I will buy another one when this one wears out.
