review/summary: Love these yoga pants!review/text: These are the best yoga pants that I have ordered. I love Bella products, and have their yoga shorts as well as yoga pants. The fabric is on the thicker end for yoga pants and seems quite durable. (Will keep you warm in the winter) They are very comfortable and stretchy. I ordered them in black and brown and they look fabulous. I did not have an issue with the sizing, and ordered my normal size small which fits perfectly. Highly recommend!
