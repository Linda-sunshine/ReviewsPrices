review/summary: Great knifereview/text: Just picked one of these up and I'm incredibly happy with my purchase. As others have said, the knife comes razor sharp out of the box and keeps its edge very well. The tip is pin-sharp and does make me a little nervous that I'm going to snap it off, but makes very detailed work a breeze.Speedsafe system is awesome! The flipper deploys the blade quickly and easily. The thumbstuds, for me anyway, seem to be a little more difficult to apply enough pressure to overcome the closing force of the spring. This is a very minor problem as I usually use the flipper anyway.Great knife, especially for the price. Will be picking up a couple more in the future. One will probably be a random leek, love the tanto blade.
