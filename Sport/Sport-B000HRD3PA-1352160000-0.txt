review/summary: A Good Pair of Mesh Shortsreview/text: I'm giving this 4 stars for the simple fact that I've had a little difficulty with sizing - I normally prefer my gym shorts to be a size large, so initially ordered a few pairs of these in large and found that they slid off while jogging, even when cinched. Mind you, dropping down a size always feels good, but I was a little surprised. I then purchased a few pairs in medium (for the price, I figured having a bunch would be good, as I wear a different pair each day while working out). The medium, to my surprise, still slides down pretty easily too, even when cinched. Part of this is because of the material - they're a very smooth mesh - and I wear compression shorts underneath, so the combination of the 2 makes them easy to slide down. Not really a huge issue, but I've had other gym shorts that stayed in place a little better. That being said, I'm overall very happy with these - just be prepared to buy your true size rather than sizing up or you might have a similar issue.A big pro to these - they feel great! The material is very light and doesn't feel bulky while working out, unlike other mesh shorts I've owned over the years. The don't restrict range of motion at all and are very comfortable! Also, I like mine to be a bit longer which is what initially drew me to making a purchase - I stand about 5'11" tall and these fall to mid-knee for me, which is right where I want them. That is a huge selling point for me!One word of caution with the white - they're basically see-through. I love the look of them, but if you plan on wearing them to the gym or outside for a jog, be forewarned. You can see the tie string right through them and tell what color of underwear you're wearing without even needing backlighting... so depending on your choice of undergarments these can be a little shocking depending on when/where you wear them and what you wear them with.
