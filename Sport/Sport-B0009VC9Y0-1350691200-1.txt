review/summary: Favorite Pocket Knife Everreview/text: I have used many pocketknives over the years and have probably 5-10 different pocket knives stuck in drawers around the house. This pocketknife is by far my favorite. I carry it everywhere (that is, except to airports or courthouses) and use it a couple of times each day. Especially like how long the blade holds its edge and that you can open and close the knife with one hand. The blade locking mechanism works great too. Strongly recommend it to you if you want a great pocketknife!
