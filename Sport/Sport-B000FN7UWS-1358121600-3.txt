review/summary: Perfectreview/text: We've had some BPA-free plastic water bottles that we've used for a while, but they say that even those can have harmful chemicals. So we decided to go with stainless steel water bottles, and found the Klean Kanteens.What we like about these is that there's no coating on the inside like other metal water bottles might have. Stainless steel is used in cookware, and is a lot safer than plastics or aluminum.The Kanteen has been great. The cap is not difficult to remove, and we haven't seen any leaks. It does transfer temperature pretty easily, so if you're water is cold, the Kanteen will be cold as well.Just be careful not to drop it. It's a sturdy design, but it seems like a good hard fall would dent the base.
