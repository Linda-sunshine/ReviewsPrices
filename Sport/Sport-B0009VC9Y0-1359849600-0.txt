review/summary: Excellent quality productreview/text: Pros: very slim profile, perfect size for daily use, very good quality build and steelCons: catch/release side looks awkward with clip removed, blade lock is loose and looks like it's made of plastic and may break easilyThis is a nearly perfect knife to keep in your pocket for those times when you need to peel an apple or open an envelope. It is very slim, although the high-quality steel and almost no plastic components (the blade lock and inner spacer are made from black plastic, unfortunately, but I think that it's made this way so that the blade doesn't get damaged by them) make it somewhat on the heavy size. I also have no use for the clip, but with it removed (which takes a seriously tiny torx screwdriver) that side of the knife looks almost &#34;damaged&#34; from the number of screw-holes and the slit of the blade catch/release lever. I am also not a big fan of the knobs on the blade, which catch on my pocket lining and are superfluous unless you remove the assisted opening spring for some reason. Other than that, this is a great little knife, I don't think I have seen any other brands/models that are as slim and well-built.
