review/summary: The bestreview/text: Can't beat the emotional feel of holding this marvelous tool. The Swiss Champion Plus, which does NOT have the pliers is great. The full Swiss Champion has the pliers but costs about $35 more and it's not worth the addfitional costs.Comes in a nice box (just plain with formed lining) and complete instructions on all the features. You will never use them all but having them there will provide one that can help when needed.
