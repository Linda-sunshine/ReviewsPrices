review/summary: Small, light, cheap bike pumpreview/text: Because I still run sew-up tires on my bike, I hate to go far without a hand pump to use in the case of a slow leak. This one works fine although you won't be able to use it as your sole pump if you need 100 PSI or more. Velcro'd it under my saddle so it will be there when I need it.
