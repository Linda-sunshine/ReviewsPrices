review/summary: Impossible to clean!review/text: I purchased two of these and was so disappointed. Full bottles of ice melt in 2-3 hours compared to acrylic insulated tumblers which keep liquids cold for up to 8 hours. The plastic is very thin and flimsy. The designs are not even printed on the bottle. They are wrinkled up wrappers between the outer layers of the bottle. These are also impossible to clean. The inside container is full of dimples which makes it ridiculously difficult to remove any mold or residue that builds up in the dimples. Bottle brush and several other methods did not work to completely clean the bottle.
