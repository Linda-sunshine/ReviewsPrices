review/summary: Glad to have them in my B-O-Breview/text: Thankfully, I have never needed one of these blankets. But 'never' isn't always guaranteed in life and everyone should have a pack of these blankets. They are inexpensive and small and weight very little, yet it could save your life. Put a couple in your car, keep some at home, and if you have a Bug Out Bag, they are really a requirement.
