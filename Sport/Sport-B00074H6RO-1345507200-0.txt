review/summary: Great gloves for the gym!review/text: Harbinger gloves are great and i really like the new pro flex closure gloves. They fit well and are easy to wash by throwing into the washer and letting it air dry. It doesn't seem to damage the leather and or expand the material. A definite buy if you are looking for a workout glove.
