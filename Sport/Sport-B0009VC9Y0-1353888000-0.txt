review/summary: Near perfectionreview/text: I am reviewing a knife that exceeds expectations. The blade deploys quickly, stows securely, and will serve me well in Alaska. The function and design waste nothing, and the result is a beautiful tool.The knife just disappears into my pocket for daily carry, and the blade's super fine edge handles mundane tasks with class.I have a non-folding, plastic-grip McNett on my belt when fishing. This knife (the Onion Leek) would not be my first choice for slimy, slick situations, like fishing. But as an EDC knife, the Onion Leek shines.Packaging was basic, no fancy presentation box. Suits me.This is a great product, just consider its intended uses, and its stainless grip before buying it. I think you'll will be impressed with it's fine blade and compact elegance.
