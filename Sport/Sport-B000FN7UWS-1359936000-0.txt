review/summary: Sounds like a dolphin..review/text: Love the water bottle! My colleague loved it too, so she bought one for herself. HOWEVER, her sport cap doesn't squeak at all, while mine makes this annoying dolphin noise whenever I try to drink out of it. I've tried several different positions, but no matter how I do it, it still makes dolphin noises at me. Someone heard the noise and asked if it was marketed that way.. you know.. a dolphin water bottle. That might be a brilliant idea, but just not what I was expecting out of this water bottle.
