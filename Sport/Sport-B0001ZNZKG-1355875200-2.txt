review/summary: Best underwear everreview/text: These are the best underwear I've ever worn, hands down. At this point I own six pairs and don't wear any of my others. Feels like I'm wearing almost nothing. They are easy to wash and dry by hand, and seem totally clean even after being worn for days on end while traveling, hiking or cycling.
