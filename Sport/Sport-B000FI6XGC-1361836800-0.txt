review/summary: Compact, Simple, and it most importantly it WORKSreview/text: Fits nicely- Came with mount to connect under water bottle holder, and screws long enough to hold both.I keep my tires at 70 psi with very little effort, does take several strokes when the tires have flat after sitting for to long.Works well with the my Schrader valves.
