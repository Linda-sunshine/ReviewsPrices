review/summary: Quality Slippingreview/text: I like this watch. It is well worth $90.00. The first one I bought lasted three years. One day moisture formed on inside the crystal . . . it was never in more than 6 inches of water. Invicta wanted $65.00 to fix it, it ran another year before it started losing time. I bought another one to replace it. When it came I took it out of the box, pulled the stem out to set the time and the crown broke off, never got to wear it. Amazon was great, emailed me a call tag, sent it off, they sent me another one. It is working fine . . . we will see what happens. I still think it is the best value for the money. I hope they will improve their quality. Similar watches sell for more than $200.00
