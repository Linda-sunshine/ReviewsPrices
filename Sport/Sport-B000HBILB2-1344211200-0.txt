review/summary: Great Air Mattress!review/text: We bought this twin air mattress for my husband to use while on a trip to New Orleans for the Youth Gathering. It was supposed to be a back up due to knowing about the lack of available beds because so many people/youth go to the event (35,000). Well, he wound up having to use it for the entire 7 days and found that it was the most supportive, best quality twin air mattress he's ever used. This is from someone who has rods in his back and finds it difficult to even sleep on hotel beds due to problems with comfort so this is very high praise for an air mattress. We both highly recommend this product! It inflates and deflates quickly, stores nicely in the bag it comes with, and is made with durable materials. It's not often you find an air mattress that is comfortable enough to use repeatedly for a week!
