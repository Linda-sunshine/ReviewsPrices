review/summary: Simple and fantasticreview/text: I've been using a Nalgene as my main water bottle for the past year or so now. I've always had to carry it though because it was to large to fit into the water bottle holder on my backpack. I saw a klean kanteen that my coworker had one day, and I decided to get one and give it a try. Well, I'm very happy with mine. I like how the mouth is large enough to fit in ice cubes, yet the bottle itself is a very nice and standard size. I also like the fact that it is stainless steel, so I don't have to worry about any harmful chemical leeching into my water like I would with a plastic or aluminum water bottle. Lastly, I like the fact that I can take this camping and hiking with me and can use it to boil water for purification purposes if I would need to.
