review/summary: awesome!review/text: My son is a cub scout and has shot some of the cheap little bows and the camp outs. THis is a great starter bow set for a 10 year old .... he shoots it in the garage into my large stuffed archery target and continues to tell me that this is &#34; the best birthday present ever&#34;!!!! Get one!
