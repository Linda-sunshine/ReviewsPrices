review/summary: These socks are a no-brainerreview/text: Say, have you ever needed to put on, oh, I don't know... SOCKS underneath your sneakers? Oh yeah? Huh, what a coincidence - me too! Then looking further you needn't as these are the socks for you. How, pray tell, might I know this? Let me count the ways. Here are, basically, your options for buying men's crew socks:1) Go to T.J. Maxx or what not and buy a pair of (possibly designer name branded) socks at roughly half the price of the ones in question. This strategy will get you decent socks at a decent price, but the construction and materials simply won't be as good as that of the Gold Toes. The cotton content will be lower as will the longevity of the sock itself. The cheaper socks will get easily ravaged in the washing machine and they will develop holes after relatively few washes.2) Go to a high end sneaker store or what not and buy a pair of fancy socks at triple the price (and up) of the ones in question. This strategy will get you pretty good socks and, perhaps, ones that are better than these. The only problem with them is the price. Almost all socks, even really expensive ones, eventually need to be replaced, so why sink that level of money into them?3) Buy these excellent quality, very comfortable, very durable, no-frills-styled Gold Toe socks here at a very reasonable price.Life is full of challenging and complex decisions. This isn't one of them.
