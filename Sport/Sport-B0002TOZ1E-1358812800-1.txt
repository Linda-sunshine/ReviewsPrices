review/summary: No Surprises - Good Fit and Feelreview/text: I've been using the white version of the Golden Toe crew sock for years now and have been very please with the comfort and wear. This are basically the same sock except in black.I recently changed my shoe style from an brown ankle high boot to a lower profile black style. The lower profile allows the socks to show more often when seated or having your legs crossed. My work is dress casual so it's usually jeans for me and I am not a fan of the white sock showing look.I purchased two packs of these to allows a decent rotation and prevent over wearing. I suspect the color will fade over time and I'll have to downgrade these based on that versus them wearing and getting holes like the white version. How long that will take has yet to be determined, but for now I am very happy with the fit and comfort of these socks.I would not recommend these socks for dress shoes since they are a bit too thick for that. But for a boot or work shoe they are perfect.
