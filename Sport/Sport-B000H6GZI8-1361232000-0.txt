review/summary: Ripped while I tried putting it on my Ruger LC9review/text: Ripped while I tried putting it on my LC9. The rubber is too stiff anyway. I bought a Pachmayr for my Ruger LCP and really liked the material, feel and comfort. I'll look for something from Pachmayr for my LC9 as this Hogue grip doesn't look like it would help with recoil as much as a Pachmayr grip.
