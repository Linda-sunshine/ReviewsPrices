review/summary: Looks good...but...review/text: This watch is made to look like a Rolex and, actually, it does a very good job of that. The down side(s) are, the outside bezel tends to move on its own, the glass face is now starting to slightly discolor (approximately 7 months) and I'm careful not to take it under water. And lastly, it runs about 3 minutes fast per week. Considering the price for looks, still an ok buy.
