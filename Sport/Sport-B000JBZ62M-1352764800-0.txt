review/summary: disappointing, not the best for runningreview/text: I have used Champion shorts quite a bit over the years and these are not as good as the others I have had.There is no back pocket at all, I really miss the back pocket with zipper my other Champion shorts have. The over size front pockets wrap around the outer side of my thigh so when I run, whatever is in the pocket bounces, even with just one car key (one very light key) The key bounces around all over the place when I run... It is distracting and also feels like you may lose whatever is in there. Running with a key fob no way, I don't run in these when I drive that car.Also I am not sure on the size..In the description they claim to be longer, they are NOT longer but they are roomier/baggier, I suppose if you are thick in the thighs these might be worth a look but for me too baggy.So they may still be okay to lounge in or for light work outs , For me they are not so good for running.
