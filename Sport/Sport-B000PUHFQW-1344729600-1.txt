review/summary: nice matreview/text: I love this mat which seems a little longer and thicker than most. I have sensitive knees so the extra cushion was necessary, It does make the mat slightly heavier but I still sling it around my back and ride my bik with it. For me the extra cusion is worth the extra weight. Also, Very low smell even before it fully aired out out of the package. I love the fun color selection which is much better than many companies make.
