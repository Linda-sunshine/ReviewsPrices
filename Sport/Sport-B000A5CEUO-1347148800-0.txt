review/summary: UNBELIEVEABLEreview/text: Thought this would be a bad review didn't you when you saw the title. It is not. let me cut to the chase. For this price, it is well worth it. It reads your heart rate just fine, who cares about all the negative comments. Let me address one problem that I had. In the beginning I could not get the data to send to the watch, but when you add a bit a sweat to the mixture the chest belt picks up your heart rate just fine. I have seen reviews where it mentions to put water on the chest belt, I personally have not tried this yet but I assume that it works because of basic chemistry. Water/ Sweat conducts electricity. In this case it is your electrical impulses from your heart. works like a charm like I always say. Also when I was working out, I had my ipod on, there was no interference. Keep in mind though this was when i was working out by myself and not in a busy gym(it was a small gym but i was only one in it at the time of my workout) I will however at some point try to use it at a busy gym and see if it works with no interference. But if that's the only problem I get from this product that i bought for about $35, I will be extremely happy and proud about it. All in all, I would recommend this product to ANYONE who really wants to get serious about a workout.
