review/summary: Extremely useful, great quality.review/text: The Victorinox Champion Plus is the perfect swiss army knife for me. It's a great balance between amount of tools and size. Some people may say it's too large to carry in your pocket, but it fits in my pocket without bothering me at all. I work as an engineer at an automotive company, so there are always parts to disassemble, boxes to open, etc. and the Champion Plus has come in handy on hundreds of occasions. It's quite amazing how many different tools they cram into one little package like this. And with Victorinox, you're getting the best quality stuff. Sharp blades (I accidentally cut myself feeling the blade with my thumb - my own fault!), nice snap-back feel when closing the tools - you can tell this was built to last.I would recommend this to anyone. The most bang for your buck and the most versatile multi-tool out there, I always have my Champion Plus with me!
