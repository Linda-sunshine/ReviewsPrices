review/summary: Counts much better than I doreview/text: Can a pedometer really help you lose weight? And why one costs so much more than the other? I never thought much about pedometers I used to use, and I honestly wasn't using them often. However, as I started getting serious about keeping a record of how much I walk, I ran into a problem - my pedometer wasn't quite honest about the count. Apparently it liked resetting itself on the middle of the day erasing my walking records, not giving me the right amount of steps and would completely ignore my bicycle miles (GRRRR).Omron Go Smart pedometer made me curious, just because - "it costs more, but is it worth more?"First of all, you can keep this pedometer not only on your hip, but also in your pocket or even a bag. It uses 2D smart sensor and can actually sense when you are making a step. Why would you want to keep it in your pocket? There might be few reasons. For example, I lose things, I drop things, and I can never find my things. I would rather have this expensive pedometer in my pocket than on my waist band.What Else Can You Expect From Omron PedometerIt keeps track of steps, calories burnes, time, distance and resets at midnight (did I mention built-in clock?). All the information it collects, it stores and can upload onto PC (software included).Bicycling is a big part of life and cannot just ignore it, because my cheap pedometer said so. Well, guess what? You can use Omron Go Smart while working out or cycling to keep the count going. I was 100% sold at that point.If you choose to use your computer as a record keeper, you will be surprised to see how all the information comes together to provide you with a great deal of information .My only issue is that I am Mac kind of girl and have to borrow husband's PC to upload information from my pedometer.
