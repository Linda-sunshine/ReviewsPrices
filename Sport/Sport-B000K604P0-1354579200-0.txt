review/summary: Great Thermosreview/text: I love this thermos! (I'm actually drinking from it now.) I use it primarily for work. It keeps my coffee warm all day long. While it doesn't have the lid-cup thing going on, I still like it cause that's one less thing I have to keep track of. It also has a drinking spout for if you want something other than coffee :)
