review/summary: Sturdyreview/text: I purchased the Allen for the purpose of taking my bike on a 600 mile drive. The rack held up very nicely and the bike was in good shape upon arrival. I've used the rack around town since that time and it's continued to hold up. The Allen is a great bike rack for the price.
