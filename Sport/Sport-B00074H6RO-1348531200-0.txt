review/summary: Lower quality than previous versionsreview/text: I purchased the Harbinger 143 gloves at a local retailer recently, to replace a well-worn pair (which lasted some years). The new gloves have less than half the padding of the previous model and the leather is thinner. The fit and stitching seem good. I would not recommend these as they do not offer sufficient protection for your hands, mainly in terms of proper padding.
