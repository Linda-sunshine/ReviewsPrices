review/summary: Nice so farreview/text: Got this recently and have used it a few times; the size, weight, and design all work well and are sufficiently ergonomic. The rope aspect, which is a hard rubber type cord material, does show some abrasions where the center portion contacts the ground. Doesn't matter for now but i'm wondering if down the road it will keep scratching and eventually wear through. Don't know, but it's nice so far.
