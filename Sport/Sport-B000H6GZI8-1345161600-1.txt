review/summary: Pretty good for a Kel Tec P3ATreview/text: The fit for my kel Tec P3AT wasn't perfect. It required some trimming with scissors. In defense of the manufacturer, the P3AT wasn't listed on the box as a model that fit the handall Jr anyway. I cut it out where the magazine release is, and a bit on the top due to the extra small size of the Kel Tec. After trimming, it fits fine, but seems to slip around a bit. Not bad though. Overall, pretty good, that's why I gave it 4 stars...
