review/summary: Comfyreview/text: These sweats are nice. They are very comfortable and great for lounging around in. I have not had any of the pilling problems others speak of (yet...after about a half dozen washes they are still nice and soft). I wasn't sure if I should get the medium or large size due to my waste size, but I didn't have the same problem others due to them being way to small.
