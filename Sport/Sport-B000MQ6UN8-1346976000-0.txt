review/summary: Izzyreview/text: Waited forever to get these ray bans. Checked out all local *specialty* stores. These are great. Was confused at first about the fit ie. There are different mm sizes which means the size of the sun glasses. I am an adult female with an average size face and went with 58 mm. They fit and look perfect. I would recommend these sunglasses and am glad I did not pay *specialty* shop price.
