review/summary: Excellent for general noise reductionreview/text: As a graduate student and freelance editor, I do a LOT of work in my home office, but with 2 young children, there's a lot of noise (laughing, fighting, movies, computer games, singing, etc) in the house, making it hard to concentrate. Not being able to afford high-quality Bose noise-cancelling headphones, I bought these, figuring if they protect your ears at a gun range (which I know they do, from my experience in the Marine Corps), they should block out a 4- and 6-year-old. They certainly do! When I need quiet time to work, I put these on, and even if the kids are running around like crazy and watching a loud movie, 90% of the noise is deadened. Just enough gets through that I can hear if they hurt themselves. I can still hear conversation if people are talking in the room I am in, though that too is deadened a great deal, but I cannot hear conversation in the next room, even with the door to my office open.I've also worn these while firing a Colt 223 match rifle in the prone, kneeling, and standing positions outdoors, and it was great at reducing the noise for that as well.
