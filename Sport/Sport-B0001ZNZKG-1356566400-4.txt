review/summary: Fit well butreview/text: The fit is great but why would I want to wear chemical laced underwear on my body? I wore these for one day and what was held in place got inflamed and raw? So much for sensitive skin. I will not wear these again.I should have read the description closer. If you have sensitive skin don't buy these expensive underwear
