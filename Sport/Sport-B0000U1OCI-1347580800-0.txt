review/summary: Motivationalreview/text: I owned an Omron pedometer for eight years and it worked fine. My wife began using it last year and she had some issues with it registering when she wore some slacks.This new device has not had that issue, we purchased two, so we can set our walking gait and use them during our day. It motivates you when you see your mileage/calorie count and it makes you want to take another spin around the block after dinner. I enjoy the seven day history [Ourstory] feature as it helps me track my mileage. This model is an improvement over the older device it replaces and I'm very happy we decided to upgrade.
