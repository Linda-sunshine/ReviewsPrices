review/summary: customerreview/text: This watch did not work from the moment I received it. I have owned automatic watches before, so I know how they should work, and this one does not. The date could not be set except by winding through the hours. The hands would not continue to move even after I followed the specified activation and winding instructions. The watch looks good, and I would have kept it if it had worked. As to the water-proofness and long-term reliability, I guess I'll never know. So far, the Amazon return process seems good, and I am hopeful of receiving a full and prompt refund.
