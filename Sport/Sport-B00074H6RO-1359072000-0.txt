review/summary: Great versatile glovesreview/text: Love these gloves! Have used this model for several years. They fit great.The stiching ensures long life and the design is very stylish. After wearing my first pair I have subsequently bought several pairs at a time. I use one for driving in winter. I keep another pair in my gym bag for use there and one with my softball gear. It works well as a batting glove and great protection for my head first slide into the bag. Lastly I use it on my wavemaster and speedbag to throw punches. Again light weight and good protection. On size. I've heard others comment about going with manufactures size - for me that would be XL. They do fit snug and after a hard work out they've got some moisture in them (sweat) so they are hard to peel off. I went with the next size up (XXL) and it's worked out great! The bad: Increasing harder to find this model. I don't know why when there is an exceptional design it gets changed.
