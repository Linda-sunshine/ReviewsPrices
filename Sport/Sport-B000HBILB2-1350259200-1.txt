review/summary: slept like a baby!review/text: i purchased this air mattress to use on a camping trip because the coleman cots i took last time were hard and uncomfortable - the air mattress inflated very quickly and fit into our tent very nicely - over the weekend they stayed inflated even with people sitting on them (and some of the people were big people) - it was long enough and wide enough for a comfortable sleepthe deflation process was just as easy - flip the switch and minutes later the mattresses are flat - BUT i was not able to get them back into the package - lol - the joke was - air mattress is like having a baby - once it's out it can't go back in againso far so good with these mattresses - just want to see how long i can go hole free
