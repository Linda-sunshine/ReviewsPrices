review/summary: Invicta 8928OBreview/text: This is just one of over 20 Invicta watches that I have bought this year, and the 2nd of this model, which I bought as a gift. I have worn this watch almost daily for about 9 months for a number of reasons. First would be the watch looks and feels great. I would expect to spend a $1000.00 or more at a jewelry store and it looks and feels far better than the $500.00 Sekio that I bought that I don't even wear now. Two other reasons are to keep the watch running, and give a good test drive on looks and fuction. It has held up very well so far, and has impressed me on many levels. This watch is perfect in many ways for everyday use or dress. I also have the 9938C and 9937 which have the swiss movement. For those on a budget this watch will give you everything you need and more. If your pocket is a bit deeper go for the 9938c only because you get a heavier clasp, bracelet and the swiss movement. Now the newest version of the 8928OB has the 24 jewel Japanese movement which can be wound and hacked (the second hand stops while you set the time) This will be enough to please most buyers. Your money will be well spent on this or any Invicta that you decide on.
