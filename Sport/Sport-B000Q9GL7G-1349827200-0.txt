review/summary: Best on the market!review/text: I purchased this product after having many cheaper versions and leather-type holsters. This holster is sturdy and offers many different options for carry. Whether you are open carrying or concealed, this holster is light and comfortable to wear all day. The retention system is second to none and allows piece of mind when moving around that your weapon will not come out.Purchased for a Beretta PX4 Storm
