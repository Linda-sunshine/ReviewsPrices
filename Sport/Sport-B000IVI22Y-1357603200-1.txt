review/summary: No spills!review/text: I already own one of these water bottles and love it. It is nearly impossible to cause a spill unless you are intentionally trying it (even then not easy.) This one has a smaller straw than my first one and I seem to like that better. It allows a better flow. The color also is very nice. Great quality water bottle!
