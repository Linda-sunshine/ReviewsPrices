review/summary: Good value, but having an issuereview/text: I am not sure if the size I bought is too small. Overall it fits great, but the part where I bend my fingers hurts when I hang from a pull-up bar or any other similar grip. Anyone else having this issue? Anyone have a fix for this? For $13 I feel like I got more than what paid for and they seem like they will last a long time. I work out 4-7 days a week (5avg), if that is relevant.
