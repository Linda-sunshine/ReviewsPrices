review/summary: Saved me from losing my Fitbit Tracker! Must for athletes!review/text: I bought this because its reviews stated that it could save your pedometers, etc. It does live up to that! I have a Fibit Tracker that is worth $100 & if it were not for this gadget, I would have lost it several times. This is a must have item for anyone who clips items to their waistband.
