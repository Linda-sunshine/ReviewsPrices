review/summary: An excellent watch, especially for the pricereview/text: I love this watch. For the money, it's hard to find a better automatic watch. It keeps excellent time and is easy to read. I love that you can wind it by either your movement or by winding it. Apparently, most watches are either one or the other. It's nice to be able to wind this watch on a day that I'm not wearing it.
