review/summary: Not as advertisedreview/text: I am disappointed with this product on at least two fronts. First it will not allow you to have two sessions in the same day with out completely resetting the device, (a lengthy procedure requiring that you reset the time, your weight and your stride, for each session). second it failed after just a few months of very careful care and use, completely losing an hours worth of exercise, then failing to allow a reset thus becoming useless. Another thing I am not sure any can handle is that accuracy depends on the accuracy of your stride input with only one type of exercise, (ie if you input your pace walking, the run part of the way all bets are off). I learned to average well enough on this last thing but you need to be able to estimate well and if you excercise twice in one day the reset becomes... you get the idea.
