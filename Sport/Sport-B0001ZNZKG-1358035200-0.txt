review/summary: Best Boxer Brief without doubt!review/text: Decided to take a chance on these while they were the Lightning deal, so picked up 3 pairs, and can not believe how awesome they are, and yes, i never thought i would say a pair of skivvies were AWESOME!They have exceeded expectations, i am constantly double checking to make sure i have them on they are so comfortable. They snuggle my huevitos and keep everything in place, they don't ride up (number one problem with previous brands).They don't maintain a smell after sweating, they dry really fast to prevent the always uncomfortable swamp nuts. Excited to use them for hiking and camping this summer.I can say enough good things about these! BUY THEM!
