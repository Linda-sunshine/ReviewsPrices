review/summary: Kershaw Speedsafe, SS beauty, great price, but still decided to returnreview/text: I love Kershaw and I loved how this Leek SS looked but I ended it up returning it. The framelock was hard to unlock especially with one hand. Maybe it was supposed to be this way to make sure the blade was locked solid when open. Someone metioned that this allows them to be made thinner that the linerlock variety. I prefer the other cheaper Kershaws with linerlocks which are easier to handle
