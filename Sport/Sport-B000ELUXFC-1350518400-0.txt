review/summary: Bike survived the 500mile tripreview/text: It did what I needed it to do...Keep my bike safe for a 500mile drive. I kept it on the outside bike holder and had no problems with it striking the car. It was relatively easy to put together. My only complaint is the bottom strap made a small black mark on the bottom of the my bumper.
