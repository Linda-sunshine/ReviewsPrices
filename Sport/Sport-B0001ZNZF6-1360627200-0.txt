review/summary: ExOfficio Men's Give-N-Go Boxerreview/text: My husband wanted a pair of breathable lightweight boxers to sleep in, and for hiking/camping. After shopping around, and reading tons of reviews, I got him two pair of these.He really likes them; says they are very comfortable. They are somewhat expensive, but worth it. I hope.If I can find them on sale, I will probably get a few more.When buying, I noticed they made them for women also. I may get myself a pair to sleep in. :)
