review/summary: A Step Abovereview/text: It's been a long time since I've tried a diff. brand of socks. I'm used to Wilson, Nike, and Hanes and I must say as a brand new sock, the quality of the cotton feels great, the elastic is tight but doesn't cut off my circulation and the socks don't fall down my leg. Can't say how they will hold up to washing yet but I love the softness of them and first thing I noticed was the lack of a seam in the toe box. I can honestly say I did not and will not miss the two little nubs in the front corners rubbing against my toes.
