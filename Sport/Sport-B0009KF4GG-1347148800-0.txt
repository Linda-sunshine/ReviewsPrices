review/summary: great knife without the pliersreview/text: I had an original leatherman from thirty years ago and a swiss champ. Between these two things I could meet any challenge. Unfortunately someone stole them both from my apartment. I now have both back and have to say I am whole again. I never really liked the pliers on the champ. They are wimpy for real use compared to the leatherman. I love what the champ has though. I can go from adjusting my eyeglass screws to writing a note to uncorking a bottle of wine with ease. I can even remove a sliver from my finger with the straight pin. It is an urban survival tool for me. I love it.
