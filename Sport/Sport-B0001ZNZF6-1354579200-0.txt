review/summary: Singing Hallelujah In these Boxersreview/text: First what I like:- Best boxers I've ever worn. Highest quality and durable. Like the name implies, ExOfficio does not mess around. Once tried Calvin Klein, sweated insanely, felt like I was wearing a thermo-sweat suit. With ExOfficio you can breath like you are totally bare on a mountain top. It feels so nice.- If on long vacations in ruggard areas of the world, you can buy two pairs and rotate daily. They dry real quick.Cons:- this is probably typical but after 3 years on a three day rotation, the elastic bands have began to wear out to the point that you could fit 2 people in the boxers. This is not good. But that's after 3 years of use. And accidentally pulverizing them in the wash machine and dryer a few times. I wish they would stay new forever.
