review/summary: Obtrusively Bigger than HJ 112review/text: The Amazon page gives inaccurate Production Dimension description for this item. Compared to Omron HJ-112 which is 0.6 x 2.1 x 1.4 inches, the HJ-720 is too big (0.6 X 2.7/8 X 1.7/8 - my own measurement,without the clip) to wear on your body 'unobtrusively'. Coupled with the bad top-heavy (clip too low on the unit) design, it is huge and heavy. When I wear it, the top always tilt outward since I only clip it to the pants waist or pocket (I do not wear belt).Returning it without even putting in the battery and will get HJ112(lighter, smaller and less obtrusive) or maybe the HJ151 instead
