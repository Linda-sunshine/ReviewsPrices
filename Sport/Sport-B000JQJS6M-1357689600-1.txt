review/summary: Cheap Rolexreview/text: I like it.Been wearing it every day, so it has not stopped yet. It lost about 50 seconds the first week, and over a minute the second week. I don't think that is so bad considereing the price. I had an expensive automatic Bulova in the late 1960s, and it didn't do that well. Since then I've only had quartz watches that died after a few years.I love the appearance of it. Great looking watch. The bezel works well. I like the Cyclops Eye. The bezel rim and braclet have more of a copper than gold appearance, but you can spend $12,000 and get the Rolex with real gold if that is important to you.If you are a fanatic about the exact correct time, then maybe you should get the quartz version. I can live with adjusting the time for the minute it is off each week. Order a cheap pin removal tool to adjust the band.All in all, I'd say this is a keeper. If this style watch was good enough for James Bond, then it's good enough for me. Considereing what you get for the money, I'd rate it Five Stars. I only rated it Four because of the minute it loses each week.... but it really is a Five.I understand Invicta has a lously repair service. If the watch goes bad after the warranty, I'll just get a new one. I didn't buy the extended warranty. We are not talking about an expensive watch here.
