review/summary: Great Bottlereview/text: I have been using plastic water bottle for a long time. Then I seen a documentary about how plastics leach estrogen (or estrogen producing something or other) into the water. Now I don't know if this is true. It could be a complete fabrication but I would rather be safe than sorry. So I looked around and found this bottle and bought it. I like it a lot. It's plain and simple. Nothing fancy.If you have trouble with the metallic taste: soak it overnight in vinegar water.Also, there is a little bit of rust around the screwy part where the lid goes. I was worried so I did some googling and found out rust is pretty harmless. A lot of people worry about tetanus but that is actually from a bacteria not from rust.
