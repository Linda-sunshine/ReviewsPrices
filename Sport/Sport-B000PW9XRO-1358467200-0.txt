review/summary: Tactical describes these gloves-they are like having insulated, waterproof fingersreview/text: We bought these for our son-in-law who is in the Oregon guard-he wore them on a weekend maneuver in the snow and very chilly air. He said he could do nearly anything he needed; the length of the fingers was perfect and the gloves gave him very good gripping capability.
