review/summary: Great product.review/text: This bottle is great and keeps the water cold. I had was I went with the 24oz bottle instead of the 20oz because the price was only 20 cents more. The problem with my choice is on my bike the 24oz has to be squeezed into place because it's slightly bigger and the position of the screws on my bike are in the middle rather than slightly back, so I should have went with the smaller one. I didn't think the extra inch would matter but it did. So if in doubt about which size to get, go with the smaller 20oz bottle.
