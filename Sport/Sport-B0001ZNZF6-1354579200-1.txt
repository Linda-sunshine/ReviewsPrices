review/summary: A great replacementreview/text: For the last 5 years I've worn Under Armour Men's HeatGear 4" Boxer Short Bottoms, which are now discontinued (unless you want the realtree camo version, or wear small, which is all you can find).Eventually most of the UA I had have worn out; the bands lose elasticity and fit like they are 3 sizes too large.I tried two styles of the UA boxers that are "tight" (red band and blue band) and just found them wildly uncomfortable.I saw these boxers listed on the black Friday Amazon deals and ordered as set and WOW, not only are they more comfortable than the UAs with the more breathable material, but the fly on the front isn't a button but a overlapped flap which is a far superior design. I'm going to order 5 more pairs and finally throw out my UA's with the bad waistbands. Shame on UA for not replacing their line of loose fitting boxers, but good for me because it forced me to look around and find a far superior product.
