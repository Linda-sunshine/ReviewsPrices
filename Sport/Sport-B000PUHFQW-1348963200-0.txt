review/summary: It works.review/text: This is the first product review I've done so I'm not sure what to say... But I like my Yoga Mat. Yes, as others have mentioned it does have that weird chemical smell. I usually don't like unpleasant smells such as that and figured if it was really that strong I'd probably toss the thing and buy another, but it really wasn't that bad. I semi-washed it and the smell slightly dissipated. I've had it for a while now and it hardly even smells (if it does I can't really notice but I'm sure it's gone). I'm able to stay on the mat without slipping but I use body powder anyways to remove any moisture from my hands and feet. The thickness I would say is just right. It's comfortable. A lot better than using the floor. All and all, a good first mat. Nice and affordable. And I do love the color blue.
