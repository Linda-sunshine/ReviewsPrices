review/summary: Its a Yoga Matreview/text: So I've been practicing bikram for about a year now, and my first mat I went to target and purchased the cheapest mat I could find for $20. The mat did its job, was decently slipper, but I had my towel set up, so it never caused any problems. I just lost my last mat, so decided to buy something on amazon to replace it.When I purchased this mat, I noticed there were a LOT of reviews saying this mat was very slippery. I figured it couldn't be worse than my older mat, so I gave it a go. Let me tell you, this mat is VERY slippery! I couldn't believe how much my feet would slide on this thing when they went off my towel, it almost seemed slightly dangerous.But with that said, I have my towel, I'm just the average yoga goer, so I don't need anything crazy.This mat does its job, and for $20 I can't complain. My next purchase however will probably be a more expensive mat, to see what all the rave is about with these "non sticky" mats.
