review/summary: Nice Looking....Won't lastreview/text: This watch is very beautiful out of the box. It is an eye catcher everywhere I go. The automatic movement is very smooth and accurate. Must wear every other day or the watch will stop.I would give this watch 4 or 5 stars, but after owning this watch for 2 months, the gold plated center links began to rub off, showing the underlying steel color links. I am not rough with my watches at all. I wear them to work and back home. The gold plate coloring rubbing and coming off of the watch makes this fantastic looking watch look like a cheap cereal box watch, because now anyone who looks at it can see the gold plating discolorations.Again, great looking out of the box. But if you plan on wearing the watch, you will see dramatic changes within a short time, for the worse.I do not even want to wear it anymore.
