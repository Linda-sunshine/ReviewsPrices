review/summary: Planet Bike lights are very goodreview/text: I have a rack on my 29er Mountain Bike and have been vexed in the past with getting a good light to remain mounted on the rear light bracket. Either they fit too loosely or too tightly (which eventually snaps the plastic). As a result, I've lost a few lights along the way.In the case of this light, I was able to use one of the mounts to mount securely to the rack mount by removing the organic bracket and using the one with this light instead. I did have to do a little minor modification to the light bracket, but it was minor and there are others if I want to mount it elsewhere. The light is secure, does not impede the bag, has good brightness and is of solid quality.This light met all of the objectives of what I was trying to avoid from previous lights. A great buy for someone needing to mount to a rack. I did not try the other mounts.
