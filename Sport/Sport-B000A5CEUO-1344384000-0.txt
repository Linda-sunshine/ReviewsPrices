review/summary: Don't wear transmitter upside down?review/text: I have zero experience with heart rate monitors because this is my first. I'm super excited to finally be using one. Previously, I thought a heart rate monitor was simply a watch apparatus you wear on the wrist. I didn't realize that's just the receiver. Despite that, I enjoy using this when working out. Today I accidentally put the transmitter on upside down and could not get a reading. I don't know if this was a fluke, but it began reading correctly when I turned it right-side up. Also, I've not had to wet the transmitter prior to usage. It could simply be my body chemistry doesn't require this added step.The adjustable strap for the receiver makes it easy to size and it's not as uncomfortable as I imagined it might be. Pressing the large silver button below the display on the wristband activates the backlight for low light conditions.
