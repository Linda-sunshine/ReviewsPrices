review/summary: Great pedometer...review/text: I am very pleasment with this pedometer, measure exactly the distance that i walk and also with the software i can have a tracking of my performance in a month, its great, also i know the kcal that i burn with the walking, so i can control my weight. If i know the steps that i walk it's function like motivation for each day walk one step more.
