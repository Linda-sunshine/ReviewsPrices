review/summary: Hogue rubber grip Handall jr.review/text: Excellent product, excellent customer service. I received my first grip and tried to install it but it tore on me. (My fault) Contacted customer service and they immediately shipped a new grip. Put it on yesterday and fits perfect. I installed on a 709 slim. Will be ordering another in a different size for my other pistols. Absolutely recommend this product for your smaller pistol.
