review/summary: Great Little Bow and Arrow kitreview/text: My 7 year old son loves it, but isn't quite strong enough to pull back the bow all the way. Nevertheless, he is learning safety and how to care for his tools early. Good quality, and packs enough power, to poke a hole through a 1/2&#34; piece of plywood, so be careful with this!
