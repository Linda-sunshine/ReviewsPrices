review/summary: Great productreview/text: I love the Omron HJ-112. I checked it against my treadmill and it was exact. Some pedometers are not real accurate but this one is. I also liked the little snapon that holds it on your pants; therefore you will never lose it if the clip came off. I would definitely buy another one if this one ever fails to perform.
