review/summary: Maybe it's just mereview/text: My back still gets tired and achy, but I often don't keep both feet on the floor and might not have the height adjusted just right. Or I'm still slouching. I like the suggested exercises done with the chair & ball, that can be used for taking breaks from sitting. My seat bones aren't as sore as they were from sitting in an office chair.
