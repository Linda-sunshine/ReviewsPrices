review/summary: Fit greatreview/text: Installed on my Kahr CW9. Took a little manipulating and heat from a blow dryer to get it on. (But now that it's on, it's not going anywhere.) Fits my hand nicely, especially with the finger grip "bump" in the front. Helps with locating my hand on the small area of my grip. Was hoping it would be thicker on the sides to compensate for my long fingers / small grip area of the gun, but this is definitely the quickest and cheapest way to make your concealable weapon more comfortable. No trimming was necessary.
