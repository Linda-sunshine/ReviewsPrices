review/summary: Perfect experience!review/text: I felt that my karma would be bad if I didn't take a moment to describe my experience in dealing with GrandSlamNY. I purchased a pair of Converse All Star's for my girlfriend for Christmas. I got the size she asked for (even took into account the additional information supplied on the site about how the size of this particular shoe runs about a size big. When they arrived they were too big! I THEN checked the return policy and saw that the period had expired (I partied hard during the holidays and the shoes were returned close to 4 weeks after purchase. I sent an email to the owner of the store and he told me to send them back for exchange. I did so and received the new pair 4 days after mailing the incorrect pair back to him. I will do business with them again because, on top of everything, for the size I needed, GrandSlam had the lowest price. Good lookin, David.
