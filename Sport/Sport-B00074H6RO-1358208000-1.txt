review/summary: Nice gloves, but watch the sizing!review/text: These are great minimalist weight lifting gloves for those who don't need a heavy wrist wrap. The velcro strap stops at the base of the wrist and gives practically no support to the wrist. There is a moderate amount of padding on the palms and fingers in just the right places. The fingers on these gloves are designed to come up to the middle knuckle on your hand. This is enough protection for the parts of your hand which are the most highly stressed by weight lifting - notably on the inside of your hand at the base of the fingers. The gloves seem very durable and are very grippy. All good things.So basically I give this glove 5 stars for design and construction.However, I also deduct a star for the absolutely wonky sizing. I'm a 5'8" male with moderately sized hands. I bought a large and they are too small. I just don't understand how a male of below average height and average proportions can require an extra large sized glove. I thought maybe the glove just needed breaking in, but I can confirm that it does not. After two workouts the glove is still too small and doesn't appear to want to stretch out. I've been working out for 17 years and this is the first time I've required an extra large size workout glove. I guess next time I'll know better.My hand is 7-1/2" from the tip of my middle finger to the base of my hand. I would say that the maximum size for a comfortable "large" fit would be 7". Anything over 7" would require an extra large. Be sure to measure your hand before you order so you don't make the same mistake I did.
