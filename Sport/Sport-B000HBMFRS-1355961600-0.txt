review/summary: Great while it lasted...(3 years, not so bad)review/text: I liked this air mattress a lot. It was comfortable but did take a little getting used to regarding the way the chambers run from top to bottom...meaning if you like a firm mattress you kind of notice the dips and raises between each chamber. But I did get used to it and then really loved this air mattress. We used it a few times a year for about a week at a time for almost three years. Just 11 days shy of 3 years (thanks for keeping track, Amazon), it kicked the bucket. I still crack up thinking about it. My husband and I were sleeping on it and at about 3am we were awakened by a loud strange tearing sound and then we both suddenly droped about 4 inches. Startled out of sleep and confused we had no idea what was going on (I'm crying laughing trying to write this!). We tried to go back to sleep but my husband said he suddenly felt like he was sleeping on a 45 degree wedge. He had to move to the couch. At about 7am I was still sleeping in the bed and awoken yet again by the same sound and a huge bulge pushed up right under me! I got up and removed sheets/blankets and could finally see what happened...the chambers separated inside creating the bulges. We definitely can't sleep on it like this...since it's unusable we might try and get the rest of the chambers to break and see what it's like then, lol! Funny story, but maybe you had to be there... All in all, we were very happy with this bed since it was very portable, came in a strong carrying bag, came with a patch kit and had the motor in it which plugged into an outlet for power (we previously had one that had to charge and it was always dead when we needed it). I think we got good use out of it considering the price.
