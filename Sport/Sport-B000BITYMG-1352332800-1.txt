review/summary: Excellent valuereview/text: When I first ordered to replace the broken plastic on my Omron Pedometer, I thought I didn't like the fact that is was so long, and also that the clip is bright and stands out in comparison to my old black plastic one. But, the length actually works well for reading the display and I just tuck the excess cord in my pocket. The metal clip is much more secure than the plastic one this replaced. So overall I really like it and the price was crazy cheap. Amazon service great as always.
