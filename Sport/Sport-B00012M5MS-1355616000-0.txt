review/summary: Great Product.review/text: I read the other reviews about the plastic separating from the hard foam. I didn't have the problem. This is great very comfortable and adjusts easy.I have more expensive helmets, and just want an extra. I find myself wearing this one more then the other ones.2013-01-10UPDATE OK I was wrong! I did have separation. It was a the lower part plastic that came off. I just used superglue to reattached. I do think it was because of the cold. I know I am in California but it was 42 out. I would still buy again.
