review/summary: Great knifereview/text: Small size. Light weight. Reversible clip.I have only used it to open some packaging so far.I would recommend lubricating the mechanism so it glides better and/or adjusting the screw at the pivot point for the blade. Before adjustment it would slide out to locked position when using the index finger on the back but if I used my thumb on the thumb stub it usually wouldn't open into the full locked position.The speedsafe mechanism is very functional and very quick.I would have liked the safety lock to have been made of metal, it appears to be made of plastic.I would also recommend adding texturing to the handle since it is smooth metal and can get slippery.
