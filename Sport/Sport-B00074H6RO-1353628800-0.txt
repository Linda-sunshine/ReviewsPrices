review/summary: Great Gloves Great Pricereview/text: I definitetly recommend the gloves if you are looking for work out gloves. They are very comfortable and do not bunch up while lifting weights. Also, contrary to some reviews, these gloves run true to size. I read that they run small so i got x-large, even though my glove size has always been a "normal" large. X-large was definitely too big so i re-ordered it in large and (excuse the pun), they fit like a glove. The quality and fit cannot be beat for the price or even at a higher price.
