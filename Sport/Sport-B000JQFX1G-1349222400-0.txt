review/summary: Looks nice, long term issuesreview/text: I ordered this watch from Amazon roughly 6 months ago and was intially extremely pleased. It looks tremendous for the price- any of your friends who aren't well-versed in watches will be impressed. It keeps relatively good time- once again, a bit more than you would expect for &lt;$100. Unfortunately though, about a month ago the watch lost the ability to engage the date function. It's absolutely impossible to change the date. Pretty darn annoying. However, the watch still looks nice and I occassionaly get compliments when I'm daft enough to wear it. So overall, it looks fairly nice and keeps relatively good time, but if you're looking for performance/durability, avoid invicta. If you're looking for an attractive diver on a budget, the orient mako is absolutely worth checking out.
