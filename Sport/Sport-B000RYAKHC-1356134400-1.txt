review/summary: Bright and Nice but a flimsy feel.review/text: It is bright and nice. But it felt flimsy. I might have to add some gorilla glue or zip tie to make sure it does not fall off during the ride. Another problem was it did not fit well on the seat post of my Giant XTC 2. It was just a little too small.
