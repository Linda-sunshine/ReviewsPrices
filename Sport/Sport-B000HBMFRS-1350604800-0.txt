review/summary: Waste of Moneyreview/text: I bought this product mainly motivated by the price of the product. As I should have expected, previous reviews were correct in that this mattress does not last at all. I looked for a leak and while the plastic was fine it was actually the motor which was letting air out in the night. This perfectly encompasses the inferior quality of the mattress as its not even tearing plastic that's typically an expected issue but a fault in design from the very foundations of the product. I don't really have another product to suggest, just don't buy this.
