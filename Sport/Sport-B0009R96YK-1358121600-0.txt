review/summary: Great Bicycle Rear View Mirror, But need also flat mirror model!review/text: I have purchased a lot of these mirrors. They are probably one of the best on the market. You can buy parts for these if needed. They are well made. But what i do not understand is why they do not offer an option of a flat faced mirror? They are made with a "Convex" (Fish eye) mirror only - which i hate. I like a regular flat faced mirror. You would think the company would give you a choice between a flat face or a convex mirror. This mirror is made of about 4, 5, or 6 different pieces which is nice because you can replace any broken part easily by ordering parts from the manufacturer. The company that makes these mirrors are good people and provide good service.
