review/summary: Just Plain Out Handy!review/text: I'll never forget the first time I saw a Victorinox knife,my grandmother kept one in her purse and I always asked if I could see it...as a kid I thought it was the neatest thing in the world.Moving on when I got older I turned to multi-tools:they were more compact,sturdy stainless steel,and they were more comfortable to carry than a thick Swiss Army Knife loaded with everything but the kitchen sink(and pliers).But to the patient individual who can carry an SAK in their pocket everyday I can only say it's level of handyness really depends on what you get...but let's get to the classic SD.So what's so great about the SD model?it's nice to have something useful on your keychain and this knife is it!Think about it:the knife is only two layers so it's reasonably thin.Doesn't weight much so it's not a bother on your keychain.And don't forget the tools...for something this size efficient and useful your keyring is practically naked without it.Being that the SD is smaller in size it's more for light-duty tasks or uses where intricate use is involved and though it doesn't seem like much you'll find it to be handy when you least expect it.Take the tools for instance...*Scissors:Now and then I'll get behind on cutting my fingernails and mine have a tedency to grow fast,I deal with the public alot as a technician so appearance is important.I just whip these little scissors out on the way to a service call(not while driving) and since their small they do make nice and small clips more in tune with a nail clipper...a real timesaver.Using them for cutting things?well you can but you've also got the knife.*File/Small Slotted Screwdriver:As a guy I don't really file my nails as a routine function but I do work with my hands alot and my nails get chipped or torn,I can deal with that except when they snag on your pants pocket,your work shirt,or heck even a blanket in bed... then it's annoying.But the file's right there and it does the trick so I'm not ragging on guys who file their nails but it's nice to have the file on a 'as needed' basis.The small slotted screwdriver gets an odd use for me-I use it to get out the lint that collects in my fans during the summer.Or when I'm cleaning one of the service vehicles and there's cigarette ash or dried out soda that collected in those little gaps in the consoles...that tip really helps get it out.*Toothpick/Tweezers:As you might have guessed they serve their simple purpose and there is the most common flaw...the toothpick is proned to fall out.The only thing I can mention to you for preventing that is don't force the toothpick into it's slot,there's is a machined notch on the plastic surface that secures the toothpick and by shoving it in your'e wearing down that notch.Beyond that the two implements serve their purpose.*The Knife:It's a reasonably sharp and thin blade and of course it's cheap versus a dedicated knife...but it comes handy in a pinch.I usually never forget my personal carry knife so this little blade gets seldom use but after years of owning my first SD it finally needed a light sharpening...two or three passes on a stone and it was sharp again...gotta love soft steel.So that wraps it up on the tools with only one word of advice:use rubbing alcohol and wipe down the tools you use for sanitary reasons then wipe off the alcohol and dry.The tools are polished stainless and fight off rust quite well but wipe the alcohol completely from the tools...if it sits on the steel for extended periods of time it will eat into the finish.The Handles:Plastics can do two things for a consumer-they can win someone over and prove their worth or they can break and dissapoint someone...Victorinox just uses a basic plastic and nothing specialized like delrin or zytel for the handle scales.But I've tossed my keys on the kitchen table countless times and I've dropped my keys on concrete a good share of times and both my old SD and my new one have never cracked or shattered,only scratches.The handle colors have changed over the years,first time I bought one they were only available in Red or Black and the colors seem to vary throughout the years...my new one was in Forest Green(seems discontinued in that color).Final Thoughts:I'm sure many other reviewers have said this but it is the most handy thing in a compact form on your keyring-it doesn't take up space and it's truthfully useful.The tool selection may seem limited to some but I think for it's size the Victorinox Classic SD brings alot to the table...5-stars!*File:
