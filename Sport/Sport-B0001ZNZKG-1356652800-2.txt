review/summary: Excellent product that is actually worth the price!review/text: I was introduced to this product on a camping/hiking trip. I was complaining about how my current boxer briefs were riding up my legs and eventually became a bunched up, sweaty 'diaper' on long hikes. A gentlemen suggested I try the ExOfficio briefs and he raved about them.Before my next hike I stopped in one of the local outdoor shops and bought a pair for $30, which frankly is a lot for a pair of underpants in my book. The next day I wore them climbing one of Colorado's many 14'ers (Longs Peak) and have never worn a more comfortable pair of drawers in my life! They stay put, dry quickly, and breath extremely well.I now have 8 pairs of them and wear them daily. When it's time to replace them, I will be buying more.These are fairly expensive, but without a doubt the best boxer briefs I've ever worn.
