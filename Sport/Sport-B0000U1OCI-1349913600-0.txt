review/summary: Pedometerreview/text: I'm not really sure I should have purchased the pedometer for what I tried to do. I was doing mountain hiking I couldn't get it where it was accurate. Hiking on a mountain trail is much different than walking down the street as your steps are not equal. I was going on hike to the top of a 14,000+ peak & wanted to check my progress. It was way off & I gave up on it. I had made adjustments to it prior to the hike trying to make it accurate. If I had the packaging I may have returned it but I don't so its mine.
