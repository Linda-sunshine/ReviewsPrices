review/summary: Simply too smallreview/text: I bought this Schwinn Trasher last week - unfortunately, I have to return it already. As some other already noticed, the plastic side pieces are poor quality - I received the helmet with these pieces already fallen off and the glue traces visible on the helmet. But that is not my main problem with the helmet. Instead the hard shell simply is too small for my head. So be careful, other bigheads out there, this helmet is not made for you...
