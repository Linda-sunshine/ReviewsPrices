review/summary: Search is Overreview/text: Finally, a comfortable water proof set of goggles for me. Buying swimming goggles is one of the most frustrating experiences....literally have to buy and return multiple pairs until you find the right fit. These goggles are the best I've owned, they are comfortable, they create excellent suction to maintain waterproof eye protection and there well made. 2 thumbs up for this product.
