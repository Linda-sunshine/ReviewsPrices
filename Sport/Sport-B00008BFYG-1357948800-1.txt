review/summary: Good First Scooterreview/text: Got this for my three and a half year old grandson for Christmas. He loves it! He is tall for his age and has been riding balance bikes for over a year so maybe this helped him get right on and go. For the price it was well worth it. Not real heavy duty, but a good purchase for a child going from a three wheel scooter to a two.The only problem with it is that he wants me to build ramps at my house for his birthday.
