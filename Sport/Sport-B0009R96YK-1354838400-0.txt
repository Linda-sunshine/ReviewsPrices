review/summary: Best bar-mounted mirrorreview/text: Both my wife and I have this mirror. It's sturdy, relatively vibration free, clear image, and provides a good field of vision. I understand that a helmet or eyeglass mounted mirror is a better experience for many people. However, I find this bar-mounted mirror better for casual riding. Good price too.Update: Bike fell over and broke mirror bracket. No fault of mirror. Still like it so much I bought an exact replacement.
