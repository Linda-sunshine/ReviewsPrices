review/summary: The most comfortable boxer briefs I have ever wornreview/text: I am very hesitant about boxer briefs. I have never really liked the fit and feel of them, and usually they end up riding up during the day. But in a request for something more appealing then plain boxers, I decided to give these a try.These are by far the best boxer briefs I have ever worn. The price isn't cheap but they are also no more expense then other less comfortable name brand boxer briefs. These do not ride up and they feel simply amazing on the skin. After wearing them for a while you forget that they are there. They are fantastic for travel and for regular daily use, especially if you are active. They look appealing too.I thought a medium was the right size because that is what I would get other boxer briefs in, but these run a bit bigger then what I am used to. Still comfy but I ordered another pair in small to see if those fit better. I have a 30 inch waist to give you some dimensions.I would really recommend them. I myself will probably start to slowly buy a whole weeks worth soon.UPDATE: The small size fits my frame much better. Its really a great fit.
