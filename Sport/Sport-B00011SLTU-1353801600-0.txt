review/summary: Handy in surprising waysreview/text: I'm constantly finding new uses for this awesome little knife. I open packages, scrape price tags off glass, clean file and trim my nails on a whim, turn tiny screws, you name it. It's so useful because it is well made and I always have it with me on my key ring. After years of use it still functioned perfectly. Unfortunately my key ring broke, not the one this has but my larger d ring one and I lost my trusty knife. I bought this as a replacement that same day because I didn't want to be without it! This one is just as great as my old one.
