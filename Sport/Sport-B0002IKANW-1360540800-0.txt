review/summary: Wish there was a "0 star" availablereview/text: Aluminum breaks apart when cycling in the gun.The soft plastic "primer" is worthless after only a few dry fires.At the best, these are only good for teaching people how to load a magazine. I would not recommend cycling these or using them for dry fire.Google "snap caps best and worst" for YouTube video. It accurately reviews these.
