review/summary: Shopping tripsreview/text: Bought these for my husband for his trips to NY. My husband takes weekend trips to NYC for shopping. He's always complaining about how cold it is. Found these at walmart earlier this year for $1 for multiple pairs. I also got the foot warmers and body warmers. Definitely need to keep there in stock. He uses these for fishing trips too.
