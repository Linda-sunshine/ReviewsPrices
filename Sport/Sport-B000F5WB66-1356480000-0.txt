review/summary: Hit or miss!review/text: Virtually useless as a stopwatch/timer or a heart rate monitor. Stop watch feature does not work independently of the heart rate monitor. If the unit doesn't read your heart rate it turns itself off. So, you have neither your heart rate nor a measure of how long you have been working out. You "wet" the chest strap before you put it on. If you take too long to start exercising and sweating the chest strap will dry out and won't register your heart rate. If you wet the strap and start exercising immediately you have a chance that the unit will work properly. I tried to make it work. It's just too hard. It shouldn't have to be so hard!
