review/summary: I love these pants!!review/text: I am genuinely very excited about these pants, I bought them in 3 colors. They fit like a CHARM, they have a great band at the top that is very flattering, and they are a nice material - not too thin not too heavy. They are a PERFECT yoga pant. I am so happy with my purchase. They are a little long, but i'm 5'4&#34; and are maybe 2-3 inches too long. No biggie though, still very satisfied.
