review/summary: Best hiking boxers on the planetreview/text: I am a long distance hiker with thousands of miles of trail and backcountry hiking and these ExOfficiao boxers are all I have used for years.Once I mistakenly ordered the ones with tight cuffs on the bottoms and that was not good. As a hiker you need air flowing and loose fitting cloths. So make sure you order the ones with the loose leg holes to get yourself some air flow and not have chafing issues.I carry two pair of these on my long distance hikes. Each day I wash one and let it dry while I wear the other pair.Not a single bad thing I could say about these other then the rather high price tag.
