review/summary: Pretty good holsterreview/text: I bought this holster to use with the shoulder holster rig. The rig sucked, but I liked the holster, so I kept it and sent the shoulder rig back. I like the belt mount as shown, adjusted for maximum height. With the paddle mount attached, the holster tends to stick out and hangs a bit low for most of my prefered jackets. If you like a paddle rig, I recommend the Fobus HK-1 for your SR9. It rides higher and tighter and for me, I found it to be more flexible and comfortable. I found that the width of the paddle that came with the Bkackhawk relegated it to only one spot on my hip which was reasonably comfortable for standing/walking, but not optimal for sitting or driving. Due to the excelent retention/release system, I think this would be an outstanding holster for external tactical applications. Also, for those of you that have an SR9C, you can cut off an inch or so of the holster to get better concealibility without affecting the integrety of the holster.
