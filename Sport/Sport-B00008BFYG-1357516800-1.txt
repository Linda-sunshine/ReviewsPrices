review/summary: Razor A2 Kick Scooterreview/text: I bought 3 Razor scooters for my 3 grandsons ages 11, 9,& 7 in their favourite colours, green, blue & red.They just loved them & couldn't believe they had their own in their favourite colours too. I was a hit.!They adjust to the appropriate height & are quiet & easy to operate.They were easy for the boys to assemble & to fold up for storage too.Thanks.
