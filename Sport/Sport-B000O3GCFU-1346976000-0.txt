review/summary: Perfect for 5YO Hands!review/text: Perfect solution for my 5YO daughter returning to school. Her new classroom does not have microwave. This is a great product - she can open it, stays cool to the touch on the outside, nice and hot inside. A note for use - lids creates a vacuum effect when it's screwed on. I had some leaking since I filled to "top" of neck, below threading. After pouring out some liquid to just below top, nice tight lid and no leaks! My daughter commented that her broth was "just right" at lunchtime- not too cold and not scalding. Happy Lunch!
