review/summary: I would pay retail.review/text: Checked out the exact same knife at Bass Pro. They wanted $55 and I think I paid $35 on Amazon. I find the knife has a really good feel and the speed assist makes one handed use a piece of cake. Haven't used it enough to know how long it holds an edge (that all depends on use anyway) but it comes out of the box razor sharp. Keep it clipped in my front pocket and don't even notice it till I reach into my pocket for whatever I'm digging for. Highly reccommend this purchase.
