review/summary: Head Squeezer!!review/text: I could tell that they would be great in the range, yet I never made it with them. As soon as I wore them around the house to get adjusted to them; I came down with a headache and nauseous feeling. It squeezed my head so much that it would be unsafe for me to use at a shooting range. I returned them since they would not be useful to me. Not to mention, they are huge! I am looking for an alternative earmuff, so right now I will be sticking with my Radians Remington earmuffsRadians Remington Womens Eye and Ear Protection Combo Packsince they are at least more comfortable wearing at the range.
