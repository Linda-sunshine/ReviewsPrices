review/summary: Handy Pedometer!review/text: I've used this little pedometer for a few weeks now and fine it fairly accurate (the hard part is getting your stride lenght right). It certainly lets you know when you have been sluffing-off! I also like the fact that it has a "safety" line on it that clips to your pocket or waist so if the pedometer gets knocked off your waistband you don't lose it. Of course, you can also carry it in your pocket, since it doesn't have to be "right-side-up" to function. I'd recommend everyone carry one of these!
