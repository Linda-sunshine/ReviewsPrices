review/summary: Disintegrated right after 30 days - DO NOT BUYreview/text: The plastic shell pieces started falling off, so I super glued them back on like others. Then, a couple days later, the back size wheel broke off, making the helmet loose and unusable because it won't fit on my head. Wasted $20 on this thing and Amazon won't let me return it because it's past 30 days. Thanks a lot
