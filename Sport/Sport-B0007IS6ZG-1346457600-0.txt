review/summary: Good product for the price.review/text: I got this rope based on the positive reviews and the price (fairly inexpensive). So far, it has met my expectations without fail. I didn't have any of the problems with adjusting the rope length. I'm 6' tall and needed to remove a good 6" or so to achieve the correct length. The end caps of both handles were removed easily and the rope could be pushed through the ends of the handles without difficulty. I trimmed the end, replaced the locking ferrule and am now good to go. The rope turns easily and works well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the rope seems to get chewed up pretty easily when using it on the road, but this hasn't adversely affected the usability of the jump rope. I'll just have to see how it holds up after more abuse. Overall, I'm quite pleased with this purchase.
