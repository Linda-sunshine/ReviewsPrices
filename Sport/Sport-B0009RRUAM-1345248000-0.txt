review/summary: Thermarest Pillowreview/text: Love, love, love this little pillow! I left mine behind on the train and immediately ordered another when we got home! Firm enough to support your head during sleep, compact enough to slip into a shoulder bag or carry-on. Yes it's small, but it does the job nicely as a travel pillow. If you feel you need a bit of back support on airline seats or otherwise, and want to travel light, this will fit the bill. One of the better purchases I made for our backpacking trip across Europe!
