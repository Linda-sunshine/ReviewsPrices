review/summary: Works great for Springfield XDS (45 cal compact semiauto)review/text: I recently bought a new Springfield XDS which is a compact (5+1) 45ACP pistol, single stack magazine. It can definitely be a chore trying to get the Handall Jr onto the gun, but that's a good thing, you put in some effort up front and then the thing does not move, which is exactly what you want.I neglected to read the directions first, which advise you to heat the grip up to make the rubber easier to work with; oops. Anyway, I was able to work it on there but ultimately found I actually prefer it to be installed upside down because of where the finger ridge meets my hand, so you may want to consider which way you put it on before installing it since it isn't exactly fun to remove and do again.The Springfield does have a grip safety. My advice is to cut the rubber away a bit AFTER installing the Handall on the gun; you have a much greater chance of splitting it down the middle when you're pushing and tugging on it to get it onto the gun than you do cutting some material away after install. I was able to cut out a notch for the grip safety using regular scissors.
