review/summary: Love my gigantic little toolboxreview/text: Don't think I have a sharper blade anywhere at home. Thought it would be too big and bulky with so many gadgets but they all line up quite well and make it just like a tiny portable toolbox. Only issue is finding a good pouch for it, all the ones I try seem to fall short...
