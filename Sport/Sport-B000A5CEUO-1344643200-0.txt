review/summary: Omron heart rate monitor best of the bunchreview/text: I've been very active in a cardiac rehab exercise program for more than 10 years, spanning an angioplasty and a triple bypass over that period. I've gone through 3 of the most popular heart rate monitors during that time, and all of them have proven less than satisfactory, mostly due to overly complex operation or inability to replace dead batteries. When I found the Omron HR-100C on Amazon, and its price was less than a third of what I'd been paying for my previous monitors, I thought I'd give it a try, and I'm extremely happy that I did. This monitor does exactly what it is supposed to do: give you a constant running readout of your heart rate, which is very accurate according to comparison to the laboratory instruments available at the hospital's rehab facility. In addition, it is very easy to set up and use, and the batteries in both the watch and chest strap are user-accessible. I've had previous experience with Omron products, such as their weather indicators, clocks, and pedometers, so I expect that their heart monitor will last pretty nearly forever. I would highly recommend this instrument to anyone looking for an inexpensive, accurate, easy to use and reliable heart rate monitor.
