review/summary: Worked well as intendedreview/text: Used it for the first time a couple weeks ago for a weekend cycling event. Had to wash/dry it before using it to fluff it up but worked great after that - kept its form and density well. I probably would have liked a larger size pillow beter but this packed well and worked fine.
