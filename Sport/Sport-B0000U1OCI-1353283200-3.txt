review/summary: Works great!review/text: This little pedometer is so easy to use. It's little so I clip it somewhere inside my clothes and forget about it. I check it in the evening to be sure I got in the recommended steps for the day. It shows me the steps I took, the aerobic steps I took, the miles I walked, and the calories I burned. The battery has lasted for months and I use it everyday. I also use it on the weekends, especially because I go for longer walks, and this is easier to find the distance I walked than trying to map the route online.
