review/summary: Very good value; comfortable pad.review/text: Got this for my wife and I use it more than she does. No carry strap or bag but for the money, this is a great mat; especially if youy have an old velcro or other sort of strap laying around to use on it to keep it rolled up. would definitely buy another.
