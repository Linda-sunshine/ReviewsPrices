review/summary: Product as advertised.review/text: If you have done Insanity before, I think you will really enjoy the Fast & Furious version. I finished my first round of Insanity around Christmas. I was debating if I should do another round but I found this version and thought it was perfect, given that it's only 20 minutes long. I usually work out in the morning before work, and sometimes I'm running late due to the length of my workout. So I ordered this version and I loved it right from the start. Don't think because it's only 20 minutes you won't sweat, you certainly will! Most - if not all - exercises will be known to you if you have done Shaun T's videos before. You'll do a quick warm up and stretch too.The only reason I gave it a 4 start rating instead of 5 was that when I opened the package and saw the thin sleeve I was disappointed. Honestly, $25 for one single 20-min workout is a bit pricey, but at least I thought the case was going to look a bit nicer. It's really not a case, just a cardboard sleeve.
