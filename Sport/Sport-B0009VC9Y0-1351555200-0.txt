review/summary: Kershaw Ken Onion Leek Reviewreview/text: This knife shipped the day after I purchased it and was received in a timely fashion. Out of the box it was extremely sharp and seemed to be well constructed. It has been a week or so and I've had absolutely no problems with this knife. It handles well, the clip is perfect, and it just feels good. Not to mention that the knife looks sleek as heck. Great purchase.Kershaw Ken Onion Leek Folding Knife with Speed Safe
