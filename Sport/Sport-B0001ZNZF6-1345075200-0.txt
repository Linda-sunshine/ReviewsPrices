review/summary: Excellent purchasereview/text: I bought 6 pr of ExOfficio Men's Give-n-Go Boxers for my husband in 4 different colors, deep palm, ocean, black and charcoal. After 1 month of frequent use, he is still very happy with them. 3 prs of these were from Amazon, and the other 3 were available from another vendor, outland usa, that also offered free shipping. Both arrived promptly and in original packaging. The boxers themselves fit well, have a comfortable waist band and dry very quickly as promised. I've been washing them in cold water and line drying to extend their lives as well. Can't wait to take them on trip to Europe since they will be light to pack, comfortable for all day hiking and easy to wash/dry for next wear!Though they cost about 4x as much as regular cotton boxers, I am hoping their wear life will be at least 4x as long as the cotton boxers tend to get holey after 2-3 yrs or so of regular use.
