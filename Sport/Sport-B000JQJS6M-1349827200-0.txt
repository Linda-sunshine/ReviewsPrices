review/summary: Very poor repair servicereview/text: Wife bought me this watch for Christmas 2011. It's my 2nd Invicta. I love the feel & Looks of the watch. I only wore this watch a dozen times never to work or around water. Just 5 months later in May 2012 the watch got moisture in it. Sent it back to Invicta by priority mail ($5.00) for repair under warranty with a check for $27.00 to cover shipping it back. On June 17th called to see when watch would be repaired & sent back was told that it was scheduled to be repaired by SEP 20th. Today is Oct 10th called & was told that the watch was sent oversees for repair & won't be back for 2 more weeks.Send the watch oversees to repair it and it takes 5 months???? This is my last Invicta !!!Invicta Men's 8928OB Pro Diver Two-Tone Automatic Watch
