review/summary: Great product for the price.review/text: Bought this for an intro to jump roping. I had read reviews about how hard it was to adjust the rope, but I had no problem. It took about 2 minutes with a pair of plyers. So far so good, it's been a great little product. When it wears out I will buy again.
