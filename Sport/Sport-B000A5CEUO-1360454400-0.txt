review/summary: Skeptical at first, surprised by the endreview/text: Like I said, I was very skeptical on how good it would work in the beginning. When I went out for the my first run wearing it, I felt a little uncomfortable. But as I kept on running, I did not even realize it that I had it on until I got home and headed for the shower. Works great!
