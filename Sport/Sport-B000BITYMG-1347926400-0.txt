review/summary: Safety Leash for Pedometerreview/text: The leash did prevent a loss on two occasions. The leash does have a quality issue with the clip. After one week of use the clip literaly fell apart. I replaced it with a well made clip. Now I would not wear the pedometer without the leash. I would recomend this product if the quality issue were addressed.
