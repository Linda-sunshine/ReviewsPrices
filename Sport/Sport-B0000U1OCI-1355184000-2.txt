review/summary: Every little movement counts as a step.review/text: When I wore this, it would record that I'd walked over a hundred steps when I only walked down the hall. I tried wearing it in different places (waist band, top pocket), but nothing worked. Within a half hour it was recording that I'd walked over 500 steps when in fact, I'd done very little at all. I stopped using it after a few days.
