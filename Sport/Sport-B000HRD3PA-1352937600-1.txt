review/summary: White is basically see thrureview/text: I made the mistake of buying a pair of white shorts, the material is super thin and that means its very much see thru.It is comfortable but I would buy a darker colour and not this --I got the pair yesterday and I am contemplating returning it or keeping it for wear inside the house.The shorts will not serve my intended purpose of wearing it to the gym --maybe I will try it with a compression shorts.Better mesh shorts are sold by UA, I own a white one that I wanted to replace with this but that was miles ahead of this one.
