review/summary: so soft and comfy!!review/text: I placed my order Wednesday night and received my package the following Monday. (less than a week? WIN!)I pulled them out and thought &#34;these do seem a little thin...&#34; (like some reviews had mentioned) so I pull them on and I was in heaven!! They're super soft and comfy, I can see these being great lounge pants. But lets face it I wear them everywhere. They aren't really as thin as they seem, they cover well and don't show through. They feel like a good light weight for working out.I ordered a large and they fit perfect! I'm in good shape 5'10&#34; and usually wear about an 8 and like my pants to reach the floor. (starting to sound like a dating profile x____x )I haven't had them for very long so we'll see if they stand the test of time... but until then I have to go order more of these comfy pants!
