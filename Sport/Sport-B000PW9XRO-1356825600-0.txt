review/summary: Great range glovesreview/text: Right off the bat, the NS430 are great range gloves, but I would NOT call them all-weather gloves.They are constructed on a neoprene back and a synthetic palm. The fingers, except the index finger, are coated in a nice grippy substance, as is the palm swell. This assists in providing extra gripping potential to your firearms, when compared to standard gloves. The hook and loop closures work great as well. This makes the gloves suitable, in my opinion, for early spring or fall weather.I have taken these into the field, but would not recommend it to others. The conditions there (wet, cold, windy, sbow, etc) are beyond the scope of conditions these gloves are useful for.Keep in mind that the hatch gloves tend to run a size small, so order the next larger size up.Having owned these gloves for well over a year, i am quite happy with this purchase as range gloves and would recommend them. If you need hunting gloves, though, look elsewhere.
