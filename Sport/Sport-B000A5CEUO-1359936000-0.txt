review/summary: Kind of bulky and problematicreview/text: It wasn't clear to me at first, but this device takes its reading from a plastic device you have to put across your heart, then it transmits a signal to the wristband. Working out with the device in place is a modest hassle, plus you have to either moisten it or lick it on the back so it gets decent contact with your skin.. if you got dry skin or in a dry climate you find yourself pushing or figeting with it to get a reading.If I decide to get a device that can reliably take pulse from the arm it's strapped on, i'd go that route. This one is only doable if you plan on stopping, then mashing down on or holding the sensor on your chest, and doing static readings.
