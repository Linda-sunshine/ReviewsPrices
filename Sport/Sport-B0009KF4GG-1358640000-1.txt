review/summary: Another great SAK in my inventoryreview/text: This knife is a work of art. It's a bit large as an everyday-carrier,{my carrier is a Wenger Teton.} This knife is carried in my backpack , or cargo pants, on all of our camping, and hiking-backpacking adventures. This is also our second Champion SAK. After my wife and I have had to share our Champion SAKon our many week-long and weekend camping trips, I finally purchased another champion so that my wife and I have our very own. I purchased this knife as a Christmas stocking-stuffer for her, and she was as excited about her new SAK as any gift she received.By the way, the much confused comments concerning the infamous "HOOK" on many Victorinox SAK's......The hook was installed by Victoeinox as a device to pull frozen boot-laces tight or loosen laces, or to tighten laces on backpacks, frozen or too tight knots, etc. It was not intended as a parcell-hook, lock-pick, plastic bag carrier or nose-picker as described in countless reviews! We must remember, these tools are desighned, and built, by folks that live in the ALPS for gods sake! I use the hook for its intended use, although it is also a great tool for liftng hot pots and lids over an open campfire . By the way, We love our two Champions !
