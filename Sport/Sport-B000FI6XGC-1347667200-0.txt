review/summary: Tears valve stem on inner tube (UPDATE: figured that the problem is not related to the pump)review/text: After using this pump the tire went flat on my first ride. It turns out the inner tube on valve stem was torn. I didn't think it was due to the pump. I replaced it and put some air with this pump. Next ride another flat tire. I read another reviewer complaining about the same problem. Still not hundred percent sure if pump is the cause though.I will update this comment if it happens after I replace this pump with a full size one.UPDATE: I figured the problem with valve stem tearing is not directly related to the pump. It turns out there was not enough pressure in the tube causing the tire to slide/move on the wheel. Thus making the valve stretch and eventually tear. After reading some discussions on the web I put some air (40-45 PSI) with a floor pump and then rub the inner tube with baby powder not to stick to the tire. Also put some glue on the tire to hold the wheel better. No more problems.
