review/summary: Invicta 8926OBreview/text: I ordered the Invicta 8926OB from NewDayWatch off Amazon, expecting it to arrive the next day or two and didn't realize it would take a week to be delivered throught Amazon. The watch arrived as described and seems to be functoning properly. The band is a little on the light side but otherwise, I like the look and fee. It seems to be an excellent value, only time will tell. This is my 1st Automatic watch since an Omega I got for High School graduation that has lasted over 35 years. I am tired of changing batteries on my quartz watches. I am really happy it has the NH35A movement and better than expected magnification on the cyclopes.
