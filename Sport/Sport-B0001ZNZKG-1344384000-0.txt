review/summary: Comfortablereview/text: They aren't too loose or too tight and are a very good compromise between boxers and briefs. Most boxer briefs I can feel while walking even if they are comfortable. These I just forget about completely because they don't restrict motion or cling to my legs. My only complaint is I don't like how they look, but I'm fine with that.
