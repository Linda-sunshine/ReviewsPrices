review/summary: Can't make a better gogglereview/text: I've always used cheapie goggles since I assumed all goggles are close enough. Boy was I wrong!I just started training for a triathlon so I figured it's time to invest in something that may be better than what I've been using. After some research, I settled on these Aqua Sphere Kaiman goggles and these are amazing. Here are my thoughts:PROS- So comfortable!- Don't leak- Incredible visibility- Looks good on me ;)CONS- NoneOVERALLEven though these are under $20, I'm not sure how much better a goggle can get. I'm going to buy a few small sizes for my kids. Do yourself a favor and get a case for this too. I bought thisSpeedo Hard Goggle Caseand it fits perfectly!
