review/summary: I love them; wife does notreview/text: I love my cast iron cookware. I don't want to cook on my aluminum/teflon stuff anymore because I love the feel of the iron/seasoning. I also think it imparts the taste, and it is fun knowing that the pan is becoming more &#34;mine&#34; every time I cook with it. After cooking a few times, it is pretty nonstick. They are also so verstile--I can fry some meat to brown it, then put the same pan into the oven to slow cook said meat for some delicous tikka kebabs. I plan to make a shepherd's pie in the pot soon.My wife, however, has a hate/hate relationship with them. She says that they are too heavy, and that they sometimes impart too much flavor into eggs if she is cooking those. She's also accidentally turned the wrong burner on a couple of times and burned the seasoning off of them, causing me to have to re-season them. To do so, I'd recommend using vegetable shortening.
