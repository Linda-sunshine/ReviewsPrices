review/summary: Sizing not accuratereview/text: We ordered an XL, and they were more like a L, and a small large at that. They were for my husband and he has an old pair of L Russell sweatpants that fit, and thought that ordering the XL would give him a little more room, which it did not. I didn't return them, because I was able to wear them; I usually wear a large.I will say that the quality was excellent, but consider ordering the next size up when placing your order.
