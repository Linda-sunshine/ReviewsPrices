review/summary: Easy to use. Big Readout.review/text: This simple heart rate monitor has the basics: it tells your heart rate. The more I use it, the more I realize how helpful that information is to making sure I'm working at a beneficial level and generally to building stamina and strength. This gadget has also given me numbers to help guage what my gut tells me about how hard I think I'm exercising.To my pleasant surprise, it also interfaced with the readout screen on some machines at the gym, so I didn't have to look at my wrist. I just wanted something to tell me my heart rate. This inexpensive little setup does just that. The band is easy to put on/take off and the watch is clear, comfortable, and has a fairly large readout. The only thing I don't love about it is having a band around my mid-section/below my chest (but this is not the gadget's fault).
