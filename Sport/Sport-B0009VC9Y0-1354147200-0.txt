review/summary: Great knifereview/text: Sharp and easy to open and use. Very comfortable in the hand. Very handy blade to have and it got a ton of use in everything from eating apples, to opening boxes, to slicing up packing boxes for recycling. I probably shouldn't have used it to slice up boxes but it held it's edge really well and was always on hand. Unfortunately I've lost it somewhere so not quite so handy at the moment. Will buy another one if I can't find it in the near future.
