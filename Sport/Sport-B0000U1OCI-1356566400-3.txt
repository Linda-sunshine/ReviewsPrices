review/summary: Really? Are you kidding me?review/text: I am finding this thing useless. I have the three button model, and I discovered it has no way to reset your steps or data to zero, short a total reset by using that tiny deeply recessed plug in the back, the ones most devices only use if a system crashes and needs a hard reset. It does automatically reset to zero at midnight. But what good is that?Because this thing will show all kinds of steps if we drive with in in a car, once we get to the trail head, we need to reset the data to tell us how far we have hiked. To do that we have to find a small stick or pen, and do a master reset. Once we push that button, we have to go through the entire setup process all over again. Good Grief!! And this must be done when you are just stepping onto the trail head. A laborious and time consuming event. I am over pedometers forever. I suggest we all just buy a GPS unit. That is what I am going to do, after this bitter experience!Give me a break! I looked up the instruction for a Model HJ-112 before I bought this thing. And I studied the PDF; in fact I still have it on this very computer. Funny thing is, the manual which states it is for this exact model HJ-112 shows four buttons on its face, and one of them is a button named reset. The instructions say that it will reset the recorded data back to zero. The manual that came with the device, and the device itself are labeled as an HJ-112. So I just see this as blatant consumer fraud.
