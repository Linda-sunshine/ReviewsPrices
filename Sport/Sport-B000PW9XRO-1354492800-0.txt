review/summary: Not bad...not badreview/text: Gloves have a great feel and fit to them. I can even work my touch screen with them on which is an added bonus. However I have only owned the gloves for a few weeks and I'm already seeing a hole along the seem in the right thumb which is somewhat upsetting.
