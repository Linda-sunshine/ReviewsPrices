review/summary: Victorinox Plus The Boy Scouts....Awesomereview/text: I have many knives and multi-purpose leatherman type tools, but the Victorinox is my favorite. When I saw that thet hada Boy Scout knife, I had to get it. In my younger days I was a Boy Scout, but I don't remember anything Boy Scout relatedbeing this awesome. Victorinox is the original and only remaining Swiss Army Knife maker. They make great products thatI carry in my pocket and use everyday. I will buy many more in the coming years. Thanks!
