review/summary: Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket pedometerreview/text: Processed and delivered on time. The pedometer works very well, though sometimes (not often) it adds a step or too with movements other than taking steps. I would recommend this product to all who walk or jog and are looking for an accurate measuring device
