review/summary: Great Yoga/Exercise Pantsreview/text: I really like these yoga pants because they are extra long, as a taller woman I dread the highwaters of my youth! They are actully a bit too long for me and that is fine - these are for exercise, not walking in the woods - although I do take my dog for a walk in them most days. I just got a second order (because I like these so much - got them in several colors and actually 2 different sizes since I am trying to lose weight) and although the pair I wore today has the correct size on it - they are tighter and shorter than the others, not a problem, still within range for me BUT this may indicate that different colors are sized differently? Or there is variation in the sizes? Not sure.When I ordered the first time 3 of the items were correct, one was the wrong size and color but I contacted the seller and they answered right away and they sent out a new pair along with a return shipping label. I was very pleased with the service and have ordered again. I still have one pair to try on and trust that they are (hopefully) the same as the first items I bought in size, if not that they are within my range.All in all the pants are comfortable and sized appropriately, and the customer service was excellent.
