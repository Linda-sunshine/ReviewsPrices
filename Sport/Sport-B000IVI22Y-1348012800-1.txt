review/summary: SPILLS AND LEAKSreview/text: The bottle is well made and sturdy, BUT unless you keep it standing upright in a lunch bag (which most kids will not) it leaks terribly. Even when closed tightly and the straw valve fully closed. What a mess, thank goodness we just use them for water! I will add this also, biting the straw to take a drink is hard on the teeth. For both me (age 31) and my children (8 and 10) they complain that it hurts their teeth to bite down on it.
