review/summary: Very Impressed!review/text: I haven't used a thermos since I was in school and they never seemed to work well. My 6 year old uses this for school. It is dishwasher safe. WAHOO!!!There is a 5 hour time lapse between when we put the hot foot in and when she eats lunch. Each time she's used it I've asked her about the temperature and she says her food is still pretty warm.Just a tip: I pour boiling water in it and place the lid on (just loosely-no turning) and let that sit for about 10 minutes before I fill it with her soup/left-overs for the day. This makes a huge difference in the temperature of the food when she sits down for lunch.This also holds a lot more than it looks like it will hold. I put an entire Marie Calendar's Turkey Pot Pie in there 2 days ago. Crust and all and there was a little room to spare.The lid and base have a rubbery material that is non-skid, also making it easier for my daughter to open on her own and to keep it from sliding off the lunch table if she bumps it with her elbow.I don't give 5 star ratings very often but this gem of a thermos deserves it. I'd give it 6 stars if I could!!!I don't give out 5 stars very often but this little gem of a thermos deserves it.
