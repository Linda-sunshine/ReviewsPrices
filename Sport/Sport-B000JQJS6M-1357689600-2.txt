review/summary: Magnificent Watchreview/text: I don't usually look at offers sent via e-mail. On this occasion though they had me at the word &#34;Watch&#34; in the subject line! I love watches. I was a little dubious regarding this offer because the picture was of this beautiful watch at 70% off! I thought oh well let&#8217;s give it a go. I purchased the watch on-line and the service from Amazon was spectacular, I was informed, and the tracking was second to none. The Invicta watch arrived and to say that I am happy with it is an understatement. The watch arrived in a beautiful presentation case, the watch looks great, and all I had to do was take it to my local jeweler to have it sized and I was good to go. Thanks Amazon and Invicta.
