review/summary: Didn't quite fit my seatpost, but the light is working wonderfully.review/text: The clip that came with the light was just a bit too small to fit. Fortunately, I could replace it with the clip that came with the reflector on my bike. I know it's not very kosher to replace reflectors with lights, but whatever. I'm sure I'll be fine.This is my first rear bicycle light, so I can't really compare it to other lights, but it does well for me. The price is pretty reasonable too.
