review/summary: Very Thick, not that greatreview/text: I recommend getting the RX rope, with bearings and optional wire sizes. I went through two of this style - Nike's and this one, before I finally caved in and bought the $35 RX brand.Not terrible, but anyone doing double unders or wants to use this on a regular basis should invest in a better one.
