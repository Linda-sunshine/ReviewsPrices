review/summary: Simply put: I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THE GYM!review/text: Tony Horton and his team put together a workout routine that will bring results. But it requires determination to make it real.I bought this package almost two years ago. I was 35 and I thought that I'd rather pay for this instead of wasting time going to the gym. As soon as the box arrived I went through the directions, intro video, diets, etc. I even started working out the following day... and then I left it there. It was a tough start. I paid for this product and I was not using it.... until a year ago. I decided to give it another chance. Being older and almost sedentary I wanted to change my situation. This time I started with the &#34;shoulders & arms&#34; disc for the evidence I could get. As I noticed some results over a week, I ended buying dumbbells and then going through all the discs! I started feeling like never before. My friends noticed the change and I get asked about &#34;my formula&#34; from time to time.In summary, Tony got me addicted to feel better and look awesome. I'm about to turn 40 in a couple of years more and I'm in the best shape of my entire life! I even see my abs where I've never thought I could. THANK YOU, TONY! I'm your fan.Certainly you have to follow a diet and be ready to get tired but you won't regret it. You simply won't. I fully recommend P90X, but you have to &#34;Bring it!&#34;.
