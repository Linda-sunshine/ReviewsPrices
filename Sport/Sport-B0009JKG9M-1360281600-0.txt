review/summary: love itreview/text: this is a great pot! it is a bit smaller than what i expected but i did get a frying pan with it!! bugers do taste different/better fried in cast iron. makes the best fried chicken. shipping was fast and was free!! if you are looking for a med sized pot this is it! would definitely recommend especially if you are new to cast iron.
