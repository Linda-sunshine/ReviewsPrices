review/summary: Very good fit for Ruger LC9review/text: I did the &#34;hot water&#34; trick for install which helped the rubber be a little more flexible. It still took some mechanical &#34;oomph&#34; to get on, so if you don't have the dexterity to throw elbow grease into it I would use a little dish soap in the hot water. Just a touch of dish soap. Just like putting hand grips on bicycle handlebars when you were a kid... the soap and water will dry out.Anyway, onto the review. Fits firearm snugly and needed just a wee bit of trim around the mag release button. I didn't trim the same area on the opposite side so when I press the mag release the grip gets pushed a little there, but nothing too crazy. It does help the native grip feel more full in the hand and I like the finger lip this has. Have never tried the Pachmayr grip so can't compare to anything else.
