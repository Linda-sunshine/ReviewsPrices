review/summary: Nice fit, cheaply madereview/text: The helmet fits me well, it has an adjustable strap around the back which allows you to make a nice snug fit. I've worn it out for about 5 rides so far and it's light and comfortable. last time out I tossed it in the trunk of my car and when I took it out one of the plastic pieces around the back fell off without any impact of any kind. doesn't affect the functionality, just aesthetics. hopefully the core of the helmet is of better stuff. All in all seems like a good deal for the price.
