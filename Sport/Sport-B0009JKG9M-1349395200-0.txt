review/summary: Cast Iron Cookwarereview/text: I have used cast Iron pan for years. Once you know how to use it you will always select it first over other pan.My friend in the last 30 years has gone through at least 30 high end Teflon and ceramic pans. I am still using mine from back then. Its not just the longevity but even the food cooks better in cast iron with full rich flavors.Use peanut oil it has the highest flash point of all oils and imparts a nutty flavor to the food. Olive oil is good for salads but for cooking it has a much lower flash point and will turn to cholesterol very fast when cooking with it.Also remember the utensils remain very hot even after you turn off the flames and the food will continue to cook.Sizzler and waffles are a different game altogether so if you are into cast iron the first time start with the pans.Cast iron utensils have to be hand washed never never never put them in the dish washer. Do not leave them soaking in the sink or on wet counter as they will rust. If you get food stuck to the pan instead of scrapping it, put water in it and bring it to a boil. This will loosen up any stuck food to the sides and the bottom. It will clean off easy. Clean rusted utensil well and go through seasoning cycle twice.Start cooking at medium flame it raises the temp above 450 degrees F which kill any and all surface germs and creates a new Teflon type layer. No worries with Teflon cancer. Follow the seasoning instructions to the "T".I have two pans, waffle maker, sizzler dishes, One two quart pan for deep frying and this new combo dutch cooker.Hope that helps.
