review/summary: Great briefs for cool comfort!review/text: These are great underwear for traveling light because they dry quickly after washing. I was able to pack just three pair for a two week trip to Europe. Wash at night...ready in the morning (probably sooner but I was sleeping. :-) I find myself using them for daily use as well because they are just that comfortable. I will say they run big though. I purchased size medium (I'm 6' tall 170 lbs), and I have to roll the waistband down a couple times; otherwise, they'd come up over my belly button. Perhaps, I just like low rise garments. Regardless, they perform as described. I'm not sure I'd be able to wear these for several days without washing like some reviewers state (trust me...they'd be funky), but if I had to I'd choose these over cotton briefs any day!
