review/summary: Great Rack!review/text: I bought this for my hybrid bicycle. It works like a charm everytime! It's very easy to mount. The only downside is that you have to be great at tying knots because it kind of relies on you to secure everything in place. That's the reason I gave it 4 stars; the first month I used it I was paranoid the whole time that the bike was going to fly off the back! But overall, it's a wonderful product and I would recommend it. It's a great value for the price!
