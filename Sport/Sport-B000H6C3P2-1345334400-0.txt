review/summary: Best FIRST upgrade for an AR.review/text: This is an awesome upgrade for your AR. It actually seems as if it absorbs some recoil too. On 100 degree days where sweaty palms are a given, there is never an issue with slippage or loosing my grip and having to readjust. Installs in literally about 3min. Feels as if it were made for my large hands.
