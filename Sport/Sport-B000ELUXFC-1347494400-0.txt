review/summary: Fantastic Bike Rackreview/text: Fantastic bike rack! Purchased it to take a 30+ pound Fuji bike from Michigan to California, and then used it to take 2 Trek road bikes from California to Georgia (by way of Oregon). Rack was used on a Honda Civic and Subaru Outback.Through 40+ mph winds in Wyoming, the rains of the pacific northwest, and 16 days of driving (5-9 hours a day) across the US at 65-75 mph, the most significant problem I experienced was having to slightly re-tighten the straps (a 30 second procedure) when stopping for gas, especially rough roads and high winds.Being sure to mount it correctly and securing the straps well, I have never had a problem with this rack. I was worried buying such a relatively cheap rack to take my bike(s) back and forth across the country, but it has proved itself to be very clearly up to the task.
