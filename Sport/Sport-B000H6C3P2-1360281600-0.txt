review/summary: Nice AR-15 Gripreview/text: The grip arrived quickly and as pictured and described. I use it on my S&W M&P 15-22 and it bolted up perfectly, and makes gripping the weapon much more comfortable. When changing out your grips, make sure you account for the springs between the grip and the weapon base (they could easily be lost). There are videos on YouTube for most weapons to help you when changing your grips. I recommend this grip for functionality and ease of installation.
