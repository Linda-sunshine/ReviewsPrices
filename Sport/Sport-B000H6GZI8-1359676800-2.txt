review/summary: I thought maybe it could stretch a little...review/text: I tryed putting this on a Hi-Point C9 given the crappy ergonomics of the gun. I was sliding it up the handle and then the grip gave out on me and torn right down the middle. I don't know, seems like it would help if the description was more informative, maybe give a sizing chart or an idea of what would fit your gun. I know the handle is not as long as most guns so I got this one, I don't think it's that much wider though. I feel like I wasted $8.
