review/summary: Good Workout but Expensive Diet Planreview/text: Wow, great workout! My muscles get sore just looking at it. My only grudge is that they really pressure you in to buying their p90x protein bars, shakes, etc which can get very expensive. I wish their nutrition plan did not include the expensive p90x supplements mixed in to its published schedule. Other than that, the workout is very good/intense and you can still get great results without buying all the p90x supplements.
