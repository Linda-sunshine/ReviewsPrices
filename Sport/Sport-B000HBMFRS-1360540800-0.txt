review/summary: terrible air mattress seems great for about one monthreview/text: Bought this air mattress and thought finally an air mattress that might not leak, or deflate while I am sleeping on it.Well, that was wishful thinking, however it doesn't leak or deflate it is worse than that. Approximately two or three months later I was sitting on the mattress and I heard a loud pop, seems the air in the mattress moved to on side of the mattress and now it has a mountain on one side and a perfectly flat area on the other side it looks like there is a three hundred pound thing sleeping on one side of the mattress absolutely even and comfortable. The opposite side of the mattress is inflated more than twice the height.I deflated the mattress and inflated it again but this had no effect I could not do anything to the mattress to pump air into it providing an even surface. Total waste of money and I will never purchase an Intex product again as long as I am living.Unsatisfied disappointed customer
