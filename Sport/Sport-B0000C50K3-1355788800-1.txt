review/summary: Hoppe's BoreSnake for .22 cal rimfire riflereview/text: A friend recommended these products to me, and I have to say he was absolutely right. I use this on my Remington Model 597 plinker rifle and it just takes a few pulls with some oil and solvent to keep the bore sparkling clean and deposit free between firings. I would recommend giving the bore a good scrubbing with a soft metal wire cleaning tool first, as the bristles on this aren't as densely placed. You don't have to do this, but it reduces the number of pulls through the bore you'll need to clean the firearm. I gave this model a 4/5 only because the fit is very snug for a .22 cal bore. It feels like I have to put a lot more tension to draw this through the bore than I do for any other BoreSnake I own. It may perhaps be better suited for .223/5.56 bores.
