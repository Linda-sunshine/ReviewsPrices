review/summary: Pants run very smallreview/text: I purchased these sweatpants because they are my staple clothes while walking the dog and running errands. I have owned numerous pair of this brand and size. However, when I received these sweatpants, they were extremely tight and much thicker than the Russell 2XL pants I have purchased in the past. While it is nice in the cold weather to have thicker sweatpants, these are very tight. I would not buy these again.
