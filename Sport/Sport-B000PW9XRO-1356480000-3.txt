review/summary: Very Nicereview/text: Received these as a gift, haven't worn them much yet so this is a "first impressions" review.Size XXL is still a little too tight, but I expect there will be some "breaking in". Even tight, they're quite comfortable.Neither my iPhone or my (job provided) Blackberry touchscreen respond to them.It doesn't get really cold in StLouis, and so far not cold enough to wear them for an extended period of time - They're too warm!Grip is excellent, even on wet objects.All in all, wonderful.
