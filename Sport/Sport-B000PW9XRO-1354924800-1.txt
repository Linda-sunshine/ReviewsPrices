review/summary: Great gloves, buy a larger sizereview/text: Really nice gloves for outdoor or shooting use in the winter. I normally use X-Large gloves but while I could wear them, they were a little tight. So I ordered the XX-Large to give me a little more room and gave the X-Large pair to my daughter who is in law enforcement. If you are a shooter, these gloves pretty well with a pistol and allow you to hold the pistol tightly and feel the trigger but have a tendency to get caught in the trigger guard. Cost of the gloves from Amazon is in line with or cheaper than normal driving gloves.
