review/summary: This is my third one, so no surprises for me.review/text: So, what happened to the first two? Confiscated by the TSA morons who think I can hijack an airliner with a finger-nail file :(And, yes, having the second one confiscated the same way the first one was confiscated does indeed make me an idiot for keeping this nifty gadget on my key-ring while boarding an aircraft. Maybe I'll remember next time...?
