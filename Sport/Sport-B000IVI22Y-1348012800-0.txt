review/summary: Great productreview/text: I love this water bottle! Since getting pregnant, I've needed to increase my water intake and this bottle has made it so easy. I carry it with me everywhere; it easily fits in most purses and keep me hydrated at all times. The straw is a wonderful feature that prevents spills when drinking in odd positions or on the move.
