review/summary: Reliable productreview/text: I have used the Omron pedometer for a number of years and think it is an excellent product. The fact that the buttons are recessed prevents them from being pushed accidentally. I purchased this one as a gift. Since the current product description did not indicate that it came with a safety leash, I purchased a safety leash, which I would not have done had the description been complete. However, the clamp on the purchased leash is made of metal and should not break as the plastic clamp that comes with the pedometer tends to do. I was able to easily replace the clamp that came with the pedometer with a small metal clamp from the stationary store, but the safety leash with the metal clamp should be more satisfactory.
