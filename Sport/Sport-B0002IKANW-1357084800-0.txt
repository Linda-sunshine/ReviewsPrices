review/summary: Satisfied Customerreview/text: I would/will buy these again.What I Like: The rubber (or rubber-like) primer seems very durable. After repeated firings it is very difficult to discern any wear on the 'primer.'What I Don't: Maybe it's my Glock but the extractor always dings the snap cap rim. That said, I don't really mind because I expect the snap cap to protect the firearm, not the other way around!
