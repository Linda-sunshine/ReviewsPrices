review/summary: Comfyreview/text: I bought several pairs of boxers recently. A pair of Champion underwear, 3 types of Calvin's and these. I just re ordered three more pairs of these. They are a tad pricey but they are the most comfortable of the bunch. The original pair seem to be holding up nicely. I recommend these. p.s they seem to run a little large. Medium worked perfect on me and I am 6'2 206 with a 35 inch waist.
