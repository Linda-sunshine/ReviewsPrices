review/summary: Worth the moneyreview/text: At the price I payed for this watch I feel as if it was worth it. The watch feels a little cheap in your hand. The band is somewhat flimsy and the crown feels lower quality. Watch works well and is very aesthetically pleasing. The crystal on the front is very nice and the automatic movement works flawlessly. I would recommend this to a friend.
