review/summary: Good mat for yogareview/text: I was looking far and wide for a decently priced mat that would work for me in power yoga. This was the answer! My yoga class is set at 85 degrees, and I spend the entire class sweating. The first month I used it, there was a little slippage, but nothing too crazy. After 2 months, it is still holding together but I've noticed it doesn't grip as well lately. I bought the Organic Yoga and Exercise Mat Cleaner by Vermont Soap Organics on Amazon too, to clean my mat after every session. It works great with this mat. Highly recommended!
