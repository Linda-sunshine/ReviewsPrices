review/summary: Best boxers I've foundreview/text: These are easily the most comfortable boxers I've ever worn, including all cotton, cotton/rayon and silk.Easy to wash. Quick to dry.A lot of the reviews mention how well these boxers travel. While that's true, I think they're perfect for everyday wear as well. Obviously, wearing them every day will cause them to wear out faster but I can live with that.Well worth the expense over cotton and a better value than silk, so as my cotton and silk boxers wear out I'll replace them with these.Looks like I'll be an ExOfficio customer for life.
