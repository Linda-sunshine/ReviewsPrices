review/summary: Very good watchreview/text: This watch looks great. So far hasn't lost Any time. Gets a lot of looks. Can be mistaken for the Rolex Submarina. Same sweeping second hand. Don't know about the bad reviews I read before, because the gold plating is on point. Blue color is a little darker but looks great. So far great watch for the low price.
