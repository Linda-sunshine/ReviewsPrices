review/summary: Very good but dont trust the sealant to keep out rust before you oil it though...review/text: This is a small complaint that wont matter much to most, but when I got mine, which I was going to use on my BBQ, I put it in the garage waiting for better weather. The package got a bit damp, and I thought, no problem, they are factory pre seasoned, right? Well they got a big rust ring on the bottom from being in a damp package for a week. I cleanred and seasoned them, so now they work fine, but1) you will need to season them2) you should do so right away. Dont store them unseasoned.
