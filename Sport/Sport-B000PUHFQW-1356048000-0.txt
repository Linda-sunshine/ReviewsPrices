review/summary: Nice and thickreview/text: Mmmmm, yeah well, this is a nice thick yoga mat. High quality...I just leave it on my floor as an all-purpose work-out area, desk mat, area rug lol. I don't know how it would work as a Yoga mat but I've purchased many over the years (I sleep on them sometimes) and this one is great!
