review/summary: Needs some tweaking, but nice!review/text: Beretta Nano required a little snipping off of the bottom. I then read the reviewer who turned the grip upside down. My grip went from acceptable to perfect. The grip is firm and doesn't really add any bulk. I am glad I got it, makes a HUGE difference. I noticed the Nano hurt the hand a little after a day at the range, this fixed that.
