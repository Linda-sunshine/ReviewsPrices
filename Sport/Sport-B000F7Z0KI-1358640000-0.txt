review/summary: Disappointingreview/text: Purchased 2 of these insulated bottles in different colors. Works aesthetically but fails functionally. The patterns are attractive, and the shape allows for easy grasping which even my toddler can manage. However, I've filled with ice and cold water expecting to have even COOL water after a couple of hours later...not so, water becomes lukewarm after an hour or so. I've filled with water and frozen, and the "keep time" is only marginally better. Perhaps my expectations were too high based on other reviews.
