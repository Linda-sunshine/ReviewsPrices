review/summary: Second chair ordered ball too smallreview/text: I ordered a blue ball chair from Amazon it is perfect . the ball is correct. I ordered a second one in green for my second daughter. The ball is still from Gaiam and it is green but it is tiny! It is so small it doesn't fill the base she is so low to the ground it will not work at her desk! How can a company fill the order with tow totally different products. One correct and one wrong. we are totally disappointed!
