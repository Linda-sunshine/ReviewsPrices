review/summary: Great tool for gun cleaning!review/text: Does a fine job and once one learns to lube the first foot of the tube as it enters the barrel with WD40 or similar rust preventive/lube. The barrel is clean with two passes and none of the garbage ends up in the breech area. I stand on the slug end after passing through the barrel and lift the gun away from my foot. Works very well!
