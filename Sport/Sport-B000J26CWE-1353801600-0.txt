review/summary: Too thick, too long, and bad material.review/text: I've been wearing toe socks now for over 20 years. I started wearing them as inner socks to prevent the fungus when I had to wear boots 13 to 20 hours a day. Before the barefoot running craze started I used to get them from a Korean friend who had his mother bring them from Korea. Then I had to order them from overseas or from Canada. My running days are behind me now but I still wear them and like them a lot.Too thick - I had no idea what they meant when the label mean "Original Weight" but I found out that it meant that these socks are around twice as thick as I'm used to. That's not really a problem when using them for the original purpose as inner socks but they are a problem for me when I use them with my Vibrams. I'm still able to wear them (since I paid $12.00 a pair for them) but all that material means that wearing my Vibrams is not as nice as I would like.Too long - There is too much material on the pinkie toe for me. All that material just hangs off the end. This is the first time this has ever happened to me. Again, not a problem with boots and regular shoes but a problem with the toe shoes.Bad material - The material on these socks started to pill after the first wash BEFORE BEING WORN. Its only gotten worse and now I've got a bunch of furry looking toe socks except that the fur are little bitty balls of material.I've been wearing these for seven months now. This has really been a bad purchase for me. This is the most I've ever paid for toe socks and this is the worst experience I've ever had with them. I really don't mind paying the price for premium products. The brand may be, but this is not a premium product. These are really not bad socks if they were half the price, but at this price these are bad socks.
