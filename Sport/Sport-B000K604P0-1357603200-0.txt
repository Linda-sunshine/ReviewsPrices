review/summary: Well Builtreview/text: This is the best design for a fully insulated coffee cup I've ever come across. It's very durable, keeps liquids cool or hot for hours and the swivel top makes it easy to take a sip instantly. A locking latch keeps the top from accidentally opening. No leaks occur when you hold it upside down. Incredible.
