review/summary: great bar end mirrorreview/text: Rec. today 1 day shipping !!!!!!!!!!!! and it is Great, easy to install. Very sturdy assembly, mirror is a very good size and you can see everything behind you, and on the side of you just great. Well worth the money! I installed this on a 1989 Trek mnt bike which has been set up with 5.25" rise handlebars and a noseless seat for street use.
