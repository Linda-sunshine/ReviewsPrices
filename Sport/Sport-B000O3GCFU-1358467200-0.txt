review/summary: Works as stated and then some!review/text: A more current review for anyone considering this item, as based on some of the previous reviews, I was hesitant to purchase and had guarded expectations, but we would have missed out on a great prdouct! I bought this last month for my daughter and so far, it has performed great, as it is supposed to. For warm foods, I do pre-warm it with, not even boiling but very hot water, for a about 10 minutes, then put the food (usually soup but have done, e.g., potstickers, too) in directly off the heat, and she says she would call it not just warm, but actually still "hot", when she eats it anywhere from 4 to 4.5 hours later. I therefore expect that it would stay at least a bit warm for an additional hour or more. So maybe actually beware if you have a really little one to let food cool before putting it in, since it may be too hot when they go to eat :) Another great thing about it and good thing for parents to know. . . you can close this tight enough to not leak without having to screw it super tight, so that young hands can get it open independently. In other words, adults would be tempted to twist it at least a half turn more to feel like it is closed "all the way", but this is not necessary to prevent leaking, and it would be too tight for most kids under 10 or 12 to get it open by themselves. And yes, I tested it first, both the leak factor and how tight it could be and my 7-year old still able to get it open by herself. I recommend this product, for kids and adults; worst case, at this price here online, at least try it and see for yourself. You will pay anywhere from $10 to $18 more buying it in a store. Enjoy!
