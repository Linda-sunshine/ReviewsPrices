review/summary: Gets The Job Donereview/text: Snug on the ears but comfortable. Works well with glasses. Muffles EVERYTHING, even conversation. If you're taking a shooting class or socializing at the range, consider a pair of electronic ear muffs (the ones with the noise-cancelling microphones built in).
