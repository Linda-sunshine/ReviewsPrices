review/summary: Replacement for the cheap failures...review/text: I got this bottle instead of stocking up on another half dozen cheap bottles from the local mega-mart. I think I have made a sound investment! My coworker originally suggested this particular product, and being familiar with the brand I thought I would give it a go.I did read much of the negative feedback on here, and this is what I have to say to anyone getting hung up on it. You need to see this as a regularly used food container. You wouldn't leave a glass on the side of the sink for weeks unwashed, even if it was just a water glass, and you certainly don't want to do that with a bottle that possibly goes everywhere with you. I read that mold was an issue inside the bite-valve, as it will be in any unwashed part of any waterbottle. Right inside the label, Camelbak states that you need to pull the valve apart and clean it properly. I wish more people would care to read the care instructions before throwing something away and blaming the makers. Then again, I got the grey bottle and the bite-valve is clear, so I imagine something like that would be easier to spot, or harder in a darker color.In the 750ml bottle, the straw does not go all the way to the bottom, but sits just above the depression in the base of the bottle. I would think this to to not cause suction issues. Nothing stops you from taking off the lid to finish off the last bit. The straw also works just fine without the bite-valve if you are so inclined. There is also an air valve in the top of the bottle to allow displacement of the internal liquid.Overall, quite pleased with this bottle and looking forward to using it more often.
