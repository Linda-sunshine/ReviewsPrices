review/summary: Powerful LED tail light BUT Powerless instructionsreview/text: The light is great, the flash mode is good and I am sure it would make me visible from a mile away as the product attributes claim (haven't had the opportunity to really use it till now). What I don't understand is when manufacturers do these annoying things such as write warnings all over the box and use up all the space but not make ONE mention of how to put the batteries in the unit. I literally had to go on youtube to figure out how to get this thing to work. There was NO mention either on the unit or on the box as to how to open it and get it to run.Once youtube helped me out, I was able to switch it on and the light looked great. Also, apart from a couple rudimentary and vague images of WHERE to install the light on your bike there still isn't enough clearly written instructions on HOW to do so.Sort of happy with the light, not happy with the lack of clear instructions. They should realize that not every one works in a bike store dealing with these units everyday. So to someone who is new to the biking world, some instructions would greatly help.
