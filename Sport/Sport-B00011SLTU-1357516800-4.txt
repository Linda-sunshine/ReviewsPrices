review/summary: This is a false advertisement. Don't buy!review/text: The product features states that:Contains six stainless-steel toolsTools include knife blade, scissors, nail file with screwdriver tip, toothpick, and tweezersIncludes key ringBut when the shippment arrived, I only received the pocket knife; no tweezers, toothpick and key ring. Amazon sent me an replacement. But I received the exact same thing. What a joke! I was told they're going to investigate on this, and it'll take 7-10 business days. I'll update this after I hear from them. Don't buy now unless you want to pay for something you are not going to receive. By the way, it's a cute knife.
