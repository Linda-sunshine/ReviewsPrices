review/summary: Solid, Nice Optionsreview/text: Just about everyone I know uses the Serpa. It is well constructed, and mates perfectly to my Sig 2022 9MM. The release is smooth, and I actually found the resistance almost perfect straight out of the box. Additionally, there are a number of nice carry options included. Belt or paddle, it gives you a range of fits with the included hard wear. Definitely worth the price over nylon holsters.The only thing worth noting would be that there is no flexibility in your Tac layout. You will have to abandoned this holster if you ever add anything to the picatinny rails. I wish someone would release an easy to use modular holster similar to the Serpa, but that isn't so much of a criticism as a consideration for someone with a Taclight or laser.
