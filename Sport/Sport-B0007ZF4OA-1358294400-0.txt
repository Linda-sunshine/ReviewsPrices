review/summary: This is more like itreview/text: I used to use the Grabbers but the last 10 bag didn't get very warm. Open these up, let them sit for 20 minutes and throw them in your pocket, useful warmth in another 20 minutes, leave them in the pocket and toasty warm at 4-6 hours. Last 7-10 hours. And this is a bargain. Usually pay about a buck a pair. Work the best in a pocket, you can wrap your hands around them in the pocket, you can pull them out and warm your face and put them back. I use them when temps are in the 30's.
