review/summary: Add mine to the failed after 2 months pilereview/text: I bought this to help with my cycling fitness rides by giving me the heart rate data I wanted easily. Namely the average heart rate for the session and the max heart rate I hit. The unit is a snap to use and the display is fine.Strap on the monitor, wet it a little with some water and off I went. The watch paired with the sensor almost immediately.It worked well for nearly two months.Unfortunately like so many others here the unit has stopped working properly. I get a HR for the first few minutes, after a very long pairing time and then the rate just keeps on dropping during the session. Very disappointing.I am doing nothing different. I tried changing the battery to the sensor but same result.Not sure what my next move is but I can not recommend this unit base on this two month trial.
