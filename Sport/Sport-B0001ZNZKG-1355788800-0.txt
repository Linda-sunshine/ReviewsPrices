review/summary: Very nice fit, kinda itchyreview/text: great boxers, these feel especially right in dress pants for some reason, and they fit great and feel great in dress pants. but for some reason whenever i wear these drawers with jeans they make the upper part of the thigh itch really bad, im not sure if its just me or not, but otherwise these are great
