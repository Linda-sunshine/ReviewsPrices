review/summary: Cast Iron Cookwarereview/text: You won't be disappointed with this two piece cast iron combo cooker. You can fry chicken in the larger pot and bake cornbread in the smaller pot/lid. It's very functional and easy to clean and the upkeep is minimal. I washed it and then apply cooking oil to protect the seasoning. I JUST LOVE IT!
