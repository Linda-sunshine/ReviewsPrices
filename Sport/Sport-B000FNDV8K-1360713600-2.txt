review/summary: A Long Time Good Friendreview/text: I have had this knife for about 30 plus years on my key chain. It has taken a beating and cut many things, It even cut a seat belt off of a person who had a car crash and the seat belt was stuck so I ran back and got my trusty little knife and cut the women out of the seat belt. I have just gotten my knife back from victorinox swiss army because it needed repairs it needed new side's and tooth pick and a tweezers they fixed it for around $5.00. So now my little blue knife is all new again and ready to open into action again by cutting a news paper ad or a picture or a seat belt and my finger hang nails.
