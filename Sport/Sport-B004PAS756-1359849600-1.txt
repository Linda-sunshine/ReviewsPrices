review/summary: A little too fastreview/text: I recently completed the P90x and Brazil Butt Lift programs and was looking for something with a little more cardio. Since I have knee issues I decided to try this first instead of purchase the complete program. I'm so glad I did because I was really disappointed. The workout I think would be amazing if it were just a little slower or he went over the moves slowly once before picking up the pace. I had such a difficult time keeping up which made me frustrated and feeling like I wasn't getting the full benefits of the workout. After about ten minutes I stopped the DVD and put in something else.
