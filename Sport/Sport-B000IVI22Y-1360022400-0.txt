review/summary: My favorite kind of water bottlereview/text: As a fitness instructor, I have tried many different kinds of water bottles. This one by far is my favorite. The bite valve makes it spill proof. A note of caution, however - leaving them in your car on a hot day can cause the bottle to warp so that the lid doesn't seal correctly causing to no longer be spill proof. Also, you need to periodically clean the bite valve, or it will grow mildew. Replacement valves are available, however, and are very easy to put on.
