review/summary: Best pair of boxer shorts everreview/text: These boxers do everything the other reviews talk about and more. They keep your nether-regions cool and dry, they resist odor amazingly well and you really can wash them in the sink at night, hang them to dry overnight and wear them as a fresh pair of underwear the next day. I am beyond impressed with these and will definitely be buying another pair or 2 of these. They are worth every penny
