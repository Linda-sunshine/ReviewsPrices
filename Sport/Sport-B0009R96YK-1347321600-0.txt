review/summary: This is a great value/quality mirrorreview/text: For Bikes that don't have drop bars, this is the best mirror. I have had about 6 mirrors over the years and this one stays put, but if tightened properly, allows you to adjust on the go. All those with bushings might not vibrate as much, but this one will not fall out on you. I have about 10 thousand miles on my bikes with this mirror and it never fell out. I can't say that about the previous mirrors I tried. Also, the vibration is minimal. At the time it does vibrate [high speed on a rough road], you still can see the car in view. To me that is all you need see. This is a great value/quality mirror
