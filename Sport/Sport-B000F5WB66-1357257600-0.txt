review/summary: Does what it says at good pricereview/text: This was a gift, but at Amazon's below $35 price, this is a good buy. It is easy to use and appears to be accurate. The chest strap is compatible with the machines at my gym, so I get a readout on the machine without having to hold on to the machine sensors or wear the watch.The drawbacks: No stop watch. It would have been so easy to include one in the design. I can't see why Timex did not. Does not fit tiny people well. My chest below the breasts is about 27 inches and this occationally slips when I'm working out hard.
