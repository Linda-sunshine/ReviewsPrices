review/summary: My husband really likes itreview/text: When I gave this to my husband for Christmas last year, he loved it. In fact, he called it his girlfriend. haha There are two drawbacks, though. If it is not upright, it leaks, And when you drink out of it, it can sometimes sound like a flock of birds or a gerbil on a loud wheel, As long as you do not mind that, it is awesome.
