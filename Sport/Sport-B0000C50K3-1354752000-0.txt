review/summary: Hoppe's 24011 Boresnake .22 calreview/text: I purchased this boresnake for my 5.56 AR-15 to clean and lube the barrel bore. This is a very good way to clean and oil the bore of any .22 cal rifle. I highly recommend the Hoppe's Boresnake to anyone that prides themselves with a well cleaned and oiled firearm. Very easy to use, just drop the leader into the breach, drop down and out of the muzzle, and pull the boresnake out of the muzzle.
