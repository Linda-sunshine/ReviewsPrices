review/summary: Nice little knife. (Shamrock)review/text: Purchased for my wife, she and I like it. We've had a couple of these in the past, and they hold up well. Our biggest problem is losing them, due to size. Pocketable, purse-able, keychain-able, they can go almost everywhere. And they are handy to have for all sorts of small work. Victorinox quality holds up, and will last forever, or until you lose it somewhere.
