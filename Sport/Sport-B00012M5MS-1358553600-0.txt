review/summary: Schwinn Helmetreview/text: Just got this helmet the other day. I figured I'd get it despite the bad reviews or photos of the shell falling off...well, surprise, when it came it the side panels were off and the top part was able to come off with the push of a finger. Now I know all that part is just a shell for look, but if it comes off that easy, I'm not going to rely on it to protect my head if need be. Going to spend the extra $15 to get a better one.
