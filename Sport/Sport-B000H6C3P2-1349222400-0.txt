review/summary: Get this grip!review/text: I don't care what rifle you have, if it fits a pistol grip like this, get it. It's leaps and bounds better than my stock grip on the SW M&P, it's very comfortable, it's perfect! Spread the word about Hogue, I heard about them from Reddit and I couldn't be happier that I did!
