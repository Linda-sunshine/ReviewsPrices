review/summary: Sizing information wasn't accurate enoughreview/text: Original quality product received, however I followed the advice and bought a US size 11 which is normally a euro size 10.5 (as I take a 10-10.5, this was the size I needed). Converse say to buy a half size smaller than you need, but it would be too risky to do that and have too tight a shoe, so I bought the size I needed. 10.5 wasn't a listed size option anyhow.The label in the shoe says they are US 11 and UK 11. Go figure - doesn't make sense. So they are a half size too big. If only they told you that information somewhere up front.
