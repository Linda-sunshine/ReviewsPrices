review/summary: Expensive, but worth itreview/text: So, these will most likely quickly become the most expensive boxers you own, but they're well worth the price. They're light, good material, dry quickly, and great for traveling. They're also durable. I own 3 pairs, and have had them for about 5 years now. The elastic hasn't work out and there's no tears or anything like that. If you travel a lot they're great, because you can was them in your sink and hang dry them. I traveled to a lot of 3rd world countries from 2007-2009, and these were essential at that point in life. They're still my favorite pair of boxers, even with out the travel.
