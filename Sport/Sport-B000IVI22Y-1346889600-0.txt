review/summary: Great water bottle for kidsreview/text: When I went to visit my two granddaughters I brought my camelbak water bottle with me. Once I arrived, I could never find my water bottle. One of the girls, ages 10 and 4 would have it by them or be filling it up with ice & water. I said, so you like gramma's water bottle, eh? I went on Amazon and purchased two: a .5 liter & and a .75 liter. They arrived in three days and my little girls have not put them down. The bottles are durable and perfect for kids. The girls are now happy to drink just "water" which makes their mom & dad very happy also.
