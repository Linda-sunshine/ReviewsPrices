review/summary: Nice fitting and looking helmet cheaply madereview/text: Helmet looks great fits well i love the back of the head adjustment.The bad: the plastic pieces on the outside of the helmet fell off when i took them out of the box. either the glue got hot or these are really old. I will take superglue and put them back on.overall good basic helmet
