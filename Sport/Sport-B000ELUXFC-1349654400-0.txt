review/summary: Good, cheap choicereview/text: Like previous reviewers have said, I found this bike rack to be easy to install and easy to use. It's lightweight and carries my woman's cruiser just fine.You can use it with a woman's bike, just do what they say in the instructions and turn one clasp upside down to hook onto the front as it hangs.As for extras, two bungee cords are enough to hold the wheels straight and keep it steady.A must have for anyone who wants a quality bike rack but doesn't have the money for one. :)
