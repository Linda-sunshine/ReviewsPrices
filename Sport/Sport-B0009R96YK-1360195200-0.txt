review/summary: Best mirror for the bikereview/text: Like many others, I have tried several different mirrors for my hybrid road bike. This is hands-down the best!! It gives a wide range of vision and is very stable. Putting it on my bike was very easy and I like the different ways it can be configured. I have had this on my bike for a month and have yet to adust, even while biking over rough pavement. Great mirror for the money.
