review/summary: Plan ahead! Can be reused!review/text: These are very nice and stay warm for a long time. However it takes a good amount of time for them to heat up, plan for 20 minutes or so. Also if you only need them for a few hours they really turn back off if they are put in a ziplock bag and the air is removed as much as possible. They usually last 2-3 days when I use them on cold mornings and then put them in a bag after a few hours.
