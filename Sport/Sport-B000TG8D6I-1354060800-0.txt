review/summary: Excellent!review/text: I love, love, love this product! I' ve had the set for over a year now. It took me some time to &#34;think&#34; myself into believing I could do the workouts. Started using it seriously about a month and a half ago. I have lost 10 pounds and went down two sizes. I can definetely tell that my strength and stamina have increased. The workouts are NOT easy! I am in my early 40's and had a hip replacement 4 years ago. Tony is very motivating and funny. I follow the workout plans as instructed and workout 6 days a week.
