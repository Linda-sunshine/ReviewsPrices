review/summary: very helpful in tracking my activitiesreview/text: This pedometer has helped me come up with my data accurately. As for the beginners like me in using this device, I recommend that you read the manual carefully or ask a friend to teach you to navigate your way around the pedometer. You would use it to a maximum if you know how to use it properly.As for the quality of this brand, it has been with me for 2 months now and it has been doing great - excellent even. It fits perfectly in my pocket; it's not too big; it's just the right size. And it accurately designates data; the steps that it counted were accurate.So far, I have loved this pedometer from the moment that I used it. I'm sure you will do too.
