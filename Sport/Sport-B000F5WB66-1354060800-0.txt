review/summary: Great price, great product... would recommend!review/text: I think this is a great product and well built. It doesn't have a lot of confusing features and it is very simple to use. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to monitor their heart rate while working out. It is a great price... much better than others which cost up to $200. I would never pay that much, in fact my last watch went out and I bought this one to replace it at a cheaper price and it has much better accuracy due to the chest band.The chest band is not bad, you will forget it is there after the first mile. A few times out, you will not even notice it.
