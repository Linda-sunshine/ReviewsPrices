review/summary: Comfortablereview/text: I bought this pillow to help me sleep on cross-country flights for work. It's a very comfortable pillow, so much so that I've taken to using it at hotels when the pillows leave something to be desired.If you are thinking about buying one of these and using it on flights, I might consider getting the small version. The medium is a bit wide for airplane seats and if im in the middle or aisle I often worry that the pillow is encroaching on my neighbors' space.
