review/summary: I love causing myself painreview/text: I've been doing P90X for a while now, and by that I mean, I put on the DVD, tweet that I'm doing it, and promptly turn it off. Does that count? On the serious side, it's great, as long as you can put up with the cheesy remarks made by the ripped dude, and the ambiguous sexual innuendo that seems to hide around every corner of the dumbbell.
