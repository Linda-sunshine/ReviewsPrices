review/summary: Not my first choicereview/text: It works, don't get me wrong, but it's just not very user friendly. It's a bit awkward to use at different angles and can easily put too much pressure on the tire stem--it actually ripped one of my tubes. I kept it because it's useful in a pinch, and because I was being too careless with it when I put a hole in my tube. But I definitely wouldn't recommend anyone purchase it.
