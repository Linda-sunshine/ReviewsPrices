review/summary: Great Socksreview/text: My Gold Toe socks are totally comfortable. They're bulky enough to provide good cushioning and protection but not so much that my feet are cramped in my shoes. I haven't worn them in the winter yet but I expect they'll be toasty warm. They're good-looking and I expect they will be quite durable.
