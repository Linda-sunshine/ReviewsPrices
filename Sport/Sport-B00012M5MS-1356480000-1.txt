review/summary: cheap bicycle helmetreview/text: Very poor quality helmet. Plastic trim pieces that were paper thin were not even stuck to the helmet and others were missing. This helmet is made out of foam and it is painted black, it would not take much to break this helmet, I wouldn't feel safe in it. I would look at purchasing other helmets on the market.
