review/summary: Worst customer repair service ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!review/text: Purchased this watch in July and the second hand fell of in October. Returned it to Invicta in October and after repeated request was informed today(1/23/13) that the watch will be repaired and ship by 4/11/13. Almost 7 months for the repair to be completed.unbelievable.
