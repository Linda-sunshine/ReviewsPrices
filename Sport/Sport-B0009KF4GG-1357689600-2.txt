review/summary: Quality productreview/text: This product looks like a quality product and it's nice addition to a survival kit--whether it's for practical reasons or some kind of apocalypse survival hobby. I tried many of the mini-tools and they worked well enough. It's hard to go wrong with a Swiss Army Knife. I don't need to explain further because it's all common sense. I highly recommend this.
