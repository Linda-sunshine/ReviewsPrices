review/summary: Awesome Bottlereview/text: Love this bottle. It may leak if you don't close it properly but other than that I have no major complaints.It's really durable and shows no damage no matter how much I throw it around. Also, it's perfect for working out on the treadmill or the elliptical with out spilling water all over the place. However, if your teeth are sensitive you may not like drinking cold liquids out of this bottle because of the bite valve.
