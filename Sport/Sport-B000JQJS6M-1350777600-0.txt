review/summary: Pro Diverreview/text: This is the 3RD time I've purchased this same watch.Reason being is that over time the gold plate wears off the bracelet or I get a deep scratch in the crystal of the watch face.However I like the blue dial, price is great, and it angers all the guys that wear Rolex Submariners when I tell them it's not the same watch.I own a Rolex, a Concord, and a Cartier, but I really love the look and feel of the Invicta ProDiver.It is my everyday watch.
