review/summary: Great travel/camping pillowreview/text: I bought this pillow specifically for my 14 year old son who was going on a week long trip to Philmont with his Boy Scout troop. He was happy with the pillow, it took up very little space & was comfortable. I'd give it a 5 star rating, except that when it came home, the pillow case is covered with those little &#34;pills&#34;. Maybe that's to be expected after a week of being shoved in a backpack, but I wouldn't expect it to be like that so soon. It doesn't bother him, but I wouldn't be able to sleep on it.
