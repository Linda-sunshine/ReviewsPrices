review/summary: Cheap, reliable and lastingreview/text: I have moved to three different countries in the last 4 years, every time I bought a bike and the accessories to go with it (yes I could have kept the lights but it seems overcrowding at the time..50 pounds per luggage you know!)I always buy this one, it's cheap, very reliable and it lasts a long time. I always use it in Flashing mode (I believe it has 2 or 3 modes, one being solid the other flashing and the 3rd...I can't remember) so it saves the battery I guess but I use my bike everyday and don't need to replace the battery often.Visibility is good and that's what matters.
