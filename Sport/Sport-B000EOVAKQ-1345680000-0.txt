review/summary: Love them pre-poolreview/text: OK, it's probably silly to post about goggles I've not yet worn in the pool. But I'm super excited about these googles. I tried them on and they suction securely to the face. I can all but guarantee no water will be getting in. And strangely, they look really good. Can't wait to wear them at the pool. Very sytlish. I'll post more once I give them an actual try under water, lol!
