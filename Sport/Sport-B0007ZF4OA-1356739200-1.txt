review/summary: Great productreview/text: We use these to keep our hands warm on the &#34;early morning&#34; tee times in the winter when the temps are low. Provide plenty of warmth to finish a round of golf and then some. Will continue to buy in bulk as it is much less expensive than buying these individually from a golf store.
