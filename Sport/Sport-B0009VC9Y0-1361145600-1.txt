review/summary: Meh..review/text: Good: Very sharp out of the box, slender, very light. Bad: Blade seems too heavy for the assist spring to properly open to lock 100% of time, adjusting the pivot to make opening easier made lock up too loose. Blade heavily favors one side when closed, scrapes against inside of frame opposite the liner lock.
