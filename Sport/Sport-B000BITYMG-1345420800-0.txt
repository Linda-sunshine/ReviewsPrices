review/summary: Pleased with the productreview/text: Delivery was fast considering the order traveled across the country. Order was placed 8/11 and delivered 8/18 via USPO. The price was very reasonable. This safety clasp, being metal, replaced a broken plastic one that came with my 2 years old Omron GOSmart pedometer. The safety leash appears to be well made and should last much longer than 2 years.
