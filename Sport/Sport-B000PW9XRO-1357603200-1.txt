review/summary: All Weather Shooting/Duty Glovereview/text: I was kind of hesitant on these as I didnt really find any good reviews that gave me enough info about them until I went to a mil/law forum and got the info I was looking for. They are &#34;all-weather&#34; and just by wearing these for a while I will agree with the fact (it is winter in Michigan after all) because they were pretty warm but with how warm they are, I dont feel they will be practical enough in the warmer months. Again, its winter here in michigan, so time will tell how they are come spring/summer.Aside from that, they fit well (I got size L) and do well when I am shooting and/or using my hunting knife.
