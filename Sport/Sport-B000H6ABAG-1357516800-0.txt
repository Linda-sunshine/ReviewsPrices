review/summary: Too largereview/text: Not Russell's fault but all reviewers said to get one size larger than you usually wuold, as they are too small otherwise.I usually take a &#34;large&#34; but on recommendation got an XL. Well the XL was too large, and trying to hold them up with the draw string caused the string to break in a couple of days. Also the material quickly started to &#34;pill,&#34; so I would not buy them again in a large. I was tempted to get a large as I liked the elastic cuff & the material is nice and thick, but the pilling killed that notion. Sorry Russell ....
