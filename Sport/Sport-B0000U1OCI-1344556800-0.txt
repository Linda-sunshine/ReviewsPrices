review/summary: No Battery Includedreview/text: I recently purchased an Omron HJ-112 pedometer which I received. On the Omron box it states that a lithium battery is included. It also stated a lithium battery is included on the Amazon website. When I opened the packaging to set the pedometer, there was no battery. I called Omron to complain and was told by their customer service rep that sometimes Amazon re-packages some of their products and they had been getting a lot of complaints about no battery included. Omron customer service also stated that it was "only a short-term battery anyway". I disagree with Amazon re-packaging because the plastic packaging looked very authentic--Omron packaging. So now I have to wait until I get a battery to try the pedometer which means if I don't like it, I lose x-amount of days I have to return the product. Obviously, I couldn't rate the pedometer without a battery.Just wanted to give everyone a heads up.
