review/summary: Comfortable sweat pantsreview/text: My sweats were beginning to get worse for the wear after well over a decade of use. They were black when I got them, and have since morphed into a dark grey via many, many washings.Are seeing the appearance of even more small holes in my sweats, I decided to buy a replacement pair. I've bought various Russell items before, so I was pretty sure that these would be just fine.They're comfortable and sized correctly. Even when it is warm outside, these sweats help keep you cool. Even before sweating, I noticed that these sweats seem to breathe very well and, if you do happen to sweat, to doesn't feel like it stays next to your skin.All in all I'm glad I bought these sweats and might even buy a second pair.
