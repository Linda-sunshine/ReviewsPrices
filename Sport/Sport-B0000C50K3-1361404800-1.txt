review/summary: Great cleanerreview/text: I really like the Hoppe's Boresnakes for cleaning my guns. I already had boresnakes for my shotguns and pistols but this one is for my 22 rifle. I expect it will do the same easy cleaning that is less messy and faster than any other cleaning method I've used. There are no rods to attack together, no tips to change, no box of pads to use and dispose of after, none of the drips on the floor or other hassles that happen with cleaning rods. You just drop in the brass weight and pull the rest of the snake through the barrel. You can add oil to the tail of the snake and reoil if you wish. The built in brass brush cleans and the rest of the snake polishes. It doesn't get easier.
