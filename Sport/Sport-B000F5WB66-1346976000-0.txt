review/summary: Satisfied - My first HRM purchasereview/text: I read many reviews on various low to high priced HRMs and settled on this one, not wanting to invest a whole lot since I'm inexperienced with using them. I'm happy with this HRM. It seems to work just fine and is not complicated to use. It does what I expected it to do. It saves info for one workout - avg heart rate, time of workout, and max heart rate. I then use an online calculator and enter my HRM information to get my calories burned (super easy). There are higher priced HRMs that will do this and more, but if you are a novice, this one does the job. The only downside is that the wristwatch piece is big, but it seems most HRMs are. Smaller styles are few and far between.
