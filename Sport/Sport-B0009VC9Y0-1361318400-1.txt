review/summary: Great knivesreview/text: These knives are so perfect, in my opinion. I think I've bought them as gifts for just about every male in my family now. The blade is literally razor sharp, and the point is like a needle. It's very solid, simple looking. I think everything about it, including the price, is all perfect. The only thing that I could see being improved would be the little safety switch, as others have noted. It's fun to play with. You will most likely end up cutting yourself at some point while playing with it, at least if you're experimenting the the thumb peg. You're much better off (as in safer) just forgetting about the thumb knob completely. The blade is so sharp that if your thumb touches it, which it will at some point, it will cut. Just use the little nub for your index finger to open it, which is much more fun anyway. It's the best knife I've every seen in my opinion, though I'm no expert.
