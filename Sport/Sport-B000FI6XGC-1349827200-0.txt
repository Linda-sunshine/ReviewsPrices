review/summary: Doesn't Workreview/text: Sad to say, this pump just would not fill my bike tires. It's a great size and weight and actually kind of cute, lol, but it won't attach to the Schrader valves on my bike tires. Very disappointing, I was really looking forward to having this on my bike rides. I have a small no name brand inexpensive portable pump that is many years old but works like a champ I keep with my Dutch bike. I will try the Lezine Pressure Drive Hand Pump sold on Amazon for my Hybrid. I would definitely not recommend this pump although some reviewers sure seem happy with it.
