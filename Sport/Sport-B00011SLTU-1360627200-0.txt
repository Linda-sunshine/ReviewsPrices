review/summary: nicereview/text: Great design, great value, it's so tiny you'll barely notice it on your keychain so it won't crowd your pockets like a larger knife. The actual knife is tiny but it works for opening packages, etc, and it's nice to have the scissors and screwdriver.My only gripe is that the scales (plastic casing) scratch quickly. Going to get the metal Alox model next time.
