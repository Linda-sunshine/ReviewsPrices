review/summary: Omron HJ-720ITFFP Pedometerreview/text: This is without a doubt the best and most accurate pedometer I have ever used. The U.S. Surgeon General and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommend every American get at least 10,000 steps a day to improve their health. The only way you can ensure you do so is to wear a pedometer to accurately count your daily steps. The Omron HJ-720ITFFP Pedometer not only counts your steps, it also allows you to track your steps along with aerobic steps, calories burned, fat calories burned, and distance walked with the software Omron provides.This pedometer allows you to take better control of your health.
