review/summary: best bday gift EVERreview/text: This is so sturdy and perfect for a 6 yr old! Now, 2 months later he still plays with it every day, which is longer than the bike made it! It folds so it isn't a hassle to keep by the door, and it's easy for a small guy to bring around and take to grandma's house :)
