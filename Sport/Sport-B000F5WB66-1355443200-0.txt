review/summary: Does't workreview/text: I have used a few different monitors over the years, mostly Polar. I was just looking for a basic monitor and thought I would give this a try. Problem is that it doesn't work. I even changed batteries on the transmitter in hoping that it was just a quality control problem. It's been moistened, massaged and rebooted. It will work periodically but the watch registers about half the heart rate that the exercise equipment monitor will register. Pretty worthless.
