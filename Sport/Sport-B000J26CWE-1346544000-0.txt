review/summary: corns on toesreview/text: I saw these socks on amazon and thought how slly they look.I read a review from a runner who said they were great. I decided to try some. Well I now have about 12 pair. I have always had corns between my toes that are very painful. since that first pair my feet feel better than ever.I never go anywhere without these on my feet.They can be a little hard to put on but worth the effort. I recommend to anyone with or without a problem.
