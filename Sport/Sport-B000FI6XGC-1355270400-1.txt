review/summary: Nice sturdy pump!review/text: Recommend this little pump as it is well made, aluminum shaft makes it a sturdy little number and comes with a bracket to secure to bike. I like the the fact it has a rubber cover for outlet, stops it clogging with mud/dirt. Also compatible with Shrader, Dunlop and Presta, easy to swap between these valve types if you have different bikes with different valve types. This is great as a portable (on bike) pump, would still recommend a larger stand type pump for at home. Well worth the money.
