review/summary: Do the trick!review/text: These warmers are great for cold weather - they stay warm for the time they claim to, and are very convenient to keep on hand for whenever you are going to be out in the cold for a long period of time. These should be a staple in any winter emergency kit to ward off frostbite if the electricity goes out, or in your car if you run out of gas or get caught in a blizzard.
