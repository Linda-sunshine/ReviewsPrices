review/summary: Works perfectlyreview/text: I have one of these in every caliber for each of my rifles. I use them for a rapid clean in the field or at the range. They will never replace a good cleaning at home, but they are great, they get a lot of gunk and residue out quickly and easily. After a few trips to the range they can get dirty, so wash them, or as I do, wear some gloves.
