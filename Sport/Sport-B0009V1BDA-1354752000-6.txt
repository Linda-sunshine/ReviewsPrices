review/summary: Great little grillreview/text: This is my second one. I won the first one a few years ago and was kind of skeptical, but fell in love with it. Since it's just me and the wife most of the time it's become our primary grill. Bought a hose at Lowes that converts it to use a 20 lb bottle, so no expensive little bottles.
