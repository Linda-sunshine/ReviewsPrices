review/summary: The whole packagereview/text: Full disclosure: this program is not easy.Fuller disclosure: this program is ridiculously difficult.Fullest disclosure: this program WILL WORK... as long as you commit to it.My one regret with P90X has nothing to do with the quality of the program -- the DVDs are fantastic, the program is insanely user-friendly and not intimidating in the least to someone with little to no strength training background. The one thing I regret is not seeing myself through to the end of it during my first run. Ninety days is a long time, and there WILL be times when you want to give up. Unfortunately, I allowed myself to, after five weeks. Yet, even after only five weeks, I have never felt so healthy and strong as I did when I was doing the program. I will be restarting on February 1!
