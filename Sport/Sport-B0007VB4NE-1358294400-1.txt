review/summary: Very Coolreview/text: I had seen these chairs in hospitals and doctors offices for several years and always thought they were a cool idea. But do they really work? I received mine from Amazon's Today's Deals. And it was a deal. I have been using the chair for a week now and it is really very cool. The first two days I some sore/stiffness in my back, especially between my shoulders. But now, I have adjusted to the seating and I believe my back is actually better.I weigh 129 and I have had a bad back since a college auto accident 40 years ago. This chair is helping me sit straight and use good posture while at the keyboard.One note: when you first receive the chair be patient. It will need air added several times the first few days!!
