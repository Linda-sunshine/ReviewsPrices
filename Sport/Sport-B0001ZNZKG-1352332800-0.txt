review/summary: Amazing underwearreview/text: The ExOfficio is an amazing piece of underwear! Now I can understand why people swear by this product. It is dead comfortable. I took it to Europe for a week's stay; and it was nice. Now I am really tell the difference against the normal cotton underwear that we usually have (the typical Hanes and FruitoftheLooms). I'm glad to have read through the many many reviews swearing by this product. It really is great as far as comfort, and dryness and support.The one complaint I would have --- which I don't think a lot of people notice ---- is that the fabric may be easily sheared. I wore this with jeans and sometimes the part of the underwear where the perineum is (between your balls and your hole) might rub against the jeans. I noticed on inspection that it can shear the fabric and the mesh can get ruined. I didn't like this because the underwear is expensive. That's the only negative of this underwear ... anything else about it is just great. And despite the negative, I would still agree to purchasing this underwear in the future.I also bought the Addidas Climalite Sports Performance boxer briefs (which are made of polyester 91%/spandex9%) --- compared to ExOfficio, this Addidas ones are crap .... I'd rather wear the normal cotton Hanes/FruitoftheLoom boxers. I will be returning the Addidas back to JCP. I bought 2 packages (total 4 pieces) and used only 1. Polyester is no good --- as I suspected. ExOfficio is made of nylon and lycra, I think.
