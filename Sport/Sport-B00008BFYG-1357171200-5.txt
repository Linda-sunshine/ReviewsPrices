review/summary: Greatreview/text: My nearly 3 yo wanted this from Santa, we chose this particular Razor as our 5 yo has one and they are so light but hard wearing. The 5 yo has had his a year now and even though used everyday, bashed about on kerbs, thrown down when stopped etc it still looks like new! I did have to order this from the US though as I couldnt get a red one anywhere in the UK but it actually worked out cheaper (postage incl!!). Service was great and very quick. Definately a fan of Razor and Amazon.com and would recommend!
