review/summary: Great program ... But be careful!review/text: This is a great home exercise program. Lots of variety. Easy to follow DVDs. You don't need a lot of expensive equipment. Good nutrition guide. Good support on Internet and with their App as well. And Tony Horton is definitely the least annoying exercise maven out there. He always both pushes you, but at the same time lets you know it's ok to find your own pace, especially at the beginning. &#34; Do your best, and forget the rest&#34;HOWEVER, a warning. These exercise are intense! I would not suggest these for someone who has been sitting around for years doing nothing. I had been going to the gym regularly for over two years before I started these, and they were tough. I suggest easing into it, playing around with it, trying all the routines, and giving your body time to catch up before fully committing to the 90 day/ everyday plan. You will be moving your body in new ways it is not used to. I pulled my hip flexor muscle, and my shoulder at first, so that slowed me down for several days before I was able to go full force into the 90 day program.But overall, a really great home exercise program, that you can also easily do on the road if you travel a lot.
