review/summary: Intense but worth itreview/text: I followed the program 2x now and look and feel great! This program is not for anyone who wants to jump right into working out without having done anything in a while. I recommend that you workout intensly at the gym for at least 6 months before you attempt this. I have been through boot camp, football camp, and wrestling camp and this is as challenging as anything I have done before. In order to really see results, you do want to follow the diet as well, or some sort of other diet plan designed to help you lose the lbs around the middle. Without a diet, you will get healthier, but you wont lose that last 10 lbs. That said, it is a tough workout and you will get bored with it after a couple of weeks, not to mention, very sore, but like Tony says, "just press play" and before you know it, it is over. I am now doing P90X for the 3rd time in the morning and following that up with a Bowflex workout in the evening.
