review/summary: A little disappointed!review/text: The helmet build seems fine. But, there was an issue with the glue that holds the ridged plastic parts on.When I opened the box on of the plastic pieces was off. Upon inspection I noticed all the plastic was loose.Rather than messing with a return I got out the super glue. This did the the trick just fine. I do like thedial fit and again the helmet seems otherwise solid. Hopefully just a bad glue day at the factory.
