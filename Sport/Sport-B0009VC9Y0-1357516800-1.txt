review/summary: Great knife good qualityreview/text: DURABLE! My husband loves kershaw knives. That's all he will get. The only reason he needed another was because he lost his last one.The spring assist is fun but not strong enough to create an accident waiting to happen.They are sharp so not a pry tool but they can cut through a lot if well maintained.The safety and the spring are two of the major reasons kershaw is a much better brand than any nock off. He has owned a nock off and both pieces did not last like they do on kershaws.Buying the real deal is not much more expensive for much better quality!
