review/summary: Keepin it coolreview/text: I've been using these bottles for a couple of weeks now, and they do a great job of keeping water cold. I carry 2 on the bike, and load them about 1/2 full of ice cubes and then water. 4 hours later the water is still cold, with bits of ice left; granted, it's the season between summers in florida right now, but I have no doubts that I will have cold water to drink in July thanks to Polar.
