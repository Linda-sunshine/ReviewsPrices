review/summary: Keeps items hot for hours!review/text: I tried a few other thermoses to keep meat warm for my child's lunch. None of them kept it warm for more than an hour. With this thermos, the meat was so hot four hours later that my child said she needed to let it cool more before eating it. It fits nicely in her lunchbox as well. Great!
