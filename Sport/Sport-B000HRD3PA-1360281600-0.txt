review/summary: Quality but not what I was hoping forreview/text: Seems built fine. Material is very mesh though, can see through pretty easy. Will probably be fine. Seems to fit very loose, long though. That may be the style these days to wear baggy basketball like shorts. Not my first choice for working out.
