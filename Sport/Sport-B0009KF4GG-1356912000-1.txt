review/summary: Swiss Army Champion Plus Pocket Knifereview/text: I gave this item as a Christmas Gift and my husband loved it. It is amazing how so many tools fit super compactly into that small space. A+quality: the screwdrivers etc. don't strip & the arms remain extended during use, only folding back into place when you intentionally do so. I was also impressed with the box. It was simple outside with a slide off outter portion that when removed, revealed an interior to fit only this pocket knife. I would recommend this item to a friend. The quality is impeccable. Take note of the many different pocket knives sold by this company and purchase according to your need. Some are smaller and have less tools, which is perfect for a keychain... while others like this one are the perfect size to be kept in a coat pocket or bookbag.
