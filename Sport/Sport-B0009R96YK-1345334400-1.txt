review/summary: Great mirror for your bikereview/text: I have tried many types of mirrors for my bike(s) and and was not satisfied, until my local dealer installed these on my wife's new bike. Now all the bikes in the family have them. The mirror has just the right curvature to provide a substantial view of the road behind the rider. It makes the bike a bit wider to maneuver in tight spaces, but it is a good compromise for increased road safety. Vastly better than helmet morrors or those attached with velcro.
