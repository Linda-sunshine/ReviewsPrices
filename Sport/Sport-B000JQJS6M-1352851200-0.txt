review/summary: Positivereview/text: I collect watches. I cannot afford the expensive ones, so I make do by surfing the net each day for those that are nice or unusual. This is a nice watch and goes well with my collection. It doesn't take much wear to get a few days of auto wind out of it, and that's nice too. I've been a big fan of Invicta, but find their watches a bit big for the wrist. This one, which I sized myself, is just fine. I'll probably next buy the blackface, all stainless steel Pro Diver as a Christmas gift for my brother-in-law. Thanks, Amazon!
