review/summary: Works great for my purposereview/text: This mattress inflated itself in less than a minute, I didn't have to do a thing but push a button. My pets and I slept as well on it as we do our regular bed. I did put an extra blanket under the bottom sheet as the surface seemed quite cold - probably because it is sitting on a bare floor that remains extremely cold all the time. On the third day, as suggested in the directions it might, it was a little softer than I like, but took only seconds to inflate back up and it has remained nice and firm since. That was several days ago.I am very happy with this purchase and would certainly purchase another just like it should the need arise.
