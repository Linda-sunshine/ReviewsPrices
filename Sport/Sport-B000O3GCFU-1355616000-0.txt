review/summary: Keeps preschool lunches hot!review/text: I bought this or my 4 year old to take to preschool. It looks cute, is easy to open, and keeps her food warm until lunch. Plus, it's easy to clean: I forgot to wash it out before vacation and came home to a yucky mess. To my surprise it cleaned up quickly and easily. Bonus!
