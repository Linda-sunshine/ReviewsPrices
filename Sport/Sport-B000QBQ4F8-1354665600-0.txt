review/summary: Buyer beware!review/text: Ordered black on black wayfarers, what was sent was tortoise shell and gold metal, Made In China, called RayBan, and was informed that they have been out of stock for a long time on the black on black wayfarers. Also found out that rayban is now officially making lower grade ray-bans in China....Shame Shame Shame, yet another company gone to the realm of cheap labor...Sad.....shouldn't advertise something you don't have nor will...
