review/summary: Great holster for the XD-Mreview/text: This is my third Serpa and I love it. Great design and quality. Big bang for your buck (so to speak) with both the belt attachment and a paddle. I bought this after searching high and low for a retention holster for my Springfield XD-M 5.25 9mm. This works perfectly. The muzzle protrudes through the end of the holster but there is zero chance of the sight snagging, which was a big concern. I know there has been talk of this somehow being an "unsafe design" because of your trigger finger placement. My two cents: I've been a police officer for 12 years, shoot competitively and think that estimation of this holster is nonsense. Your finger should index the slide when you draw, period. This design puts your trigger finger where it SHOULD be. If you can't draw safely without discharging your firearm yu have no business owning one. Don't blame the holster for something you did! Great product, highly recommend.
