review/summary: No problems so far!review/text: I was quite apprehensive in getting an Intex air-bed due to its reviews on leakages and stuff. My product was fine and it did not give any problems to-date. I got this for my sister when she came and stayed with us during her break. SO far she has been sleeping on it for the past one month and she has not pumped air in since then. Initial pumping was easy and quick. How i wish it is an in-built battery operated one! The good thing abt this bed is that it has a nice height. The disadvantage is that it wobbles when you move from side to side. Besides this, it is great!
