review/summary: Great exercise program, but time consumingreview/text: This is a great exercise program, and if you are looking to lose weight, you will see good results. If you are already skinny, such as myself, it is possible to gain weight and put on muscle, but you have to intake an incredible amount of calories.There is a mixture of cardio, weight lifting, yoga, and other strength oriented workouts. The average workout will be 1 hour 15 minutes; however, add additional time to that if you take breaks or need to change the weights on your dumbbells.The hardest thing about this program is sticking to it. It takes considerable dedication and commitment. From my experience, the majority of people who start P90X do not finish.I have done four rounds of P90X, and I am finally burned out. I have to take a break from this program; however, I have continued to exercise.If you start this program, it will not be easy. But if you hang in there, you will definitely see results. You may appear like the people in the before-and-after pictures, but your body should be noticeably different.
