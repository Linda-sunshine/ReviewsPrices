review/summary: Love it!review/text: What can i say about this Omron pedometer? Over the course of the past four years, my husband and I have purchased four of these units. When they stopped working - it was because they got dropped in water. I dried mine out twice by taking it completely apart and getting out a hairdyer and got it working again, but it finally gave up the ghose after four years. I highly recommend this pedometer.
