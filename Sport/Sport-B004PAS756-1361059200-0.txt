review/summary: Great fast workoutreview/text: The description of this product is spot on. A 45 minute high intensity workout crammed into 20 minutes. The downside is that the audio could be much better, and sometimes the instructor stops telling you when to switch exercise moves so you get a little behind. My goal during this workout is to take fewer breaks than Shaun T and his sidekicks, as even they have to stop from time to time.
