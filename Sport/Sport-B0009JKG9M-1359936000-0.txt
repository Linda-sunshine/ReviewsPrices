review/summary: It's is heavy than expected.review/text: My package got lost in delivery. It ended up taking 20 days for delivery. By the time it got to, the box was ripped, and I can see the handles sticking out. Nevertheless, the cast iron pans look undamaged; then again, it is cast iron. This works well with gas stove. I would NOT recommend it if you have electric stove or one of those smooth electric induction type stove.
