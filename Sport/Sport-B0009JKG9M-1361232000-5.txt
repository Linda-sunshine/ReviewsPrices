review/summary: Very Versatilereview/text: I've been using the cooker in the oven and on the stove. Results are delicious. I used to use a lot of aluminum disposable baking pans but have stopped doing so since I began using this cast iron product. Its a little high maintenance, but I feel it's worth it since it yields a delicious end product.
