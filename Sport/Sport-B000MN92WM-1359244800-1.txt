review/summary: I like it. Easy to use.review/text: I like this pedometer device and it's easy to use. Also keeps track of your daily walks for up to 30 days. I just recently synced my data via a USB cable to my computer, and the Omron database software to view your results works pretty slick too. Overall it was a good purchase for the dollar spent.
