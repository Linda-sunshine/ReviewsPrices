review/summary: Helping me lose weightreview/text: I have tried other pedometers before, but there was always something I didn't like about them. I love that this one counts the aerobic steps, as well as all other steps. I like that it resets itself everyday. I have worn it constantly since I received it. I hadn't realized how sedentary I had become. Since I'm walking the recommended 10,000 steps on most days since I've gotten this pedometer, I've lost 13 pounds! This is one of the most helpful purchases I've ever made!
