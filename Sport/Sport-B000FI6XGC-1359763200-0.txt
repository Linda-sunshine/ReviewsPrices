review/summary: A small pumpreview/text: I wanted a small pump for emergency use on my bike. The indoor tests I did seem to show this item will work for my needs. I only need pressures up to 70lbs so I cannot speak to its ability at higher pressures. It seemed to add about 1 lb of air per pump. So it can take awhile to inflate a really low tire.
