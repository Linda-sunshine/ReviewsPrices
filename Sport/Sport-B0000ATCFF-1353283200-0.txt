review/summary: Great shoes!review/text: These were my first converse, and I was a bit hesitant to buy a pair online, so I went to Khols and tried on a pair there to find the correct size. I bought the Black Monochrome, and they are stylish and comfortable. And look great! I have had several compliments on them in the first week or so. A great buy!
