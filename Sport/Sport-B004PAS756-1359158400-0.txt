review/summary: Very good videoreview/text: It starts with a 2 minute warm up followed by a twenty minute workout interspersed with stretching.He takes you through a variety of cardio exercises and motivates/coaches you all the way.You don't need any special equipment, and the exercises are simple but effective.The timer is visible throughout the video so you know how much longer.Just what I was looking for.
