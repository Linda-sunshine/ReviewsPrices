review/summary: Best thermos EVERreview/text: I've bought two of these before. The first one was stolen somewhere on campus at my university, so I bought another one because I missed my thermos so much. I've never had issues with denting for this Thermos -- it did fall off of my friend's car once (an SUV), and the bottom plastic base cracked, but there was absolutely no leaking so the functionality was not compromised. You do have to close this Thermos not TOO tightly, and not overfill it, to ensure that leakage won't happen. This Thermos is pretty easy to clean.I put hot coffee in it at 11PM one night, and the next day at 9AM it was still hot. By 1PM that day, it was just warm. Amazing, right!?
