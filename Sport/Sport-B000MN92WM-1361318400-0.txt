review/summary: Pedometerreview/text: I purchased this brand of pedometer because it was recommended by a relative who had had a heart attack. The unit is so easy to use and to carry with me. My daily goal is 10,000 steps so when I see that I am a bit under my goal, I do something to push my number over the top. It's a great reminder to keep moving!
