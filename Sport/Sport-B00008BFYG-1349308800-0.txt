review/summary: What Happened To Quality?review/text: We owned a Razor scooter for several years before we purchased this one. That thing was indestructible and while it took serious abuse it functioned perfectly. We would have it to this day if it had not been stolen. We bought this one to replace the stolen one. From day one it would not fold properly and the handle would not lock fully. We sent it back and got a new one thinking we got a defective one. The second one had the same problem. Because my son uses the scooter almost daily to get to school and around the neighborhood, he did not want to send it back and wait for a replacement yet again. So, now we just never fold it up which, is a bit inconvenient living in a New York City apartment. My advice is go to a store with your kid and have them try several models, opening and closing them to see if they can do it consistently before making a purchase. C'mon Razor bring back the quality!
