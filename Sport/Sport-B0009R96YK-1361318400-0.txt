review/summary: The best I have found. Made in USA !review/text: This thing is great ! Solid construction. Real glass mirror, Mounts fine, I did not use the second L arm cuz you don't have to & makes it kinda awkward looking. The threads are the same on both fittings. I only wished it twisted at the bar end so it wouldn't break in case of a mishap. I have my drop handle bars turned up " Old school style " for comfort. The best mirror I have found & I've been through a few ! Got on sale for &12.00 . Hell of a deal !
