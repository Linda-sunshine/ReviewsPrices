review/summary: Great Knifereview/text: I own a couple of other Kershaws and have been very impressed with them. I decided to get this Leek for my dad for Christmas. I was very impressed with the feel and construction of the knife as well as the razor sharp edge. My dad loved it. Great knife that I got at a very good price here on Amazon.
