review/summary: I LOVE this knife.review/text: I already was a fan of Kershaw knives from owning the Scallion. Got this one for a little bit longer, straighter-edged blade. Keeps a good edge and comes in handy all the time. LOVE the Speed Safe opening mechanism! Couldn't be easier or faster to open the knife. I'll probably end up with a few of the other models as well. Another great knife from Kershaw!
