review/summary: Perfect cooking instrument for all-in-one dishesreview/text: I don't have time for a detailed review but suffice to say this is one of the best $30 purchases I've ever made. If you're making pot roast, stew, chowder, braised meats, casserole, etc. this thing can't be matched. Not at this price anyway. I'm sure All-Clad and Cruets make pretty nice dutch ovens for $200. Two thing to keep in mind: 1. It gets hot fast and stays hot longer. Stuff cooks quicker in this. It may take a few trial runs before you get the hang of it. 2. Keep it dry, keep it oiled.
