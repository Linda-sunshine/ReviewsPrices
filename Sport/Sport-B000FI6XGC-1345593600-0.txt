review/summary: GREAT pump--missing instructions for Schrader valvereview/text: I'm not a bike fanatic and I am just getting started in the world of biking but I thought I would post this because it's not readily apparent and someone else just posted a negative review based on what I believe to be a misunderstanding of proper use for the schrader valve. For Schrader valves: There are two pieces, a plastic piece and a rubber piece that have to BOTH be swapped around. If done correctly, the screw cap will fit back onto it correctly. Five stars for the product itself, but labeling and instructions brings it down to a four.It IS shown on front of the packaging (there is a picture here on Amazon) but it wasn't obvious and was easily overlooked (I didn't even see it until well after it was too late). The manufacturer should include words in addition to the small pictures on the packaging to make it obvious what it is that we are looking at.Search for the review by "SF Mission" on Amazon, which is the best explanation of the proper method I've found so far. TOPEAK, are you listening? Please better identify the instructions on your packaging!!! While you have great reviews here, you might help someone who can't figure it out so easily (myself included)!
