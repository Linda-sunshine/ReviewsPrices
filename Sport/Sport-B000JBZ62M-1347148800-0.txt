review/summary: Functional Shorts Run Largereview/text: Needed a pair of red shorts for my Red Pants job.PROs:They're light and breath easily when running in themThey are the correct color red my work requiredThere is a drawstring to tie the overlarge shorts for smaller waists or if you lose weightCONs:Pockets are really shallow, so I can't run with a cell phone in them per my jobRUN BIG--I'm usually a large, but these are for someone with a 36 inch waist--buy a medium if you're a 34-35 incher like meOVERALL--I recommend these if you just need them for minor sports or lounging but if you're looking for something with deep pockets these won't work. If price is your concern, they are functional and half the price of Underarmor.
