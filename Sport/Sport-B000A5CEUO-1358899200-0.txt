review/summary: Great for the price and needreview/text: I needed something simple to use since the HR monitor on our cheap treadmill doesnt work any more. The bonus is that the belt works with my elliptical that has a polar sensor, so it will likely work at the gym too. I like that you can set an alarm to keep you in the target HR zone too.
