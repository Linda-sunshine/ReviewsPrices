review/summary: Not As Great as Everyone Saysreview/text: These boxer briefs are OK. A few years back, I purchased Under Armour boxer briefs which were absolutely amazing. Easily the best underwear I had ever worn. Unfortunately, they stopped producing that model and their newer model is no where near as comfortable. I looked elsewhere and I went with this product because of the reviews. These are not snug fitting as the picture indicates which was disappointing. Also the band is not really that comfortable (kinda digs into you). In my opinion, these are an OK alternative. I am still hoping to find something similar to the old Under Armour model.
