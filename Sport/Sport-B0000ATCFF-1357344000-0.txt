review/summary: Xmas top wish list item that cannot be worn...review/text: was gonna mark this one star...the size was miss-leading, and too large for my daughter to wear. She really, really wanted these, was soooo excited when she opened them. One full size, or more, too large, maybe men's vs. women's? Miss-marked? Now what? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem. But...the quality was very nice, shipped well, all that. SO, two stars.
