review/summary: Love the Gaiam Balance Ball Chairreview/text: I sit most of the day and was having trouble with my back (and rear end). I've been sitting on the ball chair for about two months now and love it! My back doesn't hurt and I can feel my stomach getting stronger. You do have to remember to sit back at times, but doing so helps you suck in your tummy for added strengthening. Love the effects - if you have to sit all day I recommend it.
