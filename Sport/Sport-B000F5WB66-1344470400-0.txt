review/summary: Junkreview/text: This monitor is a complete piece of junk. I've used other monitors and this is so inferior, I am amazed that it is even on the market.- you have to apply ' moisture' to get the sensor pads working. And even if you moisten it and get it working, if it has a couple of minutes to dry off, you have to re-moisten it.- the fastener hardly works. You have to wrestle with it for it to stay on.Truly a pathetic product. Stay away.
