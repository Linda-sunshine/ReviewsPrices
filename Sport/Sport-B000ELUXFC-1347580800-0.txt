review/summary: Allen Deluxe 2- Bike Trunk Mount Rackreview/text: I absolutely love the bike rack. At first, I was scared because the bikes might fall off but the rack is strong enough to hold our bikes as long as you secure them properly. Now we can use our bikes and my kids just love biking around the park.
