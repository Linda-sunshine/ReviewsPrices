review/summary: Nice-looking, but didn't work well in actionreview/text: They look and feel great when you put them on, but the finger tubes are a bit too long and when I lifted any heavy weights, they would dig into the skin on my middle finger. So I had to return them, unfortunately, because otherwise I really liked them.
