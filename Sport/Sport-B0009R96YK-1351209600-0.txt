review/summary: Great mirrorreview/text: This mirror is actually better then I thought it would be. It was easy to install (though I reversed the process a bit, made it easier for me). It fits my bike perfectly, its stable, it is easily adjusted or moved out of the way when not needed, and it makes it is easy to see any cars coming up behind me.Would definitely order again.
