review/summary: Love it!review/text: This combo is a must have for anyone who cooks. Great construction, heats evenly, and when taken care of properly, no issues with sticking. Easily wipes clean with a rag and then on goes a simple layer of oil. These can be used as lids, and fit well with other Lodge products, such as my 10.5&#34; griddle.
