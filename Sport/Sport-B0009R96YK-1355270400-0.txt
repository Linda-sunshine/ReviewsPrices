review/summary: They look like they belongreview/text: I bought two of these and even though their optic isn't 100% realistic, they still give you a good rear view. They are very easy to install once you have made up your mind to cut your original handle bar covers that is...I have had them on my recumbent since over 7 years now and they have grown on me. I wouldn't want to miss them anymore!
