review/summary: Good enough for my needsreview/text: I bought two, one for each side since I do a lot of city commuting and need that visibility.The size of the mirror is sufficient to see with clarity if someone is within about half a mile to a mile behind me on level roads.Assemply is squeeky, but simple, and the screws may be tightened to have the mirror be completely rigid or loosened to make it adjustable by hand while riding.I wasn't a fan of how it hangs out horizontally as it widens the space I need on the roads and can get caught on branches and other obstacles, but you can position is such that it is bent inward so you look just above or below (I have them below to not interfere with getting my hand off the bars in a jiffy) your hand to see behind you (I have them below to not interfere with getting my hand off the bars in a jiffy). I'm slender so it works great.I am glad I bought them, and if mine ever break, I'll replace them with the same. They suit my needs and are sufficiently durable and customizable in their configuration.
