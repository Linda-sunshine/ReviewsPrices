review/summary: Cast Iron!review/text: I received this set for Christmas last year as a gift. I absolutely love it! My mom always had a cast iron skillet to cook with when I was growing up and I decided I wanted one too. I have made all kind of recipes in mine. I have used it on the grill, in the oven and on the stove. I did have minor stick a couple times, but that was because I left it on the grill too long. I scraped it and seasoned it a little more and kept going. I really like the quality and the fact that Lodge is the only cast iron manufacturer still making them in the USA. I recommend a good stiff brush to clean them with. Most of the time though I just use warm water and my hand. Season with oil after ever use and this set should give more than a lifetime of use.
