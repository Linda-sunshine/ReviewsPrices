review/summary: Not bad, not great!review/text: It is exactly what you should exect o bet i around 30 dollars.The bow itself is relatively tough, and well made. The arrows on the other hand are crap. They feel like they could fall apart atvany minute, and are barelybheld together with what looks like glue...I would suggets finding another option. Try something else.
