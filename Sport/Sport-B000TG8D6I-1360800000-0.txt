review/summary: Intense, but effectivereview/text: P90X is certainly no joke, but it gets the job done. All of the workouts are challenging, although I would say Plyometrics is by far the hardest and most grueling. I started off pretty fit and trim, but I'm 1 and a half months into it now, and I definitely have seen changes, especially in my arms and legs. I have noted vast improvement in my ability to perform, especially on the yoga and ab sections.The workouts are all pretty good, although I find the yoga disc is simply too long (although I do enjoy most of it) and the ab disc is annoying because they seem to put all the movements that really work your quads back to back, such that it's hard to keep up simply because your legs are tired (abs are fine). Overall I'm very happy with the workouts and I've seen good results. It's definitely a big time commitment, but I feel much better on a day to day basis and I look forward to seeing the final results in 3 months!
