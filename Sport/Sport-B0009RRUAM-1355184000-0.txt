review/summary: comfyreview/text: Bought this for a camping trip, and I love it. It compresses down pretty small, which is ideal when space is at a prime. When it's unrolled, it takes a good few minutes for the memory-foamlike pieces inside to fluff up and reach their full size, but I thought that was to be expected from a pillow like this. I looked at other small camp/travel pillows and glad I decided on this one. I found it to be really comfortable, whether I was sleeping on my side, stomach, or back ... but don't expect the same level of comfort as your favorite pillow in bed at home.
