review/summary: These are amazingreview/text: I discovered these shopping for a 2 week trip last year. Since then, I won't go back to regular boxers. Worth every penny. By the way, the photos are incorrect on Amazon....the "Boxer" has loose fitting legs, while the "Boxer Brief" is more like bicycle shorts with tight legs. I prefer the boxers for casual wear. Both are great though.
