review/summary: best grip for sw mp 15-22review/text: This grip feels great, fits perfect and is easy to install. One the SW MP 15-22, although the magpul grips look cool on other AR's, they dont sit flush with that rifle. This grip just fits perfectly when the factory grip is replaced but feels a million times better and looks nicer in my opinion.
