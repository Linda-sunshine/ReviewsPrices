review/summary: Great little lightreview/text: This has all the features I wanted in a bike light - nice and bright; I can switch between steady or blinking, and the on/off is easy to access. The clip that attaches this to my under-seat bike bad is not very secure - my Blinky has come off several times when I've hit bumps or railroad tracks. I'll probably switch it to the direct mounting bracket for a more secure mount.
