review/summary: Wonderful Thermosreview/text: I bought two of these thermos for my boys to take to school. Yesterday was the first day we used them, I warmed up the soup for them at 745 in the morning and by 12:00 my son actual burnt his tongue. IT WAS AMAZING that they still were that hot. THANK YOU
