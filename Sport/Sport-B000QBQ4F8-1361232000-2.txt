review/summary: Absolutely love thesereview/text: 5 stars because they're built just like they always have been. The black front with the red inside is a nice touch on this style with a white buffer between the colors. Perfect size for my small to medium size face. I just can't get over how firm and well built they feel when wearing them. Just a high quality product in my opinion. I feel that is getting harder and harder to find anymore. If you like this style then you wont regret this purchase and buying this quality pair over several lower quality knock-offs.
