review/summary: Great light horrible bracket!review/text: So I bought this due to the price and great reviews. The light its self is great. Very bright and seems of good quality. The bracket is what sinks the product. I just couldn't get it to fit snugly any where in my bike. Finally it seemed to be securley fastened to my rear rack bars. Went for a ride got home and guess what? It fell off! I'm now going to try and get a refund from the seller without having physical possession of most of the item. Wish me luck!
