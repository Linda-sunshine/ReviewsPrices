review/summary: Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed is a great productreview/text: We had family coming to visit for two weeks and needed a bed for our five year old grandson. The Intex Airbed was perfect. It was easy to blow up with the built-in electric pump. Took no time at all. Twin mattress pad, sheets and blanket fit perfect and stayed on. We did not have to add air during the two weeks. Our grandson bounced off the bed, played on the bed, and slept on the bed with no air loss at all. When our guest left the bed was easy to deflate and pack in the storage bag. I give it the highest rating and would recommend it to all who need an extra bed. This is a great product!Intex Deluxe Pillow Rest Rising Comfort Twin
