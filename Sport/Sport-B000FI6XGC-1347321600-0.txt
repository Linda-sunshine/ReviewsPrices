review/summary: Great little pump.review/text: This pump is TINY! I didn't expect it to be THIS small, but it is. It pumps a bit slow, but what do you expect from something that tiny. However, it works solidly. Only con of this pump is that it has no gauge to read the tire pressure, which is why I bought a independent tire pressure gauge. Oh, another con with this is that the seal is so tight that I have a hard time taking the pump off after pumping the tire. This is a love-hate issue. Tight so it won't leak air, but too tight that it's hard to take off. What more can I say, it works! And for the price, my bank is not even bothered at all. Great buy, will update if anything goes wrong with it.
