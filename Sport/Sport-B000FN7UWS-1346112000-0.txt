review/summary: Functional and colorfulreview/text: The light blue color is beautiful and looks just like it did on the screen. Not much else to say -- this is a great product and is pretty much indestructible. My previous bottle had been dropped countless times but never broke. I had read that the aluminum canteens need a plastic coating inside to prevent leeching, but that negates the whole point of trying to stay away from plastic. Stainless steel doesn't have this problem. It was also cheaper on Amazon than through the actual Klean Kanteen website.
