review/summary: Seal wellreview/text: I use these for my masters swim class, swimming laps in the community pool, and open water ocean swimming. They work well and seal most of the time. Once in a while, they leak through my eyebrows. They don't fog very often and when they do, it isn't a big deal.I had some double vision under water, at first. It wasn't as bad as with other brands and went away after using them a couple times. I don't have any issues now.
