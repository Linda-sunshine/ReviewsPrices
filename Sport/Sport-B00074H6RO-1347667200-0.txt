review/summary: Good gloves, snug fit for XL handsreview/text: This seems like a good product for the price. I haven't tried a lot of other weightlifting gloves and i haven't been using these for more than a few weeks so I can't comment on their durability. I use XL gloves for all purposes from lab work to bike riding and usually have no problems with the fit. However this is one of those instances where the XL fit is snug. I've only used these a few times and I hope that they will stretch a little with use. Maybe I should have taken the other reviewer's suggestions and bought a size larger but XXL seemed like overkill. I would also have preferred a little more padding in the palm area as I can feel the stitching pressing into my palms.
