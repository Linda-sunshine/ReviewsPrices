review/summary: Need adaptor if your wife actually has a woman's bikereview/text: I ordered this rack and decided to use it today. It fit my car pretty well, and installed easily. I hung my bike on it, but couldn't figure out how to hang my wife's bike on it. Women's bikes do not have center posts - um, duh! This rack does not work for bikes without a center post. You have to purchase a separate adaptor, the Allen 900B. So, this really messed up my day. We weren't able to take the bikes to the state park as we had planned, all because Allen didn't realize that a typical couple might consist of a man and a woman, and the woman might actually have a WOMAN's bike. Very frustrating. I've now ordered the adaptor (which should come with this rack if you follow my drift) and in a few days, we'll be able to put both our bikes on the rack.
