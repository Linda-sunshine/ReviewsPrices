review/summary: Very fast shippingreview/text: Shipping was very fast and watch is decent quality for the money.This watch apes the looks of a Rolex Submariner quite well.Machining on the case is good with no sharp edges, dial rotates smoothly and lines up with markers and movement seems good (Citizen Miyota) but waiting for it to settle in. Bracelet is very sub-par despite having solid links. End links however are folded and clasp is not quite as refined as others (Seiko) and does have some sharp edges as well as lending a very hollow and rattely sound to the bracelet overall.All-in-all, not bad for the money.
