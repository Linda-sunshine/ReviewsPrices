review/summary: Comfortablereview/text: I really like these gloves. They fit exactly according to the sizing chart (i'm a large and I ordered large).The finger length is exactly right and the webbing between the fingers is just right to allow dexterity. Once you put them on you cant feel any stitching or seams (which is a gripe I have with some gloves) so they feel very comfortable.They are a thin pair of gloves (especially on the palm side). The synthetic leather on the palm is very soft and supple. The neoprene type material on the back allows for a certain amount of stretching when clenching your hand into a fist. I like the velcro strap at the wrist since this allows me to loosen or tighten the cuff according to the weather. A portion of the palm swell as well as 3 of the 4 fingers have added 'grip' which should help in typing on a phone, streering whel grip, trigger control etc.I wouldn't say that these are very cold weather gloves - they are more of a daily gloves for all sorts of uses. I have thicker gloves for snow shoveling and such.I can't comment yet on how long these will last but first impressions are very good.
