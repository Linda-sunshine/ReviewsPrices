review/summary: looks coolreview/text: ADV: Grab feeling is good, glove is neither too thick nor too thin. looks cool(I bought the yellow version)DISADV: the side of 2nd knot of thumb is not protected by leather but by nylon. Sometimes when I'm holding heavy dumbell, the 2nd knot of my thumbs will be touching or worn by the sideface of the plate of dumbells(maybe my holding way is not so correct) and nylon cannot provide enough protection. I would prefer the the side of 2nd knot of thumb can also be covered by leather.
