review/summary: Picture is deceivingreview/text: The shorts are comfortable with one loop draw string in the front - not the dual shoe lace kind.They breathe well and fit on the waist or just below very easilythe elastic is cheap and feels so at first use.The length allows them to ride up about 4-5 inches above the knee making them just a tad longerthen the scary old man shorts you see at the gym. when working out.all in all decent but for the money may be better to hit a big box or discount store and find a betterpair.
