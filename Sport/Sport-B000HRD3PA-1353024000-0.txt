review/summary: Champion Men's Long Mesh Shortreview/text: If you're a fourty-ish man who's gained a few pounds, these light-weight but substantial drawstring shorts are heaven, in that they are both good-looking and soooooooo comfortable! But I am sure even the slimmest male would find these shorts to their liking. A+
