review/summary: Best Socks Ever.review/text: I got these socks mainly out of curiosity and also because I saw a lot of reviews from runners. I like to run but it's mainly while playing games like basket ball or soccer etc. and I wanted a sock that didn't slip around in the shoe or get completely soaked after a while. I really like the feel of the socks and they seem to work as described. They really keep my feet warm and dry. I think they look cool and they shipped really fast and arrived earlier than estimated. Great product.
