review/summary: bright, but how the heck do you install it?review/text: it took my husband over an hour to get the cover off to put the batteries in.i still can't figure out how in the heck to install this on my bike! there are no instructions - just a picture of the installation options on the side of the carton. but, it doesn't help you figure out where the bits go!edit: since i couldn't install this how it's supposed to be installed, it was just stolen off my bike.
