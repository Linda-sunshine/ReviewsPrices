review/summary: 27 oz Orange Sunset w/ Poly Sport 2.0 Capreview/text: I bought the 27 oz. orange sunset with Poly Sport 2.0 Cap.I like the size--not too heavy but keeps me hydrated.The color looks more like the "Commuter Orange" picture (just shy of red-orange) as opposed to a yellow-orange. I might have been shipped the wrong color though.The sport cap definitely squeaks--louder than I had imagined (like a bird). As others have written, if you push the plastic nob next to the nozzle, it cuts the squeaking. I don't mind that much because the convenience of drinking it in the car is more important to me. I've had no problems with leaking yet either.
