review/summary: Its true, the plastic falls off!review/text: The plastic side pieces fell off when I barely touched them. Also, the plastic on top was about 1/2 way off. This if the way the helmet came. I did as others and super-glued the plastic pieces back on and it seems OK now, but what part of China assembled this thing?Today I went to Wal-Mart to find a helmet for my wife. They had several of these Schwinn Thrasher helmets. To my surprise, the plastic was loose on every one of them, just like mine. They won't make it to the check out counter before falling off! The other Schwinn helmet models at Wal-Mart didn't have this problem, only the Thrasher.I bought my wife a Bell impulse, which seems like a better quality helmet, and much more practical looking for her (I don't think she would like the Star Wars look).I suppose that the Thrasher helmet itself will serve its purpose OK and it was cheap as helmets go, so I'm not sorry for my purchase. It fits well enough and all. I guess I am more humored than anything, to think that a name brand company like Schwinn could sell something this consistently faulty.
