review/summary: great style, great protectionreview/text: I bought the classic wayfarer (red & black) a couple of months ago, i love them! I'm an 19 year old and they work and look as i expected.they are made with materials of great quality. I have used them on water a bunch of times and they are perfect. with constant cleaning this sunglasses will last you for years! Its worth the price if you are looking for some real quality sunglasses.
