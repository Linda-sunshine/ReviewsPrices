review/summary: As described... I received 10 of themreview/text: Ordered these, they came quickly and there WAS 10 in the box contrary to many of the 1 star reviewers who weren't terribly lucky. Not sure how much I can add. They're tightly and neatly folded emergency blankets, they work and are great to keep in the car glove box and in the home in case of emergency. We removed one from the factory bag it came in and then just folded it up and put it back in a zip-lock sandwich bag to store it after inspecting it.These are not thick, but no emergency blanket I've ever seen IS terribly thick. For the price, you can't go wrong with these. Buy a batch, and give them to family and friends to keep in their car just in case.
