review/summary: Great for safetyreview/text: For someone who is very cautious, this would be a plus. I feel safer when I ride with this and now don't understand why someone wouldn't have it. When you are on the road, and need to swerve around a parked car, you can check behind you, when you are on the road, you can check behind you to see if a car is coming, if i should move closer to the side of the road. I just really think anyone who is a daily commuter should have this,esp. if you are on road where cars go 35+ mph.Easy to assemble.
