review/summary: Wonderful!review/text: I bought a couple of pairs of these a few years ago for a trip to Colombia. They live up to the hype and are simply a great product. Since my trip I've taken them on several other adventures and they have never failed me. They are comfortable, dry quickly, don't cause chafing, and my wife loves the way they look on too. I highly Recommend them...you can't put a price on keeping yourself comfortable.
