review/summary: Great for 9 yr oldreview/text: My 9 year old son received this compound bow set for Christmas and he loves it. He has never extensively practiced archery before, but after a day or so of use, he is already getting very good at it. We set up a few bales of hay for him to shoot at and he is having fun learning to hit the bales. Pulling back is a little hard but he is already getting stronger and used to it. Great quality bow and arrows. We will definitely be purchasing more arrows soon too.
