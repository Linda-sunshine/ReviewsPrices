review/summary: PERFECT FOR BACKPACKING!review/text: I took this pillow (size:small) out with me in my backpack and it was already compressed when I received it so it was nice and small and fit right in my pack with no problems while leaving plenty of room for other items. It is really lightweight as well. I used it to put into my hammock overnight and a plus about the pillow is that you can attach a carabiner to the draw string on the pillow to the hammock so it doesn't slide around. The pillow has bits of mattress foam in it so it feels lumpier than a regular pillow but when I unrolled the pillow and fluffed it up it only took a few minutes until it was really fluffy and soft. It took longer than they say in the videos but it was very cold last night so that must be why. I'm sure in warmer weather it would only take a few seconds. I slept great on the pillow and it didn't slide down my hammock which is great. Also, I got the camo print and it looks great. The outside lining isn't soft like plush by the way. It's a little rougher than the average pillow case but that didn't bother me. Great product!
