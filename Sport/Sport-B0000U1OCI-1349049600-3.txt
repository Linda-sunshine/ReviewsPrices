review/summary: Wish this was waterproof!review/text: The only reason we bought another pedometer was because the last two went through the washing machine. Which on a side note after two washes the numbers started fading and after the third wash it completely died. Anyway, this was a birthday present, and she still loves this model. As you may have deduced from the first sentence this the third pedometer of the same model I have purchased. It is easy to set up and a basic pedometer. The display is clear and easy to read. If this one dies in the wash I will probably buy the same model. Maybe they can develop a waterproof one!
