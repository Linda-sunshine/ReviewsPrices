review/summary: Great knife for everyday carryreview/text: When I first received the Kershaw Leek 1660 st I was disappointed. It wasn't the quality that I took exception to, but rather the size. It is a small knife and I was expecting something about 25% bigger. But the more I carried it, the more pleased I was with the size. For everyday carry, you can't beat it. It is super sharp and the assisted opening is as fast as an automatic, but use the lever on the back of the blade...the thumb studs can lead to accidental cuts from the blade!The stainless handles would be a poor choice if this were a work knife but as a pocket knife, they are very attractive. The blade locks very rigidly and has a safety lock to prevent accidental opening...although I rarely use it.The knife is made in the USA and is a quality piece. You won't leave home without it! I sure don't!
