review/summary: Great starter bow!review/text: This bow was a perfect starter bow for my 16 year-old; it was originally going to be given to my 11 year-old, but we pulled the ol' switcheroo on Christmas Eve. It has good enough power to satisfy her (for now), and it is easy to work with. None of the arrows have broken yet, so it gets a good rating from me for durability. I'm sure she will want to move to a more powerful bow in the future, but it looks like the Banshee Jr. will be passed down to the younger ones when that happens.
