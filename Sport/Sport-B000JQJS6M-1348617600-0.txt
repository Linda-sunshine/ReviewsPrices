review/summary: Totally in Lovereview/text: My husband has been talking about Rolex this and Rolex that. Of course they are way too expensive so I went on amazon and typed in Rolex to see what would come up. This watch along with other Invicta watches came up and after reading the reviews, I decided to order it for our anniversary. I must say that I don't regret buying this watch for him. He loves it and it looks just like a Rolex, specially because of the automatic movement. Great deal, great quality and he is happy! It just doesn't get any better than that. Thank you so much.
