review/summary: So comfortable!review/text: These are such comfortable pants! True to size and length (the large was perfect and I'm 5' 8"). They're thick enough to make me feel covered, but not so thick as to be too hot during class. The only reason they didn't get five stars is because these pants collect hair like crazy! If you have animals you'll definitely want a sticky roller or tape to remove the hair. Other than that, I love them. I'm even thinking of getting more colors.
