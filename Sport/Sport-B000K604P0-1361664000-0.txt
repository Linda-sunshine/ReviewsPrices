review/summary: Best you will find!review/text: I bought my thermos at Cabela's before I became an Amazon Prime member, and have had the product for 6 years. I still use it everyday and have had no problems. I have never dropped it, but have always been concerned that the lid might break because of the single hinge if I did.I see folks that have a problem with it leaking, suprisingly I have that same problem, but only it I fill it a little to full. It will leak every time. If I keep below the fill line as suggested, I have never had it leak. Once you have a leak, if you don't thoughly dry the seal ring it will continue to drip, sometimes for a couple of days, even it is empty. Don't fill it to full, dry the seal ring if you do, enjoy a nonleaking thermos.The best on the market.
