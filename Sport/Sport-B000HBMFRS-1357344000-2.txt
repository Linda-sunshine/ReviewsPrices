review/summary: Great air mattressreview/text: This is a relatively low cost air mattress that has a electric pump and is great for overnight guests and travel. I've slept on this with a partner for a week straight and neither of us had any problems. It inflates quickly and deflates quickly with the pump. The carry bag is just big enough to hold this all wrapped up. Very good value.
