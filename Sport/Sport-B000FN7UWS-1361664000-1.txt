review/summary: in lovereview/text: Love it, it's durable and gets me though at least 6 hours at work. The cap squeaks sometimes, but it's because of the new design. I owned the 27oz prior, and although it fit in my car cup holder, I think this is a much better deal because of the size. Keep it upright or it could dribble. All that being said I love it!
