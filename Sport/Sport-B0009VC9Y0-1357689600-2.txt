review/summary: Perfect EDC utility knifereview/text: Lightweight, ergonomically flawless and attractive; Kershaw really doesn't make a poorly designed knife, however I recommend the Ken Leek to anyone looking for a simple and effective EDC (every day carry) blade. It is slim and lightweight, which is essential when carrying as the more cumbersome the less likely I am to carry. The handle is titanium to save weight, and the blade is sturdy 1660 stainless steel. The factory edge is impressive and maintains very well. The locking mechanism on the blade is an intelligent safety measure. The blade deploys easily and smoothly with one hand, and can be closed equally as easily. The finish is smooth and attractive to the eye. For pocket carry, either to the office or the worksite, the Ken Leek by Kershaw is rugged, durable and intelligently perfect for the small jobs and tasks an everyday knife needs to tackle, while remaining slim and lightweight. FIVE stars.
