review/summary: Works great and it's durablereview/text: Works great. Purchased it and March 2012 and have been using it mostly everyday for the past 5 months. It has a belt like clip and a secondary clip with a string. You can clip it on any piece of clothing and use the secondary clip to make sure it doesn't fall off. It displays the time, so if you want to go walking no need to bring a watch or cell phone with you.
