review/summary: Perfect for travel and camping!review/text: Great size for travel. Don't be alarmed, it will seem a little flat when you first unroll it. You can either fluff it yourself, or if you just let it sit unrolled it will fluff itself in a few hours. We bought 2 for travel and camping and we are very pleased with this purchase!
