review/summary: Casino 6-Deck Automatic Card Shufflerreview/text: I bought the shuffler hoping it would help shuffle 4-5 decks at a time. It mostly shuffled perfectly, but about 6 out of 10 times, the cards would jam in the receiving tray. The spring that makes it go down as the cards come out didn't seem very stable. Also, unless I placed my hand in front of the clear plastic guard, the cards wouldn't eject smoothly. If I had it to do over again, I would not have purchased. Even though it worked most of the time, it was cumbersome to use.
