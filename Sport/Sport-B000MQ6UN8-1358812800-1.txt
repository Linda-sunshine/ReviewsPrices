review/summary: Best sunglasses I've ever ownedreview/text: I never had much faith in sunglasses until I bought these. Sure, the 5 dollar pair will make everything a bit dimmer, but they do nothing for your eyes. With these, it's almost as though I can stare into the sun and my eyes are perfectly safe. I recommend them to everyone I know looking for sunglasses. They are well worth the price.
