review/summary: good beginner bowreview/text: I bought this bow for my 8 year old, who has shot with his cub scout pack; he has also shot his cousins small compound youth bow. For my 8 year old, who is small and wiry, the pull weight is hard for him, but I knew that going in, and bought it as a way to give him some upper body strength. He 'practices' in the house (without arrows!) by just pulling the string, and letting it gently fall back. The instructions specifically state not to dry fire the bow. He can shoot a few arrows at a time now before his arms just tire out, but I expect he will get stronger quickly and be able to shoot all day. The great thing about the compound bow is when he pulls it back and the cams roll over, he only has to hold half the weight of the draw. The construction seems solid and it feels like this will be around for years. I have shot several arrows myself, and it doesn't seem very acurate, but the the bow is very small in my hands and the handle is actually smaller than my hand so I cannot get a real good grip on it. I give it 4 stars for the solid construction and price.I agree with other reviewers that the arrows are very cheap; but for those that complain about the missing sights...its there, you just have to look harder because there is nothing on the packaging telling you what it is. The sight is a small black screw on sight that is mounted right onto the plastic packaging, with no literature or anything telling you what it is; I found it just by luck, wondering what it was. You have to unscrew it from the package, and it just looks like part of the package, then you mount it to the bow. I will be buying better arrows because the stones and ledge in our backstop will surely destroy the ones that miss our target.
