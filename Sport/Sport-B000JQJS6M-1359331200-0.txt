review/summary: Great Looking, Great Price, Great for a small Wrist!review/text: Originally, I had my doubts about ordering a watch online however this watch is both attractive and reasonably priced. It is perfect for any man or guy with smaller wrists or for anyone who simply likes a watch with a smaller face. It's not too bulky or in any way tacky and it's both classy and affordable! I bought this Invicta watch for a friend at Christmas and he immediately started to get complements on it from other people he ran into and even from the jeweler when he got the watch sized. It is a great investment and a very nice watch.
