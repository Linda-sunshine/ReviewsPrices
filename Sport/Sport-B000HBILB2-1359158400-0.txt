review/summary: Very nice for the pricereview/text: More than pleased with this item. Did the job of the very expensive ones for very cheap i wish I had bought a queen or full size model instead of the twin but even the twin is comfortable and large enough for one person. Fills up and deflates quickly and fits back into the back without much hassle. We'll see how it holds up over time but for the money you can't beat it.
