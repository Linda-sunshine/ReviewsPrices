review/summary: once you try these you will never want another brand of undiesreview/text: I first discovered these from a suggestion by an outdoors merchant for backpackers. I love them, and they are the only undies I wear. I also work a physically demanding job and they will keep you from chaffing when you sweat. Definitely worth the price. You can also wash them easily by hand and they dry quickly.
