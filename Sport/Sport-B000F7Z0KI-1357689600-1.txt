review/summary: Cool bottlereview/text: I bought one Polar bottle and one Camelback Big Chill water bottle. Both are very good and great value for money. I would recommend both of these, but if I had to pick one I would probably go for the Camelback. Bit better quality but you pay a few dollars more. Well worth the extra money. The Polar bottle keeps your drink cool but it makes this crinkling noise when you squeeze it. The Camelback is easier to squeeze and delivers the water in a nice stream. If you want to save a couple of bucks, buy the Polar, you won't be disappointed.
