review/summary: Needs clearer directions.review/text: It wasn't clear that there are extra metal crimps on the rope inside the handle. I was trying to get the existing one off to adjust the length, but it was impossible to get loose. I cut the rope just below the crimp, and when I pulled the rope out of the handle the replacement crimp fell out. The directions should really state this clearly.
