review/summary: My new go to boxersreview/text: For the past few years I've been a giant fan of the Under Armour boxer jocks, but these have knocked the UA's down a peg or two. Or three. The problem with the UA's has been the elastic band at the waist rolling down. That's probably got more to do with my gut then the boxers, but these ExOfficio pieces don't really do that. I've got some UA's that are a few years old (they last a heck of a long time) and they don't do that, but all of the more recent pairs I've purchased do.The material is as soft and silky as the best of the UA's, they're a little more expensive but definitely worth it, and they seem to be built well enough to last years as well. I would like a longer inseam but these haven't been bunching up like the shorter inseam UA's do either.Purchased per the sizing chart, fits great.
