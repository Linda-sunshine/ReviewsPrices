review/summary: An instant upgradereview/text: I did not realize how small the standard grip my AR was till I held the hogue. It fills the palm nicely and the texture (material) is fantastic. Do yourself the favor and make it one the first upgrades to your rifle. Remeber to get a gapper for a standard trigger gaurd or upgrade to an enhanced gaurd and eliminate the potential for snagging while wearing gloves or rubbing your middle finger from extended sessions.
