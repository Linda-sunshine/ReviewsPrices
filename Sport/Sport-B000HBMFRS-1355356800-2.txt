review/summary: Not impressedreview/text: This air mattress fulfills the basic purpose, but wasn't super comfortable. We kept rolling towards the middle. I'm not sure if all double high air mattresses do that, but I've never had that problem with low queen sized air mattresses. I'll try with a foam on top.
