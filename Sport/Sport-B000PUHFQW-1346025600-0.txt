review/summary: Excellent matreview/text: Excellent mat, for an unbeatable price. Its nice and soft. I have sensitive knees so i needed something thicker and this is perfect. It's a tiny bit slippery but just wipe it with a wet towel and it will be fine. No smell at all and great color choices. I got the one in dark purple. Very nice : ) 5 stars.
