review/summary: A great Hogue productreview/text: I have the larger version on my Glock 22 and always liked it. I got this for a Sig P290 because the grip is a little aggressive. It went on fine (ok, a bit of a pulling match, but that's to be expected) and fits very nice after a slight trim. No complaints.
