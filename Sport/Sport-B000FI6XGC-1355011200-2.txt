review/summary: Hard to use, wonderful when you figure it out.review/text: Like many users here I had trouble at first using this pump. I consider myself handy with tools and equipment. This however wasn't intuitive to use at first.1) The schrader valve "option" is not set at the factory. You have to disassemble the head area and flip the black piece to switch it from Presto to Scrader.2) On 99% of pumps the "lock" position is down on the clamp. This is opposite for this pump. You have to pull the lever away from the pump to get into the "T" position to lock it in place. I find that unscrewing the gray cap, sliding it over the valve, and then screwing back onto the pump works best.3)At first I thought this pump was hard to use because it required a lot of muscle to pressurize. I actually had it set up wrong. When properly pumping, it should be really easy with little to no resistance and your tire should fill up in no time.4)The little strap that hold the pump onto the clamp is an oring. Don't lose it! Although I imagine it would still require lots of force for the pump to dislodge from the clamp without it.
