review/summary: It's decentreview/text: As far as I can tell, yes, it does keep a good record of my steps.So why only four stars? Well, rarely it has been known to record steps from road trips. Then again, it says it will right in the owner's manual. So I have no right to complain about that.The safety leash has come off my belt/pants more than once. I've only dropped my pedometer once as a result, but it stills seems inconvenient considering the intended purpose.Those are both relatively small complaints. My only other one is that it doesn't keep track of steps as well when not in the included belt-clip holster and the size of this thing. If you scroll down far enough on the product page you will eventually see dimensions: .6 x 2.1 x 1.4. We're not talking about a tablet PC strapped to your belt, but it is noticeable, especially since it is such a light blue color. If the steps were as accurate in pocket as they are on the holster, I would have no problem with the size. This not being the case, I am only giving the product four stars.For the price that's still pretty good.
