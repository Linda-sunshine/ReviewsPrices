review/summary: Perfect blinky for my bike!review/text: This product is absolutely what I needed! Unfortunately most of my reflectors came off of my bicycle and I needed something that could be seen! And with the blinky light, I feel that everyone can see me as I'm riding, especially at night. I love the 2 light features (constant on or blink), but I always keep mine on blink. Great product and very happy with this purchase
