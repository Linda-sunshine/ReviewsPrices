review/summary: Great for basic needsreview/text: I purchased this monitor last year while training for a series of races and so far it has done everything that I've needed it to do. It's simple, straight forward and will meet the needs of most people who are your basic weekend warrior. I almost didn't purchase it because of some reviewers who said they had issues with interference, unreliable readings and poor contact from the chest strap, but I haven't experienced any of those problems in almost a year of use. A great product for someone who's just beginning to workout or who doesn't need anything too fancy to monitor their heart rate.
