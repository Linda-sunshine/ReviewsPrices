review/summary: Great gloves for law enforcementreview/text: I am an officer at a University. I can be in a cruiser, in and out of a cruiser, on traffic and/or on a foot beat. These gloves, although not made for strictly cold climates, do a solid job of keeping your hands warm. Not only that, but they are secure and keep my hands dry. Additionally, the price was great and they are durable. I had Damascus gloves that I only wore 4 times and the wrist strap ripped, the seams popped within a day, and the product was ripping within a week. These Hatch gloves are very durable and long-lasting so far. I will recommend these to any law enforcement professional.
