review/summary: Good Looking and comfortable watchreview/text: I was very impressed by the looks and weight of this watch. It also surprised me to discover it has a hacking type of Japanese automatic 24 jewel movement. (The second hand stops when the stem is pulled to set the time. Most japanese movements are non-hacking and 18-21 jewels) This watch gains about three seconds a day, not bad for an automatic watch of either Swiss or Japanese make. The band is a little light but seems very durable which keeps the weight down. Overall I am impressed with this watch and it is a keeper.Addendum:I purchased a watch winder from Amazon in early January 2013, a month after writing my initial review. I started keeping the watch in the winder at night instead letting the watch run off reserve. This particular watch has not lost or gained one second in the last four weeks. I have Swiss quartz watches that don't have this type of accuracy. The watch winder also helped improve the accuracy of my other automatic watches.I can't say whether the accuracy is typical of the movement of this particular watch or of the watches made from this movement. I will update this review if anything changes.
