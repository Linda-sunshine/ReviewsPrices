review/summary: Great EDC Knifereview/text: I have been researching for several weeks to buy an everyday carry knife and found the kershaw leek to be the best for value, price, quality, sharpness and looks.There are much better knives out there but are over $200. I personally wasn't going to spend that much on a EDC knife. For around $30 the leek is the best I could find. It's made in the USA, has lifetime warranty and free lifetime sharpening.You will not regret buying this knife. The best bang for your buck.
