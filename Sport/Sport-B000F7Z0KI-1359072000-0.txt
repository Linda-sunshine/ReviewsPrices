review/summary: Great Performance in a tough package.review/text: I have purchased Camelbak insulated bottles and Polar, both. I can't tell the difference between them. Polar quality is high. Insulation works great, lid and nozzle are simple to operate and the bottle is easy to clean. Fits great in my bottle cage for my road bike.
