review/summary: A must have upgrade...get one for sure!!!review/text: Fit perectly on my AR (Bushmaster M4A3). Feels great...much better than original. No issues as others have had. Very snug fit. Took about 3 mins to install. A great upgrade for the price. Thought about putting one on a long time ago...wish I had...glad I finally did. I plan on putting these on all my AR's. Very pleased with this product...you will be too!!
