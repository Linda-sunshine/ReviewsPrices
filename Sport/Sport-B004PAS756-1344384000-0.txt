review/summary: Great for a busy lifestyle!review/text: I'm married, work full time, and have two kids under the age of 3. I have no time to do 40+ minutes of working out during the day, but I really wanted to maximize the time I DO have by finding an intense workout that hits all the regions. Insanity Fast & Furious is that workout for me! I Love it! After squeezing this workout into different parts of my days for the past two months I have seen tremendous results. My arms are stronger, my Abs are harder, and my legs are looking tight! I highly recommend this if you are short on time but want to do SOMETHING to get or stay in shape.Regarding the posts about poor quality, my DVD has always played fine but I ordered it direct from BEACHBODY. I highly recommend doing that because you get a free membership and many other benefits (including an assigned beachbody coach!).I'd also like to point out to those that tried this and couldn't get past the first five minutes....I couldn't either!! So True!! But the next day I pushed play again and got through a little more, and the day after I got a little further.....now 2 months in I am keeping up with Shaun T (OK, I admit I still need a little break here and there!). When I am done with this workout I feel like I played an entire soccer game- my face is beat red, I'm drenched in sweat, my legs are a little rubbery, and I end up with TONS of energy for hours afterwards. This workout combined with high protein/low carb eating has resulted in a 15 pound weight loss for me in just 2 months :-)Once again- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (if you're busy like me).
