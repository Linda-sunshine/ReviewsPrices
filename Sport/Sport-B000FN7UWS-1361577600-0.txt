review/summary: Just the right size, stylish, and functionalreview/text: This has to be one of my most useful purchases ever. I bring this water bottle with me everywhere: to the gym, to class, to teach, to my office hours. It's cute, and just the right size. The color (Reef Blue) is vibrant and fun, but doesn't stand out too much. I love the sport cap, and the more traditional loop cap for Klean Kanteen. Both work excellently.
