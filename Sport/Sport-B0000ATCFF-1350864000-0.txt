review/summary: Great shoes!review/text: I've been wearing Chuck Taylors since the mid-80's but this is my first pair with a black outsole (all others have been the standard off white). I went to a party over the weekend in a backyard that was very little grass, mostly dirt, and was able to just wipe off the outsole with a damp cloth. If I had gone in shoes with an off white outsole, they would have been trashed. I also like the fact that these seem just a litle more "dressy" than most canvas Chuck Taylors. Highly recommended.
