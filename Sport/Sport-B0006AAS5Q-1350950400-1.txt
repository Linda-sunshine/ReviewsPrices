review/summary: Nearly great watchreview/text: It is a good looking watch for everyday office wear. Great Value for money spent. I would just refrain from giving it a 5 start rating purely because of its complicated locking mechanism. I find it cumbersome and complicated. Apart from that good watch, great value for money and like wearing it.
