review/summary: Overall, I'm happy with the purchasereview/text: I purchased 2 Leek knives at the same time. Both arrived very sharp, but one of the knives didn't flip open very easily. I gave the good one to my brother, and kept the faulty one. I say faulty, but it wasn't bad enough to send back. I will take it apart to see if I can fix the problem.Pros:SharpLight weightThinStylishCons:One of the knives didn't flip open very easily.
