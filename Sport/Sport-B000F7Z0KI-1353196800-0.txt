review/summary: Good productreview/text: Well, what can I say. This is my 4th Polar bottle. Why the 4th? Because my wife keeps losing them when we go out. Anyway, love the bottles, keeps the liquid cool and my 5 year old daughter doesn't like to drink warm water. Saves me money from having to buy chilled bottle water everytime we go out on a trip. I also keep one for myself to use on my bike. Great product.
