review/summary: Works, Is cheap, but I just don't like itreview/text: I've used ths leash for about 6 months now, after the plastic clip on the original leash broke after only a few months of use. It works well, but it is clunky and ugly. My strap did not have writing on, but it is super long, made of cotton, and is now pilling and picking up fluff etc. I hate the look and feel of it. The metal clip is large and not as easy to attach as the original, though at least it hasn't broken yet. I really wish I could buy a replacement like the original, with a nylon strap and plastic clip. No matter where I search though, every result comes back with one of these... If anyone knows where to find something different, I'd be glad to know. Four stars for price and the fact that it actually does the job.
