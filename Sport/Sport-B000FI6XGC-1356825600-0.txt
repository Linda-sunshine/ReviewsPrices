review/summary: Confused me at first but now I adore this thingreview/text: Winter was right around the corner when I bought this so I haven't been able to use the pump much. Although it hasn't stood a harsh test of time, the results are still impressive. With little effort, this tiny pump does a great job of filling the tires on my road bike. It's also super lightweight so the form factor makes it easy to attach to the bike or carry around without much burden. The clamp it comes with is also a nice albeit standard feature. Nice price to tie things all together. Highly recommended!
