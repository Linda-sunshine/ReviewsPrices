review/summary: Handy but Lid hard for kidsreview/text: I have sent my 2 kids (11 and 8) to school with this at least once a week for the past year. It has held up very nicely and keeps the food fairly warm for 5-ish hours. I have sent spaghetti, mac and cheese, and soups. My only complaint is that it is pretty difficult for my kids to re-screw the lid on perfectly themselves. Therefore, if there is any leftover soup, it will leak out all over their lunchbox or backpack. Not so great. It took a bit of practice for even ME to be able to screw it on perfectly! LOL! Anyhow, overall its been a very handy thing to have and the kids like taking this to school.
