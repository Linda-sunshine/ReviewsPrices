review/summary: Nutsreview/text: I cannot rate how this chair actually works because I did not get that far. The chair comes with a thin metal rod with threads at each end that is designed to be bolted to the body of the chair. I presume this metal rod is a key safety feature to the chair to hold the ball on the base. There are four nuts provided with the chair that are supposed to be used to secure the rod to the chair housing. Unfortunately, not one of the nuts would screw onto the rod. They were too small or possibly the paint job on the rod made the treads too thick for the nuts to screw onto. Not even using a wrench other than the flimsy one would allow the nuts to screw onto the rod. I am returning the chair tomorrow.
