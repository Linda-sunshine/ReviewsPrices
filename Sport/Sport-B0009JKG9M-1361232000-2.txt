review/summary: Portable bread ovenreview/text: I bought three of these to bake bread while I wait for my husband to build the woodburning oven in our backyard (the one he promised me two years ago).I just cut a round piece of parchment to put on the shallow pan and put my formed bread onto that. I put the deeper pan in the oven as it heats and then put it on top when I put my bread in to bake. I bake the bread twenty minutes with the lid on, then 25 minutes with the lid off. I get an oven rise that tears at the scores leaving a thin crisp ridge. The crisp caramel-colored crust contrasts with the creamy moist white interior of the loaf.I've used other Dutch ovens but this is the best. No more burns from placing my bread into the pan or removing it. I also like that I can stack three of them easily and they're a lot less expensive than the enameled ones.My sourdough breads are coming out gorgeous! Maybe I don't need that woodburning oven after all.
