review/summary: Great quality, Hard to adjust.review/text: Had no problems w/ delivery (and I live in The Bahamas). The high quality of the rope is noticed upon opening the package. BUT, my major issue (like some of the other consumers state), is adjusting the rope. Wish it was easier to adjust. I ordered the right length 9' for my height 5' 11" meaning I should NOT have to adjust it @ all but I do and the caps (on the package it says to remove them) on both ends won't budge, I'm stuck and honestly thinking of purchasing another rope.
