review/summary: Pro Diver (89260B)review/text: Despite a couple of negative reviews I was still keen to purchase this watch.I've had it for a couple of weeks now and am very happy.It did run a little fast for the first few days but has settled down and is thus far very accurate and I've been swimming a few times and haven't had any problems...I'll update my review again in a few months..
