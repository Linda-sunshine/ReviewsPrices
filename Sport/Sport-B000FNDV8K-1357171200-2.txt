review/summary: Every Key Ring Should have one!review/text: I use this little knife every day! From the tweezers, to the toothpick, to the scissors, and the file/screwdriver, and finally the actual knife, I use this on a daily basis. The scissors are a great piece of this knife! though they are small, they are sturdy enough to cut a finger nail, and sharp enough to do it cleanly and quickly. I also use them to cut paper if I dont have a large pair of scissors around, which this knife has no problem with. This swiss army knife is a great addition to any key ring. It makes a great gift for the someone giving on a budget (though I would give one of the solid color cheaper ones. The clearish ones are a little pricey). If I break this one I will order a new one right away; Get yourself one!
