review/summary: Great Compound Starter bow.....review/text: I bought this bow for my 16 year old son. He wanted to learn how to shoot a bow. I did not buy this on Amazon but at Academy. I bought him the Bone Collector version and he loves it. He wanted one since I got my Barnett Tomcat. I have modified my Tomcat and will modify his bow.I am 6'2 and love the Tomcat. He is 5'11 and the bow is perfect for him. As far as the other people posting on the arrows, they are not plastic, but fiberglass. My son took 25 draws this Christmas morning in the snow, and went through our wooden fence twice with them. It only comes with two arrows and one sight that is not all that great, but with some extra mods, it is well worth it.This bow is well worth the money as my seven year daughter,wife,fifeteen year old daughter and myself shot this today and had no trouble at all. For a starter bow, it is well worth every penny.If you want to teach your child, wife or anyone else to shoot a bow, then I would recommend this. With a few mods, it will be an awesome bow.
