review/summary: Poly loop cap rubber o-ring was stuck to the inner lip of the bottlereview/text: Once I had gotten the cap off, I noticed that the rubber o-ring that's supposed to be on the upper part of the cap was stuck inside the lip of the bottle, as if it were glued there. I gently pulled the o-ring off and put it back on the cap, but by then, damage had already been done to the o-ring. To give you an idea of how hard the o-ring was stuck to the bottle, bits of the o-ring were still left on the bottle when I pulled it off, almost like the glue left on a surface where a sticker has been pulled off.I do not understand why the o-ring was stuck inside the lip of the bottle.Amazon gave me a replacement with free 2-day shipping. The new bottle I got also has the o-ring stuck on the inner lip of the bottle, but I was a lot more careful in taking it off this time. It seems that they will all come like this (at least if you order the poly loop cap). Just be careful when you unscrew it for the first time, and peel the o-ring off slowly.I like Klean Kanteen's conservation efforts and their company image. This is the first water bottle I've ever ordered for myself; I've been re-using glass Snapple bottles for a long time...The bottle is great and of durable construction. I give a big thanks to Klean Kanteen for making such a fantastic bottle and to Amazon for such excellent customer service!
