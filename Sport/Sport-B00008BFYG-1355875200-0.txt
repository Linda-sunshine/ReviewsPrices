review/summary: sturdy, lightweight, FUN!review/text: I bought this for my 5-year-old nephew, and he was ecstatic. After some coaching, he was sailing around on it, having a ball. Sturdy construction that looks as though it will wear well. (the neighbors have a similar one that's a few years old that still works well.) It folds down to a small size, and it's lightweight (he can carry it around with ease). In my opinion, it was the ideal gift.
