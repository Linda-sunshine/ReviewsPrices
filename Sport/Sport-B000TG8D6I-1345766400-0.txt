review/summary: This is just the thing . . . for someone elsereview/text: I am used to difficult, gnarly workouts. P90X was totally manageable. I went through two full cycles and was starting a third when my body began protesting. My knees gave out unexpectedly and I had recurring pain in both shoulders. I had been careful about substituting for plyometrics and that kind of thing, but Tony still got the better of my joints. After stopping P90X my pain level dropped immediately, but it has taken more than a year for my body to get back to it's pre-P90X function.This is a fabulous, well-rounded program. The workouts are long and that can be difficult to schedule. The combination of yoga, aerobic, core, and weights/resistance is brilliant. Three weeks into the first cycle I added two inches to my biceps and no longer fit into my tailored blouses and jackets. The results are possible.Had this workout program not mauled my body I would rate it higher and would probably still be doing it.
