review/summary: Just buy them and quit comparing :)review/text: I think I first read about these in some of Tim Ferriss' writing. Every pair of goggles I've ever owned has leaked, been uncomfortable, broken far too easily, or some combination of these.These goggles are a completely different experience. The silicone eye cups fit and seal just like they should, the easy to adjust strap doesn't elicit a string of profanities when an adjustment is needed, and the hard case that comes with them means that they look just as good two years later. If you have a medium to large face, these are the goggles to get.
