review/summary: Awesome purchase!review/text: I love music and constantly listen to music. Wanted something that I could wear over my ear buds while I mow the lawn and vacuum my home. This earmuffs met and exceeded all my expectations. They are extremely sturdy. The only downside is that they may be a little tight for someone who has a larger than average head. I wear a 7 1/2 size hat and, though somewhat snug, I do not find wearing it uncomfortable.
