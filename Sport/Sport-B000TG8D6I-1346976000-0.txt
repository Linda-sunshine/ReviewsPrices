review/summary: I bought this for my son and he thought it was a great program!review/text: My son came home from college with some additinal unwanted weight gain and asked if I could get this for him. Of course after much research, I got the best price at Amazon. My son did the DVDs about 4 or 5 times a week and ran at the gym for 40 minutes everyday during the summer, and he lost 20 lbs and looked really good by the time he went back to school last week. My son said if you do these DVDs as instructed everyday for 90 days, you should see EXCELLENT results. I also know my son ate healthy all summer (because I was feeding him) and I believe this is a big part of seeing excellent results as well!
