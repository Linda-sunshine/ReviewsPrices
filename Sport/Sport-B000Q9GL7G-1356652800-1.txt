review/summary: not for all 1911's!review/text: I noticed that this holster was for all 1911and clones. I already have one for my Taurus 24/7 and love it so this was a no brainer. So here's the fine print. Nowhere does it state that it will not fit a 1911 with a 5" barrel and railed. Unfortunately, this is what i have. It's a great holster but buyers beware.
