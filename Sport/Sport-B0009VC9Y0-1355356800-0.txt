review/summary: Best knife I've ever owned!!!review/text: This Kershaw speed assist knife is by far the best knife I have ever owned!!! I always have my knife on me but, my last few knives have been way to thick. But this Kershaw is very slim!!!PROS: Slim design, great clip, awesome speed assist, lock for the blade when closed, very sharp!!!CONS: Not much of a grip on it is my only concern.OVERALL: This is a GREAT knife all around. Perfect knife for carrying with you all of the time that is super sharp!!!
