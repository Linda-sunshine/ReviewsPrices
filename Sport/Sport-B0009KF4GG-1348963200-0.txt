review/summary: Nothing Beats A Swiss Army Knife!review/text: I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it. He especially loves how easy it is to resharpen the knife blade. Without much effort he can get a razors edge on it that is literally sharp enough to shave with!I know this because my husband proved it to me and I saw him shave the hair in his arm after he sharpened the blade. Quite impressive and MacGyver like!
