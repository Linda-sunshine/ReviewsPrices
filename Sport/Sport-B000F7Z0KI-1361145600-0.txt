review/summary: Not just for cyclists!review/text: These water bottles are the best! I am a stay-at-home-mother of 2 toddlers. I was sick of not having a decent vessel for ice water. I have become a cup snob searching for the right one. I finally found it in the Polar Bottle. It keeps drinks cold for hours. Zero condensation. Easy one-handed drinking. It is not bulky, fits nicely in my diaper bag and does not leak. Fun color choices and squeezable. I love it so much that I got one for the whole family for Valentines Day. The 12 oz are a good size for kids, even my 14 month old does not have too much trouble with it. If you are having doubts, push them aside. You will not be disappointed. Only drawback-I was told we look a little corny carrying around our new bottles :)
