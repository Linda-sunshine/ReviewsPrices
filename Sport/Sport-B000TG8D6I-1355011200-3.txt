review/summary: brand new, slow shippingreview/text: I did not want to pay full price for P90X but was tired of using the poor quality burnt DVDs that someone gave me. I purchased this from a seller on Amazon and once I received the product, it was as described; still in the original package. However, the seller did not ship the package as quickly as they said they would and I waited over a week for the item. Shipping is the only reason this product and seller did not receive the full 5 stars. With that being said, P90X is quite the work out and time commitment! I cannot follow the program 6 out of 7 days a week because some days I am quite sore after my work out! You can still have great results by only following the program a few days a week. It is a great full body work out! I have found that you do not have to do EXACTLY what they do on the DVD, but instead do the best that you can and you will still have great results!
