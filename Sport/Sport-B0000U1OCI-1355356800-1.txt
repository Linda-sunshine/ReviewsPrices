review/summary: Omron pedometer bad clipreview/text: I love the functionality of the unit, and the 7 day memory. I have used it for 3 months now, the only drawback would be the clip. The clip keeps falling from my waste band, the clip should be longer with greater tension. I wish the unit came with a different clip, I would even buy another clip for this unit if available.
