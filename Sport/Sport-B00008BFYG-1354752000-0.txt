review/summary: Nice for Kidsreview/text: This is a solid, well built product. My Grandson was able to figure it out after a few hours of playing. The only drawback is that the adjustment levers are difficult for a 7 year old to apply the right amount of pressure to use, especially the lower folding lever. The top lever that adjusts the handle bar needs adjusting if you do not fully extend the handle bar, which for smaller kids needs to be done.Other than those 2 things, it works out great. As always, recommend a helmet for those occasional falls.
