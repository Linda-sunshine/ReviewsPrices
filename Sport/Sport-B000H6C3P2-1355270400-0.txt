review/summary: classic Hogue quality!review/text: this grip has the classic look and feel of the Hogue rubber overlay. greatly improves the appearance, feel and function of my ar15! I love the way this ergonomic grip fits my hand and the rubber overlay has a real quality feel and appearance. the grip fits the gun perfectly, just remember your safety selector spring is held in by the grip when removing your stock grip, I had never installed one before and it caught me by surprise.
