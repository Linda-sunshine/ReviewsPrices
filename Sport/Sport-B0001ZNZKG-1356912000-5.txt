review/summary: They are ok but not shorts for sportsreview/text: These breathe well but that is about all. I didn't test them as my only pair of underwear for 15 days like some reviewers so I can't testify to this. For me these are the worst of both worlds. They have no support like boxers and yet they still bunch up like boxer-briefs. I have only worn them once or twice and don't see wearing them again.
