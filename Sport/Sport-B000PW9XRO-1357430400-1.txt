review/summary: Great for shooting, well madereview/text: Needed a pair of gloves for shooting when it's cold out, and for light outdoor gloves. I have a CCW permit and if ever forced the last thing I want is to be fumbling with my carry piece and trying to get my finger in the trigger guard so these aren't just for the range. They fit very well, with the fingers being proper length and without the nasty little inside seam on the fingers that makes me nuts. While they're not the warmest gloves they are better than nothing and they still allow you to have enough dexterity to operate a firearm proficiently.As a side note a week or two I was adjusting the glass pane on my screen door when it was cold out. The pane shattered when I pressed on it and my hand went completely through it. After picking up the glass I looked at the gloves and noted a big slash across the knuckles. Had I not been wearing these I would have definitely been getting stitches that day. I will be buying another pair, these gloves are pretty awesome.
