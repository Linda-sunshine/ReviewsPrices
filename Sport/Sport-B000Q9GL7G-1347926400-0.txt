review/summary: Serpa has never let me downreview/text: There is a reason why more than 70 people have rated this holster at 5 stars... I have one for my Beretta 92FS 9mm and my PX4 Storm .45 ACP. The fit is great and the padel holster is very comfortable. Secure retention, quick draw, comfortable... Can't complain.
