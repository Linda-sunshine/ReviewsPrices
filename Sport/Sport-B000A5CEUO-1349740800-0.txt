review/summary: As Expectedreview/text: This heart monitor is exactly what I needed and expected it to be. A quick read-through of the manual made it easy to get started and the controls are pretty much intuitive. It is water resistant and feels durable. The transmitter belt is very comfortable, and I often forget I'm wearing it. This displays time and has a stop watch feature which is nice. It comes with a great little pouch that everything fits into as well.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it is a little bulky around my wrist (but this is not that big of a deal) and the directions were not as clear on finding and setting your target heart rate zone. I did some research on my own and found a calculation for this that works for me. Good product, fast shipping, satisfied customer. Also this may be a turn-off for some of you, but I agree with those that recommend using saliva as opposed to plain water when lubricating the transmitter belt. I found this gave me more accurate readings.
