review/summary: Fell apart within a weekreview/text: I guess the foam is what matters so I left a star on there for kicks since it was still &#34;safe&#34; but this product is terrible. I ordered this helmet to save some money. I got what I paid for. The plastic designs pasted on top of the foam peeled off within a week of being in air conditioning and having had no use. I am hesitant to argue its safety because I have yet to risk it but I wouldn't trust the workmanship. I wouldn't recommend this product at all. It looked great out of the package but that's where the positives end.
