review/summary: They do the jobreview/text: I had just replaced my handgrips on my bike and needed to plug the bar ends. I also wanted mirrors for driving in traffic. These mirrors solved both of my problems. They work well once you have them lined up properly and tightened so they don't move out of adjustment when going over bumps in the road. They do make your bike wider, so you will need to find just the right tightness so you can swivel them inward when you need to pass through tight spaces, but they will still be in the right position when swiveled back out.
