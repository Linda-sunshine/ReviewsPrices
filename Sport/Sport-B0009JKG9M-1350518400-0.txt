review/summary: Great Dealreview/text: I bought this as a surprise for my husband, for a camping trip, and he absolutely loves it! The quality is great and can't beat the price. The fact that the lid can also be a pan, makes it more of a 2 for 1 deal. We have seasoned ours after a couple of uses, and it just gets better.
