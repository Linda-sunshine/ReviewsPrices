review/summary: Best underwear ever?review/text: I wouldn't wear it every day because the synthetic feels less comfortable than cotton, but I wore these for three days straight on a camping trip and they were incredible. First, they were secure but loose enough to breathe. They dry extraordinarily rapidly and even after three days did not smell a bit. Excellent buy for camping, backpacking, or traveling. Whatever is in these boxers is magic.
