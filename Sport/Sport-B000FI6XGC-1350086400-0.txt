review/summary: Good pump for emergency use onlyreview/text: Product is good for emergency use, not for replacement for a floor pump as it is difficult to ever reach 120 PSI with the small handle. You wouldn't know if you reaches it anyway, considering that there is no gauge.Topeak should have advised customers to mount it upside down because when I was riding, the pump lock disengaged and it slides out. Got badly scratched by my chain and chain ring until I discovered what happened.How to switch the pump from presta to the schrader type requires some brains or research to find out because the diagram on the packaging is not really clear.Should also mount it on the left side instead of the right for two reasons.1. In case for any reason it flies off the mount (very unlikely unless the rubber strip that secures the pump broke), it will not jam your drive train abruptly.2. For any reason that you forgot to turn it upside down on the mount, even if the pump slides out, it will post a lesser danger since it is away from your drive train.
