review/summary: Slanted sleep !review/text: I've bought a number of cheaper air beds and this Intex is the only bed that FAILED after only 6 months. A chamber inside tore through & the result was the complete right side of the bed became 6 inches TALLER then the reft side. IMPOSSIBLE to sleep OBVIOUSLY.GARBAGE. Even the 29.00 Coleman cheapie never did this !Don't waste 55.00 bucks on this . Could not even return this rubber junk.
