review/summary: wanna go for a walk?review/text: Love all features of this product. The readout is easy to see, and love the built in clock. The reset at midnite is very convenient (who goes walking after midnite except Patsy Cline?)The lanyard is just the right length and can be stuffed in any pocket after you attach the clip. Just a dandy product.
