review/summary: Very pleased.review/text: Maybe the best goggles I have owned. They fit snugly and stay clear, frost and fog free (I somtimes use an outdoor pool at night). After a session my eyes used to look like I'd had a drunken binge. The chlorinated water kills me. No leaks,so no effect with these well fitting goggles. However, and there's always a however, one small problem that may affect a few people like me is when I spend my swim sessions alternating breathing. Going from side to side I seem to get tiny leaks but it does not happen otherwise. Buy 'em. You'll like'em.
