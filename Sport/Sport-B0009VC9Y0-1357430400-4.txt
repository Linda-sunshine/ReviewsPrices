review/summary: Great knifereview/text: This knife has a wickedly sharp blade and is comfortable in the hand. The thin tip means that I probably won't use it for really heavy cutting where I would be afraid of bending or breaking the tip. That thin tip is great for small spots and more detailed cutting, though. The framelock system is wonderful and easy to use. The only reason I didn't give the knife a 5 was that the opening mechanism was very stiff out of the box, and I have yet to adjust the screws to make it as easy to open as it should.
