review/summary: Good shorts, but sizing is all wrongreview/text: Bought a Medium pair couple of years ago. Perfect. This time, another medium -- waist was 5&#34; larger than the previous medium! Had to order a small this time to match what was medium two years ago. OK folks, waist size is expanding in the US, but not this much. Have to think they are mislabeling these at the factory. Still, once I got the right fit, they are great gym shorts!
