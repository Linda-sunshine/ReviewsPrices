review/summary: "GOOD PADDING TRAINING GLOVES"review/text: I have this gloves one year ago,but looks like new,the leather is very resistant.I training 3 times in a week,and this have good padding,grip,and its very confortable.No pain in my hands when i lifting heavy weights.I think its need more ventilation.The Large size its ok for my big hands.This is a good pair of gloves for $13 bucks you dont find nothing better.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!
