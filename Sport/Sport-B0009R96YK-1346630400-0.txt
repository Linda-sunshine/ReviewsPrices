review/summary: Nice mirror for the price, but you may need to lube the cap screwsreview/text: I was looking for a simple mirror that wasn't too expensive and this one did just that. I was also interested in something that would not break if the bike tipped, so the option to mount this toward the "inside" of the handlebar instead of the outside was attractive to me.I noticed some of the negative reviews centered on the mounting "screws" being too tight and of a non-standard size. I found this to be true for me as well. The cap screws would only go in a couple turns before binding up and making me fearful of breaking the plastic parts. I tried to "clean" the threads with a metric tap and die but it appeared to be 4mm x .8, which I did not have. In desperation I sprayed some teflon lubricant onto the threads. This worked wonderfully and I was able to connect all parts with the supplied hex-wrench without fear of breakage.This will now allow my wife to see how far I am behind her when we ride! :-)
