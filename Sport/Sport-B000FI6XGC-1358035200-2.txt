review/summary: great pumpreview/text: great little pump. has no problem getting my tires up to the proper pressure (some other pumps I have used have difficulty passing 60psi, mine recommend 80). comes with a great bracket to hold it on to a bike, and the handle twists to lock in place so it doesn't bang around. only complaint is I wish it had an integrated pressure indicator, but for the price can't expect everything and overall very satisfied.
