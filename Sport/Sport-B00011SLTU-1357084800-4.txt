review/summary: no more frustrating packagesreview/text: Aging is making me less able to open cellophane peanut packages, salad plastic dishes from the grocery, other packages that are getting so hard to open. Having the small handy scissors right there on my car key holder is so handy. I wish that it would be allowed on the airlines, though.
