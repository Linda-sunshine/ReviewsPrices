review/summary: Great Valuereview/text: I had been wanting to buy cast iron cookware for a while but was hesitant because of the price. When I saw this set on amazon I decided to buy it because it was like getting two pieces of cookware for less than the price of one in my local stores. I've had them for four months and cook with them often. I did a few batches of meat in them to help fully season them (they are technically pre-seasoned, but I would still cook with them a few times to get them to a properly seasoned level). As for washing, just let it soak in hot water for a few minutes and use a scouring pad (without soap). They clean pretty easily. Be sure to dry them promptly after washing or else they could rust.
