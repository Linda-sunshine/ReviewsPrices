review/summary: Received as a Giftreview/text: A good friend of mine knew that I had started a walking program and knew that I was looking for a "better" pedometer...and she found it! One of the best birthday gifts that I received this year.1. I tested it against the monitor tied to my treadmill. It actually reads 0.98 miles for every 1.0 mile my treadmill records.2. I love that it differentiates between "walk" and "aerobic walk."3. I love the way the machine resets -- everyday at midnight. Simple and easy.4. I love the double clasp: the regular clip-on and the snap clip. Saved me from losing it no less than 7 times while I was walking around WDW.5. Set up was easy. Was complete in under 10 minutes.All in all - BIG step up from my previous one. Recommend.
