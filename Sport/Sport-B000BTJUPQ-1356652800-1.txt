review/summary: Decent beginner bowreview/text: Bought this for my daughters, for Christmas, I tried sighting it in with the pin sight (I'm not an archer) but could not attain any real accuracy, bow seems to fire low and to the left every time. My youngest daughter (11) has been shooting with it for three days now, she can consistently hit a 3' by 6' target from about 35'. The small air rifle targets I purchased (elsewhere) are pretty much worthless for shooting this bow. The arrow rest is very difficult to keep an arrow on, practice does help, but I will probably end up buying an arrow rest that cost nearly as much as the bow to help my daughters. My daughter (couch potato) had some trouble with the draw weight (18lbs.) at first but she pulls it back with no trouble now. By spring I believe we'll be ready for a better bow, but this is just fine for getting them interested in archery. Oh and be sure to buy more arrows (28 inch), it's amazing how quickly they get lost.
