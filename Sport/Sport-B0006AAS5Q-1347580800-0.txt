review/summary: Yep it's a Watchreview/text: A great looking watch. I received a lot of compliments on its look. Comes with a lot of extra links and I had to pay someone to get the extra links removed so it would fit my wrist. So figure an extra charge for that (cost me $10). Other than that, it was great!
