review/summary: Good for monitoring rate. Does the job rightreview/text: I got the watch just couple of weeks ago.I use this only for my constant monitoring rate, I wear two watches when run and bike now. One I have to click the bottom to read my heart rate and this one allow me to constantly monitoring without interruption of pace. I compare my rate before and after exercises and both are the same. I also compare it with my blood pressure monitor(http://www.amazon.com/Omron-HEM-712CLC-Automatic-Pressure-Monitor/dp/B0009XQUE8/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid;=1348065552&sr;=8-13&keywords;=blood+pressure+monitor) and the rate of the monitor and the watch are just one or two points different, so for accurate I give it a 5 stars. With respect to the warp I read some concerns about the accuracy before the sweating take place. I found that putting a little bit of water between you skin and the chest sensor is more than enough.The only thing is a little bit more complete screen will be good, but what else I can ask for this price and the accuracy.I any case I just use it for monitoring my heart rate and keep myself on the zone in which my heart is not working to hard and also to improve my endurance and health in general.I just forget to mention I am a heavy weight guy, moving 220 lb running and biking, so heart rate monitoring become an important issue.So overall if you are a amateur like me and just do exercises for improving your health and reducing your weight this is the best option providing you enough accuracy and excellent price.
