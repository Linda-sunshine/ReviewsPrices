review/summary: Great productreview/text: They certainly work, but definitely recommend wearing gloves that have zipper pocket on outside of glove to place heat warmer--they need exposure to air to generate heat. I shoved them in my gloves while skiing & had to take my gloves off on the lift to get them to warm up. They did get hot once exposed to air--so my hands remained warm while skiing back down the slopes. A pain to take off your gloves every time though, especially if not wearing liners.
