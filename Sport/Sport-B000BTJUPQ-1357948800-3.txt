review/summary: Great price, but the bowstring is cheap roap material.review/text: My son loves this. The draw weight is perfect for my nine year old son. My only complaint is the bowstring. Its this cheap rope like material instead of the normal style bow string. I will have to restring the bow but for the price it is a great buy.
