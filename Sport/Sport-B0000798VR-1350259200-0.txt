review/summary: Runs big, beautiful design and color!review/text: Bought this for my cousin, he said it an big about half to a whole size. He's an 8.5 and i bought him the 8.5 and its big on him but he was fine with it since he wears thick socks anyway. The color black was really nice and the design as well. As for the quality, can't speak for it right now since we just got it but so far upon close inspection when i got the shoes, it look durable and made well so hopefully it'll last long.
