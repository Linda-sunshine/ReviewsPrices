review/summary: Beautiful watch. Looks just like the Rolex Submariner.review/text: Upon opening the box this watch looks amazing. The blue dial is very nice with the color changing to a blueish purple depending on the light. The band looks very nice and is of good quality. The Bezel numbers look just like the one in the submariner. Mine came with the Seiko NH35A movement which is of excellent quality and has the hacking mode. If I dont wear the watch for 2 days, it stops, but thats fine because all you have to do is set the time and date and move the watch and it starts. You can also manualy wind it by unscrewing the crown and turning it clockwise. I have other more expensive watches than the invicta 8928ob but I find myself wearing this one more than the others. A lady at church already asked me if it was a real Rolex. There will be a time when God will give me one. In the meantime, I really like this one and believe that will have many years of use.
