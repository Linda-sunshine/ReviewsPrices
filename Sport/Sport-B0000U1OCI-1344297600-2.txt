review/summary: Oversensitive and inaccuratereview/text: I bought this product reading all the great reviews but was sorely disappointed. Setting up the pedometer is easy.However the device is outrageously inaccurate in calculating the steps. I think it is oversensitive to movement. Even the slightest motion causes it to count it as a step. Even when you are walking normally it will over count the steps by almost 200%.It is a good "toy" but useless if you want to keep measure and track your walking.
