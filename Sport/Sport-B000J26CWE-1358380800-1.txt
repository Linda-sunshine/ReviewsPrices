review/summary: Comfortable but...review/text: I've been wearing these for a week now in my Fila skeletons and they are comfortable but I do not think the toes will hold up. I think the toes need extra reinforcement. They are ok for a walkabout but I would not recommend for anything more rigorous. Post script: 2/21/2013. I was right they do not stand up to day in day out wear.
