review/summary: Walking with Omronreview/text: My last pedometer, also Omron, finally when to the junkyard in the sky. Bought this; was interested in the hook-up to the downloadable internet program. The pedometer is ok; seems accurate. The program is disappointing. Have to change your weight in the pedometer, which is sort of a pain. Does good for steps.
