review/summary: Bouncin'review/text: I got this rope so I could use it for exercise, as well as to play with my kids outside. It's perfect. Although hurts like heck when you hit your ankle with it. LOL But it's excellent and I highly recommend it. The only drawback to this rope is it holds its shape from shipping...
