review/summary: was worried what I would get , they say( Hi Top), but picture the low ones.review/text: I purchased from the photo. was in a hurry that day. Glad they where the low ones he wanted. novelty item. My son wanted them , he is 30 yrs old. A fun item he used to have many years ago. the size recomendations was correct. 1/2 size smaller was just right.... Not the Hi Tops they state in the add.
