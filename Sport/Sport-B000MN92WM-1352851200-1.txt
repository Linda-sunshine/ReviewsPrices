review/summary: Love this pedometerreview/text: Great pedometer. Use it every day. Ability to download data to my PC is so easy & being able to view that data by day, week, month, year or total is really helpful to monitor progress. If I were to ask for any changes it would be to add a speed calculation based on distance & time walked. I'm currently walking 250 miles per month and walk a mile every 14 minutes.
