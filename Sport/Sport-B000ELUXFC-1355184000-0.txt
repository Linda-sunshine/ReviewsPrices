review/summary: Worst Rack Ever! Bad Customer Service!review/text: My car is on the list of cars this product is approved for however my trip was ruined because of this product, and my bike is too!Do not make the same mistake as me. I installed this on my car as directed by the video and put 2 bikes on it. As soon as I hit the highway the bikes came loose, dragging along the freeway. What a nightmare! One bike was totally ruined, the other did not get damaged much. In addition, I was out on the freeway trying to get the bikes back on as cars zoomed by at deadly speeds. We took the bikes home (driving slowly and avoiding any bumps) and were very late for our trip.If I could give this product a 0, I would!I returned the product to Amazon without a problem - they are always great..When I called the Allen company to complain that they broke my bike, they told me they cannot help me because I had returned the &#34;defective rack&#34; to Amazon. The rack was not defective, there was nothing visibly wrong with it. I should have spent the extra money and got the Thule rack. Lesson learned, now I need a new bike and a Thule bike rack.
