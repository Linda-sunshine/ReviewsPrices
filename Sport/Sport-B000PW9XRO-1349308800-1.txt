review/summary: OK for what you pay.review/text: This is my feedback on "Hatch Specialist All-Weather Shooting/Duty Glove, Large, Black" gloves that I received today from Amazon. It fits nice and snug and does not feel awkward to handle a shotgun in the open range. It does feel slightly uncomfortable (warm) in the indoor range, probably because the neoprene fabric does not breathe; and it is not very convenient to load a handgun magazine. However, I prefer to use cotton gloves in the indoor range, so thats not an issue for me. Overall I think it is good value for maoney.
