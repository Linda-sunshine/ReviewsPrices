review/summary: Very cozy and perfect for the desert i live in or any climatereview/text: I was a bit skeptical about the price. I have many different pairs of non cotton boxer briefs and these could be my new favorite. Lots of material, thick waist band and great fit make these a great thing for everyday use. If they last a long time, (the sturdy construction makes me think should) then they are worth costing 50 percent more than the type at big box stores. I hope the anti micro bacterial aspect of these is just a bonus since i am happy without finding out if they don't get funky when it gets hot out. :)
