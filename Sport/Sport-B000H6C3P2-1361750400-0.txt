review/summary: Good as any Hogue gripreview/text: You can't beat Hogue for sticky grips, and this one does well. It was inexpensive and easy to install. The only issue? Stick an o-ring sealed cap on the bottom with a rubber strap or snap so you can store small items inside of it! (Other do it, so why can't Hogue?) BUT-Hogue's reputation for quality when it comes to firearms grips can't be surpassed, so it's still a great buy.
