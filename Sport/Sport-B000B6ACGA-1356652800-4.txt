review/summary: A good shufflers is hard to find!review/text: All of the 6-deck shufflers, for home use, appear to be the same. They work OK, for the most part, initially but soon start having problems. More often than not you must guide the shuffled cards so tat they do not go sideways and jam up. It works, that's for sure, but I cannot sy tat it works well. I would rather pay a higher price and get a more reliable machine.
