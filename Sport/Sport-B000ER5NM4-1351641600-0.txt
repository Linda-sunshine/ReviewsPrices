review/summary: Not True to Sizereview/text: I like the material and design of these pants. Unfortunately, they are way too small. I ordered my size, according to the size chart, but they arrived and as soon as I pulled them out of the package I just folded them up and put them back in the bag. I know for a fact, they wouldn't even go over my hips. I ordered a 2X, they look like a large (at most).
