review/summary: Was great while it worked.review/text: This air mattress was a great solution to our guest-room-less dilemma. We bought it in February of 2012, and it worked great for the first few guests that came to stay with us. I even slept on it myself and found it quite comfortable, without even adding an additional mattress topper. By July, however, we took it with us on a vacation. We attempted to set it up on the carpeted floor of our rental house, and it looked and felt like it had inflated properly. When my husband and I woke up around 3AM hammocked in the middle of the bed with our backs and bottoms touching the floor, however, we realized there was a leak. We checked all the seams and support &#34;beams,&#34; but could not find even the tiniest pinhole where air could be seeping from. Thankfully we didn't have any of the bulging issues other reviewers have had, but a slow leak will render an air mattress just as useless. Of course it worked until we really needed it, then failed. We're now looking for a new mattress for some upcoming houseguests, and we can't decide if Intex is the brand to go with or not.
