review/summary: Another Great Planet Bike Product...review/text: I have had this for around 9 months now and I use it approximately once every week or so. This little light is very bright! With 3 Led lights it has a good long range of distance to be seen. Cars will definitely see you if you have one of these rear lights.The material is very sturdy and strong, in fact it is so sturdy you can't really open the light to put the batteries into unless you have a coin. This can be a bit annoying, but it is also a good thing because you know that your light is going to be intact and not fall off in rough roads.The battery life on this is really great. I have not yet changed the batteries on it since the first day that I bought it and it still works like it did on the first night I used it. Planet Bike is known to have one of the best accessories for bicycles and it shows in their products. This isn't the first Planet Bike light that I buy and every time I do buy one I am never disappointed. If you are planning on buying a Rear light for your bicycle or any kind of light at all I recommend these lights. I hope this review helped you out!
