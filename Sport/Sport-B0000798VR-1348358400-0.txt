review/summary: Ripped less than a year later with minimal usereview/text: I wore these shoes to the gym (powerlifting requires flat soles) no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time. After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped (on the opening, between the toe and heal, inside edge).Guess I'll skip the lo top next time.
