review/summary: As good as it gets.review/text: While shopping around for a holster the Blackhawk Serpa was mentioned frequently, so I tried it out. Accessories are fairly rare for the Sig SP2022 so I was glad Blackhawk had one for mine.Not sure what else to say - it does its job and does it well. The retention is very secure, and requires a natural grip and button push to draw. You'll need to practice the draw to make sure you get the right grip each time, though. The button requires a FIRM push, or else you'll find yourself tugging at your gun. Another nice safety feature is that the button assembly of the holster fully covers the trigger, completely preventing you from pressing it by accident during the draw while promoting correct finger positioning.If there's one downside to it, it's that this holster does not allow for the use of any rail accessories. You're better off with a non-specific leather holster in that case.
