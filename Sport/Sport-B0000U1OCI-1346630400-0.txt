review/summary: Love it!review/text: This pedometer works just great. One of my favorite features is the fact that it keeps track of the data for 7 days. I like to keep a log of my exercise but some days I am busy and don't have a chance to do so. No problem - I can just check back on the pedometer. As for the 'belt clip' about which some reviewers complained, I see NO PROBLEM. I keep the pedometer in my pocket and just clip it to the pocket edge - it has never come loose. I agree that the clip would not attach to the thickness of a leather belt, but if you want to attach it to your belt, the solution is simple - just loop the strap around the belt and then attach the clip back to the strap.
