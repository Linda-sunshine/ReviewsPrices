review/summary: Don't think about it, buy it!review/text: To say I've got my $$s worth from these DVDs would be a huge understatement. I used to hate doing weights and Tony Horton has made me a convert, not like the new evangelical being type of convert , but I've definitely gone from loathe to tolerable. The thing about p90x is it can be modified and unlike Insanity, you have sufficient breaks that even the beginner can keep up. I was already somewhat fit, but this has made more aware of a). My diet and B). The importance of training various muscle groups. There is more to life than cardio alone, although hard to believe. I'm learning.
