review/summary: Great fabric, run a tad smallreview/text: Bought these because everyone mentioned how LONG they were. I am 5'10 and hate spending $20 more for longs or talls, so I ordered these. Like them but I don't find them all that long. In fact I hope they don't shrink in length, or I will be out $19. Suggest buying a size larger as they don't stretch as much as standard lycra-sorts of yoga pants. Love the fabric. Nice product.
