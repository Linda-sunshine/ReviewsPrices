review/summary: Love this double-duty pan set!review/text: I received this as a gift for Christmas after it had spent several years on my wish list. In that time, I've used it over a dozen times, and I can safely say that I love this set for several reasons:1. It's a skillet, it's a pan, no wait, it's a dutch oven!2. Handles on each side make it easier to lift cast iron3. Nothing sticks if you use it properly.Now, that being said, there are a few drawbacks:* It's a little on the small side.* The skilled handles seem to be just a little too short (plan to use 2 hands whenever you move it)Do I recommend it? Absolutely! For the price, you really can't go wrong.
