review/summary: Great knifereview/text: This is a great knife. The smoothness and quickness of the opening mechanism is truly impressive and will surprise you the first time you do it correctly.My only negative is the safety lock; mine is hard to unlock with one hand. Perhaps some adjustment will take care of that, still very happy with it.
