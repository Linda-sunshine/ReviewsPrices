review/summary: Klean Kanteen serves the purposereview/text: These water bottles work as any other water bottle to provide clean, wholesome, filtered water without the worry of chemicals leaching into the water from plastic. However, I ordered the sports tops because I like the convenience, especially in the car, and the water makes a squeaky noise coming out as the air goes in which is not appropriate in many settings. Also I ordered the 20 oz and find it is not big enough. I was worried the 40 oz w3ould be to big to fit the cup holders in the car. I find the water does not stay cold as long in the metal container as in plastic, but that is a tradeoff for the health benefits. The metal container also sweats more than plastic. Overall, while the bottles have some downsides, I will keep using them and they are a convenient way of getting the "healthy" filtered water I want.
