review/summary: Swiss Army Knifereview/text: I bought this knife to give to my nephew in a year or two. He is 10 and fell in love with it but his parents felt he was too young and impulsive to have it yet. I know when he gets this for a future birthday he will thrilled. At 60% off this was way more than a bargain. It has everything a young man would love and more.
