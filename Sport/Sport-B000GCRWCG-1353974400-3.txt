review/summary: Easy portabilityreview/text: Put some emergency mylar thermal blankets in the glove compartments of the car and in the 4 wheeler. They don't take up much room and will be a life saver if ever truly needed. We live in a climate that has very cold winters and these blankets seemed to be a good athing to keep on hand
