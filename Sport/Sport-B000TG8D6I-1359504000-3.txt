review/summary: P90Xreview/text: I think this is a great program. I am a single mom who does not have time to go to the gym before or after work. So I am able to work out right in my own home with some flexibility. Still get it done and feel so much better afterwords. I am a little less than my 30 day mark but I can already see the changes in my body and stamina. It's not easy, but nothing ever is that worth it. I wish I wouldve done it years ago.
