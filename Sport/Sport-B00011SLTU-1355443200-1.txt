review/summary: Very handyreview/text: I take this everywhere I go. It's always in my pocket, and people call me &#34;Batman&#34; because it's like having a small utility belt. It's just a simple thing, but you'd be amazed how often someone needs a knife, scissors, file, screwdriver or tweezers (I don't share the toothpick - that's just nasty).
