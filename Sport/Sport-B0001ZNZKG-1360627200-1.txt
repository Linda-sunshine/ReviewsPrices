review/summary: Best underwear I've ever owned.review/text: The title says it all. These might be the best underwear I have ever owned, especially for outdoor activities. On a recent trip to California I hiked through the Mojave desert and everything stayed dry and unchafed. At the gym these wick away sweat really well and holds everything in the right location without being overly restrictive. This is actually the 4th pair of ExOfficios Ive bought in a month. Well worth the money!
