review/summary: Sizes run *very* smallreview/text: The socks are nice enough, and seem to be holding up well. But be advised the sizes run almost ridiculously small. I have a men's size 10.5 foot and ordered these socks in the appropriate size.The "foot" part of the sock looks like it's for a 12 year old kid and the elastic piping that is meant to hold the sock around your calf starts almost at my heel. And they were so absurdly tight the first month that I could barely stand to have them on all day, they would leave deep imprints in my calves. And yes, I checked the bag and it was marked Mens 9 to 12.Perhaps they sent me kids socks in a men's bag. &lt;shrug> They certainly seem undersized and tight.
