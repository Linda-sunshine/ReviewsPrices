review/summary: Indispensablereview/text: This product exceeded my expectations for a very comfortable (-right amount of head sink, and suede finish on side for warmer feel and smooth side for very hot 40C days), firmish (-I need some resistance to keep my head away from shoulders but I need adequate snugness), rollupable (-compresses nicely into a self carrying and protected sausage), lightweight, and maintainable (-can easily wash in machine and dries naturally in say 6 hours, or less in tumble dryer) pillow for travel/backcountry and homeuse. In fact, it is so useful that I use it for permanent bed use. It is also quite a 'huggable' size and firmish texture for those who like to seize something to sleep better.The only half star minus from 5* is that the stuffing is made of polyestre type big chips that give a chunky feel when you pat it, but it is of no consequence when your face rests snugly. If less lumpy, it would be nice but this characteristic aids odd positions that has its silver lining.I particularly like this pillow's 80% firmness as it props up a wide shouldered man's frame/head adequately and provides excellent sleep quality and maintainability. Also handy for propping up your head while watching TV in bed. Does not get smelly even after weeks of use! I bought a second. Large size reccomended. Fluffs up after a couple of minutes to about two thirds the size of an average home pillow but retains its form better.(I think Douglas Adam's of Hitchhikers' fame got it slightly wrong when he missed adding a portable pillow such as this in addition to his Towel (very true) as the most massively useful thing to have when travelling. It may not suffocate the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Trall, but you might just sleep through it all.)
