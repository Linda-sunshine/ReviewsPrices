review/summary: Good pumpreview/text: Let's start from the not so good: this is small and the amount of air you will pump in every movement is small. If you want to inflate your tire to 90PSI, it is going to take a while... But, this is the price you pay for getting such a small pump. Actually, I had a schwin before and it could not pump above 50PSI or something like that. This one will pump in as much air as your arm can bear. If you think you will be too tired after 100 pumps you better buy a CO2 cartridge and pump. In any case, this attachs to my water bottler attachment today and is almost invisible because of the size and location. It is also extremelly light so it does not weight to light roadie.
