review/summary: Christmas present score!review/text: Zero experience with archery in the house, so "novice" would be a generous assessment of our resident skills. That said, the 11-yr-old recipient was thrilled with the gift. Seems very well-built, and while probably shy of the embellishments a seasoned hunter would want, it's great back-yard fun. Looking forward to a bountiful season of strawberries due to what I anticipate will be a down-tick of the local rabbit population!
