review/summary: Work Great, Hard to Cleanreview/text: Over all they are great.The pans heat really evenly and I love being able to put them in the oven as well.I only have two complaints about them. First they can be really difficult to clean since you cant use soap on them. So be warned you may be spending a lot of time scrubbing. Second, even with a good coat of oil or butter, things do tend to stick to them pretty badly.I don't think I would replace all my pans with cast Iron, but they are good to have around.
