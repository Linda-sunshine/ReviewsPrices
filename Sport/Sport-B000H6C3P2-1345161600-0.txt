review/summary: Fits like a glove!review/text: This pistol grip fits the gun well and my hand even better. Ten times more comfortable than a standard plastic mil-type grip. The rubber overmould is very helpful if your hands are sweaty or wet and you're manipulating the gun with one hand (during malfunctions, etc).
