review/summary: Good Quick Workoutreview/text: I've completed the Insanity program (63 days) and, from experience, I wouldn't say this is a 45-minute workout compressed into 20 minutes. But it is a really good workout for days when you only have 20-25 minutes to get a workout in (you definitely have to pace yourself as it's an intense total-body cardio workout). For people considering the full program, it's also a pretty good indication of the type of exercises that they do in the 63-day program.In short,6 minute warm-up3.5 minute stretch9 minute intense workout (comparable to Insanity Pure Cardio)2 minute cool-down stretchTotal 22 minutes (the rest of the time is used for water breaks)For those not used to Insanity, the warm-up is a workout in and of itself, so in reality you're getting about 15 minutes of a great cardio workout in total. The exercises really target your legs and core, including abs (a couple of exercises hit the chest/arms but not as well as some of the other insanity workouts; I may add a minute of the "perfect-pushup" to help compensate for this). Overall, I give it 4/5 stars because it is a really good workout when you're short on time or if you just want to "preview" Insanity before purchasing the full program (although if you haven't done Insanity before, be careful when attempting the moves as a lot of the exercises require good form and different movement combinations--definitely take it slow at first and get the form down before trying to keep up with the trainers on the video).The biggest con as others have mentioned is the quality of the video--it looks like it was filmed in a downtown gym somewhere with poorer audio/quality than the other Insanity videos. Also, as others have pointed out, focus on Shaun T and the female trainer as they have better form/intensity throughout the workout than the other male trainer does.Overall, a great quick workout when you don't have 40-60 minutes for a full Insanity workout or if you want to "preview" Insanity before buying the full program. I definitely plan to use this on a regular basis and am glad I purchased this product.
