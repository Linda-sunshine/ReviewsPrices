review/summary: Long term reviewreview/text: I purchased this mirror many years ago to use on my commuter bike. It had stood the test of time. It's solidly built and has endured the average daily abuse of a commuter that parks the bike in a communal parking area (where there are all kinds of people and bikes getting bumped and jostled around). The mirror conveniently pivots/folds in to help protect it when parking, or navigating into tight spaces. It retains the position placed (whether folded in for parking, or fold out for riding). I just purchased a tandem bike and decided to purchase two more of these mirrors for it. Additional note - they are very easy to mount/install.
