review/summary: Not for the beginnerreview/text: This is a GREAT 21 minute work out for those who are already where they want to be "fit/weight" wise...and want a push to help them maintain their goals! I would not suggest someone get off the couch and start using this, b/c it is tough..and really isn't long enough to give you the results you may want. The videography on this is very low budget... not well edited like the Insanity one...but it does the trick for me...and who doesn't want to wake up and hear SHAUN T say... YOU CAN DO IT!!! lol
