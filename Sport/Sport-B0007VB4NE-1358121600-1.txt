review/summary: Just as describedreview/text: This chair does just what it says it will do.Pros: easy to assemble (&#60;10 minutes without extra tools)ball has textured cover and is not slippery (unlike the yoga balls at the gym)it looks low but actually puts me at the right heightCons: takes getting used to. It is a completely different sitting experienceit is not really adjustable for height, so it will be helpful to have an adjustable keyboard tray if you are using a computer
