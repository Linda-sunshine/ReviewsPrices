review/summary: Very Poor Qualityreview/text: I purchased this helmet based on the reviews and what a mistake that was. I just finished packing up the helmet I received today as a replacement for the defective one I recieved last week. I had the same problem with this helmet. The 2 plastic side pieces fall off if you touch them. If the helmet can't with stand someone taking it out of the plastic bag it came in, how well should I expect it to protect my son's head. Clearly defective manufacturing.
