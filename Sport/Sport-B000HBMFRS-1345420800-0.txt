review/summary: expectations not met at allreview/text: i bought this product to use while my house hold goods were being shipped over seas. it wasnt even 3 weeks before the vinyl seal spit and it started leaking air. and the patch provided was for punctures and didnt work at all for this defect. we are average weighted people and the seal didnt last for even the time we NEEDED it to. we are not happy to sleep on the floor till our shipment arrives.
