review/summary: Expensive but worth every pennyreview/text: I have tried many different boxers from various manufacturers in various materials. None of them were great. The ExOfficio is as close to perfect as any boxer can be. It is light weight, the material will not bind on my trousers, it is easy care and the closest thing to wearing nothing I have ever worn. Spend the money It is worth it. Ditto for the Tee Shirts.
