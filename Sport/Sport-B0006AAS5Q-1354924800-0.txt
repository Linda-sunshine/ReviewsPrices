review/summary: Elegantreview/text: This was a birthday present for my husband. As I reviewed watches on your space cyber Monday and found this, I thought it was the most gorgeous watch I'd ever seen!When he opened the box he said &#34;Oh my god!&#34; At first he thought it was a Brightling because of the wings logo, then Omega or surely a Roladex. And this man knows watches as he used to head up the jewelery division of a Fortune 500 retailer.Anyway, Invicta is fine with him, as it is also a fine Swiss watch, and at least now he knows it's one of equal elegance to the others and I didn't have to cash in my stock portfolio to buy it! Looks so handsome on this handsome man. I am sure it will hold up well, and at these prices, I'll just buy him another one if need be.
