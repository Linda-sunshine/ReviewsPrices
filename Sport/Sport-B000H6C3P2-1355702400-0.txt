review/summary: Best cheap upgrade to your AR-15review/text: I was little apprehensive even after reading the 5-star reviews, however upon receiving it and installing in my AR-15 (took no more than maybe 5 minutes) and putting my hand in the grip I can say it is absolutely the BEST cheap upgrade you can make to your rifle. It feels like a glove and although I haven't shot with it yet I can anticipate it will give me better weapon control.
