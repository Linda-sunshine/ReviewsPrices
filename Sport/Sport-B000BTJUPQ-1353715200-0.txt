review/summary: Bought for 10 year old girlreview/text: We bought this for my daughter. She hasn't had the chance to use it because it's a X-Mas gift, but my teen son says it's pretty good. He was surprised on the price. I hope she loves it as well :) Didn't look if strings can be tighten because my son did say it's too loose for him, but it's for a lil' girl....should be fine.
