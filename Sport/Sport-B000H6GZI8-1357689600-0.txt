review/summary: Not for a Taurus PT 709 with a Crimson Trace laserreview/text: The grip was not much of a problem getting on the pistol. My problem came when I got my Crimson Trace laser. The laser fits around the trigger guard which will not fit into place as long as the grip is in place. You can cut the grip for the laser to fit but there will not be much left so I took it off. If you don't use the laser this is a fine grip and adds a little beef to the magazine housing of the 709.
