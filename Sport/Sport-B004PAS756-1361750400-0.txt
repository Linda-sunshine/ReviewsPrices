review/summary: Fast resultsreview/text: This is a very fast and effective workout. The moves are fairly easy to pick up but are not easy to do and continue to do. This is a crazy high energy cardio workout. It took me a week to be able to get through the entire 20 minute routine and I've done these type of workouts at my gym and also do Zumba which is pretty high cardio also. After a few days my husband noticed I had muscle definition in my sides already. Awesome! I caution though this workout is not for the faint of heart. I still feel like I want to pass out, throw up, sleep all day the next day, after this one.
