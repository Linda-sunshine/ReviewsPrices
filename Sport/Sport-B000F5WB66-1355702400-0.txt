review/summary: Good for startersreview/text: I bought this to keep track of my heart rate while cycling. It didn't disappoint at first however it's pretty annoying to check the time by pressing a button because it's not always visible and secondly the fast release tab on the strap monitor broke withing a couple uses. I'm not one to abuse my items and with moderate use this happen. So if you're serious about training I would suggest putting in the extra and buy a better model
