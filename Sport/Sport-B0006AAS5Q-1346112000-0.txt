review/summary: Great Watch for the Pricereview/text: I have had this watch for about 8 months now. I love the looks, weight and size. I have relatively small wrists and looks good. I'm not impressed with chronograph function, but it does work and I like the way the fuction buttons unscrew to release which prevents bumping them on. Band is sturdy. No issues so far.
