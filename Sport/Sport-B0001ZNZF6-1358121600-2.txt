review/summary: The best underwear. Ever.review/text: Over the years, I've bought a lot of items on Amazon, mostly products rated 4-4.5 stars out of 5. I almost always agreed with the consensus regarding the quality of said products, but never felt so impressed and compelled to actually sit down and write a review.Until I finally tried a pair of these magical boxers, that is.Worth every dollar, and then some more. It's hard to describe -- they feel so comfortable that you forget you're wearing them, but of course it doesn't feel like you're going commando either.I am buying at least 5 more next time they're on sale, and replacing everything I have with these.
