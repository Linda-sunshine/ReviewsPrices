review/summary: Gets the job done.review/text: This is a "get what you pay for" thing. I didn't want an expensive helmet that would get stolen, so I went with this. The plastic decorations on the helmet were literally falling off minutes after I got the package in the mail. No big deal though, just ripped them off and got riding. It seems safe and that's what counts!
