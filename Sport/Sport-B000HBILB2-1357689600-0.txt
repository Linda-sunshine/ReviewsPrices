review/summary: LOVE it!review/text: This mattress is a GREAT deal. The built in pump is a good feature, no more looking for the pump or charger. We have had it inflated for 3 weeks and have only had to refill it a couple of times for a few seconds. Unless you have an electric outlet, you can't fill this mattress without a power source, the plug is buit in with the pump at the head of the mattress and has a cover you can close to secure it. I would highly recommend this as a spare bed for any of your guests. My only complaint would be the bag it comes in to store it. I find that in most cases you can never get the product back in the bag it came in. So we found a bigger bag and it works perfectly.
