review/summary: Unraveledreview/text: These socks worked great for me. I wore them to my exercise class and they protected a corn I had developed between my toes. Unfortunately, one of the socks was a little bit unraveled when it arrived and got worse with each washing. The final washing was crazy, as it was so "stringy" that it wound around other clothes in the wash and required extra effort to separate everything. Unfortunately, this was after the 30 day return period. And they are expensive socks.
