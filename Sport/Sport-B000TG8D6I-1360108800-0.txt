review/summary: Boringreview/text: I'm rating this product a 3/5 for no fault of it's own, just simply because it's too boring. I thought because I live in Cleveland and the winter's can be tough, p90x would be the way to go. Alas, it turns out I would rather suffer hiking in snowy Metroparks than be shut up in basement trying to get through the CD's. I'm sure results would come but I just can't bear to stick to the program.
