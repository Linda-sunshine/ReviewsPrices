review/summary: Great watch, butreview/text: This is a great watch, but the only thing to be aware of prior to buying it is the dial face is more like a deep purple than a blue, as listed. Regardless, it is still a nice looking watch. Other than this minor annoyance the watch functions perfectly. It keeps time with no issues, even after sitting for 10+ hours on my dresser.
