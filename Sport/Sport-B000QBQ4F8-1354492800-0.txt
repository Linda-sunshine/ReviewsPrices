review/summary: Quality Never Goes Out of Stylereview/text: I've been wearing Wayfarers on and off for almost 40 years. That's a long time to be attached to any one product and that should speak volumes about how timeless these sunglasses are.First of all, here are the specs for the sunglasses I purchased and why I purchased these particular glasses:I bought the 2140s. The 2140s are the original Wayfarer design not the newer, smaller ones (those are 2132s) which personally, I don't like.I also opted for the 54mm lens size and I'm glad I did. Note that the 54mm lens Ray Ban has added to the lineup are larger lens - the 50mm were the original sized lens when these sunglasses were first introduced. There are a few good You Tube videos out there on this topic and if you're not sure what size lens you want, go see the videos. Just search for &#34;Wayfarer 54mm versus 50mm&#34; and that should get you to them. Surprisingly, I didn't realize how much of a difference the lens size would matter, but it did. I&#8217;ve got a large head and you&#8217;d be very surprised how much of a difference the larger lens make in a comfortable fit (and look).I also bought the polarized lens which are an option. They are more expensive and in fact, they retail for $200.00 dollars in stores. Why polarized? I live in Florida and I&#8217;m out or by the water quite a bit so for me it&#8217;s almost mandatory that I want to be able to cut down or eliminate the sun&#8217;s glare. It&#8217;s an expensive option but well worth it (this will cost you here on Amazon about $30.00 dollars more, give or take).So the designation I purchased were 901/58 (the 901 denoting the 2140 original Wayfarer and the 58 denoting the polarized lens). Why is this important? Because when you get your glasses, you&#8217;ll see along the inside left rail of the glasses &#8220;901/58&#8221;. You&#8217;ll also see &#8220;54018 3P&#8221;. The 54 means 54mm - the 018 refers to the spacing between lens (18mm) and the 3 means brightness level (3 means high brightness) and lastly the P means polarized. Why would anyone even care about this? Because there are fake Ray Bans being sold that don&#8217;t have this information on the left rail. It&#8217;s a good idea to go watch the videos on fake versus real Ray Ban&#8217;s - you know where to go to find the vids.I wore fake Wayfarers for a while simply because I got tired of shelling out $150.00 dollars every time I lost a pair or sat on them or they walked off, etc. The bottom line? There is a reason why people shell out $125.00 and more for Ray Ban Wayfarers and that reason is quality. The lens are beautifully crafted glass, not crappy plastic. The connection between the side rails and the sunglasses are 7 point hinges made of anodized metal. There is a metal rod that goes through the length of the side rail, too.Everything about Ray Ban screams (albeit subtlety) quality and excellence.The best part about buying them here on Amazon? The great price. You&#8217;ll easily save $50.00 dollars or more off what you&#8217;d spend at a mall or specialty sunglass shop.In summary I&#8217;ll say this: If you&#8217;ve never owned a pair of Wayfarers you owe it to yourself to try a pair. There is a reason why everyone from Jack Nicholson to Debbie Harry has worn them and why they never go out of style: quality never does.
