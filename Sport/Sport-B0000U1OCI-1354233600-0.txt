review/summary: DON'T lose or break the belt clip!review/text: I've had this product for years and love it BUT the belt clip broke and there is no way of getting a replacement. Omron doesn't stock replacement clips even though they still sell the product. The only ones they have come with a new unit. So if you buy a new pedometer today and lose or break the clip, you have a pedometer that needs to be replaced. Good product! Dumb decision by some genius at Omron.
