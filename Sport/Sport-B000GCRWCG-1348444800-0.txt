review/summary: I tried it out. kept me warm.review/text: I got these to put in my Girlfriends car and my own. and to keep a few i a drawer. i was hesitant at first but theses really do keep you very warm. they look like aluminium foil but once you put your eyes to it you can see thru. so really you could but this over your eyes and walk around. as long as you obviously had air to breath. they are very large, larger then i expected. but you will need 2 to cover all of yourself. i tried mine with no cloths and it worked suprisingly well. remember you want to leave air between you and the blanket and you want to keep it as air tight as you can and you will be warm and tostey. i have heard of people putting these on the inside of there tents on cold nights and you can keep quite warm. the durability is decent. i wasn't too afraid to move it around when i opened one up. good buy overall.
