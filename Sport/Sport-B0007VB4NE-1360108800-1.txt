review/summary: SAVED MY BACK! (Great for short stature individuals as well!)review/text: I have owned this chair for approx. 30 days and have seen a tremendous improvement! This chair has saved my back after months of going to a chiropractor and much pain from sitting all day. I work in an office where I sit almost 8 hours a day and my back pain continued to get worse and worse. I am also very short statured (only 5 feet) and none of the office chairs I had were suitable for my size so my lower back was paying for it. I was diagnosed with fluid on the spine and bulged disks in my back. I even missed work because I had to lay down to not be in pain. Plus it is cheaper than the $500 chairs made for people that are my size that are &#34;supposed&#34; to be the &#34;best.&#34;The ball on this chair has created the best &#34;seat&#34; in the house and the wheels make it a pleasure to work in. They roll on carpet well. I really thought I would miss not having arms on a chair, but honestly, it has made my posture better. I sit up more rather than slouch when I am at the computer. I have also lost some weight in my core because I feel it toning my core area.Anyone that is suffering in the office NEEDS to get this chair! Heck, even if you are NOT suffering....It is a GREAT chair!
