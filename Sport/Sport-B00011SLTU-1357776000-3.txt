review/summary: Good quality, great gift itemreview/text: I purchased three of these, one for my keychain and two for gifts. They took quite some time to come but arrived in near perfect condition. The only defect was that one of them had a deformed but still usable key ring. This is easily replaced. The blades are extremely sharp and smooth. I use mine almost every day and have been completely satisfied with the purchase.
