review/summary: Great price, great packagingreview/text: Great price for a great emergency product. Each emergency blanket comes in it's own packing, which is nice if you like to spread these blankets around to different cars, backpacks, ect. I keep one blanket for each seat in the vehicle in case of a winter stranding or emergency. I also like to keep one in each backpack. These things don't take up any space or weight, and could save a life!
