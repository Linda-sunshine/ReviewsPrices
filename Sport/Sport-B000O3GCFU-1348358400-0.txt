review/summary: Keep hot food HOT...not warmreview/text: I just bought this for my son to take to school. I tested it first to make sure it really would keep food warm for 5 hours. I boiled some water (as suggested) and left it in the thermos for 2 minutes while heating up his soup. I poured the water out, and the soup in and put the lid back on. At 5 hours, the soup was still HOT. It was actually TOO hot still for my little boy, so we will omit the boiled water step in the future. This product is FANTASTIC!!!
