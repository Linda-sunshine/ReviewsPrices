review/summary: Awesome toe socks! :)review/text: These are great toe socks! :) If you have any bunions, they are excellent. These socks separate your toes, properly. One of my feet has a bunion and these toe socks really highlight the difference & leaning that occurs w/ a bunion, on the other toes (not good). I have tried another kind of toe sock and not only were they not the same, they really hurt the foot and toes & caused extreme pain. The fabric was different & sizing; whereas the Injinji brand- are a softer fabric and more "giving" for movement, or in my case- leaning that may occur! A sure fit and perfect true to size fitting as well. :)
