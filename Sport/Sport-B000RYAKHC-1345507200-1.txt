review/summary: Falls off easilyreview/text: It falls off the bike so easily. When I attach it to my the end of my bike rack it seems secure enough. I then took it outside for a test ride and it fell off when I road over a couple of bumps. I figure that when I ride over bumps the light whips around, gets unlock and then comes flying off the bike. To stabilize it, I attach it the the back wheels bracket, resting it on the frame.To open Blinky I use a coin. It takes 2 AAA batteries and is very bright.ProsBrightLight weightInexpensiveConsNo very secureFalls off easily
