review/summary: Awesome camping pillowreview/text: I already own a medium, which comes on all of my trips with me whether I'm backpacking, canoe camping, or just car camping. I got the Large size for my girlfriend, and I think I prefer it for all uses except backpacking. I'm not the ultralight type, so the comfort of having a nice pillow is worth it to me. However, the large size stuffs down to being just a bit larger than the medium, but it lofts up to a significantly larger size. I occasionally have to fold my medium in half during the middle of the night to get the support I want for my head, but it works infinitely better than a pillow case filled with clothes. Bottom line, for me the medium does its job very well, but if you're picky or like a lot of head support, then consider the large. This is a great product!
