review/summary: Great Insulation!!! Great Quality!! Company Stands by their product!!review/text: I decide to buy two of these bottles and I got to say they work great. Now when we review these bottle we have to be realistic. Please don't think that these bottles will be equivalent to your Vacuum sealed stainless steel bottle. Bottles that are flexible cannot be vacuum sealed as the two walls of plastic would stick together and you would not have the air space needed for insulation. Vacuum sealed bottles work better because the is a space between the two walls with no sir present which slows the transfer of heat or cold. For a plastic flexible bottle the are very well insulated, your drinks will stay cooler then using a standard single wall plastic bottle. I did a little test and filled a regular single wall bottle with only ice cubes and the polar bottle, after a few hours the polar bottle still had ice in it while the other bottle had nothing but water. So if you think that your regular single wall bottle is the same, do your own testing and you will see how well they work. Also have realistic expectations on the insulation properties of the material used, don't expect it to work as a vacuum sealed thermos. Vacuum sealed bottle will always be superior but will never be made of flexible material!!Also to all of you that are complaining of leaking tops, Polar offers free lid replacement for life!!! Go to their site fill in your address, the type of lid you have and that is it, no need to pay a cent!! No cost!! No Shipping!!!Enjoy!!!
