review/summary: Hoppe's quality, and a must for gun cleaningreview/text: We use Hoppe's No. 9, cloth patches and bronze brushes for the really deep cleanings before storage, but we use Hoppe's bore snakes for quick cleanings in between. They are well made, fit in your pocket or gun kit, and last for years. Each one is stamped with the proper caliber so you can grab the right one. The weight on one end drops it down the barrel, and the handle on the other end gives you a firm grip when pulling it in and out.Using a bore snake polishes out gun powder residue, protecting your barrel from pitting, and improves your accuracy by removing any gunk that would interfere with the bullet trajectory. When your bore snake gets dirty, just hand wash it, and you're good to go.Every gun enthusiast should have a Hoppe's bore snake for each caliber weapon he or she fires.
