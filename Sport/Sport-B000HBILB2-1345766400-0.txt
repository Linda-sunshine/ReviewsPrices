review/summary: Works well for SHORT term use.....review/text: This bed was used daily for maybe a month and did start to lose a bit of air during the night, although nothing that you couldn't either sleep through or refill. It was then packed away for a few months and then brought back out again to use almost daily for several months. Again, it would slowly lose air while you were sleeping on it, so by the morning it was definitely softer. And to attempt to find exactly where the leak is coming from is yet another difficult task. If you are lucky enough to find and repair it, great, but we haven't had luck in that department.We then packed it away for about 7 months, brought it back out to use in a guest bedroom and by then the bed would deflate even more noticeably and quicker so you had to fill it during the night and hope that it would hold. But the piece de resistance or, I should say, the final nail in the coffin was one of the seams on the top portion of the mattress popped so there was a huge cylindrical lump running the length of the mattress. If a small child could handle laying on half of the mattress I guess you could live with it, but not an adult. So, the mattress is toast.All in all, we maybe were able to use it a total of 7 or 8 months (and this is with it not holding all of its air during most of this time). So, if you need something for camping or temporary guests, etc....then I would say you will get your monies worth, but don't expect ANY air mattress to last you a year or years and not have issues with losing air.If I had to purchase another air mattress, I would still stick with the Intex brand as these are considerably more affordable than the Aerobed brand, which we have also used and found they lose air at just about the same rate or even worse.
