review/summary: My new Favorite Boxer Briefsreview/text: This boxer brief is INCREDIBLE. I bought 2 of these and 2 of the sports briefs from another store about 4 months ago and I whenever I wear them I always comment to myself that they are the best underwear I have ever worn. Whether you are a brief wearer or not, it will be hard to deny that these are not comfortable and functional. I just ordered 2 more of these and four more Sports Briefs so that I can start wearing these more everyday.Waistband: The waistband appears to be made of elastic. So far they have held up after several washes as if they are new. When I wash them I always allow them to air dry so that may be part of why they are holding up so well. The band flexes with you. I'm 5'11" and 195 lbs and I don't feel it cutting into my stomach which is a plus.Material: I swear this is the best combination of material. Its soft to the touch and flexible enough to allow you to not feel constricted while still offering the support needed if you want to transfer from sitting at a desk to running a few miles.General Feeling: These are a little more spacious than the briefs but fit about exactly the same with just the longer leg. I did feel the seat kind of start to meld together which felt like it started to get a hole but I was able to pull it apart fine.They are cooling and dry quickly in the heat and it appears that they can be rather warm and snuggly in the cold. I cannot recommend this product any more than I already have. The only drawback is the cost. Amazon provides a good deal on these but if they were ever to dip under 10 bucks I would replace most of my underwear drawer.
