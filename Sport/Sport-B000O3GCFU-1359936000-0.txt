review/summary: Tons of uses and no plastic chemicals.review/text: I have a 9mon old and I use it for:frozen treats, cheerios, medicine storage, warm/cold finger foods,salads for myself, freshly cut up veggies, veggie chilli beans, crackers, fruit snacks, slushies...... what don't I use these for. They keep everything from crumbling. They keeps things together and warm, cold, or frozen (which comes in handy since my lil one is teething). I bought 3 of them at Target (got them on clearance for $3, yup $3 bucks!) I was trilled at the clearance price. You'll have these for the next 10yrs. A++ item.
