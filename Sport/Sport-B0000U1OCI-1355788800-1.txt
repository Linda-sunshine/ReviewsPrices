review/summary: Needs a more secure belt clip--but an excellent step counter otherwise!review/text: THE BAD NEWS: You will NEED the leash which accompanies this product because the belt clip itself is not long enough, strong enough, nor engineered properly to maintain a firm grip on your belt or clothing. GOOD NEWS:once you determine the actual length of your stride, this step counter will accurately track your aerobic steps throughout the day, WITHOUT INCLUDING EVERY JOSTLE OR LARGE MOVEMENT YOU MAKE. If you're determined to take up walking as part of a healthier lifestyle, this is a good thing. You may kinow you should strive for 10000 to 12000 steps/day to achieve 1 to 2 pounds of weight loss per week; 12000 to 14000 per day to achieve a maximum of 3 to 4 pounds lost per week. What gets glossed over in this is that those steps should be mostly aerobic--get your heart rate elevated.a bit. Traditional pedometers "cheat"--they count a lot of false steps. This device doesn't do that, helping you get a more honest count & thereby get healthier faster.
