review/summary: So far, we love it!review/text: My husband has terrible sitting posture and actually breaks about 1 office chair per year because of it (he sits unevenly and does a lot of leg-jiggling, so the seats eventually give out and tilt to one side, making his posture even worse). After the third $100+ chair went off to the dump in as many years, I ordered this. We have had it for a couple of months and have had to 'top it off' once.He loves it. He cannot sit in his normal lopsided manner, which apparently has been doing wonders for his back/neck pain, and I'm very hopeful that he can't break this one. His posture in other chairs has improved, as well. When I use his desk, I the way this makes me sit up straight...might have to get another one for me.You DO have to spend more time than you think inflating/allowing to rest/inflating some more or the ball doesn't get big enough.
