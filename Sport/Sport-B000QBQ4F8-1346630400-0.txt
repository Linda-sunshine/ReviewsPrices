review/summary: Not what I expected.review/text: When I ordered these "Original Wayfarers" I expected sunglasses original to the Wayfarers I owned in the past.When I received them I quickly realized the lenses weren't glass like the originals,but plastic.If you like a lighter pair of sunglasses, these may suit you, but I'd be concerned about the durability and resistance to scratching of the lenses.
