review/summary: Watch the video on mfr's website...review/text: I thought it wouldn't work with conventional ( schraeder ) valves, but then I saw how to reverse the 2 internal bits. Simply google "Topeak Bicycle Pump" for simple instructions. Enjoy. Oh yeah, the reviewers are correct for males- pumping this will somehow seem all too familiar... You may go blind I am told.
