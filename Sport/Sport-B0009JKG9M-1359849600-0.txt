review/summary: Great on the Grillreview/text: The Lodge Pre-Seasoned Combo Cooker was purchased as a gift for a family member. He used it on his gas grill and was so pleased with its performance that he would like to purchase other items in this line of cookware.The pan is quite heavy and retains heat well.
