review/summary: Bright and has two flash modesreview/text: This Planet Bike Blinky &#34;3&#34; is all you really need for a rear bike light. It's cheap, it's simple and it's effective. It has a strobe mode and a constant &#34;on&#34; mode. I prefer strobe because it makes you more noticeable.There are no real flaws with this light although it may not be the brightest on the market or have the most blinking options or features. A lot of times you don't need those different blink modes, though, unless you want to stand out. The only person that is going to notice is another cyclist, though.As long as it blinks and holds a charge with the batteries for a good amount of time, it is a winner.-Ken FlemmingAuthor, How to Get a Job in Video Games
