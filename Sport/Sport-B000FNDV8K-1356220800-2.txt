review/summary: Great handy tool!review/text: This knife takes care of all the basic needs you may have. A handy toothpick, nail file, and a very sharp blade that will cut most anything in a pinch. I use the nail clipper scissors often. Fair warning, though: it will become a part of your everyday routine, and you may forget to leave it home when travelling by air. TSA, for some reason, thinks you could take over or dismantle a passenger liner with this tool, and will seize it!
