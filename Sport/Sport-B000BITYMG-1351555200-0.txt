review/summary: Lanyard too long.review/text: The lanyard is too long by about 2 to 2-1/2". We've used the leash daily for about two months. It works well, except for the overly long strap. No problems with the metal clasp which is why we bought these in the first place. The Omron's plastic clip is a sad attempt for securing the pedometer.
