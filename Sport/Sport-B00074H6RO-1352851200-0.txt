review/summary: good flexibilityreview/text: I bought these to replace a similar pair and the quality is comparable. mine fit a bit small but the gloves are flexible enough to stretch and never feel constricted. they've already been washed several times and appear no worse. these are simple gloves with a nice wide Velcro closure thats easy to grasp.
