review/summary: Makes for a safer ride!review/text: Of course I can't see the light from behind when I drive, but I've been told the red blinking light is very noticeable which means cars should definitely see us. I ride with my toddler so it makes our ride feel a little more safe. The light also can stay lit your entire ride if you want that option.
