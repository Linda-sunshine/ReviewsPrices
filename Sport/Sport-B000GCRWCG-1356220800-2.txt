review/summary: Warm!review/text: I bought these for emergency uses. But I have a pot belied pig who stays at the horse barn, and needs extra blankets to stay warm in the winter. After she got used to the crinkling sound I no longer worry about her staying warm. They really work. Since they are individually packaged I now have some at the barn, house, car and gave some to my son!
