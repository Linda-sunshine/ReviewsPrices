review/summary: Buy it!review/text: The watch arrive quickly and in perfect condition. It is easy to adjust the band using inexpensive tools I also ordered. There were none of the problems or cosmetic defects some reviews mention. I have worn it for 31 days and it works fine. Runs about 6 seconds per day fast. That is good for automatic watches, including Rolex. This is a $300 watch with a a five year warranty, for $85, and free shipping. To receive the extended warranty you must register the watch on-line with invicta. Then call the Invicta number in Florida and they will extend it to five years without charge. You will enjoy wearing this good looking, quality watch. Save yourself $8,500.00 and buy this instead of a Submariner. You will feel better about yourself if you do.
