review/summary: Attach the laynardreview/text: This is the second purchase I made of this item. It works great and the battery last a long time. My only complaint (and it is my fault) is that you MUST attach the security laynard to the pedometer. If you choose not to do this, and simply clip it to your belt, you will lose it! You cannot bend over and tie your shoe without the weak clip disengaging and falling off. The saftey laynard will assure you keep your pedometer. I lost mine when bicycling and by the time I retraced my route to find it, it had already been scooped up! I hope whoever found it enjoys its use as much as I did. I came right back to Amazon.com and bought two more, one as a small gift for my neighbor that likes to walk with me. I have my laynard attached now and on several occasions the weak clip has disengaged and the only reason I didn't lose the pedometer was the laynard was attached. Amazon.com makes buying online safe and easy. Their return policy is second to none! I really like my Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer.
