review/summary: nice rope, but sucks to re adjustreview/text: The rope is pretty nice out of the box .. but once u get to re adjusting its length according to your height - its a downhill journey from there on. The metal clamps provided just bend out of shape and then there is no way of getting them on to the readjusted length.I also tried the option of simply tying a knot with the adjusted length - the drawback here is that the rope will not rotate freely when your are skipping it and will just get tangled ..Disappointed at the design ..
