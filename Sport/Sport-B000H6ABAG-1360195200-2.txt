review/summary: Undersizedreview/text: I purchased two pair of these sweatpants and tried them on upon receipt. Both pair are woefully undersized. I actually purchased one size larger than usual just in case and I should have bought at least two sizes larger. The pants are nicely done and no problems with the quality but both pair are going into my wife's gym bag and not mine.
