review/summary: Excellent holsterreview/text: I have a Blackhawk Serpa holster for all my handguns that they make one for. The active retention devise is, in my opinion, is a must for CCW. Some have said the device has caused accidental discharges. The causes of these discharges are the result of negligence and improperly releasing the device by pressing with their fingertip and not the pad of their index finger. By using the fingertip, there is the possibility to place the index finger in the trigger guard when removing the gun from the holster and negligently pressing the trigger. Some will complain the holster is not very good for CCW. This type of holster is best concealed with a tucked undershirt and a loose fitting untucked cover shirt, preferably button up dress shirt.
