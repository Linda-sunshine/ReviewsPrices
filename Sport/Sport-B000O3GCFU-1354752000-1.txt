review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: i bought this for my 5 yr old grandson. He is an extremeely picky eater and does not like most of the food offered at his kindergarten school. I have followed the directions to a "T", leaving boiling hot water in the thermos up to almost 15 minutes, then heating up his food and immediately placing it in the thermos. This is at 7:45 in the morning and he eats lunch at 11:30, so it's not even 4 hours...he says the food is cold every time. i really need to find a thermos that does the job.
