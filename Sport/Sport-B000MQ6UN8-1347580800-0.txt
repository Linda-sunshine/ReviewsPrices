review/summary: Comfortable and stylishreview/text: I have had a pair of non-polarized aviator a few years back, after I accidentally broke them, I moved on to a few other brands out there, such as Smith, Oakley, Native Eyewear, as well as a few other designer brands and other Ray-ban models. At the end, I found myself coming back to the aviator, and purchased the Gunmetal G-15 Polarized. Although these are not intended for sports use, they are a very comfortable fit(thanks to the light and well-balanced weight and the adjustable nose-pads). They are stylish with a nice clean look which I find most practical in almost every situation. In terms of lens quality, these polarized lenses render sharp neutral colors and rival the Oakley's HD(high definition) lens if not better in my opinion.
