review/summary: Worked well for 90 days.review/text: Worked well while it lasted. Honestly very satisfied until it failed at one of the seams and now has a huge bump on one side. Manufacturer says this product carries no warranty when amazon clearly states it does. Anyways Amazon took the product back for a 100% refund so I guess Im happy. Everyone keep in mind that this is not a long term solution.
