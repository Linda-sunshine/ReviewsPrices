review/summary: Disappointed in comparison to original boresnake.review/text: To start, the only reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 1 is because, like the boresnake I bought 3 years ago (same caliber), it cleans a gun barrel better than any other cleaning device I have used to date. Now for the problem... This is for cleaning .22 caliber rifles. I bought it for cleaning my AR's specifically. The brass &#34;weight&#34; that they put on the end of the pull string was too big to slide through the barrel! Thus, the product was useless in the condition it was delivered. My first boresnake had a much smaller weight that easily slid down the barrel allowing me to quickly pull the snake through cleaning my barrel in seconds. I figured out the problem (other than the obvious fact that the weight was too big)... The weight Hoppes is using has the caliber number stamped on it to identify which snake to use. Great idea if you have multiple snakes, but the weight size needed to fit the stamp was too big to fit a .22 cal. After squeezing the weight with pliers, I reshaped it enough to barely thread it down the barrel, which took longer than using a a rod and patch set. In the end, I had to dremel the weight to make it useable. Very frustrating. I don't foresee this being a problem with calibers bigger than .22 though, because they probably use the same size weights on the other snakes.
