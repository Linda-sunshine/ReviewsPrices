review/summary: Nice pants, run smallreview/text: I just received my yoga pants and they are a bit snug! I just had a c-section and needed some extra comfy pants. I ordered a 2X, and the same size in another pair of yoga pants I got recently are extra roomy. I feel like I'm going to bust the seam on these ones! I have quite a large butt and had to squeeze it in there! Besides that, the legs fit nicely, material is nice, and I love the flared bottoms! I can't wait to lose some pregnancy weight and fit in them. I better start doing some yoga!
