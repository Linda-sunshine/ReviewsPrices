review/summary: Great water bottle so-so capreview/text: Klean Kanteen is a fantastic company. The bottles are made in the US and they have a great reputation for being environmentally friendly. You can feel good about buying from them. The water bottle is great. The 40oz is quite big (about the height of a standard paper towel roll and around 3in in diameter) so I usually only need to fill it twice to get me through the day. My only real problem with the bottle, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is the sports cap isn't so great. The biggest problem is that it isn't leak proof and, even when I shut it as tightly as I can, it tends to drip on me and/or whatever I've put it in to carry it. It also doesn't have a cap for the mouth piece so the part you're supposed to be putting into your mouth is left totally exposed to whatever it might brush against. Finally, and this is a small thing, it does make a little bit of noise when you drink from the cap so if you're in a place where you need to be quiet it can be a bit distracting to others. You should absolutely buy a Klean Kanteen, but maybe consider a different cap; they do sell many varieties.
