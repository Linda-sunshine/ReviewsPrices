review/summary: Hammertoe reliefreview/text: Male responder; I have one toe (next to pinky toe) that likes to rest partially under the middle toe. After a day of walking around in normal socks the cuticle on the toe underneath is displaced and gets fairly tender.. These socks cure that problem completely. Very comfortable. This is first experience with toe socks- they are kind of a pain to put on but it's worth it.
