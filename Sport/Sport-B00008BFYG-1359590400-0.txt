review/summary: My Daughter Loves Itreview/text: We got this for my 8 year old daughter. She was very excited. It is winter and so she hasn't been able to take it outside, yet, but she loves to roller around the kitchen. The pink color is fun and I think it is great that they come in many different colors. My only concern is that my daughter is still working how to collapse and raise the handle bar. I think it will come easier when she is able to use it more (outside).
