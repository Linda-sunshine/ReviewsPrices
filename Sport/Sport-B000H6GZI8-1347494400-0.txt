review/summary: Split at Seamreview/text: I ordered this for a Taurus PT 140 after reading reviews from many different sources saying this gun used the Handall Jr. We were really exceited when receiving the package, we boiled the grip to loosen it up and stretch it out. When we put it on, it was still very tough so we boiled it longer and continued to stretch it in between taking it out of the water and putting it back in. When it was finally stretchy enought to put on, we started slowly working it up the grip of the gun. Then it split in the seam of the grip and is now useless. I also bought the pink Handall Jr. for a Bersa Thunder, and had the same issue.
