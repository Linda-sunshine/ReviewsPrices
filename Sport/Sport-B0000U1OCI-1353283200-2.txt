review/summary: Motivation from your pocketreview/text: ProsI bought this for my spouse and it helped him visualize the concept of a day's exercise more clearly. He has trimmed off a significant amount of weight from his waistline. He can snack at night and not feel guilty!ConsCould MAYBE consider that the delayed counting of steps (12 at a time, I believe) to be a bit annoying, but it is nonetheless accurate and has proven results so we don't care. We haven't used any other pedometers, and can not compare.This was a GREAT first pedometer experience!
