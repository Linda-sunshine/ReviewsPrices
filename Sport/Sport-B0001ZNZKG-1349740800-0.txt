review/summary: Happy With My Purchasereview/text: These boxers are great! They are very comfortable to sleep in at night and then wear to work in a hot, humid environment the next day. The boxer are much more comfortable than compression shorts but wick away moisture just as well. I would recommend them for any situation.
