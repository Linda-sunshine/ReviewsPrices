review/summary: Classic.review/text: Time-tested. This shoe goes really well with a great number of things, and I find myself wearing them even when the snow is piled high solely because I like the look.Protip: if it's rainy/snowy, be sure that your laces are tied in a manner that doesn't allow you to step on them, because if you do, you'll get the laces dirty, which, in turn, will cause them to fling up while you're walking and cover your shoes in wet, dirty water, making short work of the pristine, white look.
