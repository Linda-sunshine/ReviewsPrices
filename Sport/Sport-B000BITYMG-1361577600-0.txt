review/summary: Works well for Fitbit Onereview/text: I had the first edition of the Fitbit (the kind they don't sell any more -- I've forgotten the product name). There was one that started malfunctioning after I dropped it; its replacement disappeared from its spot on my pocket at some point during my workday in a large school, never to be seen again, all too soon. When I replaced it with the Fitbit One, I also got this leash in hopes of keeping my One from being lost or falling. So far, so good. What I usually do is turn my pants pocket inside out, clip the metal clip onto the cloth of the pocket, then turn it back the right way. The string part on the leash fits snugly under the rubber sleeve/clip thing that holds the One. I don't clip the One to anything else; it just stays in the bottom of my pocket. I've had no surprises and no problems, and have been happy to find my Fitbit still in my pocket when I get home every day. (As an added bonus, since I don't have to clip the thing where it's visible on the outside of my pocket, I get zero weird questions about what that gadget I'm wearing is and what it's for and why I'm wearing it, and so on. Hooray!) I figure I'll buy the Fitbit Flex if/when the One breaks or is lost, but at this rate, that's going to be a long time. Win for my budget, even if I'd love to have the latest greatest thing.
