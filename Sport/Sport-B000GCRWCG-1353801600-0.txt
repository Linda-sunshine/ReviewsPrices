review/summary: Not survival materialreview/text: When you buy something for survival remember the circumstances under which you expect to HAVE to use it. A cheap &#34;survival knife&#34; is just plain stupid. I bought these to use in disposal conditions like ground sheet or to cover gear. they are fine for that. I did use one as a ground sheet under a gortex bivy sack and it is definitely good for almost one use. The snow and ice wore the silver finish off and made it clear in most areas. It was slippery which is to be expected but did keep the bottom of the bivy sack clean.Item arrived as expected and before the estimated due date.
