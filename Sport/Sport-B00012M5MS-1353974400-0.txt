review/summary: received today... and already falling apart.review/text: I just got this helmet in the mail today. and as i was trying it on, i hear a "clank!" One of the plastic panels that are basically glued onto the exterior of the helmet fell off.I inspected the other panels, and the glue on those were very weak. I'm going to try to super glue them back on, but a product shouldn't come in this kind of condition. It seems like it was hastily made with little attention to detail.No doubt, this is a decent helmet that will probably protect your skull from injury, but for anyone thinking of buying this, you should also buy a tube of super glue in addition.
