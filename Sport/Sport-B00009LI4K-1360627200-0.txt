review/summary: Does what it says on the tinreview/text: Bought this for ear protection while using our Vitamix - we run it through tough foods on a daily basis and it sounds like standing next to a jet engine. The earmuffs reduce the sound to a dull barely-there roar, just loud enough to be aware of what's going on.They are also a comfortable fit, and work fine over my eyeglasses.My only regret with this product is that I should have ordered it a lot earlier...
