review/summary: I'm a BEGINNER Walker - This Pedometer is my CHEERLEADER!review/text: It was really important to start out at my own pace, not spend a ton of money, and set realistic expectations for myself. I work with a lot of young people who run marathons, have expensive gym memberships, go cycling for 3 hours a day, etc. It was important to me to be low-key and just be proud of myself for getting off the couch.I bought this Pedometer and attached it to my work lanyard. I don't walk very much at work, but it was interesting to see how many steps I DO take. THEN after work, I keep the lanyard on and go to the rec center and walk the indoor track for free (if my tax dollars are paying, it makes more sense than a gym membership!) I check the time on the Pedometer and walk for an hour while I listen to books on tape on my MP3 player.I didn't buy anything except this Pedometer (no fancy clothes, no shoes, nothing ... I wanted to make sure I could be motivated and keep walking!) Each day, I have walked an HOUR on the track. I have walked betwen 2.3 and 2.5 miles.I am SO proud of myself. And the cool thing is that I KNOW this Pedometer does a whole lot more than just go back 7 days for the steps, miles, etc. I need to read up now that it's been a WHOLE 1 1/2 weeks!I think this purchase encourages you to keep going (it's your personal coach ;-) ... and it's the best value for the money you could make. Good luck to everyone out there who is taking the first steps like I am. I'm sure you could be a marathoner and this would be great too (my co-workers are now interested in it) but FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET STARTED, THIS is one of the BEST Cheerleaders you could have!GOOD LUCK!
