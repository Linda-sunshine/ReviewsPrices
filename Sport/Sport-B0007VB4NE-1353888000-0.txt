review/summary: If I could Sleep on this chair I would!review/text: Okay I have to say I have never written a review on Amazon until now. I am so in love. I love this chair more than anything. I have HORRIBLE sciatica and this week it has been so bad it reduces me to a blithering pile of tears and curse word. I also work from home and spend hours on the computer. I have to or I won't get paid. This chair feels amazing on my back. I feel 500 times better instantly!! Worth every penny and that says a lot because the damn thing went on sale on Black Friday 3 days after I bought it. I was kinda irked but now it's here and I could care less how much I paid for it. I love it. I'm going to be whispering tales of love to it for the rest of the week. Buy it. You will be glad you did. I had a regular yoga ball I have sat on for the last 2 years and that was cool but this is WAAAAAY better.
