review/summary: wearing them right nowreview/text: The problem I always, always have with yoga pants is that I have kind of long legs and they ALWAYS shrink in length. So far these have held their length better than most, which is great! Also, I've washed them lots of times and so far they haven't faded too much. So that's good. :-)
