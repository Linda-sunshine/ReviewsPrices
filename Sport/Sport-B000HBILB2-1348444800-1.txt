review/summary: Intex Pillow Rest Airbed Is A Good Buyreview/text: I ordered the twin-size version of this product to use when my daughter comes to visit without her husband. I am every bit as satisfied with it as I am with the higher-priced queen Aerobed that we have been using when they both visit. It is easy to inflate and deflate, has a flocked top for comfort and is raised. The quality seems very good and my daughter found it to be as comfortable as the Aerobed. I found nothing negative about this product at all--even the price was great! I am so glad I bought it!
