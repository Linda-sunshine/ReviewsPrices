review/summary: 10 years and countingreview/text: I purchased the 8926 with the black and red bezel back in early 2002. First off, over the last 10 years I've abused this watch! I work construction so for the last 10 years this watch has been there every day and also in the rain and snow. I don't abuse my watches but I expect them to perform and hold up when conditions get a little rough. The watch still keeps great time and I definitely feel like I've got my moneys worth. So, my experience with Invicta and this watch have been great. Expecting my new Invicta 3044 in two days!!!!
