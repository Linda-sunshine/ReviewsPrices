review/summary: A must havereview/text: I bought this to replace an earlier version of the Champion I've carried for decades. Nothing at all wrong with my old knife, I just wanted to get some of the newer features. The tiny screwdriver is a very nice addition, especially for changing the tiny batteries in electronics.This knife lives up to my very high expectations. The blades hold an edge well, and the knife is typical Victorinox high quality. At first it was a little stiff, but regular use has taken care of that. Mine lives in my front pocket, clipped to an ITP AAA light, and both are called on regularly. If I don't need them personally, someone near me will ask. It's the downside of being known as someone who is prepared.The Victorinox saw and scissors work better than on any other pocket knife/tool. The other tools work as advertised, and you can rely on them. I don't really miss the pliers on this model, I don't find myself using pliers that much. In my opinion, there are better pliers on pocket tools anyway, and I think the pliers would make it a bit much for pocket carry. This knife's biggest benefit is massive versatility, while still being small enough for comfortable constant carry. Face it, no tool is much good if you don't have it with you. And this one is ALWAYS with me.Over the years, I have tried carrying other knives/tools. But this is the one I keep coming back to.For the record, my older one is only semi retired. It gets put in my wife's purse during hurricane season.If you are a knife user, and not a collector, this is the one that will get you the most bang for the buck/size/weight. It will not let you down when you need it. Do yourself a favor, and buy one.
