review/summary: Perfect for Tactical 22review/text: I bought this because i hate pushing a rod from muzzle to breach and forcing all of the gunk into the breach. I was surprised how well this product works. so simple and effective. Makes cleaning my Mossberg 715t a simple process. I plan on buying these for all of my calibers. Great stuff!
