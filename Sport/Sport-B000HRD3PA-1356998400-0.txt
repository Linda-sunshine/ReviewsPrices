review/summary: Unlined shorts with pocketsreview/text: These shorts do not have a liner in them, they are some of the thinner shorts that I have purchased. I gave them 5 starts because this is exactly what I wanted them to be.I work out in Florida, and these pants are heavy enough to hang comfortably off the waistband but they are not so thin that they stick to me when I sweat.They have 2 side pockets.The only small improvement I would like to see on them is a better drawstring. They have a single &#34;loop&#34; drawstring that you can pull tight and knot (or bow) to hold them in place. This is very easy to use and works just fine, but I prefer a shoestring drawstring as they are less elastic and I feel like they provide a little more control than the drawstring in these... but it's not worth docking them a whole star for it.I got a pair of silver ones and they're not very reflective. I would refer to them more as &#34;very light gray&#34; than &#34;silver.&#34;If you're here and you've gotten this far down in the reviews, let me make it simple: Pick them up, they're good pants for the price.
