review/summary: Didn't last long termreview/text: I bought this product awhile back, and it was fine. But now, it eats through batteries every 2 days. And once the battery is low, even though the screen is still on and functioning, it will not count the steps until I replace the battery.The cheap one's you buy at discount stores last longer. Not impressed with what I spent on it that it didn't continue to function properly.
