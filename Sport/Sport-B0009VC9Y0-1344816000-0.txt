review/summary: My favorite folderreview/text: There are a lot of good reviews on this knife. Yup it's sharp, quick to open, useful size, good looking, all that.It gets the most use out of my, err, folder collection because of the blade safety lock. I like the peace of mind I get knowing that the silly thing isn't going to spring open on me because something unexpected happened in my pocket / vest whatever.Is it a realistic fear? Probably not. But it's my fear . . . so bug off. ;-)Yes I've bought a number of these for friends and if (heaven forbid) I lost this one, I'd replace it with the same model.
