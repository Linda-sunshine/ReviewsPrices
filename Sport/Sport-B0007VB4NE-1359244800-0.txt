review/summary: A Different Way to Sitreview/text: My husband and I are both jewelers at All Animal Jewelry and will spend the entire work day at our benches. After seeing the Gaiam Balance Chair in a booth at the Sisters Folk Festival, I looked into and ordered not one but two of these chairs. The chairs arrived and were easy to assemble. Initially they felt a bit awkward but within 10 minutes they were the chair of choice; our other chairs were given to "new" homes. The chairs are really comfortable, easy and fun to scoot around from one work bench to another, and just plain old feel good! The only thing I didn't like has nothing to do with the actual chair: the superfluous packaging; too much plastic wrap.
