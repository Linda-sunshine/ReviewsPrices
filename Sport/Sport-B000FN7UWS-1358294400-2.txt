review/summary: The 12 oz with sippy cap works for us, the larger bottles don'treview/text: KLEAN KANTEEN -- SIZE and INSTABILITY12 ozToo small for meNot enough for a trip to the gymIt does, however, work well for our children's nightstands as long as the "sippy" lid is used. Otherwise if they knock it over with the other plastic lid, the bed or floor is soaked.18 oz and 27 ozToo small for me since I drink that in no time flatIt fell over all the time and was completely dented. In KLEAN KANTEEN's defense, we gave up before trying their wide mouth bottles. They look more stable and may have been a good choice but the lids leaking all the time were a hassle so we moved on.KLEAN KANTEEN CAPS -- LEAK ISSUESStainless flat steel caps leakedSport caps over time began to leakSippy caps do not leakPlastic loop cap that screws in only if screwed in really tight didn't leakWith the exception of the 12 oz stainless bottles with sippy caps we switched to Camelbak Eddy bottles.
