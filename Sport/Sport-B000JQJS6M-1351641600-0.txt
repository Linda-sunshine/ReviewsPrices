review/summary: Don't bump the crownreview/text: The instructions say to screw the crown back tight after setting to avoid letting water into the case. I did that and after a couple of months of use, I noticed the crown had come loose, water had infiltrated and stopped the watch. Seems pretty fragile for a so called "diver's watch." Also, you must pre-pay return postage by cashier's check at $28 each way for an $86 watch which might or might not be within warranty--not a good use of my time. It is a lovely watch though.
