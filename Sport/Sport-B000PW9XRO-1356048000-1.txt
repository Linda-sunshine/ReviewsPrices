review/summary: Hatch Specialist All-Weather Shooting/Duty Glovereview/text: This golve fits like a glove even though it is an extra large glove. It was designed to be worn in all types of weather, rain or shine. It holds your pistol or revolver because of the extra leather added to the palm, and firing and holding part of the glove. All that being said, all weather does not mean it's great for cold wear. In cold weather you best have a pair of insulated mittens. Still I wouldn't trade them. Great glove and a fair price.John M.
