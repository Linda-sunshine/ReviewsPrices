review/summary: Strap works, watch doesn'treview/text: The strap never synced with the watch. Going to the gym, the treadmill picked up on my heartbeat without a problem.Changed the batteries in both the watch and strap, thinking it was perhaps too weak to register on the watch. Still didn't work.Returned this one and Amazon is sending the replacement. Hopefully the next one works.
