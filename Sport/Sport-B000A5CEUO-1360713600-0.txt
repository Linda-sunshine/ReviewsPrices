review/summary: Scratch pronereview/text: The heart rate monitor works as advertised and can pair with treadmills to show heart rate. Sometimes, even without other running besides you, the reading vary wildly despite the chest strap is put on properly.The watch surface is very scratch-prone. After the battery is dead, try to replace the battery on the watch made it completely dead. All LED bar lights up and stay there. Very disappointed in the product.
