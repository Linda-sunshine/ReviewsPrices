review/summary: great productreview/text: I'm a repeat buyer after my original pedometer (the gray one) finally conked after many years of service. I prefer the previous buttons, which were larger and more user-friendly IMO, but have adapted to this one quickly. It's as reliable as ever and a great motivator for getting and staying on the move. Thanks!
