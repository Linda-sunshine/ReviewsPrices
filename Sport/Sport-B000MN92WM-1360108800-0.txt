review/summary: Not happy right now.review/text: Just received this product. Took 4 days even though its supposed to be 2 day prime. Whatever. What, no freekin battery? What kind of cr@p @ssed service is this? I'm freekin pissed. If you have people that are too d@mn stupid to work there, get new ones. All kinds of lazy welfare people out there. I know its probably just a buck or so for a battery. Thats not the freekin point. You most certainly have idiots working there. Maybe, I'll say something good after I have to go get a battery. For now Piss off, John T.
