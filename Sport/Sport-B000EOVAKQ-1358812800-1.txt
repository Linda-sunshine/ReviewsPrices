review/summary: Very comfortable, great open view, but these leak swimming at medium speedsreview/text: I was trying to switch over from the standard Speedo line of goggles (Vanquisher 2 was my norm), looking for a change plus clear goggles for the lap pool. They arrived, and have one pro and two cons.PRO: very clear, comfortable fitCON: The strap tightening system isn't as secure as I expect.CON: Once I started swimming, medium speed, one of the goggles always leaked. I tried tightening the straps, but then they straps just came undone because they were too tight.I'm going back to Vanquisher 2s, they have perfect seal and better strap.
