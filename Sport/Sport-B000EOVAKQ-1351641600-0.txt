review/summary: Legit Italian swim gogglesreview/text: I got these googles about 3 weeks ago. I did not know they were italian until I saw the case. These googles come in a case. None the less these are nice well fitted goggles. I have been swimming comfortable without any problems in highly chlorinated H20 and have no worries of chlorinated water getting into my eyes. The best things about these goggles is that they adjust real quick while you wearing them to fit the looseness or tightness of them. It feels like suction cups on your eyes and it does not hurt or bug in any kind of way. Definitely 5 stars for these pair of goggles, best swim goggles I ever had. Highly recommend them.
