review/summary: Very good workout glovesreview/text: I have had a few gloves that tear at the thumb or any finger and last only a couple workouts. Gotta honestly say these are my best gloves yet. Padding is great, no pain on heavy lifts, and I have so far been going hard in the gym for almost three weeks and they are still going strong. I will see down the line how they hold up but can't complain right now....
