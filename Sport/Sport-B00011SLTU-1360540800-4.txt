review/summary: A Classic I've used for years!review/text: Loaned my little pocket knife to a friend who lost it. I'd used it for years and needed a replacement. Finally found it here on Amazon.com!! I ordered multiple ones, since I'm married to the one who lost mine, and intend to stay that way, and MAY lose another one in the future!!Actually, I ordered one for her very own, which she loves.What I had before had a nail file with a pointed end (I used it for keeping my nails cleaned), and apparently the only option now ships with a slotted screw-driver tip on the nail file. Otherwise, the quality, fit and finish, is the same high standard Victorinox has always had. The Amazon dealers were first rate and delivery, as promised!I would recommend this to any friend who need a small pocket knife.
