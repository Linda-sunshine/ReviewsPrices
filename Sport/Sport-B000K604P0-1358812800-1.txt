review/summary: Perfectreview/text: I use this occasionally to keep milk cool while I work at school. I leave in the morning, and my milk will still be fresh when I arrive home. (Note that if you do use it for milk, you'll want to clean it thoroughly or it'll smell, of course). I like it so much that I decided to get a couple for my parents. It keeps coffee hot so well that it surprised my mother (she may have burnt herself a bit on the first sip). Definitely a great product if you want to keep your drink hot or cold all day long.
