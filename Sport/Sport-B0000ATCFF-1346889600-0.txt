review/summary: only shoes i wearreview/text: i am on my 2nd pair of converse monochromes and these are the only shoes i wear and will ever wear. I wear them with jeans, i wear them with black slacks, i wear them playing basketball, etc. etc. etc. They look awesome, they are super comfortable, they don't get dirty and they last about 2 years with every day wear. I threw my last pair away because i kept wearing them even though they had holes in them because i liked them so much. Pretty much if i could buy a subscription to shoes where they would send me a new pair every year I would probably do it and then just never have to worry about footwear again.Actually, this is a good idea - converse send me a pair every year please
