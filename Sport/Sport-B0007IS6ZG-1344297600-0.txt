review/summary: Easy enough.review/text: Some people in this world are doers. The kind of people that change their oil, cook their own meals, and buy ball-bearing jump ropes. Other people expect everything to just come to them. The kind of people that don't know "righty-tighty lefty-loosey", how to boil water, or adjust the length of a jump rope. You buy this thing, make it taught on one foot, and size the ends of the handles to your shoulder (for a beginner), or armpit (for more advanced jumpers). You need to unscrew the endcap (remember the rule I just gave above), pull out the cord, and tie a knot at the place you want it. Then cut the cord 3 inches away, and tighten the cap back on. No, there's no dial for you to twist to make this "automatic". You just have to be a doer. With this product, you get a great aerobic workout at a great price, and you learn how to take life into your own hands instead of complaining about it being too hard.
