review/summary: Perfect for my short-stature and very comfortable!review/text: I am 5'4" with short legs and this chair is absolutely amazing. My desk at work reaches a height of 28" and this chair seats me at 19" (with ball fully inflated), which allows my arms and shoulders to be less strained while typing and working. My feet touch the floor, I am sitting up straight, and I am incredibly comfortable sitting on this chair. Additionally, I am finding that no matter how long I am sitting in this chair my abs are engaged and my lower back does not have as much pressure on it as it did while sitting in a normal office chair.**Warning: Upon opening the box and blowing up the ball I thought the ball would be too small, but it is actually perfect for how short I am and the size of my desk. If you think it will be too small for you, try to find a ball chair that comes with a larger ball before purchasing this one.**I love this chair! I am so happy that I purchased it--worth every penny!
