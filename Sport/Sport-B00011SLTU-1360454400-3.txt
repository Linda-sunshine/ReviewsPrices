review/summary: Small is beutifulreview/text: This is the smallest Victorinox knife with a scissors, single pen knife blade, and a combination screw driver nail file. It is small enough to carry in your pants pocket without wearing a hole in it. The blade is sharp and the screw driver will work in both slotted and Phillips head screws. The tooth pick and tweezers are functional and seem to be included with every one of the better Victorinox knives. I paid over $20 for one like it at a hardware store many years ago. This one was a steal at under $14.
