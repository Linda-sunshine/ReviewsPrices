review/summary: Great little safety light!review/text: I bought this light so that I can be more visible on the road, no matter what time of day. I always have it on, even on bright sunny days, and always use it in the blinking mode, because I don't want to be mistaken for a road side reflector. Even during the daytime, I am very visible to traffic coming up from behind me. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to be sure to be noticed on the road.
