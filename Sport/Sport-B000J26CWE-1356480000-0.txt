review/summary: Injinji original weight micro lengthreview/text: I used to get a large blister between my two smallest toes on really long runs (20 miles and over). I tried Body Glide and Vaseline which helped, but they made a mess out of my socks. Then I tried a pair of Injinjis and the problem completely went away. Since the sock material wraps each toe, they move against each other with very little friction. I don't even notice the feeling of the sock material between each toe, and I don't feel like they stuff the toe box of my shoes either. If you have toe-blister problems, try a pair. The micro length comes up just above the cuff of my shoes, and is perfect for hot weather.
