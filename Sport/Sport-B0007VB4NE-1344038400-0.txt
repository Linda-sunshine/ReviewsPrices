review/summary: Good chair, not too shortreview/text: When I read the reviews for this chair, I was very concerned that it would be too short. It didn't help that when I assembled the frame and blew up the ball, it was very small--smaller than the frame, even. But I've had it for about 4 days now, and each day I've inflated it fully, and it has grown a lot (I would guess about 1-2"). It is now almost too tall, though it's now a comfortable height for my standard-height computer table.
