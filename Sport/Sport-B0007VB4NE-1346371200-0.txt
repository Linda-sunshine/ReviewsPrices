review/summary: Ridiculous product, actually increases pressure on your low back!review/text: I will preface this review by saying that balance balls are great to use for exercise and can definitely improve the strength and endurance of your postural muscles.However, turning a balance ball into a chair is not the logical extension of the concept anymore than turning a wrist weight into a watch that you wear all day is. Just because it helps you if you do it for a little while doesn't mean you should do it for an extended period of time.If you are up-to-date on your postural information, you know that there is no "ideal" sitting posture. The ideal one is the one you aren't in, meaning that you should change your sitting posture frequently in order to avoid overworking muscles. The 90 degree hips, knees, and ankles is a myth.How many sitting postures does this chair allow? Pretty much one. Now let's take a look at it. It does look like good posture to sit upright with a slight arch in your low back and your chest up, rather than slumped, but what is the effect on your body if you maintain this posture for more than 15 minutes?The primary muscles keeping your torso upright are your hip flexors. These tend to already be tight and short in people who sit around all day at work. You can add overactive to that list if you start using this chair for long periods of time. The psoas (the main hip flexor) muscle attaches to the lumbar spine and whenever the muscle activates, it pulls down on it. This causes increased pressure on the discs in your lumbar spine. This is not good for long periods of time. In addition, your other postural muscles will get overused from sitting in this chair and not being able to change position.In conclusion, I do recommend balance balls but I don't recommend balance ball chairs unless they are used for short periods of time (but then you might as well just do exercises on a balance ball).
