review/summary: An excellent product!review/text: If you're looking for a simple, reliable water bottle then I don't think it gets much better than a Klean Kanteen. I've had mine for a couple of months now and I bought one for my friend over a year ago and she uses it every day. They both have held up to drops, dings, and abuse very well. The paint still looks pretty fresh save for a few scratches around the bottom from dropping. Both bottles are dent free however. Water tastes the way it does from the faucet or your fridge as opposed to plastic-ey, even when warm. My one suggestion is to go with the sport cap, especially if you like to take frequent sips. The screw on cap is durable and functional, but you have to screw it down several full rotations each time you take a drink and the time doing this does add up.
