review/summary: White 20oz Polar Bottlereview/text: This bottle is great keeps my water ice cold for dayz haha. My water will stay cold for about 2 and a half hours, and i live in Bakersfield, California where it is 100 degrees every day in the summer. Sometimes I fill some of the bottle up and freeze it, then fill the rest with water. That keeps my water cold for my 35 miles a day ride and its still cold when I refill it because of the frozen ice at the bottom.
