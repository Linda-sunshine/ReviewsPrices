review/summary: Great Workout!review/text: 1.) I would highly recommend only doing about half of the daily workout for the first few weeks, then gradually increasing the amount of time. Otherwise you will be very sore, which makes it hard to stick with the routine.2.) Tony is very enthusiastic and supportive during each of the exercises, makes it easy to want to give it your all.3.) To start this program, I would recommend the following equipment at a minimum:- push up bars- chin-up/pull-up bar- a few free weights to start (adjustable ones will come in handy later, as you want to change weight for each exercise)- yoga mat
