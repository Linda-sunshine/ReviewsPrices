review/summary: Surprisingly goodreview/text: There aren't a lot of truly good rear bike lights out there. Fortunately this is one of them. It's red, it blinks (or solid, your choice), it's bright, it's adjustable, it's great on batteries (standard AAAs), and 2.5 years after I bought it, it works like it did on day one.Definitely worth it.
