review/summary: Works with my 2011 CRVreview/text: I was concerned before purchasing this item as to whether it would work with my 2011 CRV as I read conflicting information. However, this held two bikes securely to the back of my car. I was careful to tighten all of the straps and had no issues on the interstate or over bumpy roads. The only difficulty was that it's really not made to hold small bikes and I had some trouble mounting my five-year-old's bike to the rack. However, with perseverance, it worked eventually. I used the extra length in the straps to secure the front bike tires while driving. I am happy with this rack and with the price offered by Amazon.
