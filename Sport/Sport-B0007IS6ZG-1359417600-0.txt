review/summary: Good beginner adult jump ropereview/text: Not sure how much other jump ropes cost to know if I got what I paid for. Nice that it can be made to a specific length. Plastic rope part is hard to straighten enough to use since it comes completely folded and bound. I think it will stand up to moderate outdoor use
