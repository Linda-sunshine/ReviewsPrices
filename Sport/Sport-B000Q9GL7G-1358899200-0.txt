review/summary: Excellent holster for the moneyreview/text: Size 25 fits my full size Smith & Wesson M&P; perfectly (9mm or 40 but not the 45). It comes with a paddle you can use, or just go with the belt loop attachment. I've tried both and prefer the belt loop attachment, but the paddle option works pretty well. It stays pretty solid and is obviously easier to remove if you don't want to take your belt off just to remove your holster. Either way you use it, draw and re-holster is quick, easy and solid.Can't pull the weapon out of the holster without pressing the release, which is perfectly placed to draw.The whole thing isn't uncomfortable at all either. It's quite compact for what it is and there are adjustment screws to change the angle of the draw.All in all a great holster. I can't find a single thing wrong with it.
