review/summary: Great for beginners, OURS came packaged differently and DID include all parts.review/text: Works well and my 9 YO daughter has no trouble with the pull force. Arrows are sorta cheapy but fine to learn. Now ours arrived in a box and included a foam padded target, a spare target, a wrist guard, a finger grip/guard, an adjustable sight, bow and 2 arrows. All of the ones I've seen online are packaged much differently which would not allow for the items stated. Even the one actually shown for our order is without a box. We got ours from Big5.com. [...]Overall pleased with this item.
