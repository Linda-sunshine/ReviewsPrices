review/summary: Never again.review/text: I bought 3 of these and 3 other colors in size medium after doing so much reading and research.I stand all day at work and move around so it was time to upgrade my life! Or so I thought.These had such great reviews and people swore by them. I fell for it.Upon receiving these I was very excited. I thought I was finally going to be able to wear one of the best underwear ever!I tried it on, it was a bit snug, but since it was boxer brief I understood. (I am currently wearing the Under Armour brand)Because I knew I would actually use all 6 pairs I said to myself, let's just open them all up and put them away and I can start wearing them tomorrow!That's where reality set in, one of the underwear looked slightly smaller than the other one.So I laid one pair down, and on top of it the other pair that made me think.Now, I did not order different sizes, I did however order different colors so I thought maybe certain colors are slightly smaller (it wouldn't make sense anyway but I was trying to come up with an excuse)At this time, I was a bit pissed off. The one that I tried on had fit me and it was snug, the other one would not be comfortable and as I expected, it wasn't.So I took all of them out, put the blacks ones on one pie and the charcoal ones on the other.I measure all of them and the every single one of them is a different size.LET ME MAKE THIS EASY FOR YOU, EVERY SINGLE UNDERWEAR IS A DIFFERENT SIZE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ALL LABELED "MEDIUM"So I went to the website thinking, maybe I should just go to the actual site and buy it from them.Maybe Amazon messed up (it has happened before) than I found "Items purchased through Amazon.com can only be refunded."To me that meant it is the real product, somehow a bit cheaper on Amazon.I don't think these are handmade and I don't see why every single one of mine were different sizes.I will definitely be returning these worthless items and NEVER recommend this brand again.If a clothing company can't keep consistent sizes, they should not be in business.
