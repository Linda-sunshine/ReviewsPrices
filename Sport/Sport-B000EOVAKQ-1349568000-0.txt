review/summary: Great gogglesreview/text: I have bought multiple pairs of goggles before, but the Aqua Sphere goggles top the list in quality. I have swam for approximately 3 months with the pair, and I have had no problems whatsoever. The goggles have a snug fit, sleek design, and overall great view underwater. Water rarely finds a way into the goggles, which is a huge bonus. Great product overall, will buy again.
