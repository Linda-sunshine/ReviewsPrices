review/summary: Invicta Men's 8926OB Pro Diver Collection Coin-Edge Automatic Watchreview/text: Bought this watch due to a discussion on watches on a site in Internet. They said it was a copy of a more expensive watch: a Rolex. That is the reason I bought it. Indeed it is a copy to the last detail of said watch. The only difference is in the name: Invicta vs. Rolex. It is a small watch when compared to today's watches which are huge in size. So much so, that I also bought another watch announced in one of those ads, a humongously big watch. So big it can not fit in my watch case. A nice and beautiful watch.
