review/summary: Excellent For Short Usesreview/text: I purchased this to use for one overnight when I was visiting my friend in another state. It's very easy to transport, the mattress, pump, and power cord are all well contained, and it comes with a bag for storage. Set up is incredibly easy and it only takes a few minutes for the bed to fully inflate. Sleeping on the bed was very comfortable for the one night I stayed on it. You can't feel the pump through the mattress and the built-in pillow is an amazing addition. Folding it back up can be a little frustrating, but if you follow the procedure in the instructions it makes it easier.I've only slept on the mattress for one night, but from what I've seen so far, I'm very happy with it.
