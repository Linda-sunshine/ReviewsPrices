review/summary: love itreview/text: these are great for the purpose. i would go to the range in the morning and my hands would be numb which obviously does not help with trying to shoot. I have a big hand but went with the large even when thinking i should maybe go with a little bigger size. glad i got large cuz they fit great, with more use they will break in and be one of the most beneficial purchases i have made to go along with my gun
