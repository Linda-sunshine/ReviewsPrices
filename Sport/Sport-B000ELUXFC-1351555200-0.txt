review/summary: Great value!review/text: This rack is a great value for the money! Since I'm new to riding and working on acquiring all the necessary equipment (not cheap!), I wasn't too excited about about spending $100 or more on the car racks I'd seen at the sporting goods store. This product does what I need - transports my bikes safely and without damaging the bikes or my car - what more do I need?! Super easy to install and fit my 2009 Prius perfectly. I highly recommend this product if you're looking for a functional bike rack at a great price!
