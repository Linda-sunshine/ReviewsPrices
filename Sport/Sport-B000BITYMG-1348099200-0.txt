review/summary: good idea but it brokereview/text: I bought one and I recommended it to my sister. Hers broke within a week; mine broke within two months. I don't take it on/off often, so it surprised me when it broke. These leashes are a good idea...i use mine to secure my fitbit. They are reasonably inexpensive, so if you order them, get a few of them. They do break easily.
