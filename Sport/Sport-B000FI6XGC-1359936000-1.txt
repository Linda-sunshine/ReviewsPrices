review/summary: good if you want it to pump you armsreview/text: people trust me this pump is a waste of money!!!! if u buying this pump for a 16" wheel bike is ok but if you looking for a pump for mtb of any big bike look for something else. i have got flats a couple of times and i have got to pump like 180 times to get some decent air in mi tire, it is good if u want to get stronger arms or something.... dont buy this!!!
