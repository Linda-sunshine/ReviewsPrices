review/summary: Bad shipmentreview/text: I ordered this because my vein doctor uses it in his office and loved it. I was excited to get it. Problem was it arrived in a very battered box...and upon opening it, I discovered it was missing parts as it apparently was a return and no one checked it before sending it out. The seller refunded my money as soon as it got the item back and apologized for the lack of checking returned items.
