review/summary: Perfect Hi Activity Wear!review/text: Wore these on a backpacking trip and they were awesome! They wick sweat quite well, keeping you cooler. They also seemed to help reduce chaffing. Had a second pair for back up so I could keep them clean and dry. These are the best underwear I have found.
