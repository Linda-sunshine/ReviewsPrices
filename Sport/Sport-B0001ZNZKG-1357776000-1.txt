review/summary: Best Underwear I've Ever Wornreview/text: I bought a few pair of these before a long trip, and have come to detest every other pair of underwear in my drawer. The waistband is extremely comfortable and the material itself is amazing. I've hand-washed them in the sink dozens of times and they come out smelling like they've been through a full wash cycle. Eventually, I'm going to transition to wearing these exclusively.
