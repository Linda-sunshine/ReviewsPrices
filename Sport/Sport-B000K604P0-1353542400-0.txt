review/summary: THE BEST!review/text: This thermos is impressive, keeps liquid hot. I have tried every kind of thermos and eventually gave up on them. Couldnt find one that kept liquids hot for over 8 hours. Decided to get back in the game and bought this one solely because of its size. It has the perfect capacity, for me. No more wasting coffee, filling an oversize thermos and hoping it remains hot.Like I said, I bought this thermos due to its size. So I was highly impressed when 8 hours after filling, the liquid was still nice and hot. It was a pleasant surprise. Also, you can drink right out of the top, it is great. While I dont carry this thermos upside down or anything, there are no leakage problems. It has a great rubber gasket seal. One more thing, I have never preheated this thermos. Not my thing, and it still works like a charm.
