review/summary: 6 months laterreview/text: I used this bottle daily this summer. It is well designed, the grips and the plastic loop to pull it out of the bottle cage work just fine. You can put it in the dishwasher too. With the color choices you can feel a bit more unique or match your helmet colors or something. All that said, after 6 months I've noticed sometimes it will leak around the screw top...not sure if I'm not getting it screwed down tight enough or what, but more than once I've ended up with a water streak on the front of my shirt. Not a problem if your biking on a hot, humid day but if you use it around the house too the wife will start to wonder about your motor skills and if you've had a stroke. All jokes aside, I'd buy it again - for this price, it's almost worth buying one every other year. For the new cyclist, if you plan to do anything more than 10 miles in hot weather, buy two bottles and bottle cages. I did a short 18 miler on a 105 degree day this summer and ended up stopping at someone's house begging for water. I'm that guy.
