review/summary: A solid cardio workout whether you're short on time or not!review/text: History: I have been working out 3-4x/week for the past ~25 years (since age 17!) and have tried just about every workout program there is: The Firm, Tae-Bo, Body Pump, Jillian Michaels' workouts (including one of my all-time favorites: 30 Day Shred), Wii Zumba, pilates, yoga, karate, ballet conditioning, and several Beachbody workouts including Turbo Jam and Hip Hop Abs.I've been doing this workout 3-4x/week for the past month. It's a good workout in just 20 minutes. I do have to modify certain parts due to my bum knees. For example, instead of doing the push-up/jump up routine I stay on the floor doing push-ups. The pace is great, very intense, but do-able. It is a heart-pounding cardio workout with some upper-body resistance work using your own body weight. Unlike others who have reviewed this, I don't sweat much during this workout. (???)The warm-up seems to be the hardest part and takes up a big chunk of the workout time. The post- warm-up stretch is well timed and gives you a short breather so you can tackle the rest of the workout.I still do a 30 Day Shred workout, which is a total of 30 minutes, about once/week because I feel I get a harder workout using weights. But for the days I want a good, weight-free cardio-heavy workout, I love this one.The production quality seems a little rough... like they just attached a camera to a tripod and pushed 'record'. Plus, even with the volume turned way up it's a little hard to hear the trainer, Shaun T. The price is low, though, so these are minor complaints. What I did get was a great workout that will hopefully help me get me over my plateau.
