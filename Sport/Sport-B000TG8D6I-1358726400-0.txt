review/summary: Great work outreview/text: P90X is a great work out. Tony is kind of annoying, but really enthusiastic which is nice in those beginning days when you don't feel like working out. The workouts are intense, and you'll be incredibly sore the first week. It's a bit of a combo between strength and cardio, but the main emphasis is on strength building. Follow the diet plan and you'll see all your power numbers go up while also getting a lot more defined. Also, I feel like given that the cardo isn't crazy (minus the plyo X day) you can start this program from pretty much anywhere in terms of fitness. Tony does a great job giving you alternative exercises if you're not yet strong enough to do some of the exercises. Most people who quit end up quitting because it's too long. The work outs are generally 45 minutes, but the yoga x day is an hour and half. That is pretty long, but it's kind of broken up into 2 distinct 45 minute blocks that you can spread out, or do one half one week and the other half the next week if you don't wand to to the full work out. Regardless, it's a really adaptable work out and you can probably make it work with your schedule. You'll need dumb bells, a pull up bar (or band), and possibly a yoga mat depending on what kind of surface you're going to do it on (carpet should be fine...hard wood or tile I'd get the mat). Definitely a great purchase and got my power numbers way up along with getting me in better cardio shape.
