review/summary: Wonderful Product!review/text: This bottle provided everything that I was looking for as a road cyclist. The bottle fits perfectly in the standard-sized bottle cages I have mounted on my bike. The longest ride I've gone on with this bottle is about 2 1/2 hours and at the end of that ride, the water was just as cool when I first started. Another great feature of this product is the cap. It is perfect for quick access using your mouth to open and it stays open until you close it, which is also relatively easy. Great bottle.
