review/summary: Very Good Quality for the Pricereview/text: Our guest who weighs over 300lbs used it for over a week and only had to put a bit more air in it once after the first three nights. And then two of us with a combined weight of about 290lbs also used the bed for two weeks with no problem. The only down side is the material holds the cold but can be easily fixed by covering it with a blanket or a fleece sheet. It is a reasonably-priced air bed no intended for long-term use and we are very careful to apply slow and even pressure getting in and out of the bed (no jumping!), avoid over-filling and keep sharp objects well away from it.
