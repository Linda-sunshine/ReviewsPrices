review/summary: Is knife. Is sharp. Makes cuts.review/text: Not a lot to say about it. It's a good, sharp lockback pocketknife, suitable for a gentleman to clip to the pants pocket of his suit. If you've got a bitty little torx driver, you can flip the end that the clip is located on. Due to the speedsafe system, I don't recommend that you carry it without the clip. The blade is quite pointy & sharp, and you do not want it coming open in your pocket. You will get some odd looks due to how quick it opens. The only flaw I've found with these is how the blade comes to a needle-like point that is somewhat fragile.
