review/summary: Perfect!review/text: I dont know what a yoga mat should or shouldn't be, but this one fit my need. I tried some yoga, couldn't get into it. But now it is something that I use for my leg exercises, strength training and ab workouts. My cat does love to sleep on it when it's rolled up. It is now 2012 and it's in perfect condition from when I bought it in 2007.
