review/summary: Metallic tastereview/text: I read the reviews before buying this water bottle, and had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, even after repeated washing (hand washed with mild soap), water in this bottle has a metallic taste. I gave it two stars because I love the design, but as it makes water taste metallic, I did return the water bottle. Amazon is great and makes returns so easy! But I wish I had a usable water bottle instead...
