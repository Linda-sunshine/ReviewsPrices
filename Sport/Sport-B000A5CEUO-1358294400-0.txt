review/summary: Works great when it works, which isn't long.review/text: I bought this monitor to get a better sense of my workouts. It worked reasonably well for several months, and then stopped detecting my heart rate. Cleaned it, carefully. Changed the battery. Tried again. No luck. This is a very poorly made product and I cannot in good faith recommend it.
