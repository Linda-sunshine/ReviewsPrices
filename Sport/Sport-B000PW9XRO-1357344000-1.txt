review/summary: Comfortable, but not even slightly weatherproofreview/text: I bought these gloves with the intention of wearing them to outdoor clay shooting in the winter. I quickly found out that they're better than nothing at all, but they're definitely not warm. I used them once in the rain and they were quickly soaked through.All of that said, if it's not too cold out, they're nice - very comfortable and grippy.
