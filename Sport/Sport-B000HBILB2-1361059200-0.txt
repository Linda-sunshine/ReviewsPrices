review/summary: Came with a Leakreview/text: Guess I knew we were gambling when we bought this, since about half the existing reviews said it arrived with a leak. Remind me to never to go Vegas, right? It arrived, we blew it up with the built-in pump, which worked like a charm. Seemed like it was pretty comfortable... then my son took it on a sleepover, and woke up the next morning flat on the floor. Returned it to Amazon as a defective item for a full refund. Thinking I like another reviewer's idea of just buying a regular twin-size mattress, since we would usually be using it at home anyway, then maybe get one of the pump-less airbeds for the occasional road trip, since those have better reliability stats than the ones with the built-in pump. Live and learn...
