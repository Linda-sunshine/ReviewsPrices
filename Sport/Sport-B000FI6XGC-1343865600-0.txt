review/summary: Super light, low-profile pumpreview/text: Tiny effective pump with a good mount. Only downside is no PSI gauge. Great product at a great price. I would definitely buy this again.This pump is very small but has no problem pushing very high PSI (it claimed up to 160PSI on the packaging). The pump comes ready to use on Presta valves, which wokred great for me. If you're using Schrader valves, I would recommend just looking up an online video on how to switch it. It's not difficult, but the pump doesn't really come with the detailed instructions. The mount fits nicely underneath my bottle cage and used the existing screws to mount securely. The pump is very low profile and light so it doesn't get in the way and would also fit nicely in a bag.The only add-on I would like would be to have is an attached PSI gauge, but you can easily test the pressure with your fingers or a separate gauge.
