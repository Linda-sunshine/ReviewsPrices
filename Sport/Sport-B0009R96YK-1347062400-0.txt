review/summary: Bike Mirrorreview/text: Lots of flexibility in mounting this mirror... For whatever reason the threaded bushings that make the mirror "tight" in the handle tubes as you turn in the screws were scary tight! I thought sure I was going to strip out the threads or the hex head; but, it all seemed to tighten up nicely, howbeit with nervous anticipation... TIP:I did put a bit of household oil on the threads. Very secure and steady design.
