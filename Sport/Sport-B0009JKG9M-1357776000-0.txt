review/summary: Cookerreview/text: Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas to replace the one I supposedly lost for him. He loves to cook and I know he will put it to good use. Cast iron will last forever. Highly recommend this cooker. The best part I like is the skillet can be used as a cover too, the price sold me.
