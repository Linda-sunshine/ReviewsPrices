review/summary: Insanity (Fo sho')review/text: The night before, my husband and I previewed the entire workout as our mouths remained wide open. Mentally, I knew I could do the workout circuits. The next morning, I got up, put my mind/body in alignment, poped in the dvd, and got to work. I sweated sooooo much....sweat drops dropped from my armpits. I love this workout!! I will utiliize it for 30 days then move to the full Insanity package.****Be aware the work it polymetrics moves (using your body weight only). Its very intense and you have to be focused during the workout. I suggest you practice polymetrics workouts on your own first before purchasing the prelude (20 min dvd). Shaun T is no joke.Zee
