review/summary: NICE!review/text: Got this grip for my Ruger sr9c.When I first looked at it I didnt think I would be able to get that little grip on the gun but I did.No hassle,heating or trimming necessary for my gun.Actually installed in less than 3 mins so I was impressed.It definetely makes gun feel more sturdy in my hand as opposed to Rugers stock polymer grip.Also feels beefier.I dont reckon this gun will be slipping out of my hand any time soon.Highly recommend.
