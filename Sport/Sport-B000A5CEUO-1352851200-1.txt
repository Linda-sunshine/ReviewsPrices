review/summary: Worked Great....for about a month.review/text: I was really happy with this heart rate monitor. I work out every single day except Saturdays. (The Sabbath) I purchased this based on reviews. And it worked great. And now.....after about a month. It don't work anymore. It keeps time. But the heart rate monitor stopped working. I tried replacing battery in the belt. Nothing. Too bad......I liked it. And now.....it's just a watch.
