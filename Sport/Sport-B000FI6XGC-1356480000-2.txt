review/summary: added stressreview/text: I have had this product for several months now and had to use it twice in circumstaces where I realy needed it. The problem seems to be the valve in the head of the pump ( part that attaches to the valve ) sticks. this results in either very slow intake of air back in to the pump ( 2-3 secs. ) or sucking the air back out of the tire that you just pumped in. I will give the manufacturer a chance to make good, however if you are going to buy this pump you should know that even if it works as designed it will take aprox. 200 pumps to inflate past the possibility of a pinch flat
