review/summary: Sexiest Knife You Will Ever Own ;)review/text: This is by far the most aesthetically pleasing knife I have ever owned. The body is not so much silver (as seen in the pictures) as it is light grey. I noticed that the clip interferes with the already hard-to-grasp body, so I removed the clip very easily with a small screwdriver. After removing it, the grip was very good. After watching some reviews on YouTube I assumed it would be extremely easy for the flipper to be activated; not quite. It actually takes a bit of force to get the flipper to open the blade. However, this could be due to the knife being less than a day old :PMy only gripe with this knife is I find it very difficult to completely open the knife using the thumb stud; I think the stud is too close to the body of the knife to allow for an easy opening system. Hopefully with time it will become easier. That is the only reason I gave this knife a 4/5.Overall, great EDC knife, it will see a lot of carry.
