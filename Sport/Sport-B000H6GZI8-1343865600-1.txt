review/summary: Comfortable Gripreview/text: I bought theHogue Rubber Grip Handall Jr. Small Size Grip Sleevebecause my Kahr CW40's checker-textured polymer grip irritated my hand after extended shooting. I found it listed on Kahr's website and ordered it from Amazon, which was a little bit cheaper. It took a little bit of effort to get it on and slide it up (not too bad) and positioned the finger groove where my middle and ring fingers grip the gun. The Kahr fit my hand like a glove before, but now it feels even better with this non-slip tube grip. Will be ordering another for my father-in-law's weapon.
