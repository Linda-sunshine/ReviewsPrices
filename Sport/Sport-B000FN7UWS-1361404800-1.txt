review/summary: Not cheap steel as far as I can tell, but the paint flakes easilyreview/text: If I had it to do again, I'd buy the unpainted model. On this one, the paint flaked off on the bottom within the first few days of light use. Aside from that It feels tough and durable and has absolutely no give.
