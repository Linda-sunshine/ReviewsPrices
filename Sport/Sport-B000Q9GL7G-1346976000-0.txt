review/summary: Serpa holders, secure and effectivereview/text: I have been a law enforcement officer for over 20 years and have purchased numerous holsters in my career. I already utilized a Blackhawk Serpa for my Sig Sauer 9mm and when I obtained a new Glock 17, I immediately decided that the Blackhawk Serpa would be my holster of choice. Why? Blackhawk has raised the bar by creating a high quality, easy to use Level 2 retention holster. It securely locks your weapon in the holster every time. The trigger guard lock is very secure and can be easily disengaged when drawing the weapon. The quality of the holster is reflected in the proprietary blend of polymers and carbon fibers. The Serpa CQC is a concealed carry holster. Why would you need a level 2 holster for concealed carry? My question is why wouldn't you? Do you want to ever risk the consequences of having a fight over the possession of the weapon and lose? I submit that purchasing a level 2 concealment holster that is secure but fast to withdraw and unlock is a no brainer. I fully recommend Blackhawk Serpa holsters.
