review/summary: Am I Missing Something?review/text: Before purchasing this rack from my '99 Accord sedan to take my bike on a five hundred mile move, I read many reviews warning against the possible damage this rack can inflict upon the car's finish. I was confident I could forgo such an outcome by attaching my own cloth buffers from old rags/towels and the like. After promptly receiving and installing the rack onto my trunk with the prior alluded to additional fittings, all of which was done relatively painlessly from my mechanically inclined opinion, I racked my old road bike up. I was thoroughly disappointed when I realized that although the bike seemed to be firmly secure where attached to the rack, the majority of the frame was left swinging and swaying at the whim of a breeze or the force of acceleration/deceleration to the point where I questioned whether I was not missing an additional securative appendage for the rack. As i was leaving next morning I had little time to fully assess the situation and/or apply any simple, curative measures to further secure the nearly bond-less bicycle.In short, I found the rack to be utterly inadequate. The only good thing I can say is that Amazon accepted my return despite the fact that I had negligently discarded all of the original packaging.
