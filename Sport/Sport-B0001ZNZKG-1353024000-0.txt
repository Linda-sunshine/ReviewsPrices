review/summary: My new favorite underwearreview/text: You really can wash these in the sink with soap if you are overnight somewhere. Not that you have to. You can of course also wash them in the machine with the normal stuff. I find myself rooting through my drawers drawer to pick out a pair of these drawers. They are superior to the others, even with the tag in the back which I usually have to cut out with extreme prejudice. They are expensive, so I'm buying a pair a month until I can rotate out all of my old stuff.
