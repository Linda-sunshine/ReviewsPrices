review/summary: My son loves them!review/text: I bought these for my son as a trial before I invested the money for 6 pairs for him to wear to Boy Scout camp. These briefs worked wonderfully to wick away moisture, prevent chaifing and just kept him more comfortable in the nasty summer heat than traditional boxers or briefs.
