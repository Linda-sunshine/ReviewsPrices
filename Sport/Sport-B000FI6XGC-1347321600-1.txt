review/summary: Compact but difficult to connect and slow...review/text: Started commuting by bike and I needed a pump I could carry everywhere for the emergency thorn/nail. This pump is nice and compact and very well built. The valve system took a bit of figuring out but it does work for both the schrader and high pressure valve and its easy to switch between the two once you know how. My only other issues are it takes a bit of work to connect to the valve and is slow to pump, as is expected with such a small pump. That being said, I still bring it everywhere with me...
