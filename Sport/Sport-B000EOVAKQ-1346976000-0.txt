review/summary: Great for trainingreview/text: These goggles are terrific. They have the right balance of being snug on your head but not squeezing your eyes and leaving red marks on your face. My only complaint is that the goggle comes very close to your eye so my eyelashes brush against them (women, take off your mascara before jumping in the pool!).Otherwise, they're comfortable and leak-proof and I really enjoy wearing them. Will buy again in the future!
