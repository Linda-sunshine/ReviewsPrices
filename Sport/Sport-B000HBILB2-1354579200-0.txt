review/summary: Good airbed. No issues on first use.review/text: We have a queen size Intex airbed that we've had for over four years, and which has been set up and taken down dozens of times, and used for periods of a week or longer, which we've had no issues with. We needed a smaller bed for when our teenagers had guests spending the night, and this looked like the best option. On a Gold Box deal, this was a deal we could not let pass.The bed arrived well packaged without issues. The mattress has a carrying bag, which is great for storing and using when traveling. At the time of this review, we have only used this bed one time, but it had no issues, and is a comfortable bed to sleep on. We prefer the height of these air beds over the single mattress height of many airbeds on the market.The inflation and deflation times are only a couple of minutes, and folding is no problem, but when folding, one must take into account the size of the carrying/storage bag, to ensure the mattress fits into the bag properly and with ease.I am sure we will use this bed many times over the next year, and will follow up with how the bed has done over that time. At this time, I see no issues that would be a deal breaker for this bed.
