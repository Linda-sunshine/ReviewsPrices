review/summary: awesomereview/text: these goggles are super great. the most important thing is comfort and they feel amazing in this category. doesn't hurt my face or bother any areas of my face. feel snug and no water ever gets in. i've been using them for 3 months straight 4-5 days a week. great for beginners. they do not fog up. only when you take them off after using them and then putting them back on to swim again, they fog up. but while using them in the water for more than an hour they do not fog up at all. get them.
