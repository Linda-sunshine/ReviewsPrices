review/summary: Polarized RayBansreview/text: I've been wearing Aviator RayBans with wrap-around temples for over 40 years. This latest pair is great, as always. This time, however, I bought them polarized and they are difficult to keep clean. They smear easily after washing with soap and warm water. I wanted the wrap-around temples but it was a no-go. The only place I can find wrap-around temples for my aviator RayBans is at my optometrist and only if I purchase the frames.
