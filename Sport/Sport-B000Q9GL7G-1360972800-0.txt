review/summary: Look Cool Works Greatreview/text: Fits my Berretta 92FS just great. I love that it locks the gun in so it's much less likely to fall out if I'm on the move. It also makes it a little tricky for someone to try to grab your gun. This is a very versatile holster and anyone using it should be able to find a configuration that works for them. Blackhawk rules.
