review/summary: Do what they're supposed to doreview/text: They feed and eject in my gun, have dry fired several hundred times and the snap cap is still holding up. Some of the paint has worn away from the edges and I've only cycled one of these caps a couple dozen times. That being said, I haven't seen any chunks of paint come off and can't expect the paint not to wear off a little. My gun is SA/DA and has a hammer, so I can dry fire all I want without having to repeatedly cycle the round through the gun, and it works perfectly for that.
