review/summary: Noise reduction at the rangereview/text: I ordered this set of earmuffs for indoor range shooting and found that it performed as expected. The noise reduction obviously didn't make a 12 gauge sound like a butterfly kiss. Nevertheless, it reduced the decibel level enough to make a .40 caliber pistol sound significantly softer...I left the range without ringing, ear pain or any other side effect. If you want to fire higher caliber guns or protect your ears even more, I recommend using foam ear plugs in addition to the Peltor Optime muffs.
