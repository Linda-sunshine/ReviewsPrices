review/summary: My preferred holsterreview/text: This is probably the 4th Serpa CQC holster that I have purchased through the years and it is the one I look for first. Highly recommended. I love the finger quick release, no fumbling with thumb breaks and easy to reholster securely without trying to reconnect the thumb break.
