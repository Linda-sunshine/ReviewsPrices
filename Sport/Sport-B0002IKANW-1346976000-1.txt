review/summary: 9mm Snap Caps great practice false roundsreview/text: If you have a 9mm handgun and are interested in teaching handgun safety to a relative who has weapon anxiety, snap caps are a great tool. These A-Zoom brand snap caps were all high quiality smooth, and run through my guns cleanly. They are fantastic for teaching a beginner how to load and unload a gun, handle a weapon, cycle rounds througha gun, clear jams, with no risk other than a pinched finger. I highly recommend them to gun owners practicing with their own weapons, and even more useful to anyone teacing safe practices to a beginner. highly recommended for all gun owners.
