review/summary: A must havereview/text: And after a mile of riding after mounting this, I wondered how I could have ever lived without rear view mirror on my bike. The only &#34;con&#34; is that it is very difficult to mount (you do need lots of strength to tighten it up), but it's also a plus because one it's on, it stays one (you really don't want the mirror to swivel or move every time you hit a pothole or go over a bump). I've dropped my bike a few time and the mirror did not break.
