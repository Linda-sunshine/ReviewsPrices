review/summary: Great Bed..review/text: I really shopped around before buying these beds because other beds I have purchased always went flat during the night, These are perfect, purchased 2 for when my kids came for Thanksgiving. They are a great height, easy to fill, clean and deflate...No &#34;flats&#34; during the night and for the price you can't beat them. Plus they are really comfortable...
