review/summary: Too hard for a 6 year old, perfect for my 8 and 10 year olds.review/text: We bought these (two pink ones, one yellow one) for my three kids for Christmas. The two older kids are having a blast with them. My youngest doesn't have the arm strength to pull it back yet. Once you get it past a certain point it pulls back easily, but getting it started is a little tough for a younger.I knew going in based on reviews that the arrows weren't stellar, and I've found that to be the case as well. The first day outside with them, one of my daugher's arrow feathers tore off. We have since gotten the kids some more arrows at the store and that's not a big deal. I also wish there was more of a &#34;ridge&#34; on the ledge where the arrow sits, as my son (especially, still being younger) has trouble keeping it on as he pulls back the bow. I put a little strip of hot glue to make a more defined ridge, and that seemed to do the trick.The bow itself is nice and worth the price.
