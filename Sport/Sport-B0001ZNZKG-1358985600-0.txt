review/summary: ExOfficio 5 years inreview/text: Many others have reviewed these in detail so I will just note the durability of these boxer briefs. I bought my first pair about 5 years ago to wear golfing or working out or if I knew I was going to be outside all day to combat the general "swampy-ness" that can occur with cotton boxers. I purchased many more over the next few years (I now have 8 pairs) and have exclusively been wearing these daily for the past 3 years.All 8 pairs have held up...no rips, tears, no seams have come apart. There is minor wear and pilling in the seat but nothing has worn through. They stretch out a little during wear but always shrink back to the original size after a run through the washer/dryer. I have thrown away all my other boxers and underwear and haven't looked back!
