review/summary: Nice little grillreview/text: Bought this grill for its portability. Took it out on the pontoon a couple of times this summer so we could enjoy a cookout on the water. Not as nice as a regular full size, the burner is too close the the grate, but if the flame is kept low it works well on brauts and dogs
