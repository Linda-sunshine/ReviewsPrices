review/summary: not easy to set up but functionalreview/text: This rack serves its purpose, but it wasn't easy to set up. It required me to look up the tutorial on the website (I'm glad they had that at least), but when I did I realized setting it up would mean bending the thinner metal bars into place. The video made it look easy. It wasn't. If you're jacked, you might have an easier time than I did, but don't be misled by the limp wristed girl in the tutorial snapping it into place on the first try without tears of frustration.
