review/summary: Truly adjustablereview/text: This helmet is completely adjustable to fit my head perfectly. I originally purchased a different brand that was labeled Med/Lge but, it did not fit at all and I could not adjust it. This one has a twist screw on the back so you can adjust it more precisely.
