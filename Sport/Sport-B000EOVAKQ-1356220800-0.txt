review/summary: Best ones I have ever had !!!review/text: I went through both the &#34;Speedo Vanquisher 2.0 Plus Mirrored Goggle, Silver/Grey&#34; and the &#34;Aqua Sphere Kayenne Goggle With Clear Lens, Clear/Black&#34; before I got this one. Both the above had issues with fogging and comfort. The Speedo Vanquisher was constantly fogging after a couple of laps and was not very comfortable. The Kayenne was a bit too large and was also fogging up quite a bit... These are perfect !! The blue tint is very good underwater, and gives EXCELLENT visibility. The soft silicone edges are extremely comfortable on my face, and barely realise that I have them on. There are many a time when I have raised them up to my forehead after a lap... and then as I started my next lap, forgot to put them back on and only realise once my eyes feel the water !! They never fog up, and hold up very well in the pool. Will definitely buy them again, and would recommend them in a blink !
