review/summary: Slick, Sharp, Smallreview/text: My wife bought this knife for me for Christmas. It's super sharp, and the operation is nice and smooth. But it's smaller than I'd expected from looking at it online. My hand is much too large for it. However, it's the perfect size for my wife so she's appropriated it as her EDC.
