review/summary: Repeating Problem with the Spoutreview/text: Over the past couple years I've gone through a few of these bottles. The spout is the biggest issue. You lift up the spout to drink and that's all well and good. But after about a year of regular use, I've noticed that the spout does not stay up when you drink it. Even when you lift up the spout, it sinks back down. When you're in the middle of drinking, you have to forcibly keep the spout open or else the flow from the bottle to your mouth is reduced to a trickle.I thought it was a one time thing. But now after experiencing this with my last two water bottles, I'm going to purchase a different product. I do not recommend this bottle.
