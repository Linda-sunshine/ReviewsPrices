review/summary: Works pretty wellreview/text: My wife wanted a pedometer that could track steps be downloaded for analysis. This seemed to fit the bill. The software is fine, and it works. My wife is not too happy with the holster that comes with it. The clip is very weak. It's designed for belts and jeans, I think. Yoga pants, stretch pants, shorts...it doesn't hold very well.
