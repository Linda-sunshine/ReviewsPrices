review/summary: I love this program!review/text: I'm coming into the end of Phase 2 of this workout program, and although I haven't seen great results on the scale so far (down by maybe 5lbs out of my 50lbs long-term goal), I have seen incredible results around my arms and waist - I've already gone down a pant size. I'm not really here to talk about the program though... There are lots of other reviews out about this product; and they are all immensely helpful in making your decision whether or not to buy it.I would like to point something out that people might not think about: Beachbody is an immensely helpful company. If you purchase the program THROUGH BEACHBODY (as well as your shakeology, etc) they will help you with anything you need. For instance.. If you need a replacement copy of one of the DVDs or guide books. Unfortunately, I purchased mine through amazon, so I was unable to get a replacement copy of my nutrition guide when I accidentally threw it away last Spring - please keep in mind where you're buying it from when you do (and I don't say "if you do") decide to get this program.Keep Pushing Play!
