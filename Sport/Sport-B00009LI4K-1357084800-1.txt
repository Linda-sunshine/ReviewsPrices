review/summary: It's great!review/text: I study in a noisy environment and that's the reason I had to buy it. It cancels most of the noise, but I can still hear human voice. But if you use ear plugs with this, you'll be in your own world.Cons: Can't wear it for too long. It kinda creates pain in your ears due to the pressure.But really, it's worth buying.
