review/summary: It works for me.review/text: There's allot of good things about this bed. It looks good. It's as portable as a bed can be. I sleep without waking up every night. I've been sleeping on it for a month straight now. No leaks at all.It fills with air very fast. But be aware that there is no automatic shutoff. The first time I filled it, the noise was loud so I left the room. When I came back a few minutes later the thing was over pressurized. I turned it off and let some air out. The air coming out was actually hot. Hopefully I didn't damage the internals when I did this. So if you buy this bed be aware of the speed of the pump, especially towards the end. It goes from being to soft to overfilled rock hard in seconds.The thing I don't like is the built in pillow. It's too hard to use as a pillow but when you put your pillow on top of it, now your pillow is too high. So I end up sliding down some and letting my feet hang over the end. Not a good design for a pillow.
