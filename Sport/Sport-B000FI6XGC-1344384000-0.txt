review/summary: Great!review/text: So I wanted to wait until I actually used this to fix a flat before I wrote a review. I had the luxury of repairing two tubes in two days.(gee arent I lucky?) So at first I thought that air was not getting into the tube and I was about ready to immediately give this up and get an air chuck. Upon investigation it was my tire providing the puncture (another story). Fast forward to the next day, another flat due to the tire; however this time I manage to fix that and replace the tube on the highway and fill it up using my new mini pump. It works GREAT! Way easier to fill up than my friends more expensive Lezyne mini pump, so less effort there. It got my tube up to at least about 110 before I decided the pressure was fine. If you need a mini pump for those long trips or even the small trips, then this pump is exactly what you want.
