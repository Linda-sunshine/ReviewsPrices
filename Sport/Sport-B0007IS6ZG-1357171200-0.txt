review/summary: Great jump rope and only cost six bucksreview/text: Just started jumping a couple of months ago and already people are asking me to show them how to jump. I like this rope because you can adjust it to fit you. The grip is great and it works great for me. The price is good and I got free shipping. I would recommend this product to anyone, I even bought one as a gift for a friend.
