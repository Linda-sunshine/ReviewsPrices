review/summary: Drawstring broke after 1 week of usereview/text: Great feel and comfort, i love the tight drawstring on the ankles so they dont ride up or down as easily.However the drawstring did break after one use, it snapped in the back so i was forced to remove it, and use a new drawstring which means i had to go through the painful process of feeding a new one through the hole all the way around the waistband.Good material, nice pockets, the only flaw was the drawstring, hopefully you will be luckier, im size 30 waist i bought large, it was perfect length but i like to tie the string tight so they dont sag and snap went my hopes and dreams.
