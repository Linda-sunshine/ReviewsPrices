review/summary: Pretty good little pumpreview/text: It takes a few tries to get it right, but after breaking two presta stems I finally feel like I have figured it out. I'm a complete novice that is learning about my bike as I go, which may be why I broke a couple of stems. Words of advice: be extra careful when removing from presta stem, the rubber from the pump might grab a part of the stem and break it!
