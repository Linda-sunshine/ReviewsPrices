review/summary: Great Glovesreview/text: I couldn't be happier with these gloves. I've been nitpicking around shooting gloves for years, never having found a pair I was more satisfied with than your average mechanics gloves. These gloves are all that I hoped for, they fit nice and snug, yet still provide good feel and range of motion. Mine get light use, so I'm not sure on their durability, but I wouldn't expect them to last long under heavy use with the neoprene backs. They are definitely great gloves though and worth the cost, where they can be easily replaced.
