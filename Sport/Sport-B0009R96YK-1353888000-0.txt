review/summary: Great Productreview/text: Threw this mirror on my trek 7.2fx (2013 model) after adding these handlebars to the bike as well (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I7PRUQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_title) and it still fit perfectly. Very secure and gives great added sight for when riding through nyc.
