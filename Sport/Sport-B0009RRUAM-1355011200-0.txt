review/summary: Awesome how small it compresses to.review/text: This is head and shoulders above the camp pillow I owned before. It compresses easily and very small, and puffs out to a very full size. It can be a little too squishy when expanded and in use, and at first it has a smell of foam. These are minor issues, and the foam smell goes away over time.
