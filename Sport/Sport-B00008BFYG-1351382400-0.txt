review/summary: Great for Toddlersreview/text: Last Christmas I debated the merits of the razor scooter verses other more "toddler friendly" scooters (3 wheels, radio flyer etc). I ended up going with the razor for 2 reasons: it was less expensive and it folded up. My son was turning four and my daughter was 2 years and 4 months old. I bought one for each of them. My son got it right away, being older. He was off and racing on it. My daughter took a little while to get the balance down being only two. It only took her a couple of months to catch up with him. Now, they love scootering together. Don't waste your money and storage space on a scooter they'll outgrow in a couple of years, just guy this one - even for a little kid - and let them learn how to ride. I'm so glad we did.
