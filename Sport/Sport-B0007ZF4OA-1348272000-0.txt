review/summary: Freezing Hands at Ranch - Hints to make them last and workreview/text: First, I'll agree with one reviewer who said these do not heat up quickly and do not get very warm. I've worked around some things, as I rely heavily on these to keep my hands from freezing as I work to take care of horses, daily, no matter how bad the weather, sometimes as low as 20 below zero. Before I leave the house, I slip these into the microwave for a few seconds. You'd have to test yours to figure out the timing. This gives them a boost and they are immediately warm. In severe weather, I sometimes use two pair at a time. I start out with a silk glove liner, put one in my palm, slip on a cotton glove and put one on the back of my hand, (or in the silk glove) before putting on my final and outer glove. These warmers will last for about ten hours unless, if you are out for a couple of hours at a time, off and on like I am, you can make them last longer by sealing them tightly in a plastic bag (sandwhich). With no air, the heating stops. I can make one pair last for possibly three days. I keep a marker handy and just make a little slash mark for each hour I've used them. I know this sounds like a lot of work, but it's the only thing that makes them affordable for me. As one reviewer said, they use them for a family member with Raynaud's Syndrome. I have that too. Keeping my hands from freezing is a challenge. I sometimes resort to the foot warmer's with the higher temperatures.
