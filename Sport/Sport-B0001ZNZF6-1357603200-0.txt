review/summary: Surprisingly Goodreview/text: After hearing glowing reviews on these boxers, I decided to give it a shot. Now it's what I reach for in the drawer! They are surprisingly comfortable (either sitting all day at the desk or working out). I had them for a few months, they still look and feel like new. One note of caution, if you throw them in the laundry with anything that has velcro, it may stick to this type of material.
