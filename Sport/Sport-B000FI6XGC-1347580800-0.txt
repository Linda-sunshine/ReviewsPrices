review/summary: Frustrating, but ultimately successful! Lock position is UP!review/text: My husband and I (both college eduated professionals, mind you) struggled with getting this to work. The package had bare minimum instructions and it took us a little while to see how to rearrange the inside parts for a "shrader" valve (kid's bike tire). Even once we did that, we still couldn't get it to work, because DUH we didn't realize that contrary to ALL the other bike pumps we have ever had, the diagram showed that this pump is engaged/locked with the lever UP, not down. Once we figured out how to use it, the pump worked great!
