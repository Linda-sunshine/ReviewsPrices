review/summary: Very soft and comfortable ... butreview/text: These are very soft and comfortable socks; however, the spread the toes a bit too much and slip around on my feet. I do sweat a lot and these were causing some blisters on my feet. Inside my Vibrams, my toes were spread uncomfortably to wide. I do have a wide foot and very high arch which may have been part of the problem in my case.
