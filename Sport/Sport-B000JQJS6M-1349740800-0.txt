review/summary: Decent Watchreview/text: The watch looks pretty good and has kept very good time for the first week, seldom needing any adjustment. The band is adequate although I found it a little hard to remove the necessary links for sizing. All in all, well worth the price on Amazon. This watch replaces a battery operated Invicta watch that constantly went through batteries in less than a year. The self winding feature works fine for my husband as he wears the watch constantly.
