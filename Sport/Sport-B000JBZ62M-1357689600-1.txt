review/summary: Champion shortsreview/text: These are great! I use them for my ball hockey league, I am an adult at 5'10&#34; 200lbs but the large fit perfect. The only thing I changed myself about them is that they are a drawstring type of athletic short. The drawstring was a loop though, and not two individual strings, which unless you feel like getting a knot out for 10 minutes I suggest cutting the loop and making two tied ends on two individual strings so that you can tie them together like a shoe lace and it makes it much easier especially if you are in sports.Overall, I really like them, they are soft and smooth for any athlete or even just to wear.
