review/summary: Lovereview/text: My daughter doesn't like sandwiches, yogurt only once a week, cheese stick is for snack - that left us with very few lunch options. School lunch is not appealing to us. Foogo is the perfect answer. I make meals and keep them in the freezer (meatloaf, chix pot pie, spaghetti pie, rolled pizza). Choose one the night before, warm it in the microwave while we heat the foogo with hot water and her lunch is warm and delicious. A wonderful solution. The size is great. Fits in her LL Bean lunch bag comfortably with her snack each day. We're so happy to have found this gem and wouldn't give it back. This is one item you will be happy with purchasing.
