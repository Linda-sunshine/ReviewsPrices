review/summary: Read this review for honest feedbackreview/text: I have 5 invicta watches. Some are garbage and some are great. I first ordered the non-coin edge version of this watch (more wavelike edge opposed to the coin like edge on this one). When i set the time, it wouldn't screw back in. So I returned and got this one and it works great. Extremely sharp watch. Looks like a $5k watch.But people, you get what you pay for. An automatic watch that costs under $100 isn't going to be perfect. I used a stop watch and timed this watch to see how accurately it kept time. As it turns out, every 2.8 days this watch gained 1 minute. Not a huge deal but over a month your watch is 15 minutes ahead... So, keep that in mind.For $85 bucks, this is awesome.But, you have a coin flip if you get a great watch or a lemon.If you expect a Rolex.... Buy a Rolex.
