review/summary: Don't buy it for the chrono.review/text: It really is a sharp looking watch and I like it. However, the Invicta's chrono does not utilize the second-hand like the Daytona does. In fact, it renders the bezel useless and there are no second increments on the little chrono dial because it is incremented every 5 seconds.
