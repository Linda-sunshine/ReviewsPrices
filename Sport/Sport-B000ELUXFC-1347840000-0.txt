review/summary: been using off and on for a yearreview/text: Initially for a first time user it was hard to figure out.. once you got the hang of the positioning it was cake.. I never could figure out what to do with the strap that seemed to go under the bumper? I just used it to tie down the bike some more to the rack. I've gone up to 55 mph with it and no problems... I do recommend watching which side you place your bike facing.. the kick stand will scratch up your bumper so face it outwards.. Otherwise it's pretty easy.. I always took it off when i was done with it so i can't comment on long term paint damage by leaving it on and such. The manual was tissue paper quality and quickly fell apart during initial assembly sadly but guides are online and even videos on it.
