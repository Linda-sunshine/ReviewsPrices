review/summary: Cheap. You get what you pay for.review/text: I purchased this shuffler because it had gotten good reviews. It came with no instrutions and was clearly very cheaply made. It doesn't work to shuffle new cards. The cards get jammed and won't feed through the shuffler. Plus, it's very loud. If shipping wasn't so much, I'd return it. Instead we threw it out.
