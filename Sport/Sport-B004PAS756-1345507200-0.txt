review/summary: Disappointed save your money!review/text: I purchased this because I liked the other Shaun T workout DVDS and I thought that this 20 minute workout would be great. It starts out with a few warm up exercises and then there are really only about 13 minutes of actual "workout" cardio. Yes, they are extremely cardio and not easy as you can see that the people in the video have a hard time keeping up. I just thought it was a waste of money and I wish that I could return it. I recommend that you spend more and get the full workout.
