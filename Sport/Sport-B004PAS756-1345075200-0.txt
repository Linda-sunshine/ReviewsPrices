review/summary: Good if you have done Insanityreview/text: This workout is meant to be a substitute for one of the full Insanity workouts. Most of the moves that are in this workout are in the longer ones. You will get much more out of this, if you have gone through a round of Insanity and already know the moves. Otherwise, you are likely to feel like it is just jumping up and down (as some of the more sketchy reviews say). Although it is not likely a program that someone (especially one who has not exercised) would come up with on their own. It is not a beginner's workout. It is fast paced and it assumes that you know the correct form for the moves. If you are out of shape and has not done one of the Insanity workouts you could get hurt jumping into this.For those who have done Insanity, it is similar to the pure cardio workout, in that you do not do many repeat moves and pretty much go from one move to the other. You repeat the warm up twice, but otherwise, once you get to the actual workout it is just straight through to the end. If you don't have time for a full 45 or 60 min workout, this will be a fine substitute.
