review/summary: Great pedometer but you have to use the safety leashreview/text: I purchased this pedometer several weeks ago and have enjoyed having it immensely. I did however note that some other reviewers rated the clip rather poorly. I have also found this area to be the weakest in the Omron. My pedometer falls off of my waist as many as 10 times a day. If it weren't for the safety leash it would have either been broken or lost as I don't always notice when it releases. The pedometer's saving grace is it's safety leash. This little clip is strong and hangs in there so that when the pedometer falls it just swings at the end of the leash. At first I thought it was a pain having the two clips and if I'm not careful it hinders reaching into my pocket but it's totally worth it.
