review/summary: Very well made pocket knife, comfortable to use, excellent valuereview/text: I have owed 3 of these knifes over 10 years or so. It lives on my hip. I lost one to an airport inspector. (I forgot to take it off my pocket.) One was misplaced after a few years and the other is in my pocket now.I really don't need to add much to the 450 or so positive reviews. The knife is made of excellent steel and is very comfortable to hold. The studs don't stick out so far as to hurt you and it keeps an strong sharp edge. I am rough on my pocket knifes and do things I probably shouldn't but it seems to be up for most tasks.The company stands behind the product as well. I broke the safety lock pin (by forcing the blade to close while the safety was on it cut thru the plastic lock pin) I called them and they sent me a new pin at no charge. That said I never use the safety, it is really not needed, the knife stays closed on its own.My only caution is the tip of the blade comes to a rather thin point. While that is good for many tasks, do not try and use this as a screwdriver or pry anything with the tip, you will break it off. I did that to one of them. I re-ground the edge and it was almost as good as new.I just bought two more of these for gifts. They are an excellent value at this price IMO. They do not rust corrode or pit and I am around saltwater all the time and cut some nasty stuff.Best of luck with yours.
