review/summary: Well worth the moneyreview/text: I cant pretend to be a knife expert, but after owning this blade since September 2011 i think i can safely share my thoughts on it. Those thoughts? WOW. Definitely the best EDC blade ive ever owned, but i will admit that list can be rather short. The blade itself is made of one of Kershaws stainless blends that i couldnt tell you the name of if you paid me, but i can say that its an excellent steel due the the extreme edge that it takes and holds. Im not too rough on my knife, but i can easily go for a month or so before touching up the blade edge. The handle on the knife it also some sort of stainless, making the whole package highly resistant to rust, and indeed, ive never seen any on my knife. The Speed-Safe system is one of the best assisted opening systems ive ever used, and is elegant in its simplicity, as one small steel torsion bar makes up the entire system. That self-same torsion bar has been my only problem with the knife, because after a year and a halfs worth of use it broke. Which im fine with, its a high stress are of the knife and Kershaw kindly sent out 4 when i asked for a replacement. Really, i cant give enough praise to this knife. My only complaints are that again, after a year and a half the torsion bar broke and cleaning can be a bit finicky. Just remember, if you do have to completely disassemble the knife for cleaning, make sure you dont over-tighten and of the screws and use an appropriate oil on both the speed-safe system and the hinge. Personally, im growing to like Ballilstol. Closing thoughts, if you are in the market for a new EDC, GO WITH THIS KNIFE!
