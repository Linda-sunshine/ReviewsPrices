review/summary: Good little thermosreview/text: This thermos is not quite as nice as the Nissen Thermos I previously purchased, but it is the right size for my 7 year old and it keeps food warm/hot for five hours, which is what it promises to do. The lid is fairly easy for my daughter to get off provided that I don't tighten it too much. We use it a couple of times a week for school lunch and put mac and cheese, soup, fried rice, and other hot foods in it. She also likes the flowers on it. I would purchase another one of these if I needed a second thermos of this size.
