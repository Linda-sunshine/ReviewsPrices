review/summary: The Last Steel Bottle I'll Ever Need!review/text: Okay, so the title may be misleading. Nothing lasts forever. However, this thing is build like a tank, and can hold a ton of water. The cap isn't leak proof, so don't throw it into your bag unless you enjoy wet clothes. Don't forget to buy a bottle brush for cleaning!
