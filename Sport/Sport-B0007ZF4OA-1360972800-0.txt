review/summary: Excellent Productreview/text: I use these in the winter when I am working outside in the woods in Maine. I can slip these in pockets and my gloves as needed. Great comfort. No, they won't keep you whole body warm. If you are going outside in cold weather, you need clothing, sometimes lots of clothing. (If you feel cold all over, you don't have enough clothing on!) These small heating pads can help relieve discomfort in you hands or feet. I appreciate them. My wife takes them when I come and and warms her hands and pockets indoors. She loves them too.
