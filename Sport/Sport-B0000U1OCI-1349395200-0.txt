review/summary: Simply the Best!review/text: I love this very easy to use product. Very simple to set up and it does what it says it will do. The only fault I found is with the belt clip that comes with it. It does not hold the pedometer securely. I find it not to be reliable and use only the strap to secure the pedometer. The strap is included with the purchase of the pedometer. The pedometer is PERFECT! Get one, Get Walking and Get Healthy! Happy Trails! KFYsman
