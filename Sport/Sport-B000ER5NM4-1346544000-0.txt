review/summary: Very comfortable!review/text: For me, these werre a little long, and after they were hemmed, they have become my favorite pants. I normally wear XL pants but ordered these in 2X. Order a size slightly higher than usual. Otherwise, they are a high quality pair of pants that are very comfortable.
