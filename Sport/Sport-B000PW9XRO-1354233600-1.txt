review/summary: Far from nice leather gloves.review/text: Was looking for driving gloves or winter gloves, short at the wrist. The neoprene back is soft, warm. Really didn't like the rubbery palm-finger grip. It gave a weird sensation to my hands. Was hoping for a leathery, soft feel. I like the feel of 5.11's taclite gloves a lot better.I think it's got a sheepskin palm(I thought this "Hatch" product would be a cheaper alternative).If you're looking for great grip on a firearm, a jar lid, etc... This is a good pair of gloves.
