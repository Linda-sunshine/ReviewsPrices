review/summary: Such a great water bottle!review/text: It's true what they advertise-- I drink more water with this bottle.I used to have a camel bak with this bite and before it was stolen, I drank a lot of water. In the past few months I've had trouble staying hydrated and I knew if I had this again it wouldn't be a problem and I was right! The bite is easy to use and fun, so I end up just casually drinking a bottle with no effort, when normally I NEVER drink water. I love this size because it'll fit in my backpack but still hold a lot of water, and the bite is just phenomenal. My older water bottle leaked if I put it in my bag, but this one hasn't yet!
