review/summary: Don't be fooled by the small ball that comes in the boxreview/text: I have been working on losing weight and like many desk dwellers i've been trying to find a way to "Exercise" while sitting at my desk. I decided to give this chair a try and I couldn't be more pleased. I'm not sure that i've gotten any sort of major workout but it definitely works some areas that my normal chair wouldn't. I do think you'd get a better work out just sitting on a very large ball but the stability of the chair helps me roll back and forth from desk to desk.Many have probably been like me- opened the box eager to try it out to find the ball almost falls completely through the opening in the chair frame. It took a good three days for the ball to inflate fully and even then it took a few days of pumping it up in the morning for it to reach full capacity.This chair definitely helps with my posture and taking pressure off my back. I don't have nearly the back pain that i used to.
