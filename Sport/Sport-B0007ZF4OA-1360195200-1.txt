review/summary: Warm Hands!review/text: These hand warmers work pretty well, and you can't beat the price. If you forget and have to buy hand warmers on a cold day skiing, you'll be paying a huge markup. Buy these, and keep a couple in your car/ski bag at all times. You'll be glad that you have them on those really cold days.
