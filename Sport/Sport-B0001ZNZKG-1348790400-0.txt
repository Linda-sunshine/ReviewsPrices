review/summary: The perfection of undergarment technology.review/text: I had heard about these boxer briefs online a few times and decided I'd finally order a pair, as I needed some new undies anyways. Lo and behold, this pair went above and beyond any other I've owned. Here's how:1. Comfort: I wore this pair while on a trip for work, which entailed cab rides, 2 flights, and also an afternoon of sitting in an uncomfortable chair. These undies gave the support I needed, while at the same time the breath-ability was just right. I forgot I had them on until I got to my hotel room. That's the way it should be.2. Cleanliness: Even after a long days work, this pair did not smell. At all. Nor did they feel dirty as clothes often do after a long day of wear.3. Easy to Clean and Dry: Soap, Water, Towel, and 2 hours. That's all you need to get these undies back to a pretty much brand spanking new condition. Perfect.Sure the price may be a bit high, but these are worth the price many times over.
