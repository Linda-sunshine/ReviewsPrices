review/summary: Best value for the money...review/text: I also broke the bank when I bought my bike so had to compromise on accessories but not on safety. It is a very comfortable helmet and I feel safe riding with it. I also thought that it would look freaky to wear but warmed up to it right away. The drivers are crazy, here in Florida, especially in the city, so I never leave home without it.
