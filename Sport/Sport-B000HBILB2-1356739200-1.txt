review/summary: great bedreview/text: My daughter loved sleeping on this blow up bed. It's a great idea if you need xtra guest beds, It only takes minutes to inflate and deflate..the built-in pump works great. I was so happy that it didn't lose air after two weeks of use. i just hope it won't deflate easily just like the other airbed we have.
