review/summary: Unbreakable, awesome water deliveryreview/text: First, the bottle is unbreakable. I have dropped these from 3, 4, or more feet on ceramic tile, concrete, etc, and they (the bottle, that is) don't break. The Camelbak 'bite' is the best! Just bite and suck. My only complaint on these, hence the four stars, is the flip lever on the bite breaks off too easily. The loop is perfect for a carabiner.
