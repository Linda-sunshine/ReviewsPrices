review/summary: Great for golf!review/text: These socks are thin (as many reviewers have pointed out) but the material is soft and the ankle is not constricted. I bought them to wear playing golf (hot summers = blisters b/w the toes) and thought they would help with the rubbing. They do that very well. I was concerned about the lack of cushion on the bottom, but the support offered by my golf shoes was adequate. They are uni-sex sized so if you are a Female, order a size lower. They are a bit big.
