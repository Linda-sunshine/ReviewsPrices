review/summary: Good rope - heavier cable than I expectedreview/text: The thick cable of this rope is fine, but I have two concerns - 1. if you jump fast, this rope gives you incentive NOT to trip because it hurts to get whipped with it, and 2. it might mark up a newly refinished floor, so jump on a rug.
