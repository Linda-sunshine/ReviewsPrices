review/summary: Perfect Fit!!!review/text: These are my first pair of weighlifting gloves and I am so glad that I bought them. I was worried they would not fit do to the other reviews stating the chart was wrong. Well I went with what the chart said and I am glad I did. They are comfortable and fit great. They are hard to get off though.
