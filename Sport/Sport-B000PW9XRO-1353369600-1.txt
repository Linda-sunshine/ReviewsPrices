review/summary: Sizes run smallreview/text: I ordered a large and they are pretty snug and the fingers a little on the short side. Just be aware that these will fit you snugly and if you have really large hands you're not going to be able to get a large on.I'm hoping they will stretch a little with wear. They are definitely warm. They look exactly as they do in the photo. My mother saw them and is thinking about getting some herself.
