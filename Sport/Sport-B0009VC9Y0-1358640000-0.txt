review/summary: Great quality, slick designreview/text: I'm not a knife expert nor do I want to repeat all the positive things already stated in the other review. Just a few observations:- set screws to adjust clip are star hex size that are small, not available on most hex wrench sets- blade is very sharp but very fine, I expect to resharpen this frequently and will avoid cutting rugged materials- slim, silver design of handle is cool-looking and easy to clean- but, handle is almost too thin and slick, not robust and sometimes slips
