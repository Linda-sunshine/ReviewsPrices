review/summary: The Non Pillowreview/text: I bought this to use for car camping, thinking it would be comfortable and save space. It does not fluff up, in no way is it like a regular pillow, it is a bag filled with loose lumps! In my past I have done a lot of backpacking. I wouldn't recommend this for that either. One will be much more comfortable to get a small empty pillow case and stuff it with clothes, that is much better than this item. Thermarest pads are good, but not this item.
