review/summary: Greatest idea since sliced breadreview/text: I have been cleaning firearms for over 40 years and have never had a better aid for doing it right than the Boresnake. I have an aversion to putting a firearm away without cleaning it if it's been fired, and sometimes it seems a bit of a bother. With this gadget, half the work is taken out of the equation, and with the proper lubes, brushes and an air compressor with a nozzle (my personal secret for getting grit and dust out of hard to reach places!) the rest of the job is easy.
