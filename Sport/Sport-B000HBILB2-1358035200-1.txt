review/summary: Great air mattress!review/text: I gave this to a friend who visits his mother and large family every few weeks, but has to sleep on a couch near the front door, so there's lots of noise and it's uncomfortable. It's very hard to get sustained sleep there, and he has health issues, so this is a big problem. This air mattress solved the problem wonderfully. He says it's so comfortable, and easy to inflate and deflate. I am going to buy the queen size for my apartment for when company comes. Anyone who lives in NYC knows that you get tons of company, who see your apartment as a great solution to visiting NYC without having to pay the crazy expensive hotel rates here. Great product, great price.
