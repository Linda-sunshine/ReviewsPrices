review/summary: Bang for the Buckreview/text: First off you get 10!. Second they are of good quality. Third good luck repacking one! They seem to grow when unpacked like a map. This is a fine layer but don't expect that wool blanket feel, great to cut up and put in boots and headgear and as a vest under clothes, cut a square and inset foot in boot and so on for that extra layer, water resistant well as much as a plastic bag and I have done that also. Much better than nothing! But think layers, wind block, reflector, sun block (for shade) and so on.Duct tape and cordage a must to get full effect of options.I would say ground cloth but only as a layer over leaves or something as it is very thin and no insulating value.Good survival mirror! You get the idea. Kind of small for a shelter but it could work somewhat as tarp.
