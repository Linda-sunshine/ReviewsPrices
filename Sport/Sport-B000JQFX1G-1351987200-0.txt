review/summary: Great watch no problemsreview/text: I read a bunch of reviews talking about how this watch ran fast(or slow) and other issues. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I know this isn't an expensive watch by any measure, but it's the most I've ever paid for a watch. I usually go for the electronic timepieces, but I was tired of buying batteries, paying for the replacement and occasionally finding out my watch was no longer waterproof.I have had this watch now for 2 months and have no complaints. It keeps time perfectly, looks great and feels great on the wrist. I have done a lot of manual labor since buying it and it remains looking like new. No scratches in the metal or the crystal. I would buy it again. I will update this post...
