review/summary: Great traveling boxersreview/text: Planning a trip to the tropics I wanted a boxer brief that would pack easily and most important wash out and dry quickly even in a humid climate. I packed two ExOfficio boxer briefs and two cotton. The cotton boxer briefs were thrown out as I traveled.. they never seemed to dry completely.
