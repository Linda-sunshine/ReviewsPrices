review/summary: Great little bottlereview/text: A well-designed, solid, quality product. These come in three sizes. I also have the largest size, which is a bit unwieldy sometimes, so I gave this smallest size Camelbak to my spouse, who finds it to be perfect for her trips to the YMCA. For comparison, 0.5L is a bit more than the 0.355L held by a can of Coke. So it really is ideal for most purposes in a compact size.
