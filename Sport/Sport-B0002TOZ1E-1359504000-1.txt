review/summary: Complete Rip Offreview/text: I purchased these because I was seeking high calibre black athletic socks. The cost plus freight came to $26.70 for 6 socks .... that's roughly $4.50 per pair - OUCH! Twenty bucks was bad enough but to add more than 30% more to the overall cost??? Ok, so I did not think it through completely & wanted socks for my Yeti sized feet - shoot me.To add to my disappointment while waiting for these (should be) solid gold socks to be shipped, I was in Costco & found socks of equal quality & size (size 14 shoe) for just $9.95. Hmmm, lets do a little math - 16 pairs for the same overall price as 6 from this seller .... time to hit the control/alt/return keys on my laptop.
