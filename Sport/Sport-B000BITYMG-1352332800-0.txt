review/summary: Works Wellreview/text: When my work gave out thePedometer Accusplit AE2720 Step, Set of 12for a Walktober event, it also gave out the Safety Leash for Pedometers to help hold the pedometer in place - a good thing because I've almost lost the pedometer more than once. The leash is easy to use - attach it to the pedometer at one end and hook the metal clip on your waistband or belt loop - I often attach mine to the top of my pants pocket. It helps hold the pedometer neatly in place and if the pedometer does fall off, the clip prevents it from falling all away off -the pedometer swings in space until you grab it. My one complaint is that the leash is not adjustable - it is a bit long and visible unless you clip it way to the side or wear a long the shirt/jacket. But that's a minor complaint for a product that works really well.
