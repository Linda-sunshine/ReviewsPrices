review/summary: Perfect cleaning tool for 7.62x54r and .303 British barrels.review/text: I used the Hoppe's Boresnake to clean both my M91-30 and Enfield. It works much better than pushing a dozens patches through each barrel and is quicker as well. I highly recommend this to anyone who shoots a lot of surplus (corrosive) ammo through you Nagant, as you need to clean your barrel regularly.
