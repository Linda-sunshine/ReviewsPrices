review/summary: I don't likereview/text: (1) it's very small. Doesn't hold a practical amount of anything.(2) easy to over fill and make a mess(3) screw threads are too wide apart and can make the cap screw on sideways(4) cap hard to get off(5) cap design makes it hard to clean(6) I do, however, like the stainless steel main compartment
