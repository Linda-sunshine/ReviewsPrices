review/summary: Just what you'd expect from a Hogue productreview/text: This thing is solid, and the grip feels great. Not too sticky, but won't let you slip. I got this as I don't really use combat gloves when shooting my AR, so a more comfy grip than the stock one was in order.This is the second Hogue grip I own, and third one I've used. I've been very pleased with their quality and ease of use.
