review/summary: One of the comforts that is worth some pack space!review/text: I went with the small thermarest pillow for backpacking. It isn't perfect, but it's certainly a good option for what it is. It rolls up to an acceptable size and weight for a pack. You could also probably toss it in a compression sack with a sleeping bag or tent if you're hurting for space. I found the small was adequate, but I also use a thermarest sleeping pad, so it's not as big of a deal if my head finds its way off of the pillow overnight. If your alternative is the hard ground or a thin tent floor you might want to consider a medium or large. There is a notable difference when it comes out of the dryer after a wash cycle. It is full, fluffy, yet firm. After it is rolled up for a time or it has been slept on, the stuffing shifts as it might in a down comforter. A few seconds of fluffing helps and the product is quite amazing in that regard. That being said, this is a wonderful alternative to some dirty clothes. It is comfortable enough, but I do find I'm often fluffing it in the middle of the night. For the space it takes, you'll find no better substitute, and it gets the job done. Included some photos to offer a visual.
