review/summary: Awesome!!!review/text: When they first arrived I thought they would be too small. They looked tiny! They have a good amount of stretch though without being too tight. I am a 12/14. Perfect fit, and length! I am 5'9''...I haven't washed them yet, so I really hope they don't shrink up much. The fabric seems good too. Not too thin, or thick. I would order again!
