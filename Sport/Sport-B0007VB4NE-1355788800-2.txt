review/summary: This is not adjustablereview/text: No matter what I do, I cannot seem to sit in this chair correctly. I have more, not less, upper back pain using this chair at my work station. Part of the issue is that the base is not adjustable and therefore is too low for my standard sized desk. I do use the ball in my office for excerises and stretching and my co-workers are always amused that it is the guest chair in my office now.
