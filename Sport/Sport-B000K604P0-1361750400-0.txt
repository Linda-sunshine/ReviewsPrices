review/summary: Best thermal mug getreview/text: I got rid of my last mug. Although it kept the coffee warm, I couldn't find the spout in the dark when driving, which was essential for me. Before that one, I had another that had a top that was too hard to keep clean. This one keeps hot drinks warm for hours, is easy to clean and is very easy to use in the car. Perfect for me.
