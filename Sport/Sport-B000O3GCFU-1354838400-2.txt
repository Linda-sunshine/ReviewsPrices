review/summary: Fantastic Small Food Thermosreview/text: Works great. Fits almost a whole can of soup or whole can of ravioli. Bought it for my daughter's lunch box so she could take warm items for lunch too, and she loves it. She was bragging to me a couple of weeks ago about how good it worked. She said it worked so good, the food was still almost too hot to eat! Great product, great price.
