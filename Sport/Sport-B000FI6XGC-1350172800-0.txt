review/summary: Take a look at Lezyne first.review/text: This is an okay pump but Lezyne makes a great pump. Love Lezyne products and found that they are more durable and easier to use. On this product dislike that the end slides on to the stem, it does not screw on securely. We had issues with the o-rings falling out. It was just a pain. I would not recommend unless you are used to using this type of pump and are not looking to put high pressure into your tire. If you are looking for something easy to screw on, high pressure, and smaller to slip into your pack, I would recommend the Lezyne Road Drive.
