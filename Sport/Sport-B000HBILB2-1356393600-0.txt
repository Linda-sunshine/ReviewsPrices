review/summary: Not good enough, 3 stars - got a good replacement, now 4 starsreview/text: Needs to be pumped up at least twice in the night. High rise makes it easy for older people to use.UPDATE:Amazon was outstanding. I wrote saying that the bed was leaking too much to be comfortable.. an immediate replacemnt was sent and i printed out a free shipping label online.The new bed is perfect.. three kids slept on it together and they were fast asleep when i checked later.I left the airbed out next two days and no air had leaked yet.I was lucky I think to have got a good piece.Thank you Amazon.
