review/summary: Intex Airbedreview/text: While visiting a friend out of state I had the opportunity to sleep on an Intex Airbed. I was so impressed with the comfort and the good night's sleep that upon returning home I asked her for information about that particular bed. As I work in a home that requires two overnight shifts, I ordered a twin size Intex Airbed hoping it would work out and I would be able to get off the short sofa and stretch out a bit! I ordered my new Airbed and have been using it every week. I am SO pleased with the comfort, the ease of inflating and deflating, and for a good night's sleep! I highly recommend this product as an alternative sleep solution - you won't be disappointed.
