review/summary: The best pocket knifereview/text: The slim design is a great feature because you can barely feel the knife in your pocket. The knife comes sharp and stays sharp for a long period of time before you have to sharpen it. I have dropped mine a few times and it has landed on the point several times without damaging it. The quick flip feature is awsome the knife opens with fast with the push on the back of the knife. Not alot of moving parts makes this knife very easy to maintain. I owned the smaller version of this knife and liked it so much I bought this one. Amazon sells this knife for the best price. Cabelas sell this knife for about $65 the last time I checked.
