review/summary: Low Qualityreview/text: Bought this product for a friend's visit back in late October. Since then (It is now early February), it has been slept on for a total of seven nights by two different normal sized adult guests, and promptly deflated when a third guest tried to sleep on it this past week. To its credit, the product did last just fine through those seven nights. It did, however, break not too long after the 90 day warranty ended and we have no reason to believe we will be able to repair it or otherwise recoup our loss. Purchase with the understanding that this is basically a disposable air bed with a warranty that seems conveniently short.
