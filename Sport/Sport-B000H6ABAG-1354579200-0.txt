review/summary: Acceptablereview/text: These are not true to the color in the photo - they are a darker color like the photo for the navy. The photo for the navy heather is definitely a lighter shade of blue. They are just a little tighter on the top compared to our old Hanes of the same size, but we might have stretched those out since we have worn them for several years now. The legs seem a little longer to me. My husband and I, who wear the same size in sweat pants, both find these acceptable for fit. The color is also acceptable to both of us although not as pretty to my eye as the color I thought we were getting. The price is more than acceptable, given that we can locally only get either sweat pants without fleece for the same price, or branded fleece sweat pants for two or three times the price.There were no manufacturing flaws in any of the three pairs we received.
