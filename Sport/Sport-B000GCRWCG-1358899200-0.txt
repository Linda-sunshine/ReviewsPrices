review/summary: Necessary but nothing specialreview/text: I keep these things everywhere, in my bag, jeep, first aid kit. They're useful for all sorts of situations (ever have your car not start in a mall parking lot at 10pm on a Tuesday in winter?) They're cheap and can keep you warm when you really need it. I like they bulk package because I can throw these in my parents' cars, or to whoever might need one and not really have to worry about replacing them one at a time.
