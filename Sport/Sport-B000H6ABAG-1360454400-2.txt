review/summary: good for a month.review/text: I bought these pants for my boyfriend for christmas....i noticed a small tear in the ankle where there elastic is, figured it was no big deal and sewed it up for him. A month later and both ankles are full off holes. It's not like he wears these everyday, or while doing strenuous work. These are lounge around all day pants, yet somehow are falling apart after a month. Save your money and just go buy some $10 sweatpants at target or walmart.
