review/summary: The best! A must have for lunch boxes.review/text: It is a simple way to provide hot foods for lunch. Shhh, I cheat and don't preheat the thing with hot water. I find it to be unnecessary for my children and prefer to save the time. I just heat up the food in the micro and put it in the food jar & close it up immediately. They say it has the right temperature of food every time. We have mainly used it for hot items such as Spaghettios, mac & cheese, soups, and casseroles, but have had equal success with cold items.There have been no issues with cleaning. It hasn't presented me with any problems. Even once on a long weekend when we had forgotten to empty it and had a mini science experiment growing in there.Another fantastic thing that prompted me to review this item is that my 10 year old _lost_ the top lid of the food jar. I contacted Thermos via their web site and I can buy a replacement lid. It's about half the price of a new one, but at least they offer it!Now if someone would come up with a more square & low (like a largersandwich container) design that provides the same heating capabilities.
