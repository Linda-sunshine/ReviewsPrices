review/summary: Good when it worksreview/text: This heart rate monitor has some cool features such as it will let you know when you are not in the range you want to be in, tells time, has a timer, etc. The only downside I've experienced is that it doesn't always register. It may be user error though. I have to mess with it a bit more.
