review/summary: Simple to use and inexpensivereview/text: This HRM has a strong signal and it's easy to use. It's also priced very well. It doesn't calculate your calories, but it does keep track of your last workout, including time, average heartbeat, and highest heartbeat. It also has an "indigo" light button that allows you to see the display in darkened rooms.The chest band is comfortable and adjustable. The wrist piece is a bit large for a woman, but I only wear it during workouts. It is also a watch but not a very attractive one.I used to have Polar but the battery ran down and I never got around to sending it in for a replacement. The Timex battery can be replaced by the owner, a big advantage.All-in-all, a good value and does what I want well. If you're a woman and want a more attractive watch, you'll have to pay more.
