review/summary: Not good quality anymore.review/text: I LOVE the style of Converse, always have. But the quality of the shoe is going down :(. I have had my black pair (They look just like the ones in the pic) for about 2 years now, and they're pretty much starting to fall apart already. I dont even wear them everyday! Very disappointed in the quality nowadays, but they are still stylish. (Until they fall apart)
