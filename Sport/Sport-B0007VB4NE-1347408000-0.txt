review/summary: Always on the Ball!review/text: We love our Gaiam Ball Chairs. There are two of us in the school office and we have been searching for a comfortable work chair for years. These are GREAT!! You truly feel your muscles working. They glide easily on carpet and great on linoleum. After spending a few days checking in supplies gliding back and forth between boxes, I could feel the results. One suggestion we have is to put the locking wheels in the rear so you don't accidentally step on the lock while seated in the chair.
