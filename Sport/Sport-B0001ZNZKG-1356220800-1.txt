review/summary: Would be 5 stars, except....review/text: Based on all the positive reviews, I waited for these to go on sale and bought two. These boxer briefs are THE most comfortable underwear I've ever worn in my life and I'm sure I'll buy more soon.I only have two complaints that are keeping me from giving this product five stars. One, there an annoying tag. Like many guys, I'm used to tagless underwear and I'm going to have to cut off the tag in the back. Two, I was hugely disappointed to see that this extremely expensive (as far as underwear goes) product is made in China and the company is in the United States -- and of all places the uber-liberal haven of Seattle. The ExOfficio website blathers about how careful they are to only select factories with good working conditions, and how eco-conscious they are, etc., etc. Maybe saying those things makes some people feel all warm and fuzzy, but at the end of the day there are millions of people out of work in the United States while companies like ExOfficio have their products made in China, propagandize how wonderful they are, and sell their stuff at a premium price anyway.So would I recommend their underwear? Yep, absolutely. And I'll definitely buy more, but only because I can't find anything else that comes close in comfort. But considering their outsourcing, I'll refuse to pay full price and wait for another sale.
