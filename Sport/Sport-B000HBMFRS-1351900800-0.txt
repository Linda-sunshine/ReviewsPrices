review/summary: Sleep lopsided!!!review/text: I bought this mattress for my son because regular mattresses give him back paine and migraines. It worked great at first, but after about a month it wouldn't inflate uniformly. It's much higher on one side than the other. Letting some air out didn't help. I never heard of such a thing. I've had mattresses similar to this and currently have one I bought at a local store in my spare room. This is a new one on me!
