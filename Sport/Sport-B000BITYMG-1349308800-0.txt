review/summary: Leash????review/text: If I could have kept track of it....It was smaller than a shoe string and I couldn't figure out how the loop was supposed to work. Maybe w/better ?? instructions??? It would work. Maybe I would have attached it immediately and would not have lost any more pedometers.??? Don't know. Lost the darn thing w/in hours of getting it. Had it attached or so I thought, but it didn't stay. Oops.
