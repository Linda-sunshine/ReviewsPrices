review/summary: Didn't know what to expectreview/text: We recently made a trip from Massachusetts to Minnesota (approximately 1500 miles). We had never transported our bikes using a rack of any kind before, let alone on a trip of this distance. We bought this rack a couple days before leaving, not sure if it would work, be stable enough, fit our bikes, or car, etc. We rented a standard Volkswagen sedan.The rack took a little while and a few different brains to figure out how it worked (the directions were a little confusing). However, once the rack was secure and the bikes were mounted, we didn't have even the slightest problem on the entire 1500 mile trip. We used an old dish cloth to cushion one of the pedals that looked like it may scratch up against the body of the car. We went over all kinds of bumpy terrain in Cleveland and Chicago and the rack didn't budge. The bikes were so secure we even forgot to worry about them at one point.When we finally arrived at our destination and took the bikes and rack off, there wasn't one mark left, no scratches, nothing. For the price and convenience and security of this rack, it is our opinion that you couldn't go wrong. I would think the only issue could be whether it fits your vehicle and don't forget to get an adapter for ladies bikes. We used some bungie cords to extra secure it.
