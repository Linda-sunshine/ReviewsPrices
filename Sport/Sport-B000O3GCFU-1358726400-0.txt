review/summary: Ready for schoolreview/text: I bought this for my daughter who is starting school this year. She doesn't eat a &#34;traditional&#34; sandwich type lunch and without a stove/microwave I was concerned about what she was going to eat. With this good sized thermos - she now can have her rice and beans (everyday) without it being cold with all her fruit snacks. We were able to put her name sticker on it and she can open it easily herself. Great insulation on the lid and base will help not burn her too.
