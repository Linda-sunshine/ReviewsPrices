review/summary: I used this pan the day I got it! Pineapple Upside Down cake!! Perfection!review/text: I have several different size cast iron cookware pieces and love them all. With proper care these last forever. I like this pan because it is deeper than my other cast iron skillets and can also be used as a dutch oven. I ordered this combo because I was interested in having the lid that also functions as another skillet. Also this product is MADE IN THE USA. This is very important to me.
