review/summary: Great helmet - highly recommendreview/text: This is a great, and a safe helmet - which is very important to me since my grown son is riding his bike to and from work in the dark these short winter days. He has no car so he rides his bike every where he has to go. We live in different states so I was astounded when he called and asked me to get him a headlight and tail light as he didn't have one and didn't have the internet to order one nor a way to get to a store to buy one. Oh, you can bet I did - immediately, I got on Amazon and bot a rechargeable LED light (350 lumens), a blinking tail light, lots of reflective tape and this helmet. Then I purchased him several different pairs of gloves and a warm hat for his rides in the cooler winter weather. I feel much better now that he is decked out safely for his trips to and from work. This helmet gets high reviews and he says it is quite comfortable even though I think his head is little larger than average.
