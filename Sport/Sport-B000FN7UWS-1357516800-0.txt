review/summary: Klean Kanteen Rocksreview/text: I purchased 2 sizes - the 40oz and 18oz both are equal in features just different sizes.You can boil water in them. They are stainless steel. Not sure what else you need to know other than they work well on hikes and camping trips. Picked up more for our BOB's. Simply put if you are buying plastic you are throwing money down the drain... again you can boil water to make it safe in the bottle. Stainless steel so you know it will hold up to abuse.
