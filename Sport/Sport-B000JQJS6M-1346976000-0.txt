review/summary: Japanese Automatic Movement NH25Areview/text: Hello Everyone,I read several reviews that stated the watch was defective because it can't be manually wound using the stem. I have the 8926 (stainless steel version) and it has the Japanese Seiko NH25A movement. Look at the back of the watch and if the rotor has "SII" on the right side and "NH25A" on the left side, it is Seiko auto movement. This movement is 100% automatic only. It will only wind up using the rotor. When you pull the stem out (unscrew from the case first please) the crown will freely rotate. First pull position is for setting the date, the second is for setting the time BUT it will not stop the second hand. This movement doesn't have hacking capability (ability to temporarily stop the second hand). I checked with Seiko's website for technical information on NH25A movement and it specifically says that it does NOT have manual winding capability.From their spec sheet..."4. HANDLING AND CORRECTIONS1) Crown at normal position : Free2) Crown pulled out to 1st click Clockwise : Quick date correctionCounterclockwise : Free3) Crown pulled out to 2nd click Time setting"Here is the link to the technical data.(Amazon won't allow web links - check the comment for link)Also, my 8926 will run about 36 hours on reserve power before it stops. I put my watch in a watch winder for 24 hours (timed, autorotation mode)took it out and let it sit until it stopped on its own. It ran a solid 36 hours. It's also very accurate for mechanical watch. In the month and half I've owned mine, I've only had to reset the minute hand two times, backing it up 2 minutes each time. Don't expect ANY mechanical watch to be as accurate as a quartz watch. If you want the ultimate mechanical watch, get a high quality tourbillon watch which is specifically designed to counter the effect of motion and gravity on the balance wheel. And even then, it still won't be as accurate as a quarts watch in the long run.
