review/summary: This is a really great holster!review/text: I purchased this holster based on all of the reviews here and all over the internet.I seems everyone is in agreement, this is a really great holster! Look at all of the 5 star reviews.This holster fits my Glock 30 like a glove.There is no break in period and it won't stretch out or lose its shape because it's made of carbon-fiber composite materials. Also, you can easily adjust the angle (cant) for your belt.If you are concerned about a release button on your holster, don't be. The position of the release button is perfect and feels very natural.I have several holsters and as with all of them, my finger is right in that same position every time I draw my weapon.You will be impressed as to how natural it feels to simply apply pressure with your trigger finger to the button and the weapon is released.Lastly, it arrived right on time.If you are looking for a great holster, do yourself a favor and give this one a try, you won't regret it.
