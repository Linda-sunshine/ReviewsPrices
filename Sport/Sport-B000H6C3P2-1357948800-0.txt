review/summary: Awesome Gripreview/text: What a simple installation. The grip fits perfect, and feels great on my S&W M&P15. It gives the rifle the right &#34;feel&#34; when your holding it with one hand. I would say I have smaller hands and the grip is good as far as size. I recommend this grip to anyone that wants to replace their stock grip!
