review/summary: Fun!review/text: I am a mother of a 7 year old girl and a 4 year old boy. My children received these scooters on Christmas morning and have been "scooting" all over ever since. The first thing I noticed about this product was the incredible speed my children were able to go. This is both a plus and a minus. While my children enjoy the exhilaration of racing down the road, the parent in me cringes as I worry they will not be able to stop. Additionally, this scooter is very easy to use and maneuver around. The front wheel swivels allowing for quick turns and cool tricks. Another wonderful feature of this scooter is that it easily folds up so that we may transport it to various playgrounds, tracks, parking lots, etc. It is also very lightweight so that the children can carry their own scooters around with relative ease. Overall I found this product to be a huge success and fun for everyone!
