review/summary: Comfi and light!review/text: Received these briefs and they came as advertised. They seem well constructed and fit real nice. Very good fit and comfortable in comparison to the 100% cotton boxer briefs I now wear. I like how light and breathable they are for sure.The big test happens next month on my Germany Journey. I am only going to take the 4 with me for a 10 day trip. I will hand wash every other day or so, what I need as I am only going to pack a carry on bag for the trip. I am taking sports t's to wear under my polo shirts and will do the same, thus saving more room and weight.So far they look like they will do a good job. If anything changes on the trip, I will update. So far 5 star. But if they work as well as I think they will I might just say goodbye to the old cotton boxer briefs!
