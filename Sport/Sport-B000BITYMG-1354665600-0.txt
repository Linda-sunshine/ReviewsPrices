review/summary: Excellent Safety Leash for Pedometerreview/text: So after the doctor advised to start an exercise regimen, I purchased a pedometer, determined to start counting my steps every day of a brand new exercise program. Although the program and good intentions did not last that long, the pedometer did, due to my purchase of this neat safety leash. It's now safely in the draw attached to the pedometer anxiously waiting to be used again.
