review/summary: "INVICTA" on case opposite of stemreview/text: This is a very nice watch. Unfortunately, the one thing I don't like about it could not be discovered before I ordered it. INVICTA is deeply engraved into the case on the side of the watch opposite the stem. This is not shown in any of the product photos or in the product description. I'm the type of guy who likes to keep labels to myself. Overall, I think this is a really nice watch. I just would have liked to know INVICTA was on the side of the case before I ordered it. Opening the box, and then having a sense of disappointment for something I was looking forward to receiving stinks.
