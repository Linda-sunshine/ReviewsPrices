review/summary: Unusual Pedometerreview/text: This pedometer has no capability to &#34;zero out.&#34; That means if one wants to walk/run twice in one day, one can't zero out the pedometer to measure the second event. I've been running since 1975, have owned approximately ten pedometers, and have never had one that didn't have the ability to zero out. I called the company and they told me they have only one pedometer with the &#34;zero out&#34; ability. Very strange!
