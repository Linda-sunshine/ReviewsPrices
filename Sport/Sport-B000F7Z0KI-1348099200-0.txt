review/summary: Great Bottle, Great Customer Servicereview/text: This bottle insulates nicely and the lid seals well - no leaks and no annoying drippy condensation. Great bottle for the money.I bought my first Polar Bottle about two years ago, and I typically use it 2-3 times a week. My only problem occurred a couple of weeks ago when a plastic piece on the lid cracked, making it difficult to close the mouthpiece. I went to the company website and sent them an email, and they promptly sent me two new lids at no charge. I guess I should dock them a star because of the cracked piece, but the bottle is two years old, and their great customer service earns the star back.I recently bought a second bottle for my son to take to baseball games, and as other family members' current water bottles wear out, I will probably replace those with Polar Bottles as well.
