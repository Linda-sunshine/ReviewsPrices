review/summary: Completely satisfiedreview/text: I ordered this Airbed to set up next to my whelping box while waiting for puppies to arrive. I wanted something comfortable since I knew I would be spending a lot of time on it for the next couple of weeks. This bed is FANTASTIC, inflates in less than a minute to any fill that suits and deflates just as easily. I even had plenty of room for my Chihuahua to share my bed .... Highly recommend this item and seller ... arrived swiftly and safely.
