review/summary: Nice quality matreview/text: My 5yr old asked Santa for a yoga mat for his weekly yoga class. His only request was that it needed to be purple! I just chose this one because of the price, but now my 5yr old has a nicer mat than I do! Its nice and thick, rolls up nicely, and seems to be good quality. Its also a lot longer than my mat, I actually cut it smaller for him because he doesn't need the length and I wanted it to be lighter for him to carry. The extra piece he uses to play legos on. Lots of colors to choose from as well!Good price, good product, and it shipped fast. I'll order another for myself when I need it!
