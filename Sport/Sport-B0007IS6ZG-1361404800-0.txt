review/summary: Great Rope!review/text: I'm not the most experienced &#34;roper&#34; but this jump rope is of great quality, with soft and comfortable handles. The rope itself takes a bit to relax the bends out after removing from packaging but once its broken in, its fine. The bearings dont allow for any tangling which is very nice.
