review/summary: Razor Sharp...review/text: Very sleek in design and function. I love its monochromatic look, its one finger assisted opening system, and its slim (1/4-inch) thin profile. And, the most important reason for buying a knife has not been overlooked. The blade is razor sharp, out of the box; and it stays sharp. A safety screw, when slid into position, will help prevent unintentional openings. I really am pleased with this knife. However. some people may have an issue with the absence of texture or some overlay to increase the feeling of a firmer grip; but that, in my opinion, would detract from its simple elegance and litheness.
