review/summary: Exactly What I Was Looking Forreview/text: I WAS having issues finding a heavier than rope skipping rope. Tried the plastic rolls that are added to some, tried the leather speed ropes, (Which are about as fast as an aging turtle) and I finally found this Valeo Speed Rope.Because it's made from a heavy rubber grade it swings over at a really good rate.I ONLY know how to skip from my boxing days, where the feet stay low to the ground and not the One Step, Two Step, Fall All Over There kind of skipping so this rope is perfect for my cardio workout needs.I'd definitely recommend this product.
