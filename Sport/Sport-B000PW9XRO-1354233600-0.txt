review/summary: Works well for driving. Will go shooting with it sometime.review/text: I ordered these gloves one afternoon and got it next morning! Super fast shipping and it was free with Prime.I was looking for gloves for driving in the colder months in new jersey. Initially I was looking at Under Armour fleece gloves but then these were in my recommendations.What I like about them:No logo, so I'm not paying to advertiseSynthetic leather palm and neoprene back makes for nice look texture contrastBreathable. My hands don't pool with sweat.It greatly decreases the cold bite of the steering wheel when I just get into my car (lancer) in mid 30 degree weather.Great Dexterity and touch feedback. Like a second skin.They are not for:Snow fightsBaking
