review/summary: Rated my KKSS Water Bottle, which I already lost, BUMMER! Not your fault, tho, sorry!review/text: I love these kind of bottles. The 24 ounce size was perfect, too. I loved the color of this one, also, but I already lost this one. I lose them all the time. It makes me so mad. I need some kind of invention to keep it somewhere on me. I gave my niece something she hung on her shoulder when she went to Europe. She said she thought it was nerdy at first, but then one day she used it and couldn't do without it the rest of the trip. I'll have to order a new bottle on payday.Also, I would like to cancel my Amazon Prime Monthly Account. I just don't see why I really need it. Your immediate attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.Thank you.Sincerely,Debbe L'Angelle
