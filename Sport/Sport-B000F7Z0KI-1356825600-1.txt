review/summary: Pretty good, but not perfectreview/text: Even though this is more of a water bottle for biking, I bought it for every day use at work because the one I was using didn't do a good job of keeping my water cold. This one does a decent job of that. I've yet to find a plastic water bottle that's going to keep your water icy cold for long, but this one is pretty good. It's easy to wash (dishwasher safe) and doesn't leak as long as you put the cap on tight. It also fits easily into my work bag, so it doesn't ever feel cumbersome.I was disappointed by the color--the pic makes it look more blue than it actually is. It looks (and feels when you squeeze it) like a layer of blue cellophane or something is behind a semi-transparent white shell, so it's really more white than anything...kinda boring.The biggest problem I have is that when it feels like I've squeezed every last drop out of the thing, I often find there is another gulp of liquid at the bottom. I guess it's just the way the inside of the bottle is contoured or something, but it's annoying.
