review/summary: awesomereview/text: i bought this for my 6 year old son for the new school year. The kid is so picky that he would hardly eat at school. This really does keep his food hot. You just add some almost boiling water to it, let it sit for 10 minutes. Then add your hot food, we added warmed spaghetti O's, and VIOLA! He was so happy when he got home from school. He said "MOM, my food was hot, im not joking!" lol .... awesome product
