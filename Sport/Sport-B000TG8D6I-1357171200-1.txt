review/summary: Loved itreview/text: To lose weight, ANY consistent type of workout will give you result (energy output is greater than energy intake - very simple concept.) If you stop working out, the weight should come back on again (energy output is less than energy intake).I tried p90x and i did lose weight and shaped up. It was fun and exciting (Toni is great and fun). But once I stopped the program, slowly old food habits kicked in and I started gaining all the weight back again.The reason I am writing this review is to get myself thinking about p90x again and pump myself into restarting..Wish me luck and happy 2013!
