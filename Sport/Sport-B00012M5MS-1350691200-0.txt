review/summary: Dont buy this!!!review/text: When I ordered this product I needed a helmet really soon for a charity ride, however when it came it was in pieces. The plasic that covers the helmet was glued with the worst possible glue and came off when I picked it up out of the box! I thought well I got what I paid for however a few days later I saw a friend with a new helmet that was really good and he had only paid $10 more for it!
