review/summary: Not a fan...review/text: ProHard to spillNearly indestructibleConPressurizes in heat and showers youTube attaching bite valve to top will bust off if droppedUnable to buy replacement top without buying the whole thing (bite valve/straw and all)Dirt clogs air valveBought these for our kids to use in the car - believed they would prevent spills, which they did (at first). However, we live in a dusty part of the country, so the air valve (meant to let air into the bottle and make it easier to drink) is located at the bottom of a 'well' in the top... guess where all of the dirt and grime collects? And, if the valve gets stuck open, when you invert the bottle (as kids do) then the water will dribble out of the bite valve as it isn't totally airtight. So, we try to clean out the dirt and grime but can see (but not reach) the dirt where the bottom of the bite valve holder rotates onto the top of the straw. Ugh. Also, the air valve is one way, so when the air heats up inside the bottle (if left in a warm car) if you then bite the valve (or even squeeze it with your fingers) water will shoot out of the bite valve, pushed by the pressurized air in the bottle. Ugh again. The last straw (so to speak) was when the little plastic hinge pins on the bite valve holder cracked off due to the bottle getting dropped or knocked over with the bite valve in the drinking position. Fine, I understand those little pieces of plastic won't last forever. But good luck finding a replacement top anywhere. I could only find a complete new bottle or replacement tops that forced you to buy straws and bite valves as well.So, we gave up on Camelbak and moved to Thermos Intak flip top bottles. They have a lot less issues with dirt, and are almost impossible to break as long as the flip top is closed.
