review/summary: Tried & True Pedometerreview/text: I have been using this pedometer and the Omron Health Management software successfully for years. It is easy to upload past data and while the actual pedometer will only visually show seven (7) days of data, it will save and therefore upload to your computer as many as 30-45 days of past data at a time. It keeps track on which data has been upload and there is a visual indicator to let you know when you need to upload data to prevent loss. Probably the best review that I can give for this pedometer is that I have two of them because I continually forget and wash the device in the pocket of my pants. When this happens, I remove the replaceable battery, wrap the device loosely in a plastic bag and place it in a jar of dessicating pellets used for drying flowers, etc. So far (several times for each device over 3 to 5 years) when I need the drying device (because I have washed the other), replacing the battery on the dried device and re-entering my settings (about 30 seconds) is all that is needed to get me back to tracking steps, calories and distance I am walking.
