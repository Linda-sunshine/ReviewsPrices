review/summary: An extremity lifesaver and made in the USA!review/text: I am just not a fan of cold weather and neither are my fingers and toes. These hand warmers saved me from brutally cold weather and along with layering thermals and coats, made the freezing temperatures bearable. I give only 4 stars because I do wish that they could heat up more quickly. To heat up fully it takes approximately 10-15 minutes and some of the packets are warmer than others (which is bizarre). Overall though, this is a great product and a must-have in cold weather.
