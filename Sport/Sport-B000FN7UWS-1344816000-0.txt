review/summary: Perfect!review/text: I originally just wanted theKlean Kanteen Poly Sports 2.0 Cap, but was sold on the color and size of the whole ensamble.Typically this is where you would see a pros headers, but I have no cons, so a header is not needed. But bulleted list!* Bright color, not going to get lost easily. Matches my MacBook's shell and my backpack.* Amazing Kleen Kanteen construction, super durable, super light.* No weird taste, well there is a subtle but refreshing taste, likely me tasting clean water from a clean water bottle for the first time.* Great cap, it's not like those straw like ones where you just drink up, but not like a classic sports top. It requires a bit of suction, while at an angle, but not so much that your mouth dries out. And it won't leak if you invert it. Note it will feel weird to drink and not squeeze but you will get used to it!I'll update in three months with more info. And always if needed.That's all folks!
