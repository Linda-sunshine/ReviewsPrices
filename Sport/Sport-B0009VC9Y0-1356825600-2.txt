review/summary: Well-made, high quality knifereview/text: Not much else to say. This is my first Kershaw knife and I am very impressed with its design and function. I own other &#34;assisted-opening&#34; knives and this one performs as well as a knife costing three times as much. Unlike other knives I own, the thin profile of this one makes it easy to clip to the inside of a pants pocket without feeling it against your hip. Overall, a great knife that will serve a buyer well for years to come.
