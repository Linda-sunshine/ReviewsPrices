review/summary: Great bottle, seals well, no funny taste.review/text: We bought the 12-ounce stainless bottles with the standard poly-loop top for my son to take water to school, as he does not like the chlorine taste of the school's water. It obviously doesn't impart any flavor to the water, as he drinks it just fine. His teacher pours the water from the bottle into his cup. They work great. The cap does not leak, and seals tightly - sometimes a little too tightly for me to open without help! The 12 ounce size is great - it fits fine in his little snack bag and it isn't too heavy, like some of the bigger bottles when full. We bought two so we always have one clean for the next day.
