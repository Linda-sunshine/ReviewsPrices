review/summary: Sweet Dreamsreview/text: Compact, easy to store and carry this Therm-a-rest Compressible Pillow is a great addition to my sleeping bag. I wasn't impressed when I first pulled it from it's attached compartment, but after a few good shakes and fluffing, it expanded nicely into a very comfortable pillow. Well worth the money.
