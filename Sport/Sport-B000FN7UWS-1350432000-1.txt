review/summary: excellent product from kleenreview/text: hello,this is the 6th kleen kanteen bottle we have purchased. they are the best for ease of use, and features. the sport cap has a great finger hook or belt loop hooking ring. the pop up cap stays closed preventing leaks. if there are some rough areas ahead, the enclosed outer cap stays securely clipped over the pop up cap. in over ten accidental drops and knock overs, there has not been a leak yet. great design. these bottles get quite a workout. they rinse simply and are easily cleaned. there are many stickers that go on the different bottles to show individuality. (sports team nicknames,slogans,etc.) the different caps from kleen kanteen easily interchange and make each bottle better. you cant go wrong with kleen kanteen...yrmv.
