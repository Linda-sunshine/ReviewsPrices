review/summary: Love it but missing one componentreview/text: I bought 30 units of this OMRON HJ-112 digital pocket pedometer on behalf of the company to kick of the new year with a wellness program. For each employee who signed up for a Weight Watcher Program, a pedometer was given to them with no cost to the employee. The employees love, love it! The set-up of the pedometer is easy and we have no complaints except for a missing screwdriver that was supposed to be included in the kit.
