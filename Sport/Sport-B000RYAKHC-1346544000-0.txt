review/summary: Solid performer for suburban/urban areasreview/text: I've had this little powerhouse for about 6 months now, and I am impressed. If you bike in moderately-lit areas, being spotted won't a problem. My main commute to work and back takes me through about 3 miles of farm roads, and this is where the little device has drawbacks.The light seems a little weak in low-light/near-dark conditions, and I wouldn't recommend it for rural/poorly lit areas. Why? That's an easy one -- high beams will complete bleach out that light, and the reflector is a moot point. Think about it, almost every mailbox post on a farm road has reflectors on it. I've had a couple of close shaves because of that, and you're better off dropping down the extra dollars on something with more power, like a Radbot 1000 or Danger Zone.That being said, the quick-release mount makes it perfect for swapping out different lights. I don't subscribe to the theory that you can never have too much light, because I don't think blinding people with with some strobe of death is always a safe bet. So, this gets used on rides around town, and gets removed for my commutes to and from work.
