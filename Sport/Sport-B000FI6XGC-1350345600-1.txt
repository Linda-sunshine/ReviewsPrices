review/summary: Never felt so much like an idiotreview/text: I am not a pro, just an occasional rider. So figure #1 seller has got to meet my casual need.When I first opened the box, I panicked once I saw the neat little pump had no way to connect to the valve of my bike. Did I need a connection hose? No one said a thing. No instruction included, not a word. Looking at the photos in Amazon about this pump, all about how nice it looks, none about when it is actually is use.Was the package missing something? I had no idea. But did not seem so (though I did not see any attached screws in the package as I saw in some of the photos). The nice package even had some words about a "lock". What was it for? I was clueless. There wasn't a single line of instruction.So I went to Topeak's website ([...]) as I figured if I sold a product, I'd got to tell my customers about it as much as possible.Sure I got a link to the "User Guide" there. But was I shocked to see it was only about how to mount the pump to a bike, nothing more. Tried the videos over there. Not sure what those videos were for but none about how to use the pump.I tried a few times to see if I could hook the pump to the valve and decided only a pro could have been able to manage that.I had enough. Had to return it. So wasted another half an hour to send it back. But surely I don't want to spend money on something that will only tell me how stupid I am.
