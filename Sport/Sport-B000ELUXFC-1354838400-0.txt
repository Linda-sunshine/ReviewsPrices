review/summary: Its an excelent product but at the beggining u must have a cold blood stream :)review/text: Length:: 0:16 MinsHEllo everybody.I did buy this bike support for my husband wich just purchase a Scott 29" for our training and get in shape process.The bike support it self is very good and very sturdy.Since we are currently in Brazil and the roads here are kind of bumpy and have a lot of holes u must have cold blood in the first time u go out with your bike.The bike support absorvs every road imperfection and you can see your bike shaking a lot. In the first ride we did stop the car 3 times to check on it. And it was sturdy just as we put it.I have uploaded a video of the bike support on a freeway road. The car was about 70 - 75 Mph/h and it holds the bike very well. You can see a few small bumps but nothing like taking it for a ride on a city downtown or a little bit of trail.We have yet to try these for 2 bikes but from what we can see it might be a tight fit for this task!Overall a great product, great price and on time delivery from Amazon.C.
