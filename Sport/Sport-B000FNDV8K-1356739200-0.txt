review/summary: Great Giftreview/text: I have carried the classic Swiss Army knife in my pocket for years. I must pull it out five or six times a day to perform various odd jobs from opening boxes to trimming loose thread from clothing. I would be lost without it. I got this one as a present for for my nephew. He loves the color and I am sure he will find it to be a very useful tool.
