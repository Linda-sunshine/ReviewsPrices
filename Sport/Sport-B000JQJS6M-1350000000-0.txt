review/summary: Very Unhappyreview/text: After recieving this watch I was very impressed. That lasted for 3 weeks only. I travel for extended periods of time so could not send it back. The pin on the band fell out. I spent $20 at a mall fix it shop and the same thing happened within a week, again in a differant town. I looks nice but if you don't wear it at least 10 hours a day it will stop running in the middle of the night. Looks are not everything. It's falling apart and will not stay running unless it is worn most of the day.
