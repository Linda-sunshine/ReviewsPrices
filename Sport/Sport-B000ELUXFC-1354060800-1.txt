review/summary: Low cost, effective, fairly easy to install (once you RTFM)review/text: Given the price point, this is a hard system to beat. I don't really recommend it for two bikes (it seemed to bounce a bit on rougher roads, and that made me a little nervous). But for single bike users, it's great - takes about five minutes to get set up, and folds up for storage in the trunk. No issues at all, although I did have to replace mine after it was struck by a car in a rear-end collision and the plastic tabs for the cords snapped off (although the metal frame somehow held up).
