review/summary: So worth it. Especially awesome for tall girls!!!review/text: First off, I'm 5'8" and weigh 110 lbs. Considering my height, I have always been looking for yoga pants that come with the RIGHT length. I purchased a small in black, and these yogies barely touch the ground - which is exactly what I wanted!!! The not-so-tight band nicely hugs around your waist, and the mix between spandex and cotton is awesome. Overall, I would recomment these yoga pants for any women, especially for tall gals out there. YAY! :DP.S. uhhhhh actually, these are running baggy for me. around the knee and down. But reading many other comments, I don't think washing them in hot water will make them tighter! :(
