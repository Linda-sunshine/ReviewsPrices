review/summary: Absolutely wonderful toolreview/text: I keep this in my pocket almost all the time and I love it. It is somewhat wide but I haven't had an issue with it. A few tools I could do without and have never used but I mainly got this model for the wood saw and Phillips driver on the end. The pen has come in handy more that I thought it would, however.
