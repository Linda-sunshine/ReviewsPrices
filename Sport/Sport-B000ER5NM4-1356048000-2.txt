review/summary: Good length, not see-thrureview/text: I received these pants this week and they are of a good quality and not see-thru (I have the black color). I am 5'10 and the length is perfect. I chose a large and found it very true to size - a medium would have been very snug around my hips. I wear a 6-8 pant size and weigh 155 lbs. These are thinner than some other yoga pants I own (which is not a bad thing).NOTE: I have figured out why other reviewers have said these see-thru. If the pants are stretched tightly, they do become less opaque. If yours are see-thru during normal use, you might need a bigger size. I noticed mine going slightly see-thru when I put stress on the fabric while bending over or kneeling. It is not enough to cause me any concern while wearing, though.
