review/summary: Perfect for travelingreview/text: These boxers are very comfortable and perfect for travelling. I only purchased two so I had to use 1 or 2 non-ExOfficio boxers during my 10 day vacation, but these were perfect for a 8 hour flight and day-to-day as they dry within hours. Above all, they ARE indeed comfortable, I used these all day long on my European vacation, I was out for 10+ hours walking all over major European cities and these stayed dried and in place. I would actually were these on a regular basis if they were a little cheaper.
