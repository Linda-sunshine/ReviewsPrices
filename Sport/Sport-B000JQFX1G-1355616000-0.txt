review/summary: Good delivery, Simple packaging, Nice design, Superb timekeeping.review/text: Delivered in a week on super saver shipping.Box it came in was simple, I didn't mind for the box but I know some people would mind.First impressions: Nice design, nice feel, doesn't feel cheap at all.Bracelet seems like it was intentionally made larger to accommodate for larger, or smaller by taking links out. Middle parts of the bracelet are polished metal, outer is brushed.Bezel has a sturdy feel to it, and the clicks sound sturdy while turning it. Clicks 120 times per rotation so you can adjust for half second, half minute, or 6 minute intervals per click depending what you use to time with, second, minute or hour hand respectively.Luminosity is nice. In bright sunlight the glow in the dark parts get a greenish tint to them because of the lume, and lume lasts about 2:1 units of time of exposure.Second hand moves smoothly ticking at ~5times a second. You won't notice the ticking unless you try to look for it.Timekeeping is great! Just for timekeeping alone it would be chronometer certified. It gains ~1.5-3 seconds a day on a bad day.Big plus is that it allows for hacking the second hand. It means if your timing is correct you can synchronize it to atomic or any other time down to the seconds.
