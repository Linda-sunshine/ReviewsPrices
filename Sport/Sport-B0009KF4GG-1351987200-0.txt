review/summary: Great knife, great valuereview/text: I'm enjoying the knife. It's not too bulky to carry in the front pocket and most time I forget it's there. The knives aren't as sharp as I'd like them to be. The tools are easy to access. This is my second Swiss Army Knife and if I'm a bit smarter I won't take it to the airport with me!!
