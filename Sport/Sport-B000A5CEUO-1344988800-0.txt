review/summary: not goodreview/text: So I started training for the ING marathon, its 25 miles and well I'm a big guy, so I'm taking it slow and steady to win the race. No but seriously, with my previously small athletic and medical background, I am following coaches' schedule and training. With all that said, I will be purchasing many items from amazon and for my fellow prime addicts I will be leaving reviews on the products.way to many reasons why this is bad, really probably the worst item i bought in my journey, stay away
