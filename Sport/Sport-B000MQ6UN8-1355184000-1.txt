review/summary: Ear piece hinges so tight can't fold inreview/text: I love the look of the glasses, but the hinges are so tight that one side I can fold in with much effort, and the other side I can't even fold in. I didn't return because I like the glasses and didn't want to go through the hassle of returning and getting another pair.
