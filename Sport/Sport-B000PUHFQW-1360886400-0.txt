review/summary: Thick but Slipperyreview/text: I knew this was an affordable mat, but I was kind of bummed to find out how slippery it is. It's pretty hard to hold a down dog because my hands are slipping away the whole time. I don't think my hands are sweaty, and I've never had that problem with any other mat.The mat is nice and thick, which is important to me! And I've used it for 10+ classes so far and it hasn't started falling apart at all.Also, the color I ordered was Jasmine Green, which sounded nice and soothing for my yoga practice. What I got was neon green, which is no big deal for me, but might bother some people.
