review/summary: Undrinkable: Like Drinking From A Rusty Water Fountainreview/text: I have cleaned the bottle at least a dozen times with warm water and mild soap. I took the manufacturer's suggestion and cleaned it with baking soda and vinegar. I took their additional suggestion of letting distilled water and vinegar sit in the bottle over night. I tried everything and still, the water is disgusting. I use double-filtered water in the bottle and I liken it to the water that you would taste from a rusty old drinking fountain in a run-down park. If the water tastes like metal, it's probably not very good for your health.
