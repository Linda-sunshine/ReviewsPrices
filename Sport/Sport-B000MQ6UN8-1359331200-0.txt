review/summary: worth the hype, buy it!review/text: great brand and product. no wonder everyone raves about these. the clarity is not affected while blocking out the sharp sunlight in texas. I was worried about the weight bc I had purchased in a 62mm at first and they were like actual glass lens weight. These are XLT, meaning extra light and are great to wear all day long! I'm really pleased and you will be too, just be sure of the size!
