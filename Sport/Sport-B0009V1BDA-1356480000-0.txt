review/summary: Arrived in good shape. Works wellreview/text: Purchased as Christmas present for my wife. The box was sturdy and the grill just had a couple of parts to put on which were easily installed. We fired it up last night and it did a great job. It seems sturdy enough to replace the bulkier old grill, and will be great for tailgating as it folds down easily and rolls. I ordered the adapter to fit the 5 gallon propane tank and it worked well. I haven't tested it with a one gallon tank yet. So far we are happy with it.
