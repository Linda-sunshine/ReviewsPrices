review/summary: One of my favorite bottles everreview/text: I really like the design and size of this bottle. The hook is nice for carrying. I haven't had any real problems with it leaking, but I usually always have it upright. The mouthpiece comes off and can be cleaned (I got a goo-y buildup under it and took a small screwdriver to clean it out). I liked this one so much that I bought the 1L version too.
