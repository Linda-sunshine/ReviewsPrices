review/summary: Lodge Logic LCC3 Combo Cookerreview/text: UPDATE: I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but the lid/skillet is now a reddish-brown color, and every time I cook brown rice porridge Soto Zen style, my rice and beans come out black. I'm going to leave my original rating because I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if something is wrong with the pans...could it have something to do with the chips in the original pre-seasoning?I ordered this set as my introduction to cast iron cooking...well, cooking in general, to be honest, lol. I read quite a bit and watched videos, and decided this set would be perfect for my daughter and I. I decided to strip the pre-seasoning and re-season the set myself because of some chips in the preseasoning. I used the self-clean oven procedure, and scrubbed with white distilled vinegar afterwards. I have baked two coatings of Crisco shortening on my pans and will probably do one or two more. They are looking great! Before re-seasoning, I cooked up some steaks for my folks (I'm transitioning to vegetarian for several reasons, not least of which is health), and they came out wonderfully-juicy and just a bit of searing on the surface. I'm amazed at how efficient cast iron is and how little heat is required. I'm really looking forward to learning to cook with these great pans!! BTW, I liked how they cooked the steaks so much, I bought the 12" skillet for my parents so that they can get the health benefits also.
