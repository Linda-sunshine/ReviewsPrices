review/summary: Mirrycle MTB Mirrorreview/text: I needed to replace the grips on my Hybrid bike and saw this mirror while I was reviewing the available grips. My current mirror has a Velcro strap that wraps around the grip and constantly needs re-adjustment while riding. The Mirrycle slips into the end of the handle bar, after removing the end plug of the grip, and is secured in place with an internal wedge device. This mirror is rock solid, made from Polycarbonate (an essentially unbreakable plastic) and was very easy to install. I was so impressed I purchased two additional mirrors for my Wife's bike and my Road Bike.
