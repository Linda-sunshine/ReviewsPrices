review/summary: Nice quality yoga pants, but run a little smallreview/text: It's possible that these are intended to fit more snugly than others I own, but I would have preferred them a little looser in the butt and thigh. I still really like them and will just wear them at home. The flare leg is flattering and is really more like a boot cut leg IMO. If I were to buy them again, I'd buy the next size up or drop 10 pounds... I'm a size 14, fyi.
