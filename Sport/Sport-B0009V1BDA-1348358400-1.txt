review/summary: Great grillreview/text: I've only had this grill for a week, but I haven't had the same experiences as others. I brought it home to my apartment from my mom's where It as shipped and the lid held everything tight. The book says to shut the lid for fifteen minutes and leave the grill on high. The handle didn't melt. I haven't had any "cold spots" on the grill either. I'm using it as a grill for my deck and although it does cook a little differently from most barbecue grills, it cooks just like a typical Coleman camp grill. If you can use one of those, it's a great grill that will take the place of a camp stove, and your back yard grill.
