review/summary: What more do you want?review/text: I have never had a problem with the A-Zoom snap caps. I have them in 12ga, 30.06, 7.62x39, 5.56, 9mm, and .357 I've never received a defective one, nor have I ever had one fail. They are well made, durable, and reasonably priced. I like the fact that you get five in a package with the 9mm. They are indispensable when function checking your firearms or doing dry fire drills. They fit well and function like a regular round (only they don't go off and wake the neighbors). I would have given them five stars but they will show some wear on the finish after a while....so what. On a separate note, I ordered these at 10:30 or so at night and received them the next day. Gotta love Prime.
