review/summary: Good workout ....annoying trainerreview/text: Just finished Insanity and decided to try this , whilst I love the workouts I struggle with Tony Horton . His silliness I can tolerate but it annoys the heck out of me when throughout the workout we stop to chat sand be silly . When I press play I want to get in get the workout done and finish , example ..one DVD we go around having a chat before starting checking out the guys shaved hair pattern ...yeah cool but I'm not wanting to stand around every time I press play waiting for the actual workout to begin . With Insanity ...bang you are into it no mucking around P90x2 is the same ....chit chatter whilst we stand there waiting waiting
