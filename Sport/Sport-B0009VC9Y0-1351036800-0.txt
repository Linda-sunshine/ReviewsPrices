review/summary: Great Knife!review/text: I have only had this knife about two weeks but so far I love it. There is absolutely no blade wobble in any direction. The knife opens instantly with the speed assist and the lock has yet to let me down. With Kershaw's known excellent customer service and product support, this is a no-brainer purchase for the price.
