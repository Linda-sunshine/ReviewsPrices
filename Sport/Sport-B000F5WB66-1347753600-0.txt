review/summary: A Lot For A Littlereview/text: You get a lot of bang for your buck with with this nifty Heart Rate Monitor. This exercise tool gives you reliable HR readings and I especially like that it is spot on compared with the heart rate readings on my gym's cardio equipment. I don't need information overload in a HRM, what I do need is a dependable monitor that gives me accurate readings. The Timex Easy Trainer HRM is agreat exercise device and a real bargain too.
