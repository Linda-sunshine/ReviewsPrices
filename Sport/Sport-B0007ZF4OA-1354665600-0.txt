review/summary: Saved my platoon mates and mine life!review/text: Excellent products! During my Basic Officer Training we were doing survival training, which is basically hardcore camping in snow without heat, water, or electricity for a week, this product literally saved my life! Imagine getting 2 hours of sleep per night after marching 20km a day in 50lbs gear (I am a petite female, 110lbs, 5"4). When you fall asleep in warm your sleeping bag inside the tent, suddenly enemy (or instructor) strikes (happens multiple times a night), you have to wake up (not difficult when the entire camp is shouting), put on your boots, and throw on whatever jacket you have on beside you, grab your rifle, and run out to your post, all under 3 minutes. You are tired, sleepy, and freezing cold because you just got out of the warm sleeping bag and put on cold jacket and boots, you are swearing and cursing, and you are laying on the freezing ground. It is when the magical hand warmers come in to save the day, or save the night. I open the pouch, active both the warmers, put one in my right hand trigger glove, put the other one in my pants to keep my body warm. Let me tell you there is NOTHING like HEAT in damp, cold, dark night to bring morale up. I have given at least half of these hand warmers to my fellow officer candidates to get them through the cold. In my opinion this should be a standard military issue item. During the nights when we stood sentry, again in dark, cold nights, HEAT is what made me hate my life less at that moment, significantly less, actually.I have used the whole box and only 1 or 2 pouches are defective. Which is quite impressive given the price.Thank you HeatMax Hot Hands! I am ordering another box!
