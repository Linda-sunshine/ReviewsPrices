review/summary: Excellent Snap Capsreview/text: These were great snap caps. Allows me to practice drawing from my holster as well as dry firing and loading, unloading. With Semi-Auto's being so popular it should come with 10 or 15 but they were probably made when revolvers were more standard. I'd HIGHLY recommend these. If you mistake these for live rounds you need to put down the gun and get your eyes checked LOLHope you enjoy them and practice often as in an emergency situation it's important to make sure you know what to do and are able to do it almost on automatic pilotsteve @ www.doomsday-preppers.com
