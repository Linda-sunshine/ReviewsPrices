review/summary: helps my backachesreview/text: Buyer beware, the ball that came with was really small and I couldn't use it at my desk - luckily I had a larger ball that i used for workouts and was able to use that one instead. Otherwise, i love this chair and it has helped my back from aching while sitting at a regular office chair for 8 hours a day.
