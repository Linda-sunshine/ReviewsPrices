review/summary: Perfect Simple Pocketknifereview/text: I bought this to replace one that I had thoughtlessly mis-packed in my carry-on which was then promptly confiscated by TSA. I worried that I would never find a comparable quality knife to replace my trusty old companion, and was pleasantly surprised to find this to be a worthy replacement. Unlike some reviewers I have noted, I like the fact that it is tiny. If you are looking for bells and whistles this may not be for you. But, if you are like me, and not interested in a pocket knife that doubles as a tool shed and 32 kitchen appliances, then you've found the right one. In addition to the size I love the simplicity. I has a great pair of spring action scissors as well as a knife and nail file with a flat screwdriver head, toothpick and tweezers. That's all. It fits into the palm of your hand, making it truly easy to transport anywhere(except through airport security). It makes a great addition to your mani/pedi supplies for quick fixes when you're away from home or the salon. The tweezers have a fine edge. Great for plucking those fine hairs or pesky hard to grasp splinters, and the scissors and knife are plenty sharp for all those other incidental moments when you need to cut something. All around convenient for life's simpler quick fixes.
