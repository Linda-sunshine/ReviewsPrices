review/summary: The originalsreview/text: Just got my RB2140 Ray Ban Wayfarers in the mail today, after having lost my Wayfarer II's in the airport. I hope whoever finds them appreciates them as much as I did - for me to keep a pair of sunglasses for six years without losing or breaking them was a record.My new Wayfarers have larger, green lenses, non-polarized, with black frames. The Wayfarer II's I had were not polarized, either, and it wasn't a problem.At some point I had bought a decent pair of Wayfarer knockoffs to keep in the car for the days I forgot my shades, and I will continue to use them in situations where I might lose my Ray Bans (again!). The Ray Bans, however, are going to take some getting used to. The retro lenses are bigger and look completely different than what I am used to seeing on my face. It's hard to convince myself that the knockoffs aren't the real Wayfarers and the new Wayfarers I have aren't the knockoffs. I had been wearing Wayfarer knockoffs for years until my wife bought me a pair of the genuine article for our anniversary, and the knockoffs always had the larger lenses, but after six years with the Wayfarer II's they look quite a bit different.So I guess what I am trying to say is if you absolutely want the retro look, these are for you. If you want a nice pair of utilitarian shades that are sturdy, hard to scratch, hard to damage, and a little more modern looking, you might want to take a look at the Wayfarer II's.Me? I am going to wear my new Wayfarers when driving or hanging out, as long as I am sure I won't lose them. I am sure I will get used to the retro look.
