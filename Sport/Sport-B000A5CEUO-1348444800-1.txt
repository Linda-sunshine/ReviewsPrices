review/summary: Works Extremely Wellreview/text: I purchased this product for use with P90X although obviously it can be used with any sort of fitness program or routine. So far it has worked flawlessly giving me what seems like accurate readings at a glance. I do moisten the chest band prior to use as the instructions state. This takes not more than a second with a spray bottle of water. The unit sits comfortably around the my chest and under my shirt. One could not tell I was using it and I didn't even notice the chest band during the workout (zero interference). I am just using the basic heart rate readout and have not had a use for the various alarms. Overall a great price for a great working product. No troubles recommending at this point.
