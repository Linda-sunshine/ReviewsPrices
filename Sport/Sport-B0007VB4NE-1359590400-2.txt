review/summary: Just what I wanted!review/text: I purchased the chair hoping it would improve my sitting posture and it really has helped! I love the design~the back support is great and the chair was simple to put together. The pump works just fine and you can inflate it to give you a custom &#34;fit&#34;. I may consider getting a cloth cover for it as the weather warms up to prevent &#34;sticking&#34; to the plastic. Really glad I purchased it! Worth the money.
