review/summary: Bottle is great -- it's the sport cap that doesn't workreview/text: I own 5 Kleen Kanteen bottles in different sizes. They are all great -- sturdy, rust-free, no unwanted odor or flavors. But the only cap that is truly leak-proof is the loop cap. The sport cap leaks. It just does. There was a time when you could get a sport cap without the added loop, and it worked. But the loop/sport combo: it leaks. (not the bottle itself)
