review/summary: Great product but..review/text: I like this. I put soup, pasta, porridge for my son when we're out and about. HOWEVER, no matter how many times I wash it, it the smells of food seems to be &#34;staining&#34; (aka it still smells after washes). It's particularly in the lid that I've carefully washed with dish detergent. If you don't mind it, great product. Keep the food warm and hot for a cold winter day. And the lid keeps tightly closed.
