review/summary: My second Roadtrip Grill...I love these!review/text: This is my second Roadtrip grill. I bought my first one nearly 7 years ago. Myself and several friends used it over the years and simply loved it! I took it camping since it was so portable, but mostly just cooked on it at home. I purchased the high pressure hose for it so that I could use the large white propane tanks, which seemed to last a long time before refilling since you don't have to heat up a large grill to cook for just one or two people.This summer, we moved halfway around the world, and shipping our belongings was so expensive that we sold nearly everything, my beloved Roadtrip Grill included. We moved via US Postal Service. Due to size and weight, it would have cost almost as much to ship my old grill as it would be to replace it with a new one. Imagine my surprise when I was offered $50 cash for my 6-1/2 year old Roadtrip Grill! Maybe I could have gotten even more for it, but we needed to move quickly and gave people real bargains.After we arrived at our new home, we spotted it on sale at Amazon.com and ordered it immediately. These are great. Don't let the small size fool you, you can cook a lot on these. They are so easy to keep clean, so portable, and what can I say...after 6-1/2 years in a tropical environment, my old one was still in great shape and I'm sure its new owner will enjoy it for years to come. Only one thing: the red top will fade in the sun over the years, so if that matters to you, put a cover on it.HIGHLY recommended.
