review/summary: Ideal for keeping food warm, or cold, for several hours.review/text: First off, there are costlier variants of this model available, which seem to offer nothing more than some decorative stickers on the surface. We went for the basic, simple version, which does the job of keeping food warm. In my experience, if you pour hot food into this jar and then immediately close the lid, it will keep the food warm for at least six hours, in Bangalore weather. I say &#34;warm&#34; and not &#34;hot&#34; because after six hours when you open the lid, the food is still warm. I anyway do not expect it to be as hot as when the food was poured in six hours earlier, so no complaints here.The jar is BPA free, as per the manufacturer, so that is a definite plus.The mouth is wide enough for you to put your hand in to take out food from it without having to squish your hand to get to the bottom of the jar. The wide mouth is also a plus when it comes to cleaning, especially if you want to use cleaning pad and not a long-handle brush.The jar's handle itself, I found, lends itself to easy gripping - what with its rubber grip - and opens without too much fuss. When handing it to kids, ease of opening is a definite issue to consider, both ways - how easy it is to close and how easy it is to close. Too difficult to open and the temptation to not close it tightly enough will result in either messy leaks or the food losing its temperature too quickly.All in all, a most useful jar. Now it remains to be seen how long it lasts. Five years? Ten years? One year? It certainly looks solid and solidly designed to last five years, but let's wait and use and watch.
