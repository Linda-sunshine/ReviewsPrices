review/summary: Backup guy gives upreview/text: Its a great, quick workout, but the filming/editing is terrible, which definitely takes away from the workout.Mainly, the backup white guy doesn't try hard and sits through half the recording. Its Shaun T, a backup woman, and a backup man. The backup man is not in good enough shape to do even half the program, and its distracting seeing him with his goofy smile just walk away, drink water, and not give it his all. Why not just get someone in shape for this program?Also, he drops some curse words, which get loudly bleeped out multiple times. I'd rather hear the curse words or nothing. Bleep sounds shouldn't be involved.Why didn't they have professionals put this together?
