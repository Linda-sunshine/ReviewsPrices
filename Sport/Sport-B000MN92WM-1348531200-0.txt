review/summary: 2012 and STILL not mac compatiblereview/text: Get with the program Omron...I can't believe it's 2012 and I STILL can't use my omron with my mac. I got this as part of a work promotion and I"ve had it for 2 years...unable to use it. What a useless product for about half of all computer users. Fitbit it is then...
