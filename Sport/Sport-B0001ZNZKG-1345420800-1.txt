review/summary: Just What I expectedreview/text: I ordered this product because I was looking for something than just plain old cotton. I would have to say that these are the most comfortable pair of boxers i've ever worn. they are lightweight, and made out of a mesh material. I did find that they run a size or two big compared to other manufactures. I am a size 38 waist and normally wear a L to XL pair of boxers, while in these the M fit me perfectly. I own 5 pairs of these now, and on two of the pairs I am noticing that after only a few washes, they have started to fray and the mesh is not holding up as well as I had hoped. They are still wearable, but annoying.
