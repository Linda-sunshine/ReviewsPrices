review/summary: lid is going to get grossreview/text: I tested this with hot water when it arrived and it kept the water very warm for at least three hours; looking at reviews it seems like there might be a few duds that don't work. It's a nice size for kids' lunches and can be packed for an adult lunch as part of other bits and pieces.The lid has a deep groove around an "island" - i.e. you can't fill the container all the way to the top, you have to leave space for the "island" that plugs in and helps seal and insulate the contents. The deep, narrow groove will surely get gross - it's perhaps 2/3" deep and 1/8" wide, and the rubbery seal around the "island" that plugs into the thermos has a couple of grooves and ridges. I'm sure the different aspects of the design are all for a purpose but anticipate that they will get icky. The narrow groove fits over the edge of the container, so whatever is in there will get on the lips of whoever drinks from the container. Glad I'd also ordered some straw-cleaning brushes for another purpose that will be able to get into these nooks and crannies.
