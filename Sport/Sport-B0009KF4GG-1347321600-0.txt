review/summary: Great Big Knife.review/text: Purchased this July 27th from Amazon.com. I have one for myself and my boyscout son. First, the knife is big. You can carry it in your pocket, but I recommend getting the large case for it. The case will be tight at first, but will stretch.Victorinox Leather Large Clip Pouch Swiss Army Knife Pouches Black 33256The knife has everything you could want on it. I have not used every tool yet, but I know if I am in need, it is in there. The quality appears to be what you would expect from Victorinox Swiss Army. Now the knife has a lot of tools so there may seem to be a lot of tools bunched together. Honestly, what else would you expect. It may seem difficult to get to certain tools, and you may have preferred one tool be in another location. But you can't please everyone so you've got to please yourself. Seriously, the knife is fine. The main reason I wanted this over a smaller version was for the magnifying glass. It has come in handy just in having to read fine print. I could also use it to start a fire if I wanted to. My son has been told by ALL his fellow troop members how awesome and cool it is. He has used it to help out some of his fellow scouts and even some scoutmasters as well. He thinks it is the coolest thing since xbox. Well he may not really think that, but I do. He just thinks it is cooler than sliced bread.Anyhow, I highly recommend the knife. Again, get the leather pouch if you don't like bulky things in your pocket.Good camping and scouting!
