review/summary: My third Kershaw, and my favorite of the bunch!review/text: I've ordered two Kershaw knives in the past, one is the Blur, and the other is the Compound 1940ST (from Woot). The leek is my favorite of all three knives, and this is in large part due to the overall design, form, and size of this knife. It is not very large (which I like) but it fits perfectly in my hand. It comes absolutely razor sharp out of the box, I did the "shave a random part of your leg" test, and came out as smooth as a baby's bottom, lol.Anyways, this really is a great knife. I'll be going to Kershaw for all my knife purchases in the future, that's for sure.
