review/summary: Great feel ...review/text: I purchased for my DPMS AR-15 MK-12 as a replacement for the factory grip. This Hogue Rubber Grip is MUCH better for feel and grip security. It's that &#34;kinda soft&#34; feel but not sticky feeling. Installation was simple (watch for and don't loose that little spring, see your owner's manual). Well worth the purchase I believe.
