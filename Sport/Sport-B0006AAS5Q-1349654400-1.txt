review/summary: Returned.review/text: I hate to be the bearer of bad news but this is probably my 4th invacta I bought and the quality of this watch is.. well.. poor. It does not compare at all to theInvicta Men's 10704 Speedway Chronograph Blue Dial 18k Gold Ion-Plated Stainless Steel WatchorInvicta Men's 1774 Pro Diver Collection Chronograph Watch. In terms of weight, material, functionality, and of course looks. To me this would be a good gift for a women, it is small, lightweight and it's not a horrible price for what you are getting.
