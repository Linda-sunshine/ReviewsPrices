review/summary: Absolutely Perfect!review/text: A friend got me these gloves for Christmas when she had no idea what to get me and I suggested them! I live in a cold weather climate....target handgun shooting is a big hobby of mine, and I have arthritis in both hands. Grip and flexibility, both critical in shooting gloves, are first class with these! Now I can enjoy my hobby without my hands seizing up!!
