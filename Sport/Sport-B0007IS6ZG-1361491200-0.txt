review/summary: Durable, but difficult to adjustreview/text: Well built, but difficult to adjust. Thankfully, you should only need to do this once. You'll essentially have to bend a crimped metal fastener enough to allow the rubber robe to be removed, and then crimp it back on. Sounds easy, but will require some fiddling.
