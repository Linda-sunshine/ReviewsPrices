review/summary: OK, but leaks a littlereview/text: I bought this originally to bring juice to work in from my juicer. I popped it in the refrigerator the night before to keep it cold. It stayed cold all day then, which is excellent. I love how long this thing keeps liquids cold. I haven't tried hot liquids in it yet. I love that it's normal stainless steel, since anything painted seems to start chipping or peeling after a little while. The pour spout makes it easy to pour into another glass if needed without dribbling and I'm sure will help prevent you from burning your mouth on hot liquids. It does slow the flow of liquids, so it probably won't make the best sports water bottle. My biggest complaint about it is liquids seem to get trapped in the lid area and leak out a little while moving if not kept straight up and down. I would normally put this in my backpack where any juice leaking out would cause a sticky mess. A nice bottle, but not the best.
