review/summary: Complicated design and fragilereview/text: The spout broke very early on in it's life. The parts can't be replaced due to the design of manufacture. I fix almost everything in the house one way or another but the cap is not a repairable part. Machines build them in certain ways that a human hand can't do. Plus - the parts are too fragile. The plastics need to be a more resilient or softer blent to resist cracking and breaking.
