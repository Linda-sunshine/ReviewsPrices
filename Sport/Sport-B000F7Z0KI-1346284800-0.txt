review/summary: Effective Insulatingreview/text: I bought 3 of these to use on bike rides with my children. The kids are able to ride longer distances this year and I wanted to be able to keep them hydrated. We've had a really hot summer this year.We've done about a half a dozen rides in 85-95 degree heat with the insulated water bottles. As the other reviews have stated these bottles will keep water cool for a couple of hours.We fill the bottle one third full and freeze that water while the bottle lays down flat in the freezer. When we are ready to ride we fill it the rest of the way with water and it stays cool for the duration of our ride.Nice!
