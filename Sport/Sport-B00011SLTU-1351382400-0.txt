review/summary: Great small pocket knife. As in pretty small.review/text: Just so nobody gets confused here, this is a very small pocket knife. To be worn on a key chain. Nothing remotely what is considered EDC (every day carry). But here is why I got it: You get a small blade which is good enough to cut open little packages/string/etc. Scissors, a nail file and what I like the best....tweezers and a toothpick. None of the high priced Leatherman etc. multitools have tweezers, and if you ever had a nasty splinter you know how important tweezers can be.
