review/summary: Omron reviewreview/text: I really find this to be a quality pedometer. It meets all my requirements and more. Very sturdy if it drops. And it gives accurate information. I like that it tells me aerobic steps verses regular walking steps. Calories burned information and mileage as well.Good product I would choose it over the weight watcher one as well.
