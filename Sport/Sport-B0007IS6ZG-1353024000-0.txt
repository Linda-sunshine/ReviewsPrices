review/summary: Awesome jump rope to train withreview/text: I used to be a much more active person. Lately I've been pretty lazy. Not to long ago I made up my mind to get fit again. Well, I'd need a jump rope. I looked around and read the reviews on this one. It's affordable, and very easy to use. The material is great and I really love my new jump rope. It's a bit annoying to have to fix the length of the rope, but once you get it it's amazing.Been training now for about a week. Still love it. If you're going to buy a jump rope, I'd suggest you go with this one. Now stop reading reviews on jump ropes and buy it already!
