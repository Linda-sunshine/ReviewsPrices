review/summary: Reality wasn't as good as my imaginationreview/text: I imagined myself gleefully bouncing along on my ball chair day in and day out. Reality was far less appealing. First, I always felt like I ended up slouching, vice the promised good posture. While I am certain I burned extra calories during the day, fighting to stay on my chair wasn't my idea of &#34;exercise&#34; at all. The back on this chair, which is really a misnomer considering the fact that it doesn't function like a chair back, broke after I leaned on it... which was both difficult and uncomfortable.Best of luck to anyone that feels the need to try this. In theory I think it is a good idea, I'm just not sure how reasonable it is in application. I switched back to a normal chair at work and gave this to my son.
