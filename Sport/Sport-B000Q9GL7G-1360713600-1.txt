review/summary: Blackhawk Serpa Level 2 Holsterreview/text: I had second thoughts about buying this holster, but when it arrived and my gun fit perfectly I have had no regrets. I love it. My gun stays snug and it will not fall out until I release it. I am going to be buying a Taurus 24/7 real soon and I will be ordering one for it. Well worth the money.
