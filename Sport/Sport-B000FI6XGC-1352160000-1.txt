review/summary: Works Wellreview/text: Pump is very light but sturdy, not flimsy. Clip holds the bike securely (it hasn't loosened at all on my mountain bike despite several miles of hard trails). The handle locks in the closed position with a half turn. I was concerned it could work loose and extend when mounted handle down, but so far it has stayed locked. Pump seems to move a fair amount of air with each stroke. Not a replacement for a floor pump but good for a trail pump.
