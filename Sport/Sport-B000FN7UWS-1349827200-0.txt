review/summary: Perfect for lunch pail.review/text: Perfect size to slip in the purse, lunch pail, etc. I have several size, and use everyday. I have several different lids as well. The 12 ounce is similar to a small water bottle - or baby bottle. The larger sizes hold more water but are more cumbersome to carry for me. 20 oz is a good mid size bottle. Recommended to many.Update: In reading the other reviews, I see many who have leaks. I have experienced no leaks with any of mine. I have both the plastic lids and the stainless steel. This has not been a concern for me. I like over the Sigg - the Sigg gives a metal taste to the water and the Sigg opening is much smaller. Still highly recommend.
