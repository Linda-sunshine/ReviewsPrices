review/summary: Hypereview/text: I bought into the hype and gave these a try, but must say I don't get it. Sure they are pretty comfortable but so are a lot of boxers for far less $$. I hang my laundry to dry and these take longer to dry than my polyester pairs, and about the same as thin cotton ones. On a recent vacation I tried out the hand-washing thing; rung them out but neglected to roll in a towel... they hung all night in a bone dry room and were not even close to dry by morning. Don't forget the towel step! Also they do not seem like they will hold up well... they will be fine if you plan to wash them in a sink/river but the washing machine appears to take a toll, even when washed on cold/delicate. After just a couple months they are starting to get a lot of fuzzy patches. Don't even think about washing these if there is any Velcro in the machine. 4 stars for the shorts because they are pretty comfortable and good for hiking, but 2 or maybe even 1 star for the price vs. what you get.
