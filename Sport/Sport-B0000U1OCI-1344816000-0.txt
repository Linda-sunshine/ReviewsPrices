review/summary: Reliable and Easy to usereview/text: Finally, a Pedometer that actually counts accurately. It's reliable and easy to use. Love the fact that you can look at steps, miles or cal count. And it saves your history for 7 days. It's very easy to set and use and I'm not the most technical person.
