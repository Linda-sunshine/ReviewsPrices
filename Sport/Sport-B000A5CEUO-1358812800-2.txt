review/summary: It works perfectly for my needs! (without any beeping)review/text: I selected this model because of the recommendation from Consumer Reports, and the fact that the user can replace the bettery in the watch and in the band, as well.I use it while exercising on my Nordic Track skier. I don't wear it on my wrist, instead, it sits on a stand directly in front of me that also holds other "stuff." In use, it is probably about 12-15 inches away from my chest. I never have a problem getting a reading. Be sure to wet the contact areas of the belt before you put it around your chest.The heart rate numbers on the display are large and very easy to read. Once you set up the range for your heart rate, it is supposed to beep if you are above or below that rate, but I haven't heard any beeps yet. Normally, I would downgrade it for that, but I won't because I don't need, or want, to hear any beeps, because I can clearly see my rate and I make adjustments to keep myself in the right range. Also, any beeping would shorten the battery life of the watch. There is an adjustment to shut off or keep on the beeping, but I have noticed no difference, no matter the setting. Frankly, don't pay too much attention to my comments about the beeping, because I have not spent much time on trying to get it to beep, since that aspect is not important to me.All in all, I think I made the right choice on this product. If I ever have any problems with it, I will update this review.
