review/summary: Product is Cheap - But made Cheap as well!review/text: I was very disappointed when this card shuffler came and one side did not even work and the tab to one of the battery compartments broke when opening...Now understand I did not expect it to be much for the money i spent on it $14 ... BUT, I did expect to get to use it to shuffle a card deck at the very least 1 time... But NOPE!Buyer Beware!
