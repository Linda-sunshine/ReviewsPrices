review/summary: Comfy Toe Socksreview/text: I've only used these once but they provide a lot more comfort than going bare with just my Vibram Fivefingers. My feet usually get sore after walking for too long but they're able to take more impact as the socks provide some extra cushion. They fit well and look good with the Vibrams. I haven't tried to wash these yet but with a few people saying the washing machine rips them up, I'll probably hand wash them just in case.
