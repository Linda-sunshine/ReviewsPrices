review/summary: Doesn't pump wellreview/text: I bought this thinking that it was an equivalent to the full size bike pumps for flat tires. Even though I was ignorant, I think the sellers should have made it clear that this was NOT to be used for fixing general flats. I asked some bike shop owners and, for those of you who are thinking of buying this, please note that it's only for emergencies where it needs a tiny bit more air to make it until you can get to a proper bike pump.Even when I tried to use it in the conditions that it was apparently made for, it barely pumped in any air at all. I lost more air than I could get into the tire.The only reason I couldn't return it was that I waited too long to use it and I had passed the final return date.
