review/summary: sleek and sexy!review/text: Excellent. Some knocked this knife for being too smooth and not textured like if you had to use it with gloves. Please. There are other Kershaw models that fit the bill if you are looking for that. But if you are looking for sleek and sexy knife to take out on a casual day this is it. I consider this an old school, 'Sunday church' type of knife if you know what I mean. I was amazed how well it felt and looked. If I was going out for a heavy work day in the woods, I would leave this knife at home and grab something alittle more suited for that (which Kershaw makes). Get it!
