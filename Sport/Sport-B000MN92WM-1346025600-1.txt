review/summary: It has even survived to two trips through the washing machine. I recommend to everyone.review/text: I've had mine 5 months and wouldn't be caught it without. The battery lasted 159 days or approximately 2 million steps. The machine screwed up the time on the last day but kept the step count history. The batteries were cheap on Amazon (just order before you need them). I set my goal as 12K daily steps after using it for a few days of use. I upload blood pressure and step count info into the Omron software. I've had no success with HealthVault. It would be nice if it recorded directly into the WIfi but I do not think that is important or worth spending $100.Pros:Love the clip- it has saved me from losing the device more than once.It resets at midnight so no need to hit the reset button.I did not have a problem following the directions to set the time.Even more important, it was easy to reset the time without instructions when changing the battery.Size is just right and very comfortable and I do not even feel it in my pocket.Not too small where I would forget to pick it up in the morning. I've only forgotten to use the machine twice which is very good for me.Lets me know that exactly how active I've been and when I need to take an extra walk in the evenings.Great on vacation where I found myself walking 26K steps a dayCons;Records very little when I ride my bike, even though I know I'm getting a good work out.
