review/summary: Car truck bike rack reviewreview/text: I am very pleased with this bike rack. It is quick and easy to attach and detach from my car (although, not sure how it compares to other bike racks in terms of user friendliness), and getting the bikes on and off is pretty easy too. It doesn't scratch or damage my car in any way, and it holds my bikes securely. As someone who's not a super hardcore biker, I think this bike rack is a good value for the price. With this bike rack, you don't have to worry about spending a few hundred bucks on a bike rack that you may only use a handful of times.
