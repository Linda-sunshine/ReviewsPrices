review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: Exactly what I needed. I use this only for water. It rarely needs washing or gets smelly. It has not leaked yet, even after tumbling around in my backpack all day. It also makes a nice percussion instrument when it is empty, and it is a good blunt object whether it's full or empty.
