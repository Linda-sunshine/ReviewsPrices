review/summary: My Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Cast Iron 5-Quart Dutch Oven Comboreview/text: I am thrilled with my Lodge Pre-Seasoned Cast Iron Combo Cooker! The package arrived very quickly (as always) and I love the fine quality of the product! I'm replacing all of my Aluminum (Guardian Service) cookware with Lodge Pre-Seasoned Cast Iron, which is definately the best way to cook everything! Recently, I read some pretty scary online information about cooking with Aluminum and it didn't take long for me to make my decision! I hope more and more people will educate themselves about how cooking and storing food in old (vintage) aluminum has been proven to be a primary cause of developing Dementia and even Alzheimers! YIKES!! I plan to continue purchasing Lodge Logic Cast Iron cookware until I collect a nice set; I can hardly believe the great prices, selection and the wonderful Customer Service at Amazon, far better than anywhere else! Oh! I also purchased an extra 10" Cast Iron lid in case I'm also cooking with the original lid which doubles as a 10" skillet; I love the versatality of this cookware! Shopping at Amazon.com is a totally positive experience in every way! Thankyou!Lodge LCC3 Logic Pre-Seasoned Combo Cooker
