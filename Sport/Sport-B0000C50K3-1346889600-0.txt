review/summary: Used in a Ruger 10/22, Made in Chinareview/text: I purchased this to clean my ruger 10/22 since it can only be cleaned from the muzzle end. I apply solvent, in this case Hoppes 9, let it sit for 5 minutes while I service the rest of the weapon then I run this bore snake through two times, then apply more solvent and run it through again twice.You take the brass weight and drop it through wherever you wish to clean, and pull the snake through.Good product, I wish it were US made, it is made in China.
