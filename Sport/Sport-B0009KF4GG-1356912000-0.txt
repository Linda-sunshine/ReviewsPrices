review/summary: Love itreview/text: Fit and finish are perfect. I'm actually surprised how thin the knife is. For some reason I thought it would be 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick. To me it looks like actually around 1 inch. As far has heft, it's actually pretty light. I can see myself carrying this thing as my go to EDC from here on out.The two blades (small and big one) were sharp but not amazingly sharp. A few passes on my ceramic sharpening rods and it cuts paper slivers with ease. The scissors are sharp out of the box. They cut the cardboard that the box was made of with ease. Small cuts but easy cuts nonetheless.Spring tension seems good. The knife actually needs quite a bit of force to close. If you practice sound knifeman-ship you won't have to worry about the knife closing on your hand.
