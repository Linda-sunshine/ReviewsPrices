review/summary: Gaiam Balance Ball Chairreview/text: I bought this on a lark but it sure did help me to keep my bad back streight. If you are sitting for hrs on end at a computer then this is for you. You learn good balance too. I enjoyed using it but my office is small with 2 large desks an requires 2 chairs. This took up too much space in this tiny room along with the other desk chair so I had to sell it. But had I had more room I would still have it. It looks silly but its fun to use. If ya want a chair thats different an comfortble this is for you. TAke the ball off an you have an exercise ball! Syl in Texas
