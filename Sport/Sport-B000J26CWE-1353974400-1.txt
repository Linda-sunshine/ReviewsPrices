review/summary: I love my toe socksreview/text: These are the most comfortable socks I own. I originally bought them to use them with my Vibrams, which they are perfect for. But I also tried them in my regular golf shoes. Man that was a great idea. My toes feel better now that they aren't sweaty and touching each other. My feet just feel fresher.
