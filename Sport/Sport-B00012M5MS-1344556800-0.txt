review/summary: Great looking bike helmet.review/text: This is a highly adjustable bike helmet that would fit almost any size head! The only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars is that the plastic panels that cover the helmet were pretty loosly glued on and on was actually sitting in the bag when it arrived, however this is a very minimal problem as i had it super glued in a couple of minutes however i was expecting it to be a little bit better than that! Also getting the helmet snug on your head is pretty easy but getting it tighter is pretty uncomfortable as the adjuster at the back feels like its digging into my head a little but i could easily fix that and am not too worried at the moment. Overall great helmet for the price, a pretty impressive product! Would recommend of you're on a tight budget or just want to save some money.
