review/summary: Works great!!!!review/text: I chose this model because my parents both have one through my dad's workplace. Theirs has lasted for two years now, and other than the clip (which is plastic) snapping after about a year, it has held up great! I also had a problem with the strap/clip within a couple week, but I usually wore it on my belt so it got bumped a lot! If you get this, I would recommend getting the additional strap with the metal clip.However, since using this item I have been able to monitor my exercise levels, and have already lost weight. I use both the step counting function as well as the calorie counter, and use the free online program MyFitnessPal to monitor my calorie intake.Very Satisfied with it do far. :)
