review/summary: Efficient, Effective, Quick & Compact. Any Questions?review/text: I never liked using cleaning rods for fear of damaging the muzzle. BoreSnakes are a terrific solution, and easy to fit in a crowded range bag. One pass with solvent, another with gun oil after each firing session keeps the barrel (and muzzle) pristine.
