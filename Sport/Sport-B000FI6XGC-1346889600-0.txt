review/summary: First time I was technically challenged by a pumpreview/text: This is a neat little pump, but honestly it took a little getting used to. First, it's tiny. That is almost a negative, as you pump, well, it sort of looks, wierd. I was surprised though that for as small a stroke as it has, it seemed to fill the tire pretty quickly.There are no instructions, but the packaging does show a diagram of how to extract the parts and reverse for a shrader valve that's common on average consumer bikes. After sitting with it two times, I finally realized that my mistakes where that I didn't push the valve far enough into the pump, and that I had confused the 'locked' and 'unlocked' position of the valve lock. Once I pushed the valve in very firmly, and lifted the lever up to lock it, I noticed that the pump was filling the tire.Ergonomically it's styled for bikes with thin frames. I have an oddball bike that has a wider frame where I mounted it with a water bottle holder. It sits ok and holds alright, but would probably look and fit nicer on a typical thin frame.I would give it 5 stars if it didn't take me two sittings to figure out how to use it.
