review/summary: comfortablereview/text: I just received and assembled the chair. Like another review, the ball seems way too small, but I am taking the manufacturer's recommendation to inflate as the ball expands. Hopefully it will, as it is currently VERY low to the ground and I have to bend my legs back to sit (I am 5'10").On the bright side, I switched from my regular desk chair (my bf constantly complained about it - that it hurt his back. The only issue I had was slouching. I think both of these issues are from towering over the desk) and have been sitting in this one for 15 minutes. It is very comfortable and definitely forces me to sit up straight (which might be bc I am so short at my desk now!)I have given 3 stars based on the current size of the ball. I will alter my rating/comment in a week or two.
