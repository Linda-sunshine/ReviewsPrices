review/summary: Just as Described!review/text: These came quickly, new in box with all materials. The glasses look like the picture that is posted here, so that's good. The lenses are just dark enough. It's evident in the photo that they are not dark lenses, but they are not clear either. You do not see straight through them when you look in the mirror. They are a gradient lens, so they are darker at the top than the bottom. These offer a very comfortable fit as would be expected of the RB2140.
