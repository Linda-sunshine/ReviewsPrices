review/summary: Life-Changing Workoutreview/text: I never knew how to workout, I only knew how to run until I did P90X with a friend. I had always heard about how INTENSE it was and figured that I could never do it because I had never worked out in my life. I found that I could not only survive, but thrive. I lost 10 pounds and gained a lot of muscle tone. P90X has revolutionized my understanding of exercise, dieting, and standard of living. Anyone who is in good enough shape to exercise can do P90X and I hope many choose to do so.
