review/summary: Coleman Road Trip Grillreview/text: Item came on time and was well packaged. Upon opening, this product was in a small compact state that was easily assembled. It lights with ease and reaches full heat within minutes. It cleans like new after each use and cooks like no other portable grill I have seen or purchased. For the price this grill cannot be beat...
