review/summary: Hardware not the correct size.review/text: This would be a great product, if the screws fit properly. The long screw that actually mounts the unit to the bike was fine. But there are two shorter screws that assemble two arms to the mirror. These shorter screws were EXTREMELY tight. In getting these to go in all the way the unit cracked. I was still able to finish the assembly, but now with a cracked unit. So if this had the right sized screws for assembly it would have been great.
