review/summary: Great bike rack, easy to usereview/text: I purchased this to transport my bike with the car. It works as intended and is very easy to install and remove. It handles the bike without issue. I have, on occasion, carpooled with two bikes on the rack. It's a little sketchy with two bikes on the rack, but has held steady and secure. I can see the bikes bouncing a little on big bumps when two bikes are on the rack.Overall, does what it should and is easy to use. If you were always going to haul more than one bike, you might want to find something a little sturdier, but it does work and work well.
