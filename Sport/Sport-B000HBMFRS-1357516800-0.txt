review/summary: Perfect Air Bed!review/text: After looking through reviews, we added this to our wedding registry and ended up using it for a week as a temporary bed while we moved. We couldn't be happier. For an air bed, it was pretty comfortable, the sheets stayed on the bed, and it stayed inflated each night. While we used it a week, we probably added extra air 1-2 times, and mostly because we prefer a firmer bed. You could have continued sleeping on it all week without refilling. Really like the built-in electric pump feature, as well as the built in cord storage. And we were able to fit in back into the provided storage bag! I highly recommend this air bed!
