review/summary: effective, comfortable and affordablereview/text: These are the best earmuffs I've tried for the price. I use them in an office to block the distracting conversations and chatter of my office mates. They help put me in my own little world where I can concentrate. They also work great while vacuuming and while grinding metal.Ear muffs aren't magic. They are plastic cups filled with foam and a rubber seal to fit your head. Most brands I have tried work about as well as any other. This model might work a little better than most, but it's hard to tell. I like this model because they are comfortable and cheap.
