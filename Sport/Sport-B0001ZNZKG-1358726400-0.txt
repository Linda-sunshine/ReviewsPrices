review/summary: Simply the bestreview/text: If you're in doubt because of the price, try them. Once you give these a try you'll never wear anything else. Expensive but worth it. I now have six pairs. Very durable and well made, yet stretchy and soft at the same time. I took three pairs on a two week trip and washed them in the sink and hung them to dry in the shower. Three is plenty, two would be fine. It took a full day to dry one pair in the humid Florida air so I'm glad I had three.If you have any problems chafing or getting road rash from running these are a great solution. I have tried so many different brands. These offer the best protection for active people. I get burns on my inner thighs at the top from running or walking 54 holes of golf on a weekend. I can wear out a pair of cotton jockeys boxer briefs in one or two days worth of wear cycles. Not these. They are extremely protective and don't show any wear after almost one year and many miles on the first pair. Because They are stretchy and fit your form well without sagging, they stay in place. I have had other athletic undershorts that did, too. The difference is that they were tight and compressive. I had to constanly adjust and tug to stay comfortable. The ex officio brand doesn't give me any issues with that. I always wear xl, but tried larges for golf. That fit just as we'll because the fabric is forgiving. I can kneel down and read putts and not have to stand up, pull up and rearrange my belt line with these.I'm a big athletic guy with a baseball player rear end. I have done a lot of squats over the years so my thighs are touching. I will tell you this. When your thighs rub together and get a rash so bad that it burns to move for a week or so each time... You skip golf or jogging until you recover. So, you spend a lot of time and effort looking for a product like this so you can stay active. This is that product. Amazon has the best price, too.
