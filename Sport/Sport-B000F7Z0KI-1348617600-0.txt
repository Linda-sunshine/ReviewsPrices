review/summary: Bad bottle if you like to take big gulpsreview/text: This bottle is great at keeping your beverage cool. However, if you're like me and you take big heaping gulps of water whenever you drink from it, you'll find yourself running into the "vacuum problem". The nozzle is an old-school pull top so it doesn't have an outlet for vacuum pressure that builds whenever water is being drawn out quickly.If you're a big gulper, the Camelbak Podium Big Chill is a better choice (I own it also). Otherwise, this bottle works fine.
