review/summary: Made to last, I don&#8217;t want to take them off!review/text: Cant say enough about how much I like these gloves. I use them for justabout everything. Once I broke them In I didnt want to take them off. Theirperfect at the range handling ammo, loading, and making scope adjustments.I can also use my phone touch screen. I take them everywhere I go and theirmade to last. The neoprene is tough and the stitching is tight. You cant beatthe price. You cant beat the product.
