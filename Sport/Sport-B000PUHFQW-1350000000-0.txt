review/summary: Weird slippery substance on the mat!review/text: I read the reviews that said this was a slippery mat. Having never purchased a new yoga mat I wasn't quite sure what they meant by all the slipping. They were right. I went to my yoga class sporting my super cute mat only to slip and slide in almost every position. My hands felt like a sticky slippery substance was on them, almost like they were sweating (which they never do). My old mat is old and worn and starting to fall apart, but oh how I LOVE it compared to this new one. Sigh...I will try washing it in the washer and use soap and water and everything else in hopes of getting this mat into usable condition.
