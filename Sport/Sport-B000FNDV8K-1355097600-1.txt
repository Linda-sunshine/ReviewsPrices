review/summary: Classic.review/text: I bought a few of these for my family. I think I still prefer the rally over this model since it gets rid of the scissors and adds a screwdriver instead. Still, there is a reason why this is a &#34;classic&#34;! You won't be disappointed with this small keychain knife. I would suggest adding an extra keyring so the knife sits flush with your keys. The one keyring it comes with will cause the knife to sit perpendicular to your keys, adding bulk.
