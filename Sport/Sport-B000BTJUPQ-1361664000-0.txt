review/summary: My kids love itreview/text: Got it for them as a Christmas present. Great starter bow. I have a nine year old who pulls it pretty well, my five year old needs a little bit of help though. I stacked some hay bales in the backyard, spray painted a target on it and let them have at it. Great fun. It's constructed real well and has finger guides for new shooters.
