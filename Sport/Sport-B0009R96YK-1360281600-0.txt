review/summary: Best Mirrors out there.review/text: A few of bike shops in my area only carried these, because &#34;they are the best out there.&#34; They come in really handy when on bike, especially on the street. Without them I tend to swerve when I look back, which is dangerous. Fold mirror in when you store bike. I accidently dropped my bike and a piece of the mirror broke off. Good thing they sell replacements, although I'm too cheap to buy it.
