review/summary: Classicreview/text: I love Ray-Ban sunglasses. The aviator is no exception. It is just the right mix of timeless, chic, and sporty. Its heavy enough so that is doesn't feel like it'll fly off of your face but light enough so that it won't leave marks around the nose and cheeks. Thanks to Prime for the hasty delivery. You won't find a better deal for these sunglasses. I only wish you could choose the case.
