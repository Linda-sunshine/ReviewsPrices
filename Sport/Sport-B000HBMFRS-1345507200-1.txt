review/summary: Awesome air mattressreview/text: I am so impressed with this product. I have recommended it to lots of friends who have purchased it and enjoyed it as much as I have. The built in pump feature is great. It holds air. It is a good height from the ground. I learned, after having and using the product for a few months, that you can reverse the pump to push the air out. This makes the bed super flat and deflated, as one might imagine, and then really easy to stow away. This is really a remarkable product.
