review/summary: Great for stationary use, bad for bikingreview/text: Pros:-Great capacity (24 oz model) Can hold a whole tray of ice cubes with room for water-Great insulation. Still ice cubes left after 2+ hours on bike and 4+ hours sitting still-Looks nice and many design choicesCons:-Tough to open and close valve. Good for no leaks, but a pain to open/close with mouth while on a bike.-Tough to squeeze, especially from the top (where bikers grab/hold water bottles).-Dimples on the inside wall. Mold/mildew haven if bottle is not kept clean/dry when not in use.Overall, I love this water bottle for everything except cycling. I use it at work and at home more than anything else because it insulates so well and doesn't create condensation on the outside. I find it bad for use while cycling. I like to grab my bottle, hydrate, and put it back in one quick motion without having to re position the bottle in my hand or use two hands. That is hard to do with this bottle. The valve is hard to open and close, and I have had it pinch my lip a few times while closing it. The top is hard to squeeze so I have to re adjust my hand on it while cycling. It becomes a very 'clunky' maneuver while trying to ride one handed. I much prefer my camelbak podium bottles while on the bike.
