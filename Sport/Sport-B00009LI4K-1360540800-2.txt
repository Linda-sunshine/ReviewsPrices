review/summary: I bought these for young childrenreview/text: Purpose of this purchase was for monster truck shows.I bough four pairs two different types of ear protecion earmuffs.3M Peltor H10A Optime 105 Earmuff, 105 dBA3M Peltor Optime 105 Behind-the-Head Earmuff with Neckband (H10B)This what I can tell you:3M Peltor H10A Optime 105 Earmuff, 105 dBA - it fits my kids that are 5 and 7 very comfortably, it probably would fit me as well - I have a smaller head - I probably liked that one better for myself because of padded headband.3M Peltor Optime 105 Behind-the-Head Earmuff with Neckband (H10B) - this one was great for my husband who has larger head.All of us were happy to have ear protection.Seems like a good quality earmuffs - it will last for a long time - great price for both types.
