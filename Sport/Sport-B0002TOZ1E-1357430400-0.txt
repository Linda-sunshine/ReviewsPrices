review/summary: Almost Perfectreview/text: I'm a farmer and a walker. I buy Gold Toe socks almost exclusively. The other brands appear to just disintegrate after a bit....but the Gold Toe socks hold up. Their price premium is well earned.I gave these socks 4 stars because 4.6 stars was not an option. They are absolutely perfect except that the socks have too much elastic in them and therefore fit a bit tight IMO. Specifically, the foot is okay, but the portion of the sock that fits around my leg (above the ankle) seems tight - especially the band at the top of the sock. And not I'm not overweight or muscle bound.Please note, I've not washed them yet and a few turns in the washing machine and dryer may yield a more relaxed fit. Previous pairs I've owned were solid 5s!
