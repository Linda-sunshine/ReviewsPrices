review/summary: affordable and attractive solution for trapping cat litterreview/text: I cannot speak to the utility of this mat for practicing yoga, as I got it to go under the litter box in our bathroom. The waffle texture helps trap litter, yet is easy enough to clean with a hand broom every night. It's reasonably cushy and the cats don't mind walking on it. It feels squishier than my Gaiam yoga mat.I chose this brand because it came in a brown color to go with our cherry cabinets. It's a nice chocolate brown, but very plain. The mat is long enough to cut about 3 or 4 mats from, so will serve us for a couple years as messes eventually occur.when I unrolled it fresh from the box, there was a somewhat strong plastic/chemical smell, which rapidly dissipated. I didn't mind, but might not like it if I had my face to the may doing yoga poses.
