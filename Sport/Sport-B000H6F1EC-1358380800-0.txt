review/summary: Very tight, awkward fit--poor quality--ripping at seams after first use (happened with 2 pair)review/text: I agree with the other reviews to buy a size larger.They have an awkward cut to them. They are very tight around the hips which, to me, defeats the point of buying sweatpants. These are not comfortable to wear and have no stretch to them.I have other pair of Russell sweats that are 3XL and fit me fine which is why I went ahead and made this purchase. It appears that the sizing has changed and they are of lesser quality so if you're buying these based on previous Russell purchases, I wouldn't recommend these. They have downgraded in quality big time.I do not recommend these whatsoever.UPDATE:These are the most poorly made sweats I've ever worn. The stitching is very weak. 2 pair of them had the exact same issue of the seam at the crotch developing a hole in them after the first wear with light use only.I have Joe Boxer sweatpants that I have had for 8 years and they have yet to rip, tear, or have any other defect in workmanship. Besides the fading of the black fabric, the sweats are still in very good condition. Compare that to the Russell sweats that I paid 3x more for than the Joe Boxers.
