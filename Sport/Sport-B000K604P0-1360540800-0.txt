review/summary: Absolutely Perfectreview/text: I read many of the reviews before making my purchase of the Thermos Nissan bottle. I figured it was worth a shot, due to the positive side of things, and boy am I glad I did. I heat the bottle with hot tap water while I'm brewing my coffee, and make sure to not fill coffee (or tea, or whatever) up past the line on the inside. Before putting on the lid, I wipe off the inside and outside at the top to make sure there's no liquid in the way. Screw on the lid and I'm good to go for hours. I mean HOURS, of hot beverage. Even after 3-4 hours, it's still as hot as when it went in. I can't speak to how long this magnificence will last, but for now... I'm pleased as punch!
