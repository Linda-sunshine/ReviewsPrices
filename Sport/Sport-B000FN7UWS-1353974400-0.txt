review/summary: After nearly 3 years of use, its my favorite bottle ever!review/text: I bought this bottle almost 3 years ago, when I first found out about the BPA scare and decided to toss my plastic nalgene. This thing is big, sturdy, and awesome! It's made of stainless steel, so it cleans effectively, it resists most drops (I've dropped it many times with only a few little dings), and holds a lot of fluids. Everyone knows me by it because I carry it around everywhere. Plus I got the big bold red one, so it's also hard to lose it. Overall I highly recommend this bottle.
