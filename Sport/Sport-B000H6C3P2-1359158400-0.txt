review/summary: Most comfortable for my hands.review/text: The rubber on this is the perfect softness to enhance grip without rubbing your skin raw. The finger grooves fit most hands nicely, and the width fits my somewhat large hands perfectly. Most people prefer the Hogue, Magpul MOE, or Tango Down. Almost everyone likes the feel of all three, but will love one more than the rest. This one has the right shape and grip angle for me, and I use it on all my AR's and my military M4. This is one of the easiest, and most rewarding AR upgrades.
