review/summary: Sturdy!review/text: I have never reviewed a product before but I just had to review this great pedometer. Not only was it easy to set up - a key factor for me - but it works great too. Most importantly, it is so sturdy that it came out of an hour in the washing machine and 40 minutes on high heat in the dryer working perfectly! That's pretty amazing as far as I'm concerned and it even counted an extra 2109 steps for me (presumably one step for each rotation!).
