review/summary: Would NOT recommend for vinyasa, power, bikram yoga.review/text: I got the seafoam color. Very soothing. Ended up not being too useful for my practice. It had too much cushion so I wasn't as stable in my poses. Not to mention how slippery it got when I started sweating.Would NOT recommend for vinyasa, power, bikram yoga.
