review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: FOR THE NAME BRAND AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT, I EXPECTED A QUALITY PRODUCT. THIS PEDOMETER HAS REQUIRED SEVERAL NEW BATTERIES AND CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM. TOOK IT OUT OF MY POCKET YESTERDAY AFTER WALKING AT LEAST 2 - 3 MILES AND IT TOLD ME I HAD 713 STEPS!! VERY DISAPPOINTED AND I CANNOT RETURN IT AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT LAST YEAR FOR MY HUSBAND.
