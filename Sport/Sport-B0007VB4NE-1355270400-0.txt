review/summary: Has helpedreview/text: I use this as my main office chair now. It's been about a month. I like that:- It's nice and high to reach my counter (tall enough - I wasn't sure from the picture)- It set up quickly and easily- It is comfortable enough to sit on for long periods of time, but not so comfortable that I don't notice how long I've been sitting. Basically, it reminds me to get on my feet and to stay on them more often since I am more aware of my sitting. I have aFitbit One Wireless Activity Plus Sleep Tracker, Burgundyand my steps have gone up a lot since I got this, from about 6-8 thousand a day at work to 12k or so. It keeps me from being lazy and settling in on my office chair for hours and hours without even really noticing that I haven't gotten up for a long time.- It helps with my posture a TON- I didn't find that I needed to "break it in" at all, I just went right to using it full time- I like the black color because it's subtle and doesn't look as much like an exercise chairI'd say that the rolling is not very smooth but that's not a big deal to me.I keep my main office chair nearby in case I ever do need to do something for like 6 hours straight where I'm sitting and want to just be comfortable and lazy. This chair is almost more...formal. You sit really straight and you're aware of how you sit so, if you're like me, you'll simply sit less.
