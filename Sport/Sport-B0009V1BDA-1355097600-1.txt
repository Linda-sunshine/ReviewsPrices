review/summary: Not sure what why for some bad reviewsreview/text: I love this grill. Seer marks are beautiful and flavor is great. I use it for traveling and for my grill at home. Do listen to people when they say never use the high setting. Treat the medium setting as high and go from there. I never grill with my lid down and I find everything grills just fine.
