review/summary: Comfy Earmuffsreview/text: I bought these to go shooting at the range and they work great. They protect your hearing and are comfy while doing it. Even with glasses and goggles they provided a great seal and felt comfy. The only issue is that ears can get really hot after a while, but that is the nature of earmuffs isn't it?
