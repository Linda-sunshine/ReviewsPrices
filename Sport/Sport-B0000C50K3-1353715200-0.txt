review/summary: BoreSnake works well and does save a lot of timereview/text: The BoreSnake makes cleaning a much faster task, and that's a good thing especially when not at home with my work bench and gear. The 'Snake goes in my range bag and heads out on trips with me to be the primary cleaner when away from home.I used this first on .223/5.56 AR-15 and must say that it was an extremely tight fit - so much so that I was worried about damage to the chrome lined barrel. After reading more on the 'net I put a ton more gun oil on and that helped a lot. Still have to give it a very strong pull through the barrel, but it seems to do a very good job.Still give my firearms a good rod & patch cleaning at home every once in a while, but the 'Snake will do in between those times.
