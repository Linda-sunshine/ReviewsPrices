review/summary: Pretty close....review/text: I ordered these on the advice of the reviewers who were 5'10" and said they were long enough. They will be when I let the hem all the way out! I'll just wear them that way way rather than have them too short. I do have a shopping tip for the tall ladies: go to Alloy Apparel Dot Com. They carry up to 37" inseams on most, if not all, of their jeans! They're really cute, lots of choices and loooooooonnngggg.
