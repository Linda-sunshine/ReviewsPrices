review/summary: Years of Use:review/text: Use at annual beach party by all guests and annual block party. Bought propane tank adapter to hook up my full size propane tank, no need to worry about guests wasting propane or running out of propane. Hamburgers, steaks, sausages, chicken, water for cocoa or coffee, etc ALL have cooked perfectly with this. The beauty is no sand from the beach and no bending over to cook. I have had mine for so many years. The only thing is the lock lever in front does not work when you try rolling it someplace. Could be assembled wrong?
