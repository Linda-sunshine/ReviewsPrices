review/summary: Good watch for the price - but NOT a Rolex look-a-likereview/text: I'm happy with the purchase. The watch is solidly built (this was my first Invicta) and feels solid on your wrist. It is really the perfect appearance for someone who wants to combine the gold and silver look without making it look....weird. It's the right combination of colors. Do note, the gold is a deeper, darker gold than the picture on here makes it appear. Not a bad thing, but just more one of personal preference. The gold is bold, whereas I think this picture makes it look like a softer gold. I personally wish it was more like the picture, but I'll leave that up to you.Now, one thing I've read a lot on these is that &#34;people mistake it for a Rolex!&#34; Either this is simply not true, or the people that are saying that to you have never seen a Rolex. First off, to the left of the face reads 'INVICTA' in HUGE letters visible to anyone who sees your watch. This, to me, is tacky. Second, the face does not nearly have the glow of a Rolex finish, nor is the casing or glass any sort of pearl or anything equivalent.Again, I like the watch - but if you think you're getting a cheaper alternative to a Rolex, don't be fooled. This is definetely not a Rolex. There's a reason it's several thousand dollars cheaper than one.
