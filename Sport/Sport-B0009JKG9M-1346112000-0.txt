review/summary: Love it, love it!review/text: If you are new to cast iron cooking, it does take some getting used to. But I've been using these for a month now, and this set is almost the only thing I need in the kitchen. Want to fry up some green tomatoes? It will do that! Want to make a rice dish? It will do that! How about some gumbo? Burgers? Want to bake cornbread in the oven? It will do that too! And marvelously! Its seriously the best piece of cookware I ever owned, and I'm buying some for my sister for her wedding gift too!
