review/summary: Loved it.....while it workedreview/text: I found this to be a great motivational tool. Easy to use, easy to read, and seemed fairly accurate. However, having only owned it for 4 months now, the step counter frequently locks up. It literally misses hundreds of steps. It has never been dropped or mishandled. It was nice while it worked. It's just an aggravating piece of garbage now.
