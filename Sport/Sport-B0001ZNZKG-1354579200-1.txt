review/summary: Do you like granny panties?review/text: After seeing this around for a while and reading rave reviews I decided to give these a try. They were most definitely not worth it. I wear boxer briefs to prevent from chafing, but these sit so high above the waist that they're useless for that purpose. Plus they make you look like you're wearing you granny's underwear. Not cool, Ex Officio. Not cool.1/5 on comfort1/5 on function1/5 on styleDon't waste your money.
