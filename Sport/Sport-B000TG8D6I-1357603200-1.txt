review/summary: Tony gets it-review/text: Whoa- this is perfect when I'm not in the mood or the weather doesnt permit me to get to the gym. I don't use mine as a 90 day routine but I imagine if I did I wouldn't be here looking at these few extra holiday lbs. It's definitely a hard-core-feel good about yourself workout. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great total body workout..
