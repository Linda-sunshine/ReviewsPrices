review/summary: Works on induction stove!review/text: I LOVE LOVE LOVE cast iron pans. I got this pot, and found out that cast iron can be used on induction stoves! We have a induction stove (a Mr. Sunpenton), which is square shaped (the as seen on tv nuwave induction stovetop) that we use when we want to cook on tabletop. And this pan can be used on it! Great for sukiyakii, quick stirfried dishes too. Love cast iron pans.
