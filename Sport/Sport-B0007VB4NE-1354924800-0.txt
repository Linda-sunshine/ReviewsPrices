review/summary: It's okayreview/text: The assembly was really simple. The material used is not that steady. I found that the ball is very firm even if you deflate some air. Also, it gets very cold. I kept the towel over it to prevent the heat loss from my body. When you seat in the ball at first it appears to be very comfortable but after few hours you really need to work on it to make sure your posture is correct. Seating in the chair for prolong time will make your bottom muscle to get stiff and it will force you to get up every few hours. Seating in the office for 8 hours straight with really uncomfortable office chair made my posture really bad. I was constantly slouching. It was really hard at first to find the right position but once I got used to, it really help to correct my posture. Also, I paid more attention to the way I seat in any other chair.
