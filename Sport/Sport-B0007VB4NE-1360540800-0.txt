review/summary: Disappointingreview/text: We are both in our 80s and my wife has used inflatble exercise balls for years. We also exercise regularly at a local community center. When we saw this promoted on the Instapundit Blog with some favorable comments we thought it might be very usefull for her at the computer and her knitting and sewing machines. She is barely 5' tall and it proved to be much too low for these purposes. We replaced the ball with a much larger one. I can use it at the computer but it still too low for her.We are now undecided if we should keep it for my occassonal use, donate it to a local thrift store or try to sell in on Craig's list.
