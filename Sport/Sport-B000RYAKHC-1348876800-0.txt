review/summary: Very Bright!review/text: This light is easy to see in either blink of steady-on mode. In blink mode, it is easily seen from 100-150 during daylight and 350-450 feet away at night in suburban street lighting. A good buy and easy to install. Align the beam over your back tire at night and have someone hold the bike in an upright position to aid in aiming.
