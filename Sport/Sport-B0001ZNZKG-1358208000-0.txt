review/summary: Another boxer brief that runs small for an Asian guy.review/text: I've been having a lot of issues with boxer briefs that ride up and I've been on a non-stop quest to find the perfect underwear. Unfortunately these underwear feels like a medium even though I ordered a small. They are the most comfortable piece of clothing I have ever worn. But since the fit felt too big for me, the boxer briefs ride up easily and it makes my underwear saggy.
