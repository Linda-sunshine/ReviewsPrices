review/summary: Can't wait to use itreview/text: I placed this pillow in medium, bramble design, on my birthday list. I opened it up and was quite excited! When I first unrolled it, however, it was pretty lumpy and honestly a little unimpressive. I thought, well, it is a compressible pillow. I fluffed it and let it sit for a while, and it got better, and decided to wash it after reading the care tag.The care tag recommends washing and drying before using the first time, and that's 100% right!! VA-VOOM when I pulled it out of the washer, it was even plusher and more supportive than I expected. I love how it rolls into the little pouch that's attached, and the design is very cute. I can't wait to use it out camping.
