review/summary: So Goodreview/text: I love it I ordered this because my son didn't want to buy a skillet that was not seasoned naturally So I gave him mine of 45 years that ought to be seasoned enough.. Anyway I find no difference in my new store bought seasoned pot. I got it for my favorite chick roast receipe. I was the first things I made and it was great I recommed this to everyone PS the top is a great shallow skillet
