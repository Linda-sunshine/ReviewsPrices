review/summary: Doesn't Fit Trek IsoZone Handlebarreview/text: This looks like such a nice mirror, but sadly doesn't fit the Trek/Bontrager IsoZone handlebar found on the 7.3 Fx and other models (turns out the handlebar tube is not a circular hollow despite appearances). I learned a little late there's a special version of the mirror for the IsoZone; hopefully this review will help someone avoid buying the wrong model as I did.
