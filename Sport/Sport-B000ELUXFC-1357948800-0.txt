review/summary: Does the Trickreview/text: For the price, you can't complain too much. But this is a review so I'll complain. It only really fits men's bikes (the ones with straight bars, not the diagonal ones). I was able to fit a female bike crooked. The rack moves a lot when driving and the bikes would hit the car a lot. I have an old beat up rolla so I don't mind. But if you can afford a new car, I would recommend you buy a hitch rack. If you are like me and have a old beat up car and like biking, i recommend this baby.
