review/summary: Very Nice Fitting Glovesreview/text: These gloves are ideal for work and activity in all weather and of course shooting. They fit as tight and comfortable as, well, a glove! The palm and fingers are padded for non-slip and the neoprene fabrication is warm and high quality. Recommend.
