review/summary: Great viewreview/text: We just went on our first ride with these mirrors. Not only are they stable, but they give a big, clear view of what's behind you.After reading the reviews we thought we would give them a shot and am glad we did. Also they were easier to install than I expected, after some of the reviews. First one took less than 10 minutes. The second one took less than 3 minutes. Easiest thing - look at the picture and follow it. Probably also a big help that we have TREK bikes and the larger holder fit perfectly. Great mirror at a terrific price.
