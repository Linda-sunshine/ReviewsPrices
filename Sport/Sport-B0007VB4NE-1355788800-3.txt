review/summary: okayreview/text: for some reason my ball was a lot less thick (? not sure if that is the proper description) than the ones that i have seen my friends have so my ball was bigger when blown up and more malleable. Also the metal bar that goes in the front i guess to hold the bar in broke off a few months into use - but i found that i didn't really need it anyways.
