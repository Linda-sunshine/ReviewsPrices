review/summary: TERRIFIC Air Mattress!review/text: I inflated this air bed for a guest who reported how comfortable it was. The twin fitted sheet worked great and didn't slip around with the flannel surface. The installed inflation/deflation pump also worked great and was fast. My guest used the air bed for an entire week, and it never lost air or got soft. My only criticism is that the static on the rubber underside did pick up some loose dirt and dog hair that was on the hardwood floor where I placed the bed.
