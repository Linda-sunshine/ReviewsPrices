review/summary: Perfect if your game requires a lot of cards!review/text: After we attempted to play Munchkin with about a bazillion cards, we decided it was time for a shuffler. I looked around for a couple minutes on Amazon and saw this baby and knew it was the one! For only a little more, I could get one that did 6 decks! Awesome!!! Talk about making life a lot easier! And no more yelling at people for their bad job at shuffling! This works great! Only occasionally gets jammed, and when it does it's easy to fix. It's so much faster than manually shuffling, AND it's fun! I just hope it will last!
