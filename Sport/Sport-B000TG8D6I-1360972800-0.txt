review/summary: Quick Way To Burn Out!!!review/text: I started exercising and eating better two months ago and the first of February I thought I was ready for this, that was absolutely not true. My sister, who is in fantastic shape warned me to proceed at my own comfortable pace or else I would get burnt out and unmotivated. Truer words have never been spoken and this product killed me. I have this back on the shelf for a while until I work up past working out three days a week for 30 minutes. I have lost 17 pounds since Christmas and I am doing very well but I was 215 pounds and did absolutely no exercise. Now I am working out three days a week and this thing wants me to work out everyday for an hour, YA RIGHT. I am sure it is a great system, but do not try to get ahead of yourself. I will update in a few months when I try this again.
