review/summary: Nice size for childrenreview/text: The Klean Kanteen 12 oz. bottle fits perfectly in my children's lunch bags. At five years old, they can easily open and close the lid. The water stays fresh and cool. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because the water will spill. If the bottle is left on its side for too long, the water will end up all over the place. However, I was unable to find another stainless steel bottle that is spill proof. Overall I am satisfied with the bottle because the lunch bag has a packet inside that keeps it up. We only had one spill because my son forgot to place the bottle inside the lunch bag packet. If you purchase this bottle, make sure your lunch bag has a packet or elastic band to keep the bottle strait up. I would recommend this bottle to others.
