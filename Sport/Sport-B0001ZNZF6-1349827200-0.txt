review/summary: Has anyone ever experienced "post drip?"review/text: Underwear is supposed to be comfortable. But this pair is not. First, it doesn't have flat seams. An el cheapo Fruit of the Loom has flat seems that do not chafe. Why make the seams all rough and raised when there is technology to make it flat or simply use bigger piece fabric to lessen the number of seams? Second, the nylon fabric, which everyone is enamored with is, well, still nylon. It doesn't absorb. Underwear is designed to absorb, shall we say, "post drip" when there has not been enough "shaking" at the end of the urinal movement. In fact, unless you get that perfect amount of shake after the errr, "movement", you are bound to have perhaps 1 or 2 drip which should be absorbed by your underpants. That's why we wear underwear. In fact, this garment is so busy expelling any and all moisture that it doesn't protect you from possible accidents showing up on your pants (as if you needed Depends on something).I see that it washes out easy and dries quickly too. But any old nylon gym shorts that created huge amount of electricity on a dry cold day did the same thing back in high school.
