review/summary: Colorful exercise matreview/text: I loved that this mat was available in a wide variety of colors (I know it shouldn't be that big of a deal but I feel that I often see pastels and boring blues). I needed a mat to exercise on my hard floor and found that 1/4" thick may not be thick enough. With some exercises the mat has some weak points but overall, I'm happy with the buy.
