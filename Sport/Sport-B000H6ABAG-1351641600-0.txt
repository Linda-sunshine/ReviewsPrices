review/summary: Runs smallreview/text: The material is nice and my pants had same-color pockets (not white as previous reviews mentioned) but they are SMALL! I ordered the size I normally get in Russell and they are way too tight to wear out of the house. Too bad as these were supposed to be a replacement for my 100% cotton ones that have holes :(
