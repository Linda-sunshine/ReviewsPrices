review/summary: Not Durablereview/text: Great at first, but after a year's use no longer accurate, even after a battery change. It now gets stuck while counting steps and has to be jarred to continue. I admit it has been dropped a few times while running but was in its plastic case holder to protect it. If i had reviewed this product six months ago I would have given it five stars. Now i need to throw it away, like garbage.
