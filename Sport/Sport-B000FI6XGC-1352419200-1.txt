review/summary: Get the Road Master Blasterreview/text: Unless you have some reason for choosing a small pump,you should opt for the larger Topeak Road Master Blaster.It is a lot easier to pump your tires with a longer stroke pump.Very easy to reach over 100lbs with the Road model.There are 4 lengths.I recommend the longest one that will fit your frame.
