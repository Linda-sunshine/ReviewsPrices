review/summary: converse mens chuck all star solid shoesreview/text: my daughter is happy with the purchase. i had order in dec but received wrong size due men size instead of women size. it was my fault . the only complain it was that it took a long time from the time i sent it to get it replaced with correct size. that was my only complain it took a month to get it right. but is a cool sneaker and i did received correct one and my child is happy. yes i would recommend just when ordering make sure you click on the gender size (lol) if not you automactic received in male size.
