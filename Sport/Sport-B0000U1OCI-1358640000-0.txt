review/summary: Keeps on Truckinreview/text: I didn't know what to expect out of this or any pedometer but was curious enough to buy it. Have had it for almost two years and have not been disappointed yet with the workmanship. I wear it all day and my husband and I walk together and never leave home without it. I like the features it provides and the best feature of all is that it is still working well today. Worth the purchase.
