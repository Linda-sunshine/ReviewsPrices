review/summary: Great little pillowreview/text: We used this pillow when we went camping and once you have washed it and put it in the dryer it definitely fluffs up and is great. We would have given it 5 stars but once the pillow is all fluffed up you don't want to pack it down for transport which kind of defeats the purpose of it being compressible.All that said, it served its purpose well and we would recommend it to others.
