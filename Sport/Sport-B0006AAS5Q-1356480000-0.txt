review/summary: Nice Package - Nice Looking Watch, not the best quality.review/text: Just after peeling all of the plastic off the watch the front bezel fell off. I took it to a jewlery store and they were suprised and I will be asking Amazon for a replacement. If the next one is defective I will be looking at other brands.
