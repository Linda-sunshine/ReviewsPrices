review/summary: Decent jump rope if you use it right.review/text: Pretty good jump rope, would recommend people to buy it.PROS/Likes:-Generally good build quality, just needed something to jump rope with to do some boxing training.CONS/Dislikes:-You have to cut the cord in the handles in order to adjust the jump rope. Tying a knot or others will cause the jump rope to twist and you will not be able to jump rope effectively.Other Thoughts:Meh, its ok for the price
