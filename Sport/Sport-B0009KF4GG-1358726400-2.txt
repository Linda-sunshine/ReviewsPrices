review/summary: well, it's victorinoxreview/text: I got this for my father's bithday. I have one for my own too, and I love this knife. It's very usefull and compact and it is very sharp. You can feel the quality of the steel, no rust in mine and I wash it a lot. I carry it all day, every day. It's allways usefull having it around.
