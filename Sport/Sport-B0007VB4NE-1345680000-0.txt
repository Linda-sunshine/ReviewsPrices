review/summary: Buyer Beware!review/text: So disappointed in this item. I have used a balance ball and thought owning one for a chair would be awesome but there was a major flaw with my chair and I am returning it today. The bar which is suppose to hold the ball in place comes with 4 hex nuts and they do not fit on the bar. I sent an email to Gaiam for help several days ago and they have never answered my email, I also called them and they were not helpful just basically told me to try harder to get the nuts on the bar and neither my husband or I were able to get them to go on, they are too small to fit and I find it hard to believe that anyone could get them on the bar. My experience with this company is they don't care that there is a problem with the chair. Glad that Amazon is great with returns.
