review/summary: UPDATE: Hard to adjust? Look for the second set of clamps!review/text: UPDATE: I'd seen reviews that mention either how easy or how difficult this rope is to adjust. I think I've figured out why.There are two sets of clamps. One set is already pre-clamped, for those wishing to use the rope as-is lenghtwise. Those were the ones I was trying to adjust, but of course, they wouldn't budge. For those of us not 9 feet tall, another set of clamps are included. Mine were slid onto the rope as expected, but they were stuffed down inside the handles and, without me realizing it, slid up and down when I slid the handle up and down. I only noticed them when I shined a flashlight down into the end of the handle. I had to fiddle with it to get them to appear, but after that, adjusting it was a snap. I felt like a dope, though.Original review: I'm pleased by the quality of the product, but I haven't been able to use this product because the 'adjustable' clamps on the rope ends came pre-clamped. Seems this is a common issue with this rope, though.
