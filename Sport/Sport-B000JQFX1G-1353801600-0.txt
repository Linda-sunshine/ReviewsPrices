review/summary: Great bang for the buck!review/text: In the past, I owned the 8926a with the miyota movement and oyster bezel, and since gifted to my family. I missed the Invicta 8926 so much as a casual/dress watch, that I went ahead and ordered the OB version with the coin-edge bezel. I love the pro diver series, and this version came with a Seiko NH35A automatic movement. It works really well, and keeps very good time in comparison with a Swiss movement I have, which is the CL888. I recommend this timepiece for someone looking for a great watch without breaking the bank.
