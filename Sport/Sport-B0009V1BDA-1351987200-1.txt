review/summary: Love it!review/text: We take it camping and I don't find it hard to clean as previously stated. We are tent campers and usually our dish water is cold unless I take the time to heat it up over the fire. After the grill cools down I usually spray it with a little 409, wipe off what I can with a paper towel, then put it in my dish pan of soapy water. The rest comes off pretty easy. If you are tailgating you could spray it with the 409, tuck it in a garbage bag, and clean it at home. There could be a problem if you cook on it several times in a row without cleaning or don't do anything until you get home. It cooks great. We don't have the griddle attachment but are thinking of getting it. Happy camping/tailgating!
