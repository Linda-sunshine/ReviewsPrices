review/summary: Easy install on Colt LE6920 AR-15review/text: I love Hogue grips. This is a simple change you can make in under 10 minutes. I swapped out the hard plastic "stock" grip that came on my Colt LE6920 this evening without any trouble. All it took was a flat head screwdriver. If you have never done this before on an AR-15, pull up a quick tutorial video on Youtube. The main thing to know is that there is a spring (part of the safety mechanism) that you do not want to lose.
