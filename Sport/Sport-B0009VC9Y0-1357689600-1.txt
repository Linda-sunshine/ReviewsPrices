review/summary: Great gentleman's folder!review/text: I first saw this knife reviewed by Nutnfancy on YouTube and bought one shortly thereafter. I liked it so much, I bought my son one for Christmas last year. He loves his, too.Kershaw makes great knives and Ken Onion designs great knives. With this assisted opening knife, they've come up with another winner, made out of good steel and even has a blade lock that you can choose to use or not. I don't use mine and I've never had a problem with it coming open accidentally. But it's there if you want it and you can tighten it down so it doesn't move if you don't want to use it. Plus, this is a very good looking knife that's not out of place in dress clothes and won't leave a bulge in your pocket or weight you down.
