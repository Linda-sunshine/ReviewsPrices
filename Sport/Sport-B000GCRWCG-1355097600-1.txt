review/summary: Surprisingly Warmreview/text: I bought these (a pack of 10) because of years of reading ads about these 'Space Age' blankets, and the price was almost a give-away price.I did not expect much from these thin and somewhat flimsy 'blankets'. However, we were staying in a cabin at 7,000 feet (on the trip that I bought these for), and I was a little cold sitting in a chair and stargazing. I placed one of these over my lap, and was surprised when I had to loosen it up after only a few minutes. The heat retention is impressive.As mentioned by others, these are a little noisy and make a lot of crinkling noise. Definitely a must have for a cold weather emergency kit.
