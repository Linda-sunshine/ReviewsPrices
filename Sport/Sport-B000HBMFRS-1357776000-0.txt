review/summary: So Easy and Durablereview/text: I just moved to a new city and needed a temporary air mattress for myself and then for any guests who would be visiting. The mattress blew up in less than 5 minutes, has a built in pillow, and large enough for two people. I have yet to get an actual mattress so I've had this placed on my bed frame for a couple months and it hasn't deflated. I'm very impressed. The built in pump does need an outlet so if you're thinking of using this for camping just take that into consideration.
