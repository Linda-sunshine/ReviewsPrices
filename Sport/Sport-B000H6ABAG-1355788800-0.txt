review/summary: Smaller (waist) than some other sweatpantsreview/text: They do run smaller than other recent sweatpants I tried (like Champion and Jerzees). Those "Large" models fit me, but I'll have to get an X-Large in these Russell Athletic pants. I only briefly wore them to try them on, so I can't comment on durability.
