review/summary: Great giftreview/text: I found this to replace the one my mother had in her key ring years ago that TSA had taken and she loved it. The tweezers are always helpful to have nearby and it's perfectly compact and easy to carry on your keys (small and lightweight) but also gives you the peace of mind of having a Swiss army pocket knife in you. Great small gift for someone in college to keep on dorm or apartment keys or a lanyard.
