review/summary: Eh, okayreview/text: So, purchase a pair of these because I was sick of the 'Hanes' and 'Fruit of the Loom' pairs riding up, sweating through them, and loosing elastic so quickly. And these are an improvement over the 'typical underwear'. However, I did also purchase "Champion Elite Active Fit Boxer Brief 3 Pack No Ride up", and these fit and wear so much better. For the money, the Champion Elite is much better! The ExOfficio still 'rides up', and picking wedges is umcomfortable and embarrassing! Maybe a small would fit me better? Not sure, I am a 34 waist and the sizing guideline said to go with a medium. Not willing to drop another $20 to try the small....... The material feels nice - smooth and soft.Overall the Champion Elite are a better choice in my opinion, no ride up, and cheaper per pair.
