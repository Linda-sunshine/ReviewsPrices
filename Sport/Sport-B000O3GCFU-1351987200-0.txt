review/summary: Perfect for workreview/text: I got this container because I work out of my car and needed something so I could stop eating fast food everyday. It has performed far better than I expected. It claims that it keeps food hot for up to 5 hours. One day, I was unable to eat for over 8 hours, and while the food was certainly not as hot as it was in the morning, it was still warm enough for my satisfaction. I have not tried it with cold foods yet, but am confident that it would perform well. Also, it is dishwasher safe, an added bonus.
