review/summary: Condensation Is Annoyingreview/text: I've had a Camelbak bottle in the past. It was nice. Then I lost it.I bought another as a replacement. I put in ice, put in water... and bam. It was like there was a craft it was leaking so bad. My mother's bottle did the same though, and we realized it was condensation. It was really annoying, as we wanted to use it immediately. It got so bad we had to put a paper towel and foil around it.Everything else was great. The bite valves were perfect. The tab to pull the valve up was plastic - making it easy to do so. It was durable. It had no taste or odor. Great. All of it was great. Except if left alone with water and ice, there'd be a puddle a good six inches under it within an hour.In the end I had to return it. And that in itself was a joke. The company that sold it to me had clear instructions how to return, then sent me the bottle back two weeks later, soaking wet, with a note saying no returns were accepted. They tried to refer me to Amazon, who said they didn't sell it and had no say.It was a joke. All for a bottle that couldn't hold anything but luke warm water. I finally had to purchase the insulated version, which is great. I just wish this had worked.
