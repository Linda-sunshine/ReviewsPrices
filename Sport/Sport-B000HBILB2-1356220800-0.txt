review/summary: This air mattress works great!review/text: This air mattress works great and is very sturdy as well! It has a quick acting blower on it that has worked flawlessly. The mattress airs up in just a couple minutes and has never had a leak what so ever.It comes with a spare patch and a storage bag. The stock storage bag is a bit small so a duffel bag is used to make sure the air mattress is not ripped trying to cram it into the stock storage bag. This air mattress is collapsed and stored every day and has never faulted once. I'm told it is quite comfy as well.The price on this was the best I could find on the internet for a twin air mattress with a self contained electrical air pump. If your looking for an air mattress, give this one a try. You won't be disappointed.
