review/summary: Best boxers I've ever ownedreview/text: I originally started wearing ExOfficio boxers for multi-day hiking treks, now I wear them all the time. Their comfort is unparalleled to anything I've worn. One hikes they wash easily in a stream or lake and dry quickly overnight. Two pair is all you need for a week.
