review/summary: Great Balance of Comfort & Conveniencereview/text: I used this on a trip for family of five. We had to stay in multiple hotel rooms built for 4 people. No one complained about sleeping on this. Most of all, it was durable and very easy to set up and take down because of the built-in pump.
