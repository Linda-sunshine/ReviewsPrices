review/summary: Stellar!review/text: I've been using Camelbak bottles for years now. I received my first one as a parting gift from a company I have had dealings with. Recently I bought a couple of them on Amazon.com and was extremely pleased with the purchase.I am a wheelchair user and find it difficult to carry water with me wherever I go. Cup holders are not an option because I have to transport my chair in cars and other vehicles. The loop handle fits perfectly on my brake handle. Portable water supply anywhere! What's more, I can tip one over near my computers and other electronic equipment without worrying about spilling on my big ticket electronics!
