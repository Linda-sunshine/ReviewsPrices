review/summary: very good!review/text: Once i placed my order i was kind of confused caused buying glasses online you never know what you're getting. But now i receied it i realized that was a good purchase. They fit perfect and i'm 5'6 tall i think 58 mm is the best size for most people in aviator. Very good i recommend this glasses. This are glasses for people who take really good care of their stuff.
