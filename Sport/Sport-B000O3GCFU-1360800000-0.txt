review/summary: Great!review/text: This is a great product. I was tired of sending lunchables for my kids. So now I send soup, spaghetti, etc and it is actually hot at noon. I have no problems with discoloration. I heat up the thermos with boiling water, then heat the food extra hot. Easy for my kids to open and doesn't spill in their lunch bag
