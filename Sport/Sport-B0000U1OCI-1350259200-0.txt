review/summary: Works greatreview/text: This pedometer works great. It's very easy to program. It seems to work consistently no matter where I clip it on. Whether it's clipped to my pocket, waistband, fanny pack belt, etc, the resulting total steps/miles from my routine walking route measure basically the same distance. I haven't noticed it counting distance from car vibrations. Maybe it depends on the car, shocks, etc.I recommend this product. It's worked well for me.
