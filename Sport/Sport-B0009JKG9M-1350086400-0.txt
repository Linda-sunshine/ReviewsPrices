review/summary: new Lodge compared to oldreview/text: As this is an old man's evaluation, I don't mean it to be negative of Lodge cast iron in general. this chicken cooker is heavier than one I bought 20 years ago. If I had a chance to do it over, I wouid buy a giddle pan to use in place of the combo cooker top. I have used new Lodge skillets and find them favorable to others now available. The quality of the chicken dinner I prepared in the combo cooker was right there with my old one, it's just a little harder on an old mans wrists.Lodge LCC3 Logic Pre-Seasoned Combo Cooker
