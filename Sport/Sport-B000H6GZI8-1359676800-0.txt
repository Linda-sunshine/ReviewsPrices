review/summary: Great product for PT709!review/text: Easy to install although some trimming was required for my Taurus PT709 Slim, the instructions were great and made it a breeze. I love the feel of the grip now and being that my gun is less than an inch thick, my trigger finger contacted the trigger on the second knuckle. With the grip sleeve installed my grip is spot on.
