review/summary: Emergency Preparedness in Small Packagereview/text: Ordered these planning for the end of the world- Since we all survived will update and post if something changes and have any need to actually use these. All joking aside- compact emergency blanket takes up next to no space and provides an extra level of security should we find ourselves in an unexpected situation. Keep them in your car/ with camping or hiking equipment/ even in your purse for the added peace of mind.
