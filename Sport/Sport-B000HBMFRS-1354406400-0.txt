review/summary: Very good for the moneyreview/text: When I was starting out in NYC just out of school, I slept on an air mattress for about 8 months. Fast forward 8 years, and I needed a mattress for a weeks while I was waiting for my bed. For only paying about $40, this air mattress is great. Very easy electrical pump, and it even has a little nook to contain the chord when not in use. I did notice it would lose a bit of air during the night, but again, at this price it's a great mattress.
