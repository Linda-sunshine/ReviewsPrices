review/summary: 50/50review/text: I purchased two of these mattresses and am sorry to say that only one of them works as advertised. One arrived defective out of the box and had a pinhole leak somewhere that we could not identify. When we tried it before a trip it looked to hold up just fine, but even without any weight on it it was deflated after about 2 hours.The return process occurred without an issue, and the second mattress is fantastic, but I would strongly strongly strongly recommend heavily testing this before your first "real" use. At a minimum try to blow it up and see what it looks like in the morning, if there is any sign of loss of air, return it right away.
