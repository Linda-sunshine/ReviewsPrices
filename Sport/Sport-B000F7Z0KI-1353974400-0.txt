review/summary: Hard bottlereview/text: Actually it looks bigger than it is, I also own camelbak one which are nice expect the smell. With this one there is no plastic smell yet but it is little hard to drink because you cannot squeeze the like a water bottle, they are quite rigid. Still looking for my perfect bottle, between this and camelbak one I prefer this one because of the plastic smell, otherwise camelback is a better design.
