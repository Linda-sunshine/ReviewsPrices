review/summary: Packaging was poorreview/text: Although the actual pedometer is fantastic (I have bought them before and highly rate their accuracy), this particular item arrived without any Omron packaging - it simply came stuffed in a small brown cardboard box with the shipping labels attached directly to it. This is not really a problem unless you are giving it as a gift - which I am - which means I need to somehow get all the shipping and custom labels off it to make it look presentable, or put it in another box - either way, it makes the item look second hand. In short, Dodgy Packaging
