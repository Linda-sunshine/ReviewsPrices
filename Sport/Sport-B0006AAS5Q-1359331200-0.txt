review/summary: Great everydayreview/text: I love this watch. I own several movados and one Rolex. This invicta is my everyday watch. It looks great feels great and keeps great time. I don't know why people leave such terrible reviews about this watch. I assume most people think they are getting a Rolex for 70$. I promise you after you spend the 8k for a Rolex you will not want to wear it everyday. A nice watch is expensive between 800$ and 1200$. When you get this watch understand you did not pay 800$ for it. However the weight and shine will make you think that you purchased a high end quality watch. You won't be timing race cars but you will be getting digits at the bar. Couple this "beater" with a nice button down white shirt, nice jeans and clean shoes and you can enter any place and get a few looks.
