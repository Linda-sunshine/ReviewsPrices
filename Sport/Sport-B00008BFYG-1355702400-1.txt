review/summary: The kids love itreview/text: This is a well built scooter, it can even handle my weight (150#), I love that the bar adjusts to the child's height, but it would've been nice if it came with a small allen wrench, I had to dig through my tools to find the right sized one. The back brake works well, and can pretty much stop on a dime. It collapses quickly without any tools. The price was significantly cheaper than other scooters and I was surprised that quality was not compromised. I'd highly recommend this scooter.
