review/summary: Impossible to do with-outreview/text: If you bake bread at very high temperatures, especially the Artisan method then this is indispensable. The vessel traps steam and prevents carmelization of the the loaf by allowing it to bake thoroughly before removing the top for final browning. I love it.
