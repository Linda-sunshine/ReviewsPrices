review/summary: My head must be too smallreview/text: I'm a 24 year old white male and these glasses were just too big for some reason. I really liked the field of vision these goggles offer, it's pretty awesome, you can see everything. However, they let water in and just were too bulky for my head I think. I really wish I could give them 5 stars, because they are so easy to adjust, and feel great on my head. Sadly, I am going to have to revert back to my old speedo goggles because they don't let water in. The speedos are much tighter around my head and create a lot of pressure. I easily get slight tension headaches with them. With the Kaiman's the tension was dispersed very evenly and I didn't get the really tense feeling even when I synched them down all the way. This pair of goggles is made for someone with a slightly bigger head. I wear 7 1/4 cap size, so my guess is if you're bigger than that you should be good.
