review/summary: It's a SERPA holster...review/text: SERPA holsters have always been held in high ranks in my opinion and they work great for most people. The only thing I wish Blackhawk would change is create a SERPA that has retention on the inside of the holster vs. the outside. Thus making it harder for someone else to get your gun away from you.
