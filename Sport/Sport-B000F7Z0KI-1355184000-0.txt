review/summary: Good water bottlereview/text: I gave this bottle only 4 stars because it's hard to clean. After a couple of months it started tasting bad because it wasn't fully clean, the different drinks I put in there were absorbed into the plastic which was really annoying. The one redeeming quality was that it kept my water cold and it felt right in my hand. It fit nicely into the side pocket on my backpack. I do recommend it despite the taste.
