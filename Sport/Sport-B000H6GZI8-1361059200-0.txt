review/summary: Excellent!review/text: With only a tiny bit of trimming from the bottom (with Exacto knife) the Handal Jr. was a great fit and nice addition to my Kel Tec P11. While it requires a good bit of tugging to put in place, once on the sleeve substantially improves the in-hand stability and comfort of the grip.
