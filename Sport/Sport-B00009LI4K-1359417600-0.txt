review/summary: 3M Peltor H10A Optime 105 Earmuff, 105 dBA -( initial impressions )review/text: Length:: 0:06 MinsNot sure if this cuts the db level by 105 as stated but dampening of outside noise while wearing the unit was good in my opinion . It provides a tight fit on your head and ears so I doubt the average person can wear this for extended periods unless the environment demands that you do .
