review/summary: HeatMax Hot Hands 2review/text: Item will heat up provided you allow air to flow around it. Once heated (about 20-30 minutes), if you place the packet in a glove or mitten that is leather or nylon vs wool, it will loose its heat and only be slightly warm within 5-10 minutes. When it happens to you, take the packet out and put it in a loose pocket and it will heat up again in another 5-10 minutes and you can put it in your glove again. Certainly beats having nothing at all but the glove when your going to be in the cold outdoors for awhile.
