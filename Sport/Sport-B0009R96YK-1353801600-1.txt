review/summary: Works on road bikes tooreview/text: Although it isn't mentioned in the product description, this mirror works great on road bikes too. The mount can be turned just about any way you want. On drop handlebars the mirror sticks out about 3-4" to the side allowing it to see around my midsection. I have to move my head a little to the side to see it when I'm on the brake hoods but when I'm on the drops or the center of the bars I have an unobstructed view. It even works when I'm down on my aerobars. It partially obstructs access to the drops and I knocked into it once or twice but I've learned not to do that now.Many years ago I bought a handlebar mirror but gave up on it because it slipped on every rough piece of road. The mount on this mirror is solid and it has never slipped even when I've ridden the worst roads. The wedge style mount is similar to how handlebar stems used to fit into steerer tubes ten years ago. It's easy to mount - remove plug, insert wedge, tighten with allen key.The mirror is almost flat so alignment is important. But once it's aligned it stays aligned. The flatter mirror means you can see stuff while it's still a long way back. I can see a car while it's still ten seconds or so behind me. This is crucial. I've used mirrors that were so convex you couldn't see cars until they were within a couple of seconds of passing you so they were pretty much worthless.One upgrade I would happily pay a couple of extra dollars for is the ability to easily swing the mirror to the inside of the handlebars so I can lean the bike up against a wall. With this mirror sticking out to the left I can only lean the right side of the bike against a wall. Looking at the mount, I think this would be fairly easy to do.
