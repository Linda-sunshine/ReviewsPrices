review/summary: A pocket-sized toolboxreview/text: I have carried Victoinox Swiss Army knives since I was a kid. This is larger than the models I've owned previously. I put this on my wish list and my wife and kids got this for me as a gift. I love it! Yes it is big, but not to big for me. Granted I am a big guy and it fits my hand and pocket just fine. What I love about these knives is that you always have them with you. While not as powerful as a "survival" knife, I dont have the room to carry a full "survival" knife with me at all times. I have helped people innumerable times because I had my Swiss Army knife. This is a great knife!
