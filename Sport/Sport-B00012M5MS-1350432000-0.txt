review/summary: Good helmet, great value!review/text: Overall, the helmet fits very well, has adequate adjustment and is fairly light. For the price, I am satisfied, but the helmet is a little bulky, somewhat heavy and the visor attachment system allows the visor connection points to disconnect. The visor never comes off, as the center mounts stay secure, but the outside mounting points pop out of the shell rather easily. Great helmet for beginning cyclists, but more experienced riders and those riding longer rides should look elsewhere for a more streamlined, lighter and cooler helmet.
