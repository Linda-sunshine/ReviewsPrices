review/summary: A very good grip.review/text: Installed this grip on a Bushmaster XM15 ES2 rifle. Installation was easy and the fit was perfect. Only minor issue was the depth of the hole drilled for the safety/selector spring. It's a little too deep so the safety isn't as crisp as it was with the factory grip. All in all, a nice inexpensive upgrade for your AR.
