review/summary: it just works - but fragile (update)review/text: Installation was easy and I was really surprised at how well I could see behind me. I had expected a lot more vibration- there is practically none. Tighten all the screws (there are 3) enough so that they are snug but you are able to move the arms for adjustments. Getting ready to order another for my wife's bike.UPDATE: So I liked the mirror much I put it on my wife's bike and ordered another one for mine. Opened the package and found a broken mirror lens. Amazon was great (as usual) about the return and sending a replacement. So I mount the mirror just snug enough so that it stays put but can be adjusted fairly easily, also figuring the flexibility would protect the lens if bumped. Well, I bumped the end of the mirror and the lens broke - in less than one day!! (No, I wasn't riding off-road.)Maybe I just had a run of bad luck, but a plain glass lens this big seems to be asking to break. Regardless, my original 5 stars is now only 2.
