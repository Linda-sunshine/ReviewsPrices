review/summary: Horrible smell! Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with built in pumpreview/text: The twin airbed inflates very well, it only lasts one night and then needs to be pumped up again. It did stay firm overnight, but lost air during the day. Good thing it is easy to do. I used this bed for ten days while on vacation. The plastic smell was (and still is) overwhelming. The room was air conditioned at night so the smell was not heat related. We did leave the windows open in the room during the day to make it bearable to sleep in there at night. Even with the door closed you could smell it in the rest of the house. I will try leaving it out on my deck for a few days to see if that helps.On the plus side, the bed was comfortable, pumps works well and very quickly. If it were not for the smell and the slow leak I would rate it higher.
