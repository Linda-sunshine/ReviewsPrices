review/summary: Works fine but makes noise that old one didn't.review/text: Got this to replace similar one I paid $50 for a while ago. My old one lasted about 2 years. This one works fine but makes a clicking noise that can be heard. Not worth returning. The heart rate feature works fine and that is the key. For a bare bones item, works fine. Has no second hand on clock like my old one. Does what it is supposed to and I can use my old watch with the chest band too.
