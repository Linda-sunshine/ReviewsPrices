review/summary: Good Holster, Great Pricereview/text: BLACKHAWK! is a well known brand used by security companies, police, and military forces around the world for a reason. These holsters are good, made of a lightweight polymer, and function like they say they do. The company isn't known for putting out poor products.Mine is for a left hander on a Springfield 1911 A1 Loaded model. So I was skeptical when it said fits 1911 Government Model and Clones, considering variations can screw things up. This holster lives up to what it promised, and I love it. The best feature is that the release for your weapon relies on the finger, and by design, will place your finger on the frame and out of the trigger guard, ensuring you won't shoot yourself or discharge when you aren't ready. It helps to remove error, teaches the shooter the proper draw, and works extremely well at doing it's job: carrying your firearm. I highly recommend this holster to anyone who plans to carry their weapon.
