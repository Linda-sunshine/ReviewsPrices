review/summary: Nephew's first man tool.review/text: In today's society it may seem inappropriate to give a 9 year old (lost ideals of a boring politically correct society) this type of present, but I come from a decade where common sense and parents were parents (ie you were seen and not heard). Yet, I had my first simple folding knife at his age and I turned out just fine and so will my nephew, who loves it and will have real parental guidance when used. Good quality product as always.
