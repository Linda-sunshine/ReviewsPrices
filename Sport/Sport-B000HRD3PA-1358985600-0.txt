review/summary: Terrible Craftsmanshipreview/text: The shorts are comfortable, but when I work out, I want a tight fit. The second time I ever tried to tie the drawstring, it broke from the seams. I wasn't using an overt amount of strength to tie them together, yet it popped apart like it was made to do it. I guess I get what I pay for, nothing more, nothing less.
