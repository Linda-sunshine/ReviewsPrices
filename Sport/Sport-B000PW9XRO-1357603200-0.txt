review/summary: Hands cold in Sub 32 weatherreview/text: These are not the hardcore winter gloves but I thought they would be a little warmer then what they were. They fit great and feel ok because they are a little thick so it takes a little bit to get used to on the trigger pull. If you have a small trigger guard you might have issues with these gloves.
