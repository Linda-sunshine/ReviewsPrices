review/summary: Made in Italyreview/text: I purchased this item with Amazon.com as the seller. The item is made in Italy! I have not tried it in a swimming pool as yet but wanted to give feedback because of a sizing issue. Note that the main picture of the product on the Amazon web site gives you the impression that the goggles are smaller than they are. Instead, the "regular" size is larger. Instead of the main picture, click to enlarge the smaller 4 pictures. The second of the 4 pictures, showing a woman's face under the water as she swims, is more representative of the actual size of the goggles on your face (also the third picture of the goggles (on a man) show the actual fit on face.) So if you are looking for a smaller profile goggle on your face, the "regular" size won't fit the bill.I selected the blue color googles with clear lens. I do not think they look cool so from a styling/looks perspective, they get no extra points.Adjusting the strap length is super easy and the goggles are said to offer 180 degree viewing angles.
