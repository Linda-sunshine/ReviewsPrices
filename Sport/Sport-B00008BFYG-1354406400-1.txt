review/summary: grade a scooterreview/text: this razor scooter is great for a younger child. i bought it for my 8yo nephew for christmas and it was perfect size. now he is a bit on the skinny side and he was comfortable on it. if your child is a little bigger i woud recommend a larger size though because its not the biggest thing out there. but for what i got it for its great. he rides it so much i feel like i truly got my money worth
