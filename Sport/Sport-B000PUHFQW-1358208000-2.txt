review/summary: Great Mat!review/text: This is a great mat, especially for home use. It's sturdy and comfortably. I've had this mat for almost a year now, and it's still in great shape after regular use. I've had no problems with the mat slipping on hard wood floors, which is a big plus. It also hasn't stretched at all, which can happen with certain poses. There is a slight smell when the mat is new, but that's to be expected with mats like this and it does go away eventually. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
