review/summary: Good product but not the best.review/text: This was a good product, however, the only but I have is that the vinyl plastic is not glued on the edges to the Styrofoam material. The local sports store had a similar one for the same price-but I din't get it because they (local sports store) also had one with the vinyl glued to the Styrofoam, which look much better. But for twice as much the money.In the end this helmet is ok. The minor details should only be considered if you want the best looking helmet.
