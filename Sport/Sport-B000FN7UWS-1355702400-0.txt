review/summary: Nice, but hardly the best choicereview/text: Its a nice bottle. Nice colour for a 7 years old girl, and sipping top is good for in-school lunches.The warning I make is about it's durability: paint will fastly peel off as any scratches will deteriorate it (and mi daughter isn't particularlly careful), and the bottle will deform at any impact (aluminium isn't very sturdy)...
