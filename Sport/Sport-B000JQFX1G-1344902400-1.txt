review/summary: Which Movement Will I Get with this Watch? You can't say?review/text: I would like to purchase this Invicta 8926OB watch from Amazon.com, but I would like to know exactly which model automatic movement I will receive for my money - and from this description I don't think it is possible to know the answer??The movement you receive in your 8926OB watch could be a:(1) Miyota 8215 - 21 jewels, the one pictured, has hand-winding but no hacking feature. ...or...(2) SII (SEIKO) NH25A - 21 jewels, This one has neither hand-winding nor hacking capability. Many reviews mention getting this movement with their 8926OB watch ...or...(3) SII (SEIKO) NH35A - 24 jewels, a new model with both hand-winding and hacking features. Some (but not all) of the newer 8926OB reviews mention the NH35A. And I would like to know that this is what I will receive, but I see no way of being certain of this based on the Amazon.com website.I'm not saying that any of these 3 movements are bad for the price. But they are different, and I would just like to know what I am buying. It's like buying a new car and not knowing whether it will have a 4, 6 or 8-cylinder engine until AFTER you buy it (with the car's online description not saying one way or the other).I first noticed this ambiguity several months ago and assumed that Amazon would eventually correct it, especially for a fairly popular model. But this has not yet happened. In general, I think that Amazon could do a better job of specifying movement models for the automatic watches they sell.
