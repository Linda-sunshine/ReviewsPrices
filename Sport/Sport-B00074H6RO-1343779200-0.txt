review/summary: Decent glove for the pricereview/text: Overall the glove is pretty good. The styling is functional basic black, no frills, nothing fancy, don't need a matching jump suit to wear them. If you are like me and crack a sweat when you're in the gym, the wash and dry option is nice to have.In one of the images on the item description there is a note about cutting out the webbing between the middle fingers, this is a pretty uncomfortable area and does need to be removed. Turn the glove inside out, and a quick cut with scissors does the job.
