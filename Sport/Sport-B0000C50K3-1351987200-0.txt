review/summary: Fine for large calibers but @#$%* for a .22review/text: I have one of these for my .357 magnum revolver and that's fine. It does a reasonable job and is way faster that brushes and patches.I bought another for a .22 rifle and it was a disaster. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's difficult to get the weight to pass through the barrel - it's not heavy enough and too close to the diameter of the barrel. So close, in fact, that I managed to get it lodged in the barrel - wouldn't fall through & couldn't pull it out. I called a gunsmith and he laughed. Apparently I'm not the only one to have this experience.If it happens to you, you might try the fix he suggested - put a small rubber stopper in the muzzle and fill the bore with copper solvent overnight. That softened up the brass enough that I could drive it out with a squib rod.Needless to say I would never use this again for a .22
