review/summary: Pedometer. A helping guide for exercisereview/text: THe pedometer has great reviews and I don't disagree B U T the clip is totally worthless and the manufacturer is not willing to do anything to assist .I asked if the clip might be a faulty item and they might replace it with another that might not be faulty.&#34;It's not our policy to do that.&#34;Not so good customer service and as good as the unit is what good is it if ot won't stay put?Just my opinion but you asked for it
