review/summary: Best Mirror That I Have Found For My Mountain Bikereview/text: The Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bike Mirror is the best mirror that I found for my Motobecane Fantom Comp mountain bike. I looked at as many as I could, and even considered the helmet mount models. I started with the velcrow strap mount model that looked good and had good reviews on another site, but it never stayed in place well enough. I looked at the larger helmet mount mirror, but did not like the idea of the distracting mirror.This mirror provides a far superior mount, and is stable once you adjust it. The mount is well designed and it works as well as I could expect, providing a higher level of safety without any distraction.I can't think of anything I would change about this mirror, and higly recommend it for mountain bikes ridden on the street.
