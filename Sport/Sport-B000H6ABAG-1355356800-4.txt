review/summary: Sizing runs very small !!review/text: I give this a 3 star rating because the weight of the material is great......BUT the sizing is way on the small side. I bought a XX-Large which in my opinion should be labeled XL at the most, possibly even Large. I don't know about you, but I like my sweatpants baggie. I have Hanes XXL sweats and they are perfect, with regards to baggieness. I bought the Russell since they were about 45% less money. However, you DO get what you pay for.
