review/summary: Nifty little devicereview/text: I have been using this pedometer for 2 weeks and I am in love with it. Seems very well thought out. It accurately keeps track of my steps. The strap already saved it several times from falling to the floor, an event that used to spell the death of my old pedometers. I like how I can clip it on my belt or stuff it in my shirt pocket, e.g. when wearing pajamas at night. But what I like most is the software. For $6 more than the HJ-112, I can connect it to the computer once a month and store all my results. It gives me bar graphs showing the distribution of steps not only day by day, but by the hour each day. It also shows which hours I was wearing it and allows me to record events and set goals. I can see how this can be helpful for me to figure out my habits and combat laziness. Well worth it.
