review/summary: Insainereview/text: Waaaaaayyyy too hard. Unless you're training for some sort of enduring sport...I don't see the point in pushing your body THIS hard. I've used the DVD twice. I love working out, but this DVD keeps me out of breath more than I enjoy...so it will probably sit on my shelf. The idea is good tho!
