review/summary: The BESTreview/text: I have tried many pedometers from the cheap ones to more expensive and find that Omron has the best. I am on my 2nd one in about 5 years. The software that comes with this model also makes it easy to track your steps on a regular basis. I wear mine from the time I get dressed of a morning to the time I go to bed. I would highly recommend this item to all those interest in a good pedometer and who likes to walk alot.
