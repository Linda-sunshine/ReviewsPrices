review/summary: Perfect for daily usereview/text: I purchased this knife before my most recent deployment and it performed flawlessly as a daily use knife for the seven and half months I was underway. The complaints about the cheap locking mechanism were not an issue at all for me. After some adjusting to the fact that I had to use my pinkie to operate to locking mechanism I was able to quickly and safely operate the knife whenever needed. Despite being smooth I never had an issue with the knife slipping out of my hand and possibly causing severe damage to my hand even when using topside covered in seaspray. The edge was incredibly sharp and maintained its edge for a longer than expected period of time. The only reason I ended up purchasing a new one was because the clip got caught on a deckplate and bent bad enough it would no longer securely grasp my pocket. Bottom line: for the price you can't beat this knife.
