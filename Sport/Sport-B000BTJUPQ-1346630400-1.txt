review/summary: Great bowreview/text: I purchased this bow set for my son's aged 11 & 14 to take with us camping. They have absolutely no problem using it and pulling off accurate shots every time. For target practice, purchase a pack of field tip arrows. I also picked up some Allen Company arrows with 125 grain Broadheads for shooting pesky racoons that were coming around the campsite. They work real well! Buy this bow set and you won't be disappointed.
