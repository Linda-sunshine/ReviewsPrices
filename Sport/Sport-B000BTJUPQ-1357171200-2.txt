review/summary: Good Starter Setreview/text: This is a good starter set for kids. Our daughter is almost 7 years old and its good to spend this small amount of moeny to see if she likes it and will be interested. Only downfall is that where the arrow sits, doesnt stay and you cannot hold you hand there cause you will get snapped.
