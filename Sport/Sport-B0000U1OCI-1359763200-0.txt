review/summary: Best Pedometer for busy Mom'sreview/text: I love this Pedometer and I have bought the digiwalker and several other pedometers that I have either lost of busted. I clip it onto my jammies as soon as I get up in the morning. I even stuff it in my bra when I want it hidden. I am in a continual competition with myself to get 10,000 steps a day. I love going to the gym but I am busy working part time at a retail store. I love that I can see how many steps I did at work and if I need to up my steps I go to the gym afterwards and run on the treadmill. I love to see how I am doing for the last 7 days. I even wear it to the gym when I do the body combat classes. Just keeps me moving! You will love it! I have not lost this one because it has a clip and a string with a clip. So double security.
