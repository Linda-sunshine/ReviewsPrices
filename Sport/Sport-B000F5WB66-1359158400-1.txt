review/summary: Love it! Perfect Price. Simple for a person new to fitness.review/text: It detects heart rate easily. You must use a little sweat or some water to make it work.The chest strap is easily adjustable. It beeps (very very quietly) with each heart rate so you know its detecting.It is not as durable as I'd like it to be, but for the price point. You can't complain.The controls are easy to find.Navigating between the clock and the hear rate monitor takes some practice.Understanding the sequence to push the buttons and how long to hold them for for different options can be a little confusing.Just play with it. You'll eventually get it.Overall a great product. Treat it gently and do proper cleaning and maintenance.
