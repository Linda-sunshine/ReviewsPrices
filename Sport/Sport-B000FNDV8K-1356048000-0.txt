review/summary: I carry it everywherereview/text: I bought this one to replace the one I lost. I'd carried it in my purse for years and years - so convenient! Super sharp scissors - that and the tweezers are so handy. It gets dusty inside after time and is so tiny it's hard to clean, but with perseverance I did. I highly recommend it.
