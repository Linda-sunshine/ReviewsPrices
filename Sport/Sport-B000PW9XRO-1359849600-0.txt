review/summary: Fit perfect, natural feelreview/text: Having read manufacturer blurb regarding being a favorite choice among law enforcement professionals I figured at the very least the sizing of these gloves would be accurate. Thankfully that presumption has proven accurate as these XXL gloves fit perfectly.Manual dexterity feels natural and the ability to operate touchscreen devices with these still on is an added bonus (something I can't do with my current favorite deerskin gloves by Ansell.)If you're looking for a snug fitting glove that fits naturally and preserves most manual dexterity these gloves will do just fine. I like them enough that I'll be looking for more offerings from Hatch.
