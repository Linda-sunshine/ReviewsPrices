review/summary: Klean Kanteen Water Bottlereview/text: I have been looking for water bottle for a long time. I bought Klean Kanteen for about a month now. It's okay, but still not what I expected. I use my water bottle every day- at work and during my training. Sometimes water smells and tastes little weird after few hours. I also wish there were different caps available. This one is little hard to open and if I use it frequently- for example when I work out- I have to leave it opened. Otherwise it takes me more time to open it and close it each time I want to take a sip. I will be looking for different water bottle soon.
