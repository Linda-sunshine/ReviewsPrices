review/summary: Very Uniquereview/text: I have been using this funny chair for a month by now, and it does have some unique advantages over all other regular chairs. First, because the ball is flexible and it can mold according to shape and pressure, the pressure on my butt spreads out more evenly and over a much larger area compared to a flat seat, so that sitting on it for a long time doesn't create any sore spots. The pressure, actually, is also spread over the upper parts of my thighs.Second, because it's a ball, and you are forced to sit more towards the rear side of it---tucked between the ball and the back support---I don't slide forward, and thus don't need to resist any horizontal motion of the chair with my legs.One minus for this chair is that the back support is hard and rigid and does create pressure point on my back. I solved this problem by wrapping a semi-hard foam material about 3/4" thick around the back support (fastening it with packaging-grade Scotch Tape).Overall, I am happy with this chair and I give it 4 stars, not 5 because of the back support rigidity and non-adjustability.
