review/summary: Perfect water bottle! also good for your health.review/text: I was looking for a water bottle,to help me drink more water while on computer & found this. It's BPA-Free,holds plenty of water 25/26oz when filled to the top great design/looks & only $11 & change. Make sure to disassemble & wash every part completely,I soaked bite valve & straw in vinegar for 30min to kill germs and inhibit mold growth. Water bottle works perfect no strange water taste,perfect size for my elliptical,small learning curve on where to bite valve so far happy.Bite valve it clear not blue like picture.
