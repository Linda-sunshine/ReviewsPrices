review/summary: Dangerous/slippery matreview/text: Thought this mat would be a good bargain but really should have spent more to purchase a quality mat. The quality of my yoga practice really decreased because I was slipping so much in downward dog and upward dog that I was concerned I was going to slip and fall during class. It's nice that the mat is longer and padded, but it's super slippery. Would not recommend.
