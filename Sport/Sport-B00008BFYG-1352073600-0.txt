review/summary: Very pleased!review/text: I bought this for my grandson for his 4th birthday. Maybe it was a little too soon for him, but I can say that I was pleased with the product. It is built well, and easy to use. As I was teaching him to ride, I managed to sneak in a little ride myself ;)! And though it isn't made to hold my weight, it did hold me, and it was fun!! Not bad for an &#34;old head&#34; like me!!!
