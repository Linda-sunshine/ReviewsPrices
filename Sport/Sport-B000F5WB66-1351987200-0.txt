review/summary: Timex Heart Rate Monitorreview/text: This heart monitor does what it says it will do. Nicely monitors heart rate, average heart rate, and time.Advertising is misleading though. States that you can change the battery yourself. Turns out that you can change the battery in the belt, but they recommend that you take the watch to a jewelry store for battery changes.Belt needs to be bigger for fat boys.
