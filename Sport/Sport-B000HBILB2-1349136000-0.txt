review/summary: Easy to use and set upreview/text: Have used 5 air beds for children for the last month while we are in the process of moving. Beds were very easy to setup. Takes a few minutes to deflate and store, but nothing too major. Requires occasional minor re-inflation if beds remain inflated more than a few days in a row. One child had a bed-wetting issue one night and air bed was very easy to clean. Children range in age/size from 6 years to 16 years old. Out of town adult family member used a bed for a couple evenings and stated she slept very well. Highly recommended for any temporary bed needs.
