review/summary: washable, durable, well insulatedreview/text: I have four of these, and they insulate well in the summer. plastic loop makes carrying easy and two of them have sustained 2-3 years of everyday use. Lid screws on very tightly. black spout not so tight, but doesn't leak. inside of lid is prone to mold and bacteria in the summer or if you use a lot of sugary drinks like juice. Easy to clean with a Q-tip every now and then.
