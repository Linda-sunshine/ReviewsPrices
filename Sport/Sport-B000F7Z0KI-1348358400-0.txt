review/summary: Good product, very useful.review/text: The cup is actually made in the U.S.A. I was happily surprised to see that it is American made. It is 24 ounces,which is 1.5 pints. I ride in 90 degree weather and so I fill it with ice and then top off with water. It keeps cold for about 4 hours by which time all the ice has melted. This is adequate to my needs. I am happy with the cup and recommend it.
