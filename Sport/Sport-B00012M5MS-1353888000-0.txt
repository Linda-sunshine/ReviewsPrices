review/summary: Doesn't seem very substantialreview/text: I bought this because it's inexpensive, and I got what I paid for. The plastic feels brittle and seems like it would snap without much stress. I don't think I would trust it for serious biking or in high traffic areas, but it might be okay for a mild biker on a park trail?If you are going to ride your bike on the street, high traffic, or rough terrain, I would recommend spending a little extra to get a helmet that is more substantial.
