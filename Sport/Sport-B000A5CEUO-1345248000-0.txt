review/summary: Omron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitorreview/text: Delivered on time & works just fine. Does not have some features of the more expensive monitors but I basically use it for time of day and heart rate. Like most monitors you must wet the strap or your chest a bit so that it makes contact and sends the signal to the wrist monitor. I have seen a few monitors where you must send the product to the manufacturer to change the battery. On the Omron you can change both batteries yourself.
