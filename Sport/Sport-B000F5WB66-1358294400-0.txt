review/summary: best thing ive ever bought. better yet best investment.review/text: i cant begin to express how much this device has aided in my work outs. im a visual person so being able to see what exactly my intensity level is, is incrediably helpful. you start by establishing your max heart rate and then you view the chart to see what your target zones are for your heart rates. zone 3 is what i strive for. when im going too slow i pick it up. when im going too fast i lighten up. then at the end of my workout. the monitor gives me the average bpm and the highest bpm i acheived. with the help of this monitor i can calculate the calories ive burned, and tailor my future workouts so i can reach my work out goals.
