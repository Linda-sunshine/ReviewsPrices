review/summary: A Must Have in Your Purse Girlsreview/text: This little (only about 2.5 inches) pocket knife, scissor, nail file, and tweezer set comes in handy for me everywhere I go. How many times have I needed to cut off a thread from my clothing, fix a broken nail, or remove a little splinter and went to this all-purpose handy tool? So many I can't count. It's not for camping; it's like a must-have for everyday little needs.
