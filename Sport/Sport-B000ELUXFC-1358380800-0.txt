review/summary: It works well, but test it!review/text: I like it and would absolutely buy it again. However, the first time I used it, I found that it would gradually slip down the trunk. As a result, my bike tires ended up dragging for a while, destroying one tire (fortunately not the wheels). After a little experimenting, I found a position where it didn't move at all (it wasn't the position shown in the instructions). Having found a position that works, I love it and it does exactly what I want.Buy it, but test it and make sure it won't slip!
