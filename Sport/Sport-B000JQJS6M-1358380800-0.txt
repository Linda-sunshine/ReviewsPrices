review/summary: OK for the pricereview/text: Received this watch for Christmas as something to wear while my TAG is being overhauled. Two biggest complaints are the color of the face and bezel and the band. My watch has a purple hue to it not reflected by the on line pictures. The bezel numbers have a rose gold color look to them. Not a huge problem but I was expecting a blue watch. The band on this watch is flimsy. For such a solid case the band is thin and I think will not look good after significant wear. Overall, the watch has a good look to it and I'm reasonably happy with it.
