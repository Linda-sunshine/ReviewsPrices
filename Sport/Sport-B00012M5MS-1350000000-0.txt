review/summary: Poorest qualityreview/text: When I took it out of the box, one of the plastic plate at the back on the helmet had already fallen off. I could see that there were little glue on it. BOTH stickers on top of the helmet were up. The quality is as poor as a something made by a kindergarten kid.
