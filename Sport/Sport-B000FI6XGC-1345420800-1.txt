review/summary: Reliable travel bike pumpreview/text: Needed a quick and easy to use travel pump. Feels sturdy and does a great job on my presta road bike tires. Keeps me going when I am riding 5+ miles on my bike per day. Only complaint is the cap/plug to cover the pump opening doesn't stay in place/fit well and comes undone, but it stays connected to my bike with the bike attachment and doesn't bother me.
