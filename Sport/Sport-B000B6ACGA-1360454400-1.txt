review/summary: Arrived broken and non workingreview/text: Second one we ordered, gave the last one away. This arrived as promised, packaging was in good order. However when we took it out of the box it was broken. The clear card slide had a big crack in it and one of the guides was busted off. We went ahead and put batteries in it and tried to shuffle several decks of cards. They would not shuffle. It was as if something was missing. Contacted Amazon and set up a return. Will get another one soon and hopefully it works better than this one.
