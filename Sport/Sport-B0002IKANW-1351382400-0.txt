review/summary: A zoom 9 mm Luger Percision Snap Caps (5 Pack)review/text: If you own a S&W 9 mm auto or revolver this "dummy" round is what you need for dry firing. Dry firing with the 9 mm "dummy" rounds is a great way to get the feel of you weapon and to "test" fire without throwing down a round. They fit the clip very nicely and eject without fouling. I highly recommend for new shooters or experienced shooters.
