review/summary: Works wellreview/text: Solid bike rack. I've taken my BMX bikes over 20 miles to a park across town on about 10 different occasions.. and never had a problem. The straps are always still tight when I get there, but you should still periodically check them just in case. I have a 2001 Ford Mustang and it fits easily onto the trunk.A few personal recommendations - You may want to wrap your pedals in a sock or something similar to keep them from scratching your trunk. Mine got scratched from my first trip where the pedal was rubbing the trunk. I use tie straps to lock down the pedals and keep the wheels from spinning. Also, after you put the straps through the fasteners, wrap the excess around the rack and tie it into a knot. You'll feel safer.
