review/summary: Not long.review/text: Don't get me wrong, I wear these shorts all the time and they're some of my favorites, but they're by no means &#34;long&#34;. I'm not very tall, and they still come above my knees when I stand up. If you want basketball-length shorts, these are not the ones to get. Running, on the other hand, is what these are made for, and that's what I do most of the time, so I lucked out.
