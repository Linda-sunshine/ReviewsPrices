review/summary: ragged boxreview/text: These were a Christmas present. They came promptly, but when we opened the box, we found that the glasses box itself was kind of worn with a hole in one corner that kind of resembled a mouse gnawing. We were worried so kept all the packing. But discovered that the glasses themselves were fine and our son was very happy with them. We suggest a little more attention to the packaging....
