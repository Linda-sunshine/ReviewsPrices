review/summary: Only Shorts to Havereview/text: I bought some ExOfficio boxer briefs a year or so ago to replace some briefs that I had owned for a number of years (at least the style for a number of years, not the particular briefs). I bought them on the recommendation of someone I met in a store who only wore these particular briefs. I bought a small number to try. Then I bought more. Now it's the only brand/style that I wear. They're incredibly comfortable, dry, have plenty of support and don't take up much room. They're ideal for travel as you can wash them out and dry them overnight. All I can say is they're great!!!
