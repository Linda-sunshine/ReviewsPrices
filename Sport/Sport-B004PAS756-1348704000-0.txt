review/summary: Holy @%*# !!review/text: I am a guy in (what I thought was) pretty good shape. But holy cow! This routine is crazy. I only got 12 minutes into it and had to stop. I saw some other reviews saying this sucked, or bad packaging, advertisements in the begining, etc. Ok, yea, just a cardboard sleeve package, who cares! It's not a zumba set. Yes there is an advertisement in the start, big deal. Yea, it is a low budget set but who cares, the workout is AWESOME.I have never owned or have done the insanity workout package but this 20 Min DVD is worth every cent. If you want a good, short burn then go for it. Yes it is a no frills DVD but you're not looking for complete production value, you're looking for a WORKOUT! And this delivers. As far as the reviews warning you about this and the warning on the DVD, they are true, DO NOT jump into this! Unless you an 18 year old marine fresh out of boot camp then GO SLOW. I'm only 40 and weigh 150 pds and this wore me down quick.So, if you want a straight up fat burning cardio work out in a short time, here you go.
