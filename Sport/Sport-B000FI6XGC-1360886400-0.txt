review/summary: A little frustrating at first, but okayreview/text: Pros:Locks on to your bikeVery small and portableTakes very little time to fill a tireCompatible with multiple styles of valves (Schrader, Presta, Dunlop)Cons:Very poor instructions - really only two diagrams, but after some trial and error the diagrams make more sense.Doesn't work well with a Shrader valves - you have to loosen the adapters, slide them on the valve and tighten them again.Even when loosened, sometimes you have to carefully twist the air pump onto the valve (which isn't fun with a flat tire).Bottom line: for the low price, I suppose it was worth it, but I wouldn't buy it again.
