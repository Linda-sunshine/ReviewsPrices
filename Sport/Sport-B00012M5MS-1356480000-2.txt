review/summary: Falls apartreview/text: I rated this two stars, because the plastic shell has separated from the foam part. The helmet lasted about two weeks before one of the plastic pieces on the back fell off. Today, the large plastic piece fell off.I like how easy this helmet was to adjust and how comfortable it was to wear. I dislike how easily it came apart. It was either on my head or in my bag. No rough use, whatsoever.This product is only recommended for infrequent riders looking for a very inexpensive helmet. It is your head, protect it.
