review/summary: Comfortable ear protection at a very good price.review/text: My boss offered me a pair of these earmuffs to try out while running a vacuum cleaner. They were comfortable and reduced the vacuum noise level a lot. I bought 4 pair of these earmuffs for each of the other vacuum cleaners our company uses throughout their buildings. Hearing protection is worthy of the purchase, and these were priced at under $20. a piece (excluding shipping and handling).
