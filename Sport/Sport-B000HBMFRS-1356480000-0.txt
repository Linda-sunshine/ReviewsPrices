review/summary: So comfy!review/text: We were headed to the in-laws and needed an air mattress to avoid sleeping on the couch. This was cheap and would get here quickly so I ordered it and hoped it would at least be less awkward than the couch. I was surprised to find the difference being a double high airbed would make in terms of comfort. For once we didn't miss our pillow-top while travelling (I was even sick this trip but didn't mind spending a day on this bed)! Having a built in pump was also incredibly convenient. No more fitting the inflate pieces and holding the pump in place. Even with a nutty 4 year old and two 50lbs dogs clumsily walking across numerous times we had no air leak issues.
