review/summary: Comfortable but baggier than I likereview/text: Well made, good materials, good, light feel, but I think I prefer tighter-fitting performance boxer briefs.As some others noted, going down to a small (for a roughly 32&#34; waist), versus medium for sports boxer briefs, was a good choice, but small is still roomier than I like. That may be typical of boxer shorts (I've long worn ordinary cotton briefs).
