review/summary: WASH IT!!!review/text: Ok so i read on some review that this item didn't work as intended...because it didn't fluff up to expectations.I read the instruction...washed it in warm water with very light detergent...then machine dried on low setting for about 1 hour.I pulled the pillow out and this thing was 3 times fluffier than when i put it in to wash.The pillow seemed to work well. I used it once...so far...will come back to edit on how it held up. So far so good
