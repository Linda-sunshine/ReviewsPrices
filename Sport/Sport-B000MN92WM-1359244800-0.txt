review/summary: Short sighted or baby steps?review/text: Been using for about a week. I can wander around my bedroom and not take a step? I don't think so. I have set my step at 28 inches, could it be it will only recognize/record steps that are that length? Other than that I assume it is accurate. Or I guess my steps are too smooth, and not erratic.I was especially looking for an accurate pedometer that was up-loadable and that is some of the rub, software... The on-line software works but is very vanilla. There is seemingly no mention of downloadable software but it can be googled and found, Omron. The software does not work according to the manual but you can figure it out so that it is better than the on-line. If you play some more you will find Health Vault, but it is not as good as the Omron vanilla, or maybe I have not figured out the secret handshake. But if you play you will find an app that gives you the chocolate and strawberry.My ideal: I started this quest using a Humanafit pedometer. I had to manually input my bicycle mileage. Add a Garmin 205 and I am golden. Well my pedometer went for a swim. Back to square one.
