review/summary: heavy, but does the jobreview/text: This pan, as I expected being cast iron, is not for the weak limbed. Oof, heavy! But so far, so good. I bought to use at work to make lunches on my induction range, since stainless steel pans are pricey and that or cast iron is the only option that works with induction via magnetic properties of those two metals. The pan transmits heat fabulously - be careful as it can get too hot and overcook your food if you don't set your heat right! and I would still recommend putting a bit of oil in with your food so that it does burn until you learn the complete range of temperature. Nothing sticks, but you can easily wind up with some nice brown welts on your veggies from the quick sear. Easy to clean and I don't have to worry about scratching it either, which is an added bonus in an office with 5 other boys who don't know how to cook that will likely be using. Great pan for the value
