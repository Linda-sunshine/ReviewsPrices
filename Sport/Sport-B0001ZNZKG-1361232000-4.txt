review/summary: Love these boxer briefsreview/text: In college I thought my roommate was crazy for wearing underwear that was $10+ a pair but years later I see how right he was. These boxer briefs fit great, look great and feel great. Much better than anything I've ever worn in cotton and some folks are getting more than a year out of a pair. To be honest I've gone that long with cotton boxers but I probably shouldn't have based on the holes in some of my pairs. These are well made and well worth the $15-17 a pair. I wish they were made in the US but that's the only downside I have so far.
