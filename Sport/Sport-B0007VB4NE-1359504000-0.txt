review/summary: Better for backreview/text: I haven't used my desk in a year because I get a backache from my regular office chair. This is a very comfortable chair. I am purchasing another because my son liked my chair so much that he's keeping it.It arrives unassembled, but is really easy to put together. It's a little low which is a negative in the ergonomic sense (arms might not be at right angle to keyboard), but I see that someone sells risers for the chair which increases the height by 2 inches.
