review/summary: Works greatreview/text: This works well on my Forge M-Street bike. I cut a small hole in the end of the hand grip with a single edge razor blade and then the plastic plug in the handlebar came out easily. The mirror mounting screws are very hard to turn but I guess that is what keeps it from requiring frequent adjustment. The mirror mount is rugged, I commute on buses and load the bike on the bus bike racks. The mirror has been clobbered by other cyclists loading and unloading their bikes, (one guy apologized after hitting it) but it hasn't broken. I dumped the bike a few weeks ago and cracked the glass. The replacement mirror itself without the mounting hardware is available from Amazon for about half the price of the whole unit:Replacement Mirror For Mirrycle Bicycle Mirrors
