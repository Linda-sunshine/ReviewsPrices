review/summary: Extremely uncomfortable chest heart monitorreview/text: This product is built for people who have elastic arms. It is almost impossible to get the chest encircling heart monitor on. Then you have to moisten it to get skin contact which is a source of discomfort. Finally, it is like trying to pull a neoprene scuba suit off over your head. What a stupid design. Also, it is extremely uncomfortable on and it chafed my skin. The watch monitor is bulky and difficult to set. It is also very difficult to figure out how to return the product. No shipping manifest was in the box. When I printed out my purchase the date didn't print either so it was very hard to figure out where to look for the returns information.
