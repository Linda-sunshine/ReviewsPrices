review/summary: Great tiny pump; don't expect for it to be quick though.review/text: This is exactly what is advertised and it works well. It's an aluminium cylindrical pump and it comes with a carrier to mount underneath your bottle/cup holder.A little note on how to use it if you want to use SCHRADER valve(why it wasn't like this as the default, I don't get).1. Unscrew the cap2. Use the lever to push the black plastic forward. Follow the directions on the box to realign the parts. Put it back in and screw the cap back on (important).3. When you're inserting it to pump, make sure to lock it with the lever or it's useless. Maybe that's just a dumb mistake I made though.Great pump, and looks nice too. Of course it is small, and you need to hand pump it, so don't be surprised that it takes a while to pump a deflated tire.
