review/summary: More stuff for my bug out bagreview/text: These mylar blankets are lightweight and folded up very small. I hope I never need them, but then I buy house insurance, car insurance, health insurance, life insurance and fire extinguishers too. These are small enough and cheap enough to have in my car, my wife's car and my bug out bag.
