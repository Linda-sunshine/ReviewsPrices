review/summary: I love these boxers!review/text: I bought a pair of these earlier just because I haven't been able to find any affordable boxers that has a nice fit.. Until now.These boxers are just great. Nice fabric, feels very light, easy to maintain, great fit (not too tight, not too baggy).The sizes may be a bit off though? I usually wear XL, but with these Large is more than big enough.
