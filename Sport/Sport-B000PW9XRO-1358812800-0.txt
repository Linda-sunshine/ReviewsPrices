review/summary: very nice for the pricereview/text: Nice gloves good construction and they seem like they will last a long time. You might want to check your sizing before ordering. The XL were a bit snug compared to other brands; so if your an XL you might want to move up a size or just deal with the snug fit. I found that these gloves are not quite as sensitive for frisking as my all leather gloves. So I will definitely say that these are nice gloves for the price.
