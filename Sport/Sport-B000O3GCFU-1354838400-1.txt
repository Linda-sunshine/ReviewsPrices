review/summary: Does what it says--keeps the food warmreview/text: Bought this to keep my 5-year-old from accidentally melting her lunch in the school microwave. Putting very hot food in it at 6:30am and by 11:30am it's still warm and ready to eat. Two items of note:1. I pour near-boiling water in the container, swish it around, and leave it for a minute to warm up the container before adding food. This helps keep things warm by not losing any of the food's heat to warm the container.2. I've been hand-washing it, and noticed that if submerged, a small amount of water can remain between the metal and rubberized part at the bottom of the container. Not a deal breaker, but seems like it could be better sealed to keep this from happening.
