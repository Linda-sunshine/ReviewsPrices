review/summary: Very pleased!---not.review/text: I bought this mattress as a practical bed to sleep on everyday till i go back to school. I have been using it with no troubles at all. Having the pump inside the airbed REALLY REALLY helps. Although i barely use it, having an electric pump connected is very convenient. The bed stays perfectly inflated for about two weeks, maybe more, without needing to put any air in. When i do put air in, its only for about 20seconds and its back to normal. Overall, its pretty comfortable, i put a couple of blankets underneath my sheet to take away from the air mattress grooves but an egg crate topper would work just fine. Great mattress overall!__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Okay, probably 3 days after I posted this my bed grew a HUGE bubble in the middle of it. I had to pump it up every night. Followed by a second bubble in the middle. It started to lose air even faster. Then, a third bubble. On the bottom of the mattress. Needless to say, I'm currently sleeping on a recliner. This was NOT worth the money. When it says "not made for everyday use" they weren't kidding.
