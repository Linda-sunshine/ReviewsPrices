review/summary: Perfect everyday pocket knifereview/text: While this isn't a "utility knife" it is very easily utilized in everyday tasks where an edged object is needed. The flat edge surface was awkward at first but you kern to manipulate it quite quickly to utilize the knife properly. Only drawback is Kershaw's ridiculously tiny screws, I suggest buing Kershaw's T-Tool to make the adjustments it will need over time.
