review/summary: Love it!review/text: Bought 2 - one for an 11 year old girl, and one for an 8 year old boy. They love it! We all do! If was a little difficult at first for the 8 year old to pull it back to firing position, but after a few tries, he quickly mastered it. I would recommend this for sure.
