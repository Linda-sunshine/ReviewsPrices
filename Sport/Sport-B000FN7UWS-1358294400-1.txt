review/summary: Rustreview/text: I am giving this item 3 stars because as much as I like the wider opening for drinking, it's also a bit messy. I ordered 3 Klean Kanteen bottles...2-27 ounce, and 1- 40 ounce. The 3 stars is also for the fact that shortly after using one of the bottles, rust spots began to form on the inner rim where the cap screws in. I contacted Klean Kanteen directly and they gave cleaning ideas and how to get rid of the rust. What disappointed me the most was that if the spots didn't go away after their suggestions, they said I should send pictures of the rust! Really? Pictures? I wasn't looking for 3 free new bottles, I only inquired about the rust spots! The other 2 have been free of rust and according to Klean, their products are of a high grade steel and rust shouldn't be an issue. I do like the fact that they are not lined with anything...like the Sigg bottles are. Been there, done that. Overall, the bottles are nice and I would purchase them over any lined bottle in the future. I have noticed the spots have gone away, but I will be checking before I take a sip!
