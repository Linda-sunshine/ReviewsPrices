review/summary: Comfortable, Easy. Good height.review/text: I ordered 2 of these for our Christmas guests. We have been using them for the past 5 nights. So far, so good. The beds go up and down quickly, Their height is higher than &#34;other&#34; brand air beds on the market. The price is much better. And, the beds are perfectly comfortable.
