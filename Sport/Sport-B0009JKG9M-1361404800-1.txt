review/summary: So good I just ordered a second!review/text: I use these to bake bread as described in the book Tartine Bread. They're great for that purpose! I haven't used them for anything else, but I have other cast iron things from lodge and these are just as good as any. I actually just ordered a second set of these so I could bake two loaves of bread at once and cut my weekly baking time in half.
