review/summary: Works great!review/text: Bought this to keep my Fitbit attached to my pants pocket. It had fallen out several times and luckily landed on the floor. It did almost fall in the toilet so I decided to get something to keep it attached and this came reccommended on the fitbit community boards. It works great and also helps me to remember to take it off before I throw my pants into the washing machine! Happy with this purchase.
