review/summary: LOVE THE CHAIR...review/text: A friend and I bought these for work, same day, same price.... BUT she received an appropriate size ball, I on the other hand recieved a tiny ball that is embarrassing! Now I have to go BUY another ball spend more money... that or pay for return shipping wait longer and hope it works out. Either way I have to spend more... not happy.Her Chair is incredibly comfortable! I do love it.I don't love that I GOT SCREWED but... it is what it is.UPDATE - My Husband inflated the ball for me.... I thought it was going to pop... but NOPE! its not the size it said it would be.... and NOW the size (Height) is perfect for my office desk! HAPPY :DSO TIP: inflat the ball till you fear for your life... then its ready. as you sit on the chair the ball will stretch out more and more :DGOOD LUCK!
