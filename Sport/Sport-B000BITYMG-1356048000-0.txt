review/summary: Does what it is supposed toreview/text: I got this leash for my pedometer. It is a replacement for the one that came with the pedometer, The original leash had a plastic clip, which eventually broke. I expect the metal clip on this new leash to last a lot longer. It's a small, inexpensive item, but it works great to keep my rather expensive pedometer from getting lost, because many times, the pedometer itself has a tendency to fall off the waistband of my jeans.
