review/summary: Klean Kanteenreview/text: Arrived quickly. Ordered two, one for myself and my wife to use at the gym. As good as any other stainless steel bottle I've used. The difference that makes this bottle more convenient is the top. We like the pop-up spout for ease of use with gloves on. What makes this top different than others I've used is the tiny vent valve that lets in air while drinking yet won't leak if the bottle gets turned over. Better pricing than other SS bottles I searched.
