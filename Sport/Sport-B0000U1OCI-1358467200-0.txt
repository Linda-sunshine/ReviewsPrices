review/summary: Works nicely for a good pricereview/text: I am reading a book called The Happiness Project. The self-help book is divided up into 12 months Jan-Dec of helpful advice. For Jan, the advice is about getting more energy. The author suggests getting a pedometer in order to track how many steps you take; the idea is that the pedometer will &#34;reward&#34; you by showing the progress you've made when you increase the number of steps you take in a day. That idea appealed to me; it adds a fun, competetive angle to getting healthy, especially for someone who exercises very little. the pedometer works well, and keeps a running count of several days, so you can track your improvement day over day.
