review/summary: No complaints - as advertised.review/text: I got this item just in time for the short winter days headed out to the bus stop in the morning and home from work at night. Very bright and visible. Love the soft-touch switch and the blinker mode. Easily mounted on my rear basket so it was not blocked by my &#34;cargo&#34;. Uses cheap, easy to find batteries - even rechargables.
