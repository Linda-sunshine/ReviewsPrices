review/summary: best knife for the do-it-all by farreview/text: was looking for the &#34;right swiss army&#34; that could do all the little task that needs attention on a field trip, fishing trip, camping and or hunting trip. I happened across this one and I knew right away this was the one. After I got the knife I was even more pleased. I knew I had made the right choice. The small tools on the back side have some people confused but if you have ever done any electrical work you recognize the &#34;hook&#34; as a handy little device for pulling wire and then there is the small chisel for any number of uses including removing the back of your watch to change the battery, and the small flat head screwdriver is a handy little item when conducting electrical repairs on radios and such. Then there is the leather punch and we all know what the cork screw is for but what was really neat was the small eye-glass screwdriver that screws inside the cork screw. The tools on the knife blade side should be self explanatory. All in all a really great tool for the do-it-yourselfer.
