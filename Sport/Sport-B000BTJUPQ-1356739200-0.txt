review/summary: Good starterreview/text: Got this for my 6 year old daughter. It took a few tries for her to be able to pull it back all the way, controll it, and then aim to shoot, but she's got it down now. If you have a beginner without much upper body strength, you might want to start with a 15 lb. pull non compound bow, otherwise, this is a good bow for a 6-10 year old. We haven't had any problems with the arrows, as some mentioned.
