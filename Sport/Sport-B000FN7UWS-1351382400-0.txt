review/summary: Fantastic Bottlereview/text: I bought a slightly larger version of this bottle about a year ago, and loved everything about it. There was no plastic taste to the water, it's neutrally fashionable, and it's cheap. After a year, I somehow cracked the side of the bottle from some sort of impact. The crack was tiny and not noticeable, but water started leaking out of the side. This leads me to believe that it may be pretty easy to crack again, but for the price I'm not too worried; I just purchased another. If you take care of the bottle, it's an awesome purchase.
