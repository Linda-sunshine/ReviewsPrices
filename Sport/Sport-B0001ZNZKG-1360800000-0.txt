review/summary: Great material, ok fitreview/text: The material on these boxers do exactly as advertised. It's pretty incredible as they wick away any sweat but I found the fit to not be satisfactory. I have several boxer briefs and these just don't fir right. They're a bit baggy and sit too high above the waist.
