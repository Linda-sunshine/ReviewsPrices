review/summary: Absolutely horrible and cheap; poor fit.review/text: I am a 44 year old man, about 200 lbs with an average size head. This helmet was not comfortable no matter how I adjusted it. Furthermore, it is extremely cheaply made. The plastic molding on the sides literally fell off (on both sides) 30 seconds after I first put it on.
