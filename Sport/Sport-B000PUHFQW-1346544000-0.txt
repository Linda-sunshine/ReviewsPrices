review/summary: NOT for Bikram Yogareview/text: I have use this mat since July 1 for Bikram Yoga. I started to notice the mat was absorbing sweat. I would clean with a diluted solution of witch hazel & place the mat on a chair in the sun daily to dry out. Now 2 months later I have to soak up the sweat with a dry towel before drying in the sun and the mat smells funky. If you are NOT practicing yoga in a heated room, you will love this mat. But if you ARE practicing in a heated room pick another mat.
