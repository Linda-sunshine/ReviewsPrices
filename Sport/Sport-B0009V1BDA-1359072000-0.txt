review/summary: Very easy to assemble and a perfect size for a boat or apt.review/text: We bought this grill for our houseboat and really like the size, although it is a tad low to the ground. I put it together in fifteen to twenty minutes and it seems pretty sturdy. The grill surface is plenty big for a small get together. We haven't used it yet but it looks like a good product for a good price. I ordered one that had a damaged box (to save $10) and it was still perfect when I opened the box.
