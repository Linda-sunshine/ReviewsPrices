review/summary: Taurus Judge w/2" chamber & barrelreview/text: Just wanted to say real quick that this is pretty kick-ass with the Taurus Judge!Mine has a 2" chamber, and I believe that is about the length of the barrel as well.Doesn't stick out at all. The retention button is simple to use and works great.I snapped this guy onto Blackhawk's thigh rig, and it's perfect for anyonewanting to show off that amusing, and big-ol Judge!Happy shooting!
