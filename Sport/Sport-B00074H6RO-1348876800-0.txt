review/summary: Very comfortable...my second pair!review/text: I am a personal trainer and avid fitness buff. I have used many different gloves, but one of the things I like about these is that they don't dig into the crease of your thumb like so many others do. My only suggestion to anyone looking to purchase this brand is to consider the sizing. I have a small hand, but find the XXLs to be the most comfortable fit, I can get them on and off when my hand is sweaty. This seller did a great job of timely delivery too.
