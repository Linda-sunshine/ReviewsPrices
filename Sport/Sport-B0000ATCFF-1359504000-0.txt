review/summary: Look cool, butreview/text: I think Chuck's look cool, which is why I bought these, but I had no idea they were so uncomfortable. If you can deal with a shoe that has almost no cushion and no arch, then by all means get them (I still wear them every once in a while). But if comfort is a big thing to you, I would look elsewhere.
