review/summary: Favorite Underwear...review/text: These have quickly become my favorite underwear. I first read about them in a motorcycle magazine stating they dried so fast so they were great for traveling by motorcycle... you could handwash one pair a night and they'd be dry in a few hours and ready to pack up. I've yet to wash and air dry them but comfort-wise they are great and I love them. I tried out one pair at first and now I own a bunch. These are all I'll be buying for a while.
