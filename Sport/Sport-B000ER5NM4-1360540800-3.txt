review/summary: Favorite pants!review/text: I am 6&#34; tall and require a 36&#34; inseam, so naturally it is hard to find pants to fit me. Usually once I do, I keep buying the same thing because I know it will work. I found these pants a few years ago, and now I buy two pairs every year and wear them to death! I love the bit of stretch, they hold everything in, are very flattering and best of all--they come all the way to the floor!
