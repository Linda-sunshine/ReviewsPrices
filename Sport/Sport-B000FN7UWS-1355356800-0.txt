review/summary: Simple, effectivereview/text: I carry this bottle almost every day. I like having one, to save from using bottled water, and wasting both the money buying it and the trash throwing it out. Additionally, of course, this one could be used in a SHTF scenario for boiling water and the like, since it's steel. I did notice a bit of a taste in the water when first used, but I don't anymore. Cap screws on securely, and I've found that the loop is helpful not only to secure the bottle somewhere, but as a grip to open it if the cap is on too tight. Good purchase if you need something to carry your water in. Don't buy it for hot drinks, as mentioned above, this bottle gets HOT fast when filled with something hot - even when washing in hot water.
