review/summary: works less than half of the time.review/text: This HRM is awful. of the last 10 times I've used it, it has only worked 4 times. I've used HRM's before, I know I'm using it correctly. It rarely works at all. At first, it seemed to work well, worked with the gym's ellipticals, treadmills, stairmasters, etc. Now it barely registers AT ALL, and if it does, it says my HR is 87 when I am FULL ON RUNNING. What a waste of money.
