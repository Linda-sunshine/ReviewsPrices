review/summary: lasted 13 monthsreview/text: I have had this watch for a little over a year and has been satisfactory. The readings were sometimes all over the place so I replaced the battery on the strap at least twice during that time. Here lately the chest strap and watch have not been syncing so I replaced the watch battery even though it still had bright appearance. Still not syncing. Expected it to last a little longer than it did. Looking at Polar now to see if longer lasting.
