review/summary: Just what you needreview/text: I bought this heart rate monitor after my old one died(No user replaceable battery) and saw reviews that it did not work at a low heart rate. I have seen no problems with it, as soon as i wet the monitor and put it on its reading my rate almost instantly. The controls are pretty simple and easy to use, the display is large so that when you are working out you can read it with a quick glance. The band also syncs up with other devices such as treadmills, ellipticals, etc. Only draw back i can see, is that to be able to tell how long you have been running, avg heart rate, min/max heart rate you need to stop the watch and hold down the button to get a read out, but seems a small price to pay.
