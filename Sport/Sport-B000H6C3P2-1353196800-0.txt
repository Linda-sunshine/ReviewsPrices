review/summary: buy this and you won't regretreview/text: When I was looking into buying a rubber grip, I had a hard time deciding between this and the Ergo grip. Spoke with a few shooters and they recommended the Ergo grip. Purchased that, and they're definitely right about how great it'd feel in the hand. However, fit and finish on the Ergo grip was terrible. I went ahead and order Hogue to replace the Ergo and I regretted ordering the Ergo grip to begin with. This Hogue Rubber grip felt just as good in my hand and fit and finish was top notch. Highly recommended if you're in the market for a soft grip.
