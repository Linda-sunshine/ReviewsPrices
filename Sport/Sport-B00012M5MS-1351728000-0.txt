review/summary: Great for the price, buy multiples and be happy with a low $ helmet that doesn't suckreview/text: There are some bike parts I won't skimp on (like cranksets and hubs), but helmets are one area where your money stretches quite far. I suppose since it's just made of foam and plastic, they make a ton of cash anyway, and with all the gov. regs. they can't cut too many corners. Some low$ helmets are really yucky, with bad strap hardware, or plastic covers that peel off when the tape gets hot. This one is good and I own several. They are marketed at hardware stores and Walmarts for about $15-20.I think it looks ok, none of the foam has cracked in about 1 year. The pointy shapes sometimes get busted on helmets due to carrying around in cars or putting in storage boxes. So far so good. The fit is way above many other walmart and dept. store issue helmets, with a little knob in the back, like a construction helmet. This saves a lot of time when you are wearing a hair cover, motorcycle helmet liner, or mosquito net. This helmet is comfortable and worth the cash. Buy a few. They look as good as many $60-80 mtn bike helmets, aren't too "bulky" (less dorky), the strap system is GOOD, and the visor stays put. It's really just for looks but it is pinned to the plastic so it doesn't fall off. You can pick it off if you want to use hunting jackets with hoods or put a rain cover over it. Buy 3 and still cheaper than one "shop" helmet. Then you can always have a clean one and keep a spare at work or something, or match colors to your bike or riding gear.
