review/summary: Amazingly effectivereview/text: These work so well it's somewhat disorienting--almost like being in a sensory deprivation device or as if you are far, far away and isolated from the rest of the world. I use them to block out the noise of very loud power tools. Their sound would be unbearable without some kind of auditory shielding and these heavy duty earmuffs are more than up to the task.
