review/summary: Not Bad, But Not For Reasons You Might Thinkreview/text: Overall this is a nice product. It is made from quality materials as opposed to products from other vendors. Therefore, from a product perspective it is top notch. From a functional perspective you need to understand what you are getting into. If you sit on this for long periods as I do, you may find that you legs and buttocks get numb. Possibly this is due to concentrated pressure in a small area of the buttocks. Also, you might find your pants riding up in an uncomfortable manner requiring you to stand and adjust often. A side effect of these issues (which you might consider a benefit) is that it forces me to "adjust" and "stand" often. I find my self standing during conference calls and I'm constantly re-adjusting myself toward the center of the ball. Also, I am much more aware of my posture because if you lean forward or slump, it is somewhat uncomfortable so I find myself sitting more erect which is the goal anyway. I've only been using it for a few weeks in the office, but so far I think the primary benefit is that it makes me more aware of my posture and to some respect makes me sit in a more health position.
