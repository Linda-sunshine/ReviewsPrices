review/summary: Doesn't do muchreview/text: The band takes quite a bit of adjusting on my body to get it to register. I also have to hold the watch close to the band to make it register. I wish it counted calories. If it does it is to hard to figure out.The one thing that I do like about this product is that it wirelessly links up with most of the cardio machines at the gym. I can not get an accurate reading on the machines when I hold the handles. This product links up with the machine and displays my heart rate constantly.I do not think it was worth the money.
