review/summary: Was Skepticalreview/text: Have owned a pair of aviator Ray Ban's since I was a teenager. In fact, I have the original lenses crammed into a pair of walmart sunglass frames. Obviously, I was in need of new shades so I proceeded to try and find the best deal I could (they've gone up since the 80's (: As soon as the Ray Ban's arrived I went to several sites to read about knockoffs and fakes and to compare what I had bought with what other had been ripped off on. These Aviators are 100% authentic in looks, feel and minute details. Very pleased with my purchase and with this Amazon merchant, very nice!!
