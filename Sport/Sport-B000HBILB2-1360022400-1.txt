review/summary: good investmentreview/text: This is the first time that I have purchased an air mattress but I have slept on a number of them over the years so I knew what I was looking for.I needed a twin size air mattress with its own pump.The pump for this airbed is actually internal, it has a plug for an outlet that has a little compartment which is also internal with the pump.It took about 3 minutes to fully inflate. The pump also has a deflation pump that took even less time than inflation.The pump is loud but since it is only on for a couple of minutes that wasn't a deterrment.Since the airbed is so thick it is comfortable as far as air mattress go, I used it for 2 nights and felt fine.My only gripe is that the storage bag is too small - I wasn't able to fold the air mattress back up to its original size so that it would fit in the bag.Overall, I am very happy with this mattress and hope it lasts for a few years for occasional use.
