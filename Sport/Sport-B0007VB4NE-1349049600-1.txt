review/summary: It was not what the picture showed or describedreview/text: The chair was very small and unfortunately the ball was not even big enough to fill up the bottom of the chair it rolled around. I sit on a balance ball all day at work already so I thought this chair would be great so I could turn from side to side at my desk with no worry off falling over:), however when I received the item and took it out of the box I was very very disappointed, the ball that came with the chair was maybe the size of a regular basketball so it didn't even fill the entire bottom of the chair up. Very unhappy and will not be ordering another item from them
