review/summary: My favorite pocket knifereview/text: Resilient, durable, sharp and easy to open. I have had one of these on my person for most of the last ten years. It is a nice little blade that isn't too fancy to use or lose. The safety is a bit odd but you get used to it, I wouldn't want to carry it in a pocket without the safety on.
