review/summary: Excellent little knifereview/text: All three of us, my son, myself, and my husband carry one of these knives . I carry mine on my keychain and hubby keeps his always in his pocket. I bought him the camo one to replace the one he had taken away from him at the airport when we took our cruise last year. It would have cost him $20.00 to have the knife checked so he opted to give it up. If you are flying any time soon, please leave your little swiss army knife behind or you will lose it.
