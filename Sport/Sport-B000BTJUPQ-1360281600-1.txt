review/summary: Ok product, but great price, and fast shipping!review/text: I guess you get what you pay for. Amazon definitely had a really good price, but this product, 2 days after the 30 day window, had some issues. Of course, if you Google it (which I should have done first) you'll find it's a common issue. The bow string doesn't hold up and doesn't take much to wear. One it starts wearing down, the arrows don't lock in very well, which can be a safety concern. Also, the bow string slipped off the wheel, which was a huge pain. I contacted Barnett, though, and they sent me a replacement bow string assembly. All in all, though, this is about the best bow you can get under 25lbs.
