review/summary: Great water bottle, but not perfectreview/text: I really enjoyed using this water bottle, and it's perfect except for the mouthpiece. It can grow fungus, which is disgusting, and I had to replace it. Not a very hygienic bottle, but otherwise very nice to use. I like how it closes the nozzle completely, pinching it so no spills occur.
