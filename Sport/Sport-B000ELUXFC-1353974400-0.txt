review/summary: Go Ahead and Buy it....review/text: I shopped around for a bike rack for our two bikes. We were moving across the country and decided to take our bikes instead of selling them.I shopped on line and found this one right away but wanted to see if I could find it locally I and not wait for it to be shipped. I called some of the "bike" shops in my area. They had racks that were anywhere from $60-$400. When I ask for this model the retailers discouraged me from using it.I came back to Amazon after not finding this anywhere else.I ordered on Saturday Afternoon and paid a little extra for the Two-Day Shipping. It arrived early on Monday morning.There is a link somewhere on the web for all of the vehicles that the rack will fit. It is listed on the entire back of the box. The install was easy. Just make sure to read the directions. We drove across the country with the two bikes. We made a "rule" to tighten the straps at each stop for gas or food. We found that the straps were still tight and we did not need to make any adjustments. Just make sure if you have Items you "need" frequently travel with those in the front with you, as you will need to remove the rack to get into your trunk. We have arrive to our destination and continue to put the rack on the car for trips where we think we may use our bikes.We also used a bike lock to secure them to the rack for safety.Great Buy... Great Price.
