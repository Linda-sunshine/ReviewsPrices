review/summary: Harbinger Pro FlexClosure Wash & Dry Glove (Black, Small)review/text: good material, it is a bit unconfortable while working out because the interior sewing lines can print lines on your hand. That makes me unconfortable. some people cares, some don't. you have to judge it yourself.
