review/summary: Kept working for 12 hours plusreview/text: These hand warmers were amazing! Used for skiing on a very cold day (single digits). They kept my hands nice and toasty. I skied for the day and after I came home, they were still working! They lasted 12 hours plus. I used them the whole night keeping my hands and feet warm. They even warmed up my bed before I got into it! These are not that expensive and well worth what I paid for them.
