review/summary: HeatMaxreview/text: I've skied for years being the tough guy, occasionally enduring cold hands. Finally one sub zero day, I bought one packet of hand warmers and was hooked. I've used them about once a week all this winter. Warm hands=warm body. Resorts sell these lifesavers at $6 to $9 dollars each. Having my own stash in my ski gear bag is great! Highly recommended!
