review/summary: Worked for about 3 monthsreview/text: This heart rate monitor worked pretty well for about 3 months and started just not working as well. I've tried tightening the strap adding water, saline solution, saliva, and finally electrocardiogram gel. Now that the weather's turned a little cooler, it's basically useless. I've got a buddy that's had the same HRM for years.I don't think that 3 months is a reasonable working life for a heart rate monitor at any price point.
