review/summary: Love this Productreview/text: This is the second one I have owned. I wore the first one for 3 years before it took a bath in the toilet. I wear this pedometer everyday. The clamp on the leash eventually breaks, thus the demise of my first pedometer. The clamp is made of plastic and will wear out and break. I had replaced the leash several times, but didn't have a spare at the time.I love the software and keeping track of your steps on the computer. It's a great product, especially if you're kinda Geeky, like me.I will always have one of these. It's very motivational.
