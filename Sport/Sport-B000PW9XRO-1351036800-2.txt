review/summary: Hatch Specialist- Great Fishing Glovesreview/text: Out of the many pairs I have worn over the years, these are by far the nicest gloves for fishing I have owned. They are flexible, durable, warm enough for cool weather, cool enough for summer, and very comfortable. I wear them year round,freezing temperatures excluded. Great finger protection for casting heavier weights with braided line. I also love them for hand protection and gripping ability when landed a lively fish. I have bought multiple pairs to make sure I can always have a pair handy, and I have bought them for friends since they are so nice. I rarely find any product to be clearly superior to any others I have tried, but I haven't worn any that are comparable.
