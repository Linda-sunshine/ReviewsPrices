review/summary: Harbinger Pro weight glovesreview/text: In an effort to find a replacement for my Valeo Ocelot gloves that are no longer produced, this pair had similar qualities. However, as one reviewer previously stated the gloves fit really tight at the webbing of of the hands and I needed to cut one of the gloves between one of the figures to alleviate the pinching. Also, at the wrist when pulling the gloves on the material has separated, but I've also been able to fix this.
