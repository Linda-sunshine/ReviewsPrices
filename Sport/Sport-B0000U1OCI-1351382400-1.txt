review/summary: Omron HJ-112 pedometerreview/text: This pedometer is the best! Not only is it easy to read, but it is accurate as well. I clip it onbefore I head out on any walk. I wear it at work also to check the steps used during the day. If youare looking for an easy to read, light and accurate pedometer, this is the one for you!
