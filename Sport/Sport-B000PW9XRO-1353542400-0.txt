review/summary: Sleek, high-dexterity glovesreview/text: I have been searching for some sleek-looking gloves that allow for a high amount of dexterity while wearing. Love these Hatch gloves, they are exactly what I was looking for. The fit is exceptional; these really are the most unobtrusive gloves I have owned. As an added bonus, as other reviews have mentioned, you can use a touchscreen smartphone while wearing these.Some details about the fit, since that was the most important factor during my search. There were two different recommended measuring systems:1) Spread fingers, measure from the tip of the pinkie to the tip of the thumb. My measurement was 9 inches.2) Measure circumference of the hand, just above (distal from) the thumb. My measurement was approx. 8.5 inches.Given those measurements and the conflicting reviews on Amazon about these gloves fitting too large or too small, I decided to order both a Large and X-Large. The fit between these two sizes is very similar, but the Large was just perfect (returning the XL now). So, given the above measurements, Large should fit well. Hopefully, that helps someone out there with similar hands who is evaluating these gloves.Anywho, I love these gloves. I'm very pleased with this purchase!
