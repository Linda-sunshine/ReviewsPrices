review/summary: Great Scooter.review/text: My boys (5 and 7) both love this scooter. I got one for each of them. The only thing I would recommend is tightening the handle bar after you raise it up. It seems tight out of the package, but it easily loosens. The directions recommend this, but I forgot to do it so my son's adjustment bolt and quick-release came off after he rode it for a little while. Great buy!
