review/summary: Quality and Inexpensive.review/text: I have several of these snakes in various calibers and use them quite often. While these bore snakes are inexpensive, they do their job wonderfully. The durable woven construction takes the abuse of cleaning without any problems. The integrated brass brush works great for scrubbing out the burned on carbon deposits that would be otherwise left behind with the old cleaning patches.
