review/summary: Not Impressedreview/text: Took me awhile to figure out how the set up for the Schraeder valves on my bike.Once I did I discovered that it still was a pain to use.Its difficult to get the pump to seal so you can inflate. I don't have a problem deflating the tire while using this pump.When I do get it hooked up properly and inflated, once finished the pump latches onto the valve and nothing short of unscrewing the cap and taking the pump parts off individually will release its grip.Sorry Topeak, not a fan.
