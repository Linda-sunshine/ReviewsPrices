review/summary: Perfect Day To Day Water Bottlereview/text: I purchased the CamelBak Better Bottle because, as a college student, I'm always looking for ways to save money. One of my biggest expenses was buying drinks on campus. So, after lugging around a SmartWater bottle for a week or so and finding it not working out I looked to Amazon to find a water bottle to suit my needs. I settled on the CamelBak and I've been very happy so far. It's dishwasher safe, which was a big plus for me, and I really like the spill proof, bite valve design. I have the Black 1 Liter bottle and I find it to last a decent amount of time when it's filled all the way. I haven't had any drops yet, but I'm sure when that happens the bottle will hold up. It feels very study and well made and I especially like the loop for grabbing it; it's the perfect size and allows for a quick pick up when in a hurry. Overall, if you're looking for a well made, day to day water bottle, you can't go wrong with this bottle.
