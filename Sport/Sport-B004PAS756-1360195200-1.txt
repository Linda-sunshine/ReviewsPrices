review/summary: insane.enough said.review/text: i started this work on monday. nearly died. only got ten minutes into it it was that intense. did on wednesday again. got through all of it even though i can barely walk because my quads are so sore. i love this workout. i can barely lift my arms. i can feel it working right away. i am a new college graduate trying to loose all the fat gain and i'm excited to see the results of this workout.
