review/summary: OUCH!!! NOT FOR CHILDRENreview/text: I bought 4 of these bottles. One for myself, and three for my children. Using it one day, I was drinking from it and my lip got suctioned onto the spout. It hurt soooo bad. It got stuck and my lip was pinched so hard it bled. I thought it wouldn't happen again, and blamed it on my clumsy nature. Then, a month later my 4 year old started screaming from the back seat. Her lip was stuck in the neck of the spout like mine had! It was aweful because she couldn't tell me what was going on since her lip was being pinched. She too removed the bottle via blood and a rip on her lip. Please beware when you purchase this bottle that you should only squirt water into your mouth, not suck from it! SHAME on Polar company. I have used many, many water bottles from various companies in my lifetime and this has never happened.
