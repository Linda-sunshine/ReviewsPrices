review/summary: Only for narrow feetreview/text: I've never bought gold toe before so I can't comment on how they've changed but the socks I received seemed very well made. Nice and study, comfortable fabric.However...I bought them because I have size 16 feet. These socks would be perfect if you have long narrow feet but I'm 6'5" and these are much too constricting. The designers should realize that people who have size 16 feet usually have wide feet with bigger calfs and ankles.
