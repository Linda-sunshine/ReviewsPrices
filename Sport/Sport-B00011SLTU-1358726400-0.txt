review/summary: Don't like it as much as the cellidor SDreview/text: So you gain a nice, checkered, flatter surface on your classic SD. You lose your toothpick and your tweezers. Sound like a good deal on a multi tool that is that thin and small to begin with?Honest, I was about to order one. How cool would it be to have a larger Alox tool AND it's little brother? How cute would that be if they matched?! But, then I thought about how not having the extra few tools would stink, added to the fact that the classic SD is already super tiny to begin with. So tiny, it literally will disappear if misplaced.. It just didn't make any sense to me.My guess is that if you have an Alox style companion to this, you might want it. But I do, and I don't want it for the reasons listed. It simply doesn't add any value when you lose tools on an already super slim product. You're paying more for less, essentially. I don't like throwing money away, so I'll stick with my classic SD cellidor scales for now. My honest opinion of course. Take with a grain of salt.
