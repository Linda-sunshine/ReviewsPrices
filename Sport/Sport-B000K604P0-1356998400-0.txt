review/summary: Just what I wanted.review/text: Love this thing! It goes everywhere with me. Fits perfectly in the car cup holder. Keeps my water ice cold for 8+ hours. Still icy on the nightstand overnight, even with the lid open and a straw inserted through the handy hole. As others have said, dont't overfill or it will dribble a bit around the rim. Have not really tried for hot items.
