review/summary: GREAT`review/text: I got these for my husband. He works on planes (avionics) and sometimes has to be out in the cold on the flight line to finish some repairs.He LOVES these. I asked him how these were working out and he said &#34;GREAT!&#34; really quickly hehe.. They keep him warm and last all day (he works many 10-12 hour days).He's shared them with co workers and they like them, too. He said - 'it lasts 10 hours. You just need to shake it a bit to re-warm'He also said that the one draw-back is that it takes 15-30 minutes to heat up, but he loves that it lasts 10 hours.We have weather that goes below zero here in the winter and have strong winds frequently as well. I'm pleased are working well to keep the hubby warm and comfortable while he's working hard :)
