review/summary: Great Looking Watch & Oh What a Nice Price!review/text: How Invicta avoids patent infringment issues due to it looking just like the Rolex I will never know. But the Invicta looks great and has the same mass as the Rolex. Look if you just can't live without the Rolex name on your wrist, then by all means go ahead and pay the $7,000+ price. For me, at $97 including shipping, I'm going with Invicta. It looks great and so does my wallet!
