review/summary: fingers crossedreview/text: I just ordered this, hasn't come in the mail yet. I am a beginner of this work out, I have been seeing this on TV, and would constantly say this is a lie, those results aren't real. I am an over weight (150lb (aiming for 112-127 at least))5ft tall girl, I have been trying to lose weight, but was just never really motivated and could not find the right workouts for myself, well I'm done sitting on the couch waiting for things to change. I am hoping that once trying this, I will get the results I am looking for. once I get this going I will color the stars it deserves.
