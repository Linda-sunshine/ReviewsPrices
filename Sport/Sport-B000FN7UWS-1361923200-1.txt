review/summary: Buy this one with the 3.0 cap, not the 2.0 capreview/text: Bought this for my son's lunches at school. I picked the unpainted one and I like the fact that I don't have to worry about paint chipping off -- something I noticed on the other kids' painted Klean Kanteens that are colored.Why only 3 stars? Well, there is a tiny rubbery silicone plug that covers a hole on the cap. The plug controls the rate of flow - not a big deal for me. But somehow, the plug came off and when he went to take a sip, his shirt was drenched. The cap was screwed on tight, so the culprit was the tiny plug. I think my son picked it off.Well, I got a new cap -- this time the 3.0 cap. It's supposed to have a better flow rate and less noisy drinking. Problem is it also has a small silicone plug, but this time it looks less accessible. So hopefully there won't be any accidents with this new 3.0 cap.
