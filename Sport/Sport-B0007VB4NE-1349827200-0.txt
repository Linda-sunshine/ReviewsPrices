review/summary: Some people love it, but not for everyone.review/text: We now have a total of 5 ball chairs in the office. Since they tend to sit too low, we also ordered the risers which add a couple of inches. It is not much, but it is better than nothing.Of the 5 chairs, only two people use it the entire day. Another uses it for only an hour because it does make you use your core muscles and can make you tired. The chair forces you to sit up straight or you fall off. You really do not use the back support at all. One user says it stopped their shoulder pain and another says it relieves their back pain.The chairs are not for everyone. If you like to sit back and relax in a chair or want to recline, this is not the chair for you. I also do not feel like the chair is comfortable for men, but we do have one man using the chair.While the chairs look odd in the pictures, the black chairs blend into the office and do not stand out as odd looking. Most people don't even notice the chairs are different, other than most users now have two chairs at their desks because they switch back and forth.The price of a ball chair is so much cheaper than the $700 ergonomic chairs we have.I would recommend you order one and have people test it out before buying more.A couple of the chairs came with hardware that was loose in the box so be careful to find them. The newer chairs come with the hardware in a plastic bag, but the nuts that hold the retaining bar are too small. We had to replace them.
