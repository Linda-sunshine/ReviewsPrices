review/summary: Cold fluids from a durable containerreview/text: When I'm road biking on hot summer days, the last thing I want from my water bottle is hot water. That's what I was getting from my other water bottle within twenty minutes. Since purchasing this bottle, I haven't had to worry about my next drink--I know it'll be cold throughout my 30-mile rides.
