review/summary: Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pumpreview/text: Arrived quickly and every bit as advertised! I use this for my truck at work and it is absolutely comfortable and nicely built! I'm very happy with this purchase.There is a rotating control for the air pressure in the mattress once you have inflated it that allows you to adjust it to the level of comfort that suits you. It can also be used to let the air out to deflate the mattress completely, should you no longer be near an electric outlet. The supplied cord tucks neatly out of the way into a compartment at the head of the mattress and is easily accessed.Cons: I don't really consider these to be &#34;cons&#34;, but may make a difference to some:1) There is a rubber odor that can be bothersome to some who have migraines caused by strong scents. Or, to people that just don't like strong odors. You will definitely smell it when you first use it. I have only used this a couple of times, and I did inflate it and allowed it to air out some in an attempt to curb it. I haven't had it long enough to see if it wears off eventually, but I will update if it does. I use it really only once a week. I think I'm used to it as it didn't keep me awake when I slept on it.2) It's a little loud, ok more than a little when inflating it and deflating it using the motor. Not overly, but if you have to use it for yourself/guests, and you need to be quiet, then inflate it ahead of time when it won't disturb others because it will wake the house up. Think &#34;noisy vacuum cleaner&#34; to give you an idea of what I mean by loud. That's probably accurate.Other than that - I highly recommend it! Enjoy!
