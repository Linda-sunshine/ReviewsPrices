review/summary: Heavier than I expected, and that's a good thingreview/text: The only thing stopping this from getting five stars is that the grill grates warranty specifically does not allow for you to use pots or pans on them. Even though that would be a huge use for it. I know that there is a fixture to swap out a grate, but there really is no reason that these should be able to be used with a pot or pan. Otherwise it's easy lighting, easy setup and it rolls well. I bought it to use while camping. Obviously more drop off at a location camping, but with the wheels it can be used to be carried farther in. It will get use as a tailgate rig as well and it heats pretty evenly. The table pullouts are a great touch too.
