review/summary: This is the onereview/text: I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and needed to make sure I was getting my "10K steps" in per day. Well, I'm up and down on that goal according to my schedule. But I will say this: I have accidentally washed and dried this unit TWICE and it has come through without a trace of damage. I would recommend this product on that aspect alone.
