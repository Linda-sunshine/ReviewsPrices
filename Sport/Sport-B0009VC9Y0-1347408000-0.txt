review/summary: Awesome Little Guyreview/text: Got this as a groomsman gift and love it. It's small and sleek and the action is very quick with the assist spring. Kershaw customer service is awesome if you ever have any problems. My only issue is that the clips makes the knife sit up pretty high in the pocket, but with this finish it still goes well with a pair of khakis. I refinished mine recently, check out the user picture.If you ever need to disassemble, the pivot screw can be very difficult to loosen and unscrew because the "nut" is free floating and spins with the screw. Here's the trick: take off the clip, cut a piece of rubber band and fold it over, place it over the "nut" side and screw the clip back on, locking the rubber band in place. Now you can unscrew the pivot while the rubber band holds the other side in place.
