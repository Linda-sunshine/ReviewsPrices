review/summary: Nice Mirrorreview/text: It has a big field of view and installed very easily onto my bicycle handle. Just make sure you have a hold at the end of your bicycle bar and it will install. Comes with two inserts. My mountain bicycle used the bigger of the two. You stick it into the handle bar and keep twisting the allen wrench until it expands inslde the handle bars and has a nice tight fit. I seem to have to adjust it everytime I go for a ride but I do bump it a lot. I can ride through the neighborhood and easily see anything approaching behind me with this. Well worth for the piece of mind it provides.
