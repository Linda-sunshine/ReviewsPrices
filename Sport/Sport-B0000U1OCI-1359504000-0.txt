review/summary: Keep Your Resolution to Get Healthy!review/text: I LOVE this pedometer! It is such a simple little tool to help you with your fitness - whether you are looking to maintain your activity level or are just setting out.The best features:*Small (fits easily in the palm of my hand) and lightweight.*Easy to read instructions, easy setup.*Accurate reading, even in pocket, backback, purse. Also comes with a clip.*Memory function - track your daily steps over the previous 7 days.*Calories burned function - this is a great feature to learn how much energy it takes to burn calories.One drawback, if you can call it that, is that it is so small and so easily fits in my pocket that I have have accidentally washed TWO pedometers. Needless to say it is not waterproof.If you are even considering buying a pedometer to help with your fitness - get this now! It's the perfect time to start getting healthy!
