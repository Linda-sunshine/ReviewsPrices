review/summary: Works wondersreview/text: I shoot Cowboy Action matches with black powder cartridges. A typical club match is about sixty (pistol caliber) rifle shots, sixty handgun shots in to six shooters and around 25 shotgun rounds.With BP this makes for messy shootin' irons. I use two boresnakes for the rifle, two for the revolvers and two for the shotgun, the first one is to clean the main mess of the black powder residue, the second to finish the cleaning and to add a little oil. Then I toss 'em in the washing machine, each in a mesh bag so they don't look like mating anacondas after the spin cycle and I'm done.After a match my four firearms are cleaned in an hour, it used to take about an hour per gun and then a repeat performance the next day to make sure the black powder goo isn't rusting the guns. And it doesn't take much time for a firearm to rust after BP. The Boresnake is faster, sure, but the important thing is, it works better. One part Ballistol to nine or ten parts water, sop the front end of the Boresnake well, it comes out looking like an old fashioned coal miner, the second snake finishes the job, the water evaporates, leving a thin coat of the Ballistol oil. Wipe down the outside and the shooin' irons are ready for the next match.
