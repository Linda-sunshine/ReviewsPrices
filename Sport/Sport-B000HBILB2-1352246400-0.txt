review/summary: Air bed exceeds expectations!review/text: The air bed was absolutely easy to use and inflated in less than a minute. I use it as a temp bed and only had add air maybe once a week, if that. COMFORTABLE!! It has a tight seal, strong bonded seems, and does well with fitted sheets. I recommend a foam pad for extra added comfort. Definitely worth every dollar!!!
