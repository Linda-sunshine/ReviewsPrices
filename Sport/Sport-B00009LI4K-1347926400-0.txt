review/summary: This is a life saver.review/text: The Peltor ear protector is a must for anyone sensitive to environmental noise. I am particularly sensitive to keyboard noise at work and dogs barking. The Peltor doesn't block out all noise - I didn't expect it to - but when I also put those little purple foam things in my ear, it blocks out almost all noise [and I only do this sitting at home or at work :)]. If I use earbuds playing music under the Peltors, I'm not disturbed by any noise. I have smallish ears and this model is fairly comfortable. Of course, I look a bit dorky at work, but lowering my stress is more important.
