review/summary: Better than nothing?review/text: Arrived as scheduled and product matches description. Is a bit "lumpy" but smooths out eventually. Pillow is a bit better than nothing. Ultimately used it as a top pillow with a bulky shirt underneath. The larger size might be better. Fortunately pillow is light weight and wraps up in my sleeping bag sack fine. Cost is not a big issue and it is usable but a pillow case from home with clothing inside might be a better option.
