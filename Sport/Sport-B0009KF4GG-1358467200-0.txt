review/summary: 58 year old husbands first Swiss Army Knife -he was a kid for a day!review/text: My husband mentioned he'd never had a swiss army knife so I bought this one for him. I couldn't decide what to get him but since he's a computer programmer I thought he woud use some of these tools.He still hasn't used it, he is trying to find a few hidden tools. Like the scissors. It has been a month and he is still playing with it. The knife came with a guide where each item is stored, which helped.The purchase through Amazon was delivered within a few days. Quicker than they expected it to be.The only negative point I can make (and he does too) is that it is quite difficult to expand items. They are all squeezed in and it is taking awhile for them to loosen up I suggested WD-40 but he said &#34;never mind, it's just fine&#34;.I believe he really does like this. It is quite heavy to keep in your pocket and I don't know if you would be able to go through airline security with it.This was quite an inexpensive Christmas Present. He put everything else to the side and tried picking items open, scouting for his scissors still! He's happy, I'm happy. Perhaps it could come pre-lubricated, somehow. That is my only suggestion.
