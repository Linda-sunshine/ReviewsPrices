review/summary: Value for money, but not superreview/text: The price is right on this helmet and it looks to be completely decent in a crash, the wheel they have for sizing makes getting the proper fit easy.on the con side, i had to return the first one that came as one of the plastic bits that protects the foam shell had fallen off in transit (it's opposite side partner was falling off as well), that the hard plastic doesn't provide much of the protection in a crash, wasn't a big deal but does lead one to believe that it isn't a super quality product.I would probably buy again just as it is so inexpensive compared to other comparable products, but you ain't buying a BMW here, more like 15 year old Corolla.
