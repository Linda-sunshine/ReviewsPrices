review/summary: Pretty standard jumpropereview/text: Title says it all. This rope gets the job done. Tailoring it to my size was extremely simple and only required 5 minutes of my time, a quarter, a pair of scissors, and pliers. I've been using it for two weeks now and it seems to be pretty durable. For the price, I would definitely buy another one if this one were to break.This is absolutely a quality product.
