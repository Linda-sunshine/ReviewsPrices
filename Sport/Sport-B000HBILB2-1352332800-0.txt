review/summary: Soft & Comfyreview/text: While I was waiting FOREVER for my stupid movers to deliver my stuff, I had been sleeping on the floor using the 3" memory foam mattress pad I'd also purchased from Amazon. But sadly it just wasn't cutting it, so I bought this airbed. Put the foam pad on top and it was fabulous! UNTIL... one of my cats stuck a claw into the bed!!! I couldn't figure out how to make the patches work and I had no glue, but since I wake up every hour from fibromyalgia conditions, I would just reinflate the bed again until it was firm. My cats loved it! I love my cats but wanted to rip their nails out after that! At some point I'll patch the tiny hole and it will be good to go! I would recommend it to anyone.
