review/summary: Great extra bed or travel bedreview/text: I took this with me on a vacation for our guest to use. But, it is so comfortable that it turned out that I used it the whole week and gave the guest the actual regular mattress bed and used this air mattress instead. I have used it for 3 different 1 week vacations and have had no problems with it. It even deflates electrically so it fits back into the travel bag it came with. Amazing deal.
