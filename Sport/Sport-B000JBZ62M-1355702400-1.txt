review/summary: Comfortable, Cool, Extremely Comfortablereview/text: I thru-hiked the entire 2,184 miles of the Appalachian Trail wearing these shorts, and they are still in remarkable condition. They got snagged on branches, they rubbed against rocks, they were probably even exposed to a few fire ambers...and yet the material doesn't show any undue signs of wear or abrasion anywhere. I'm very impressed by their durability.I wore them in 100-105F degree weather and the mesh design kept me nice and cool. They dry reasonably quickly and they are surprisingly odor resistant, which was an unexpected and much appreciated surprise. The material feels really nice against the skin, which is obviously a plus.Overall, I love 'em, and I bought another pair a week ago :)
