review/summary: The answer to a good nights sleepreview/text: I like to travel light when camping and carrying a full size pillow for each person just took up too much room.This pillow now stays permanently in my roll-up swag [bivvy bag, thermarest, sleeping and liner + pillow] and the whole lot rolls up to 75cm x 30cm [30 x 12 inches].No longer do I use my clothes as a pillow; another great product from Thermarest.
