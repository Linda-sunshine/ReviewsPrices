review/summary: Great product (for US)review/text: I've owned a few of these over the years (having managed to lose a couple) and I really like them - simple and they "just work". However, this model, unlike earlier ones, forces me to work in miles and inches, which for a Kiwi in NZ takes some getting used to ;0)
