review/summary: Locking mechanism not well designedreview/text: Knife is ok for a basic stainless steel blade. I've only had it two days so I can't comment on the durability. The auto open 'speed safe' functions well, opens simply, quickly and easily.My main gripe is the frame/thumb lock, which is a major deal. If you squeeze the handle hard (eg if you're really cutting something) then the frame lock goes in so far that it touches the other side of the frame and jams. I have to stick my car key in to open it again. I've have lots of knives and I thought Kershaw was a decent brand. I'm not saying they're junk (this is my first Kershaw knife) but if they are generally high quality then this is not a good example of their product. I'll stick to SpyderCo and Benchmade, neither of which have let me down yet.If you want to use this casually, to open boxes or cut string, then this is an ok deal. If you want a dependable knife for camping, etc, then I'd avoid it.
