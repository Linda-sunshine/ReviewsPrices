review/summary: surprisingly comfortablereview/text: As a member of BzzAgent, I am often presented with an opportunity to review various products. This time around, the product was Gold Toe socks.Mind you,I have worn plain white, over-the-calf, tube socks my entire life. Love 'em. Couldn't see ever wearing anything else. But hey... free socks! :) I'll try (almost) anything at least once.I have to say that these socks were surprisingly comfortable. It almost feels like you are wearing nothing at all, they are so thin. That is also their only drawback, however. I tend to work in cold climates, so thin definitely is not in! Come summertime, though, these socks are going to be my new go-to socks! :D
