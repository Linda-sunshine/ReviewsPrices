review/summary: KK great for bike touringreview/text: Bought the 800ml black version (matches the colour of my bike) and also a spare 800ml stainless steel version with matching bottle cages, for cycle touring - have scraped the black one a lot taking it in and out of bike bottle cage, so should probably have stuck with 2 x stainless steel.That said - the Kleen Kanteen is so much nicer to drink from than what I had used previously.Wish there was a 1.5 litre version of this product - had forgotten to bring along a spare 1.5 ltr bottle and ran out of water last weekend in the middle of no where...
