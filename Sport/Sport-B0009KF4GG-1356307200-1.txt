review/summary: Great Knifereview/text: I've carried Swiss Army knives for years and this is the best one I've owned. It has everything but the pliers, which would have made it hard to carry in my jeans pocket. It comes very sharp, as I managed to bump my finger on the short blade and sliced it right off the bat while examining the blades. This is the best practical pocket knife that fits in a pocket. Anything bigger would require a sheath. I've sent one knife in for repair and it was completely warrantied, as advertised. The scissors are sharp and handy. Recommended.
