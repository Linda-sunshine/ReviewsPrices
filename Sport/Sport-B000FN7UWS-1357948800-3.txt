review/summary: Amazingreview/text: This is amazing. It's constructed out of quality materials, does NOT leave an odor in your water, and does not leak. Oh and it's stainless steel, so I don't have to worry about the BPA in the plastic ones. Great everyday water bottle, haven't been anywhere without it. Fits great in my backpack. Easy to clean. Environmentally friendly, I can't ask for anything more, this is perfect!
