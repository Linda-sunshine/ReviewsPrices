review/summary: Small pump for small tires & small handsreview/text: If you have never seen how to switch a dual presta & schrader type pump then the cryptic directions are useless and bring it to a bike shop to show you how to set it up for schrader valve stems. The small design is nice, but realize if you have a larger tire on a crossover or mountain bike you will be pumping for a while, but that's better than walking back. It's 1/4 the size and weight of my top tube mounted Zefal pump. If you have large hands like me be careful as the pumping action on a large tire is easy and you tend to go fast and can pinch yourself during the monotonous pumping.
