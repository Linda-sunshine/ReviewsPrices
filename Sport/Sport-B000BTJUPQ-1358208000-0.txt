review/summary: 6 yr old son loves this AND use 28 inch arrows.review/text: When I bought this I had some trouble figuring out which length of arrows to purchase with it. You need 28 inch.... :) It is very sturdy and great fit and form for a youth. My 6 year old is a bit tall for his age, but has no problem with this bow at all. And the 18lb pull seems to be just right.I can see him using this till he is around 11 or 12. So he should get several years out of it.
