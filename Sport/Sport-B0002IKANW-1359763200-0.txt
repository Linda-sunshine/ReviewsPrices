review/summary: First rate snap caps that work exactly as they're supposed toreview/text: I recently purchased a new 9mm handgun and needed to practice loading and unloading, as well as getting accustomed to the trigger pull, and just generally familiarizing myself with the gun's operation before taking it to the range for live firing. I read the reviews on Amazon, and the A-Zoom snap caps looked like the best bet, so I ordered a set. I've been very pleased with them, especially the rubber primers that allow dry-firing without any risk of breaking the firing pin. I've given the snap caps a pretty good workout the past few days, and they're still working fine. There's some scratching of the brownish-red paint on the casing, but that's cosmetic only and doesn't affect the operation in any way.The snap caps are a first rate product, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again if I change calibers.
