review/summary: Water Bottle Usagereview/text: I bought this water bottle for my wife so she could ride her bicycle with me on hot days. It worked very well. I filled it with ice cubes and water and after a couple hours it still had ice cubes in it. I love the insulated bottle and even though it is plastic it does not have a plastic taste to it.
