review/summary: Fantastic Goggles, Great Price!review/text: Best Goggles I've Found! After returning to master's swimming, and trying to use Swede's, other swimmers said, "you have to get Aqua Spheres". That's what everyone seems to wear. I hadn't even heard of them. I tried the Cayenne first, because I liked the look better, but these fit me much better. SOOOO much more comfortable than just regular Speedo goggles that also leaked like crazy. I love these. I have since purchased the blue lens, and some of the kid's ones for my 4 year old. They are so much better, I don't care how they look :).
