review/summary: Good Pair of Glovesreview/text: I've used this pair of gloves extensively since I've bought them working on my car and at my job when it started getting cold and I am very plased. Work as they should just don't expect to wear them in the dead of winter. They are of pretty good quality for the price, the index finger has some stitching there that makes it a bit weird but overall pretty happy.
