review/summary: Great & easy installreview/text: Upon receiving this mirror (cheaper on Amazon then in stores), my husband installed them both in a matter of minutes on both bicycles. We went out for a ride and they worked great. We have had them approx 2-3 months and go riding recreationaly and they have held up without any problems. We are both happy with our purchase and feel safer with them on our bikes.
