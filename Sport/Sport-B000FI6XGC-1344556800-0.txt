review/summary: So much from so little!review/text: This is about the smallest lightest pump you're going to be able to get your hands on, and for the price, size and weight i think this combination is pretty much unbeatable. Very easy to use, was able to figure out how to change between presta and shrader valves really quickly without any instructions, also great for pumping up balls! just insert the needle into the shrader valve and you're good to go. As this is so small it dig take a couple of hundred pumps to get a completely flat mountain bike tire up to 50 psi. However i wouldn't be expecting this thing to do much better as it's meant to be carried on the frame of your bike with the included mount. Overall excellent product, highly recommended especially for road cyclists as its ohhhh sooo light! But also for an everyday pump around the house as it has so many applications.
