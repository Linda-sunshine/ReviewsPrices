review/summary: Jury still out...review/text: The first one had a bad seam apparently, and wouldn't hold air for long. There was no patch kit or any paperwork in the package. Amazon was great and sent us another one quickly (while the defective one was still in transit, the new one arrived). The new one seems better. It had an instruction booklet and a patch kit and so far it holds air. It's a nice high bed, twin sheets fit perfectly, and hopefully this one will do ok. If it does it's a great bed for company use, when you have a crowd and run out of space.
