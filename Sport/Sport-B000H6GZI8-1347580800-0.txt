review/summary: EZ to put on Kel-Tec PAT3 380review/text: Due to the small size of the 380 and my arthritis in hands, wrists, I can now grip this gun much better. Just have to trim bottom a little. Be carefull not to trim to much. Used trimmed bottom, as a slide on, over the rubber grip (like a rubber band) at the bottom. Now I have to field test it, to make sure it holds, is not lose.
