review/summary: This is not a helmet....review/text: So... I opened the box that I thought contained the bike helmet I'd use with a brand new bike I just purchased. Instead of a helmet, I found an electric dog collar complete with "remote shocking device". The label said helmet, but I fail to see how this will protect me if an accident were to happen. Maybe I need to get a dog and train it to scare off the careless motorists that seem to frequent the streets around my apartment.
