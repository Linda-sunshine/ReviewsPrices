review/summary: Great shadesreview/text: I swear by Ray-Ban mainly because they are the only brand of sunglasses that fit my rather large and slightly crooked nose. The styling of the classic aviators looks great and the polarized lenses are wonderful for blocking out the sun's glare particularly when driving. If you like the aviator style, don't settle for imitations - these are the real deal.
