review/summary: Exactly what I was looking forreview/text: My nutritionist recommended a pedometer and this one appeared to have numerous great reviews. After a month of use, I have to say it definitely deserves five stars. Setup is extremely easy, including how to calculate your stride. I have since measured it's accuracy by comparing it to my GPS, and I've found it to be consistently reliable. The controls are very simple and logical, and even though the manual is very well written, you won't really need it. Finally, one of the very best features is the automatic reset to zero at midnight. When I wake up, it's all ready to go without any thought or action on my part. My wife now has one as well. Highly recommended!
