review/summary: Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pumpreview/text: bought this for when i stay over friends or families houses. really comfortable bed has yet to deflate on me no punctures yet even though i lightly abuse it. only problem is the electric pump when turned on sometimes make a really horrible sound like there is something obstructing the airway and have to turn it off and kind off stretch and pull the plastic away from the side that's inside the air pump
