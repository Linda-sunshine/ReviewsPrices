review/summary: Great Knifereview/text: I own a number of Kershaws and the Leek is one of my favorites. I keep mine in my MaxPed Versipack since it is small, sharp, and light weight. My wife also keeps one in her purse for personal protection and general use. Kershaw will stand behind all of their products and if you fill out a warranty application available on their site, they will sharpen, lubricate, and check over the knife whenever you send it in free of charge. You only have to pay shipping. Great company and product.
