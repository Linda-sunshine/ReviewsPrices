review/summary: Perfect for keeping your drink coolreview/text: I purchased 2 of these as replacements for Polar bottles that wore out after several years of use. It's not a true insulated bottle, just double walled with insulating foil in between. It will however, keep your beverage cold for a lot longer than a conventional water bottle without the extra cost, size or weight. At first I found the carry strap to be annoying and in the way but soon found it to be a convenient way to carry the bottle. Either way, it can be easily removed. The opening is wide making it easy to add ice direct from a dispenser The valve is soft, opens & closes easily and does not leak. The bottle holds a generous 24oz and is soft plastic that will withstand lots of abuse. This is a perfect water bottle for anyone who is active or always on the go.
