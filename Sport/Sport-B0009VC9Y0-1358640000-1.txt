review/summary: Fantastic EDCreview/text: The tip is very fine, as noted in other reviews. This is excellent for EDC tasks like opening packages, or small precision work. The edge was very sharp when I got it, and continues to be an adequate edge for just about every task it encounters. The SpeedSafe opening system is great for when you don't have two hands to open your knife, however I feel like I have to say:IF YOU'RE BUYING A KNIFE FOR SELF DEFENSE PLEASE RECONSIDER YOUR OPTIONS. A knife is a dirty, dangerous, and legally grey method of self defense for more than just a couple reasons. This is also not a fighting knife. Consider pepper spray or a baton for self defense. This knife is a tool.
