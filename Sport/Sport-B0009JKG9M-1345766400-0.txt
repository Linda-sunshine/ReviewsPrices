review/summary: Best Christmas Present Everreview/text: My husband got me this for Christmas last year. It was my first piece of Lodge, and it got me hooked! I have since purchased four other pieces to round out my kitchen.I use the whole set as a chicken roaster, with the lid on the bottom. It roasts a chicken perfectly in 1 1/2 hours.I use the deep pan for sauces and mac and cheese, and the skillet for small meals.I did season them before I started using them; Lodge's factory seasoning is a great base, but isn't as non-stick as it should be. Just season it once or twice yourself and you are ready to go!
