review/summary: Love this knifereview/text: I had one of these when I was a kid in scouts. I loved this knife then and still do. I recently got this one as part of the daily deals, and since it has arrived I have carried it with me every day. I have used most of the tools, and you really do not know how much you will use it until you carry it daily. Victorinox makes great products, and this knife is no exception. This knife also to my surprise had several new tools upgraded from my old one, such as a pen and eyeglass screwdriver.
