review/summary: Great looking watch with auto movementreview/text: I like the two tone bracelet and the deep blue dial that has luminous markers and hand with a magnified date window. But what is really nice is that the watch body is on the smaller size of 40 mm, so you don't notice the weight as much as the larger watches. And its good to a depth of 200 meters, so getting it splashed or going for a swim means no problems. Being an auto movement means no batteries and that's one less headache, and it has the see through back so you can see everything, and made in China in is not present. Of all my Invicta's this is my favorite.
