review/summary: Schwinn Thrasher Adult Helmetreview/text: As usual, Amazon is amazing...from their pricing to their customer service...that being said, I received the helmet in 2 days and was a bit skeptical to order one online but after reading the reviews I pulled the trigger.The pros: great price, size is adjustable and that was the key factor in me ordering this one because I have a gigantic head and this fits it perfectly. The helmet is very comfortable and seems very sturdy.The cons: The plastic pieces that are glued onto the top of the helmet (they serve no real purpose, just look good) were coming off as soon as I took the helmet out of the box. I had to use some super glue and glue them back into place. A little ridiculous for a brand new helmet, but not a deal breaker for me. For some it might be, but the price and the fact that it fit my huge head won me over and I will definitely keep it. Even if it disintegrates after a year, for the price I paid for it, I can't complain.I would recommend that everyone try it for themselves, and worst case scenario you can always return it, but I doubt you will.
