review/summary: Great Workoutreview/text: I love the workouts. Can't say I've made it through the program (mainly injury) but the workouts themselves are pretty fun. Expect lots of muscle pain for the first two weeks at least. I did notice results pretty quickly when eating a clean diet and sticking with the workouts but the clean diet is probably accounts for 85% of the results.
