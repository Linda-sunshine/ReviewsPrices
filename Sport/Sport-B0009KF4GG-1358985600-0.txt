review/summary: Victorinox quality and utility!review/text: The Champion Plus knife has a lot of good features without being too bulky but a case for belt wear is my choice. Victorinox, as usual, delivers quality and utility. Have to be agile with your fingers and have strong fingernails to get some of the blades out for use. A lot of utility is packed in a small space which is what the Swiss Army knife is all about.
