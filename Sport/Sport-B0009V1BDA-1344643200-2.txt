review/summary: Pass on this grill...review/text: This grill is poorly designed and difficult to move for a portable grill.The burners are way too close to the cooking surface, which burns pretty much everything, but leave the middle raw.The wheels do not allow for the user to move the grill easily, and the thing weighs a ton, so it is even difficult to pick up and move it.Normally Coleman stuff is pretty good and user friendly, but not this. Don't waste your money as I did on this grill.
