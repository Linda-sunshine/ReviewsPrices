review/summary: So Far So Goodreview/text: I have had this air mattress for about a year now. I have used it several times while camping and several times while friends stayed over. It inflates very quickly and seems to keep the air pretty well. Each night before sleeping on it again I would just add a bit more air. Deflating it is just as quick and it comes with a carrying bag. My only complaint is the rippling of the air mattress on the top. At times it can feel a little uncomfortable. I do like that it is a high air mattress. I had bought one that was half the size before this one and it was not easy to get in and out of.
