review/summary: Seals great, compact size, & I drink morereview/text: Perfect! I keep this in my car because i wanted a small container of water. the kids size is too small (perfect for bed side table though). the 1.0L is too big (perfect for home use though) so this was just right for me. I no longer have to worry about spilling water on my clothes or fumbling for a cap. I end up drinking more water since its so easy to bite & drink. wish i had bought this years ago.
