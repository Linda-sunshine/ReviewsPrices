review/summary: This is the 3rd one of these that I have hadreview/text: This is a great help when I walk on the treadmill. It allows me to see what my heart rate is at any time. At my age, my target heart rate should be between 107 and 114. I usually exceed that.Everyone that does any kind of cardiac rehab should have one of these.
