review/summary: Comfortable and airyreview/text: This helmet is a great value. It doesn't make my head too hot, and it's easy to fit perfectly. I have a larger head than some people, and this fit me very comfortably. People with small heads might have trouble getting this to be the right size, but I'm not sure. It worked for me!
