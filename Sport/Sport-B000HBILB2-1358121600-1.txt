review/summary: Very pleasedreview/text: For the price you've got a fast self inflating bed that is very comfortable and portable. The integrated air pump makes it a bit bigger once folded but then again, it's smaller than having a mandatory separate pump. Only real complain would be that can be colder than a normal bed, but with enough covering you won't even notice.
