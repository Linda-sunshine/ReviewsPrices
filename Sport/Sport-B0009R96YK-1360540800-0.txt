review/summary: These are nice, but a bit small...review/text: They are attractive, can be positioned in many different configurations; but they are a bit small. I may replace the actual mirror with something about twice the size so I can see what's behind me at a quick glance. The tiny image in these is hard to focus on when you're trying to make a fast, critical decision while moving in traffic.Other than the size of the mirrors themselves, I like the way they're mounted.Great idea; just needs larger mirrors.
