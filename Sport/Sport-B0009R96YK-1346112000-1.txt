review/summary: The very best mass-market bicycle mirrorreview/text: I've spent hundreds of dollars on dozens of mirrors, over several bicycles. This is absolutely the best. The amount of space you can see in the mirror, the balance of staying positioned vs being able to be knocked into a new position after bumping something, the small extra lateral profile it adds to your bike... this is the very best.
