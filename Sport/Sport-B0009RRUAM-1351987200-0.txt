review/summary: Great backpacking pillowreview/text: Have had this pillow out on 2 separate backpacking excursions now and it is perfect. I like comfort and this pillow fits the bill. The soft nap on the pillow stays warm and it stays in place on your sleeping pad or sleeping bag. compresses down pretty well, not as compact as some others, but this pillow is pure comfort.
