review/summary: Good quality blankets for emergenciesreview/text: I bought the 10 pack of these so I'd have one for each of my vehicles, one for my backpack, and a few extras to have or to give to some of my friends and family for their vehicles. These blankets might not look like much, but they do a great job of keeping your body heat in and keeping you dry.
