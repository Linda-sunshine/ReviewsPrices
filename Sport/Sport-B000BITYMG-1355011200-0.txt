review/summary: Not very goodreview/text: A closer look at the pictures now reveals what low quality these leashes are. For what a decent safety leash looks like, take a look at the one that comes with the Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer.Alas, I can't find a better one on Amazon.The cloth strap seems insubstantial. It is attached to a metal 'loop' that is nearly three times as wide as the cloth strap. One of the pivot 'pins' is not sharp, but it's not smooth either.Yes, what did I expect for $2.36, including shipping?
