review/summary: does not stay airedreview/text: The air mattress was very easy to air up, less than one minute. Other than that it was not good. It didn't even stay aired up for an entire night and that is with my 90 pound daughter sleeping on it. The air mattress didn't stay firm and by morning it had lost enough air that she was sunk into the middle. Packaging was great and it inflates and deflates easily, just didn't stay as firm as it should have to sleep on all night.
