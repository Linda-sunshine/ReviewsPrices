review/summary: Just as describedreview/text: What can I say? It's a good jump rope. It's not extra fancy, and doesn't have weighted handles or any of the other fancy things found with more expensive products-- but it works!My only complaint is that I found it rather hard to adjust the height so that it actually fit me. The adjustments work &#34;ok&#34; but periodically needs re-done.
