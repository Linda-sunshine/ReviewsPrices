review/summary: Pre-Seasoned Comboreview/text: This is a good combo, but be careful, the handles get just as hot as the pan. You'll need thick pot holders to handle them. It says it's pre-seasoned, but I had to season it again, and even after seasoning it again, food still has a tendency to stick. I may season it again.
