review/summary: Helps improve posture!review/text: This product hurt the first two days, but I'll admit to being out of shape. The third day was easier and now I am sitting up straight and not feeling it. It's a conversation piece too at the office. I feel my posture has improved significantly. Worth the price. Follow the directions and top of the air after 48 hours. At first it seems too low, but after topping off the air it doesn't.
