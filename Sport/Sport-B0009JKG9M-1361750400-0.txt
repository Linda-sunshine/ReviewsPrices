review/summary: Doesn't leave our stovereview/text: This combo lives on and in our stove/oven. We truly have used it that much in the last few months that we have had it. We re-seasoned using methods found on line and bought a metal spatula. I was worried that the pan would be too small, but it's great for my family of 4 and, depending on the meal, gives me room for a recipie that feeds us twice. For the price to combo can't be beat, I am very happy with my investment.
