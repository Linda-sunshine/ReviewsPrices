review/summary: Former Nalgene Queen says No More Plastic Water Bottlesreview/text: This is a great stainless bottle. The paint does chip at the bottom after you've dented the bottle from dropping it on something hard, but it still looks great and I think the paint helps keep the water slightly cooler in direct sun than the naked variety bottle. This size fits nicely in a car cup holder, even with a neoprene sleeve on it. I used to use plastic water bottles but don't think I could ever regress to them again. The stainless holds NO odors and the water just tastes fresher and better out of stainless or glass.Kleen Kanteen stands behind the product... when I needed new O-rings for lids they sent them out promptly, with extras. Highly recommend.
