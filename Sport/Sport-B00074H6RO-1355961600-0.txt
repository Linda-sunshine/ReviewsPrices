review/summary: Great gloves but inaccurate sizing chartreview/text: These gloves are great. The only issue that I had was I ordered a size too big based upon the measurements I did in accordance with the Harbinger website (not on the products detail page on amazon but harbinger's site).No issue with the gloves just the sizing chart. I measured multiple times and with great specificity but the size I was fit for is a bit too big around the wrist.Once again, the gloves are nice. They grip well and allow me to lift heavier without fear of dropping my weights on the ground (Bowflex weights which tend to slip).
