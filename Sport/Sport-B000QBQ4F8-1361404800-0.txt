review/summary: Ordered 2140 Original Wayfarers--received the Folding Wayfarers in errorreview/text: I didn't receive the correct item (and double checked my invoice to make sure I ordered the 2140 Polarized Original Wayfarers size 54, which I did), however, I received the folding wayfarers in the correct color and polarized lens, and I really like them! I have two pairs of the New Wayfarers size 55mm, but decided I wanted the bigger frames of the Originals so ordered the 54mm after some serious contemplation between the 50 and 54. I was a little afraid that the 54s of the originals would be too large to stay on my head properly, and I still don't know whether or not this would be the case since I received the wrong product. The folding wayfarers I received have very contoured arms and despite how large the lens frames are (which I am liking), they do not slide down my nose like some of my other larger-style designer sunglasses....for this reason, I am just going to keep the folding wayfarers. Plus they are so compact and will fit easily in my small purse, or even in my pocket if necessary. =)
