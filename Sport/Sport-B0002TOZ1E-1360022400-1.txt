review/summary: Athletic but not so strong...review/text: I ride my bike to work everymorning, and after purchasing an extra size sock, I believed my &#34;sock problem&#34; would end. Specially if they were &#34;athletic quality&#34;. But these keep on opening near the toas! and trust me, it's not a lack of nail clipper!
