review/summary: Invicta Men's 8928OB Pro Diver Two-Tone Automatic Watchreview/text: Bought it because it looks like a Rolex watch. Since a Rolex watch is extremely expensive I bought it since it seems I bought one of those expensive watches for less than a $100.00. That is the reason I bought it. Took it to a jewelry store for band adjustment and the local jeweler praised the watch for it looks, workmanship and the fact that it is an automatic watch and it shows so when you look at it in the back. Wonderful purchase indeed!
