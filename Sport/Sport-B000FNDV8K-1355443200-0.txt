review/summary: The real daily carryreview/text: To me, these knives are like socks in the dryer. Every so often I just lose one. But like socks, I use this knife daily. Not as a knife proper, but to pick on things, open this or that, fasten or tighten a screw. I finally learned not to use my teeth to rip on packages and find this knife in my pocket instead. The small jeans pocket. This should be a standard issue, everybody should have one and the TSA should lay off. Nobody is going to highjack a plane with this one.
