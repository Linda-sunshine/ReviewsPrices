review/summary: A knife for all seasonsreview/text: I own a huntsman which has been truly useful over the years and is still going strong.That said i wanted to test the waters with a beefier knife (more tools) thus i chose the Champ-plus. The Champ plus does not have the pliers and as such is sleeker than the regular champ. It still has a good heft to it and i'm sure if thrown at an attackers head it will render them quite KO'ed. The tools are all well made especially the wood saw which is very efficient and the scissors. I still have yet to use the fish scaler and chisel. The many screwdrives incorporated or dedicated work well and major kudos go to the glasses screwdriver found on the corkscrew. The magnifying glass is also a nifty addition.The knife is well constructed and i suggest you clean and maintain it regularly for best performance and would highly recomend this knife.Will update this review as time goes on.
