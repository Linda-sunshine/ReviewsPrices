review/summary: Save your neckreview/text: Just a glance and you have peace of mind rather than having to turn around to check traffic. That in itself could save you from a wreck - keeping your eyes on the road ahead. I toss my bike in the back of a truck to haul it to the park and just turn the mirror to keep it from getting broke. Fairly sturdy build but don't expect it to survive a hard fall.
