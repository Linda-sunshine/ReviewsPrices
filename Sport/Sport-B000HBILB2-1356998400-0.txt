review/summary: Good for a Few Daysreview/text: I have the queen sized version of this product. I needed the twin size for another room to accommodate more guests.I personally don't find these mattresses to be very comfortable but its hard to consider any air only mattress very comfortable. For hosting guests for a few days, it gets the job done and inflates pretty quickly. We do find that it loses a little bit of air almost on a daily basis and just requires half a minute of pumping or so to become firm again, so keep it handy near a socket.
