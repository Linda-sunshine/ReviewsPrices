review/summary: It wont stay in placereview/text: You know how when you haven't done the laundry and you run out of underwear, you go to the drawer to get your backup underwear...the underwear a little too tight, a little too small, a little too big, the underwear that caused you to buy the new ones to replace because the originals were uncomfortable now, or unwearable for some reason?That said original uncomfortable underwear is better than this. When I got this I was excited from the description. Opening the package and first feeling them, they felt interesting. Smooth, silky, stretchy. I thought "cool". Until I wore it the next day. These things ride up and bunch up something awful. I find myself pulling this thing down every minute like a woman who wore a skirt she knew was too short for her. Smell wise I don't really notice a difference. One thing that I find kind of annoying, but I guess it is by design, after wearing it, ON AN AVERAGE DAY, it slightly feels moist to the touch. Going back to hanes.
