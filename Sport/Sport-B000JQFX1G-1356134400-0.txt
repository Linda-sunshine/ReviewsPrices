review/summary: Fantastic watch and get it while its availablereview/text: Let me tell you one thing. Just buy it! This watch is marvelous looking classy master piece Invicta ever offered. Its just identical to Rolex submariner. There is no difference visually to that $8K watch. I was debating to get 8932 or 8926 or 8926OB. So I ordered 8932 due its low price $54 and its too small to my wrist. Trust me my wrist comes under extra small in mens size. Luckyly Amazon accepted the return with their fantastic return policy. We love Amazon!. Then I went to Samsclub and physically tried both 8926 and 8926OB. They both are perfect size and looks like adult mens watch. Then the debate come into which bazel I should prefer. The 8926 has chamfer kind of corners on the bazel and 8926 has sharp teeth kind of bazel (they call coin marked). Some how the 8926 looks blunt and 8926OB looks sharp on the wrist as the bazel teeth are reflecting sparkling light. Thats it I decided to buy 8926OB and I am so happy I did. The automatic movement is great and works pefectly and hard to resist to take it out. I adjusted the links myself with my watch repair kit. Its not heavy at all and the band has nice combination of brushed steel and shiny in middle gives nice elegant touch. One thing I paid $86 but I checked it went on sale in the past for $59 but I am not that lucky to grab it at that stealing price. But when you love some item you just dont look for the price but the availability from a reputer seller with a hassle free retrun policy just incase you need to return. I am not diver and I dont have a swimming pool either so I am not intended to use this watch under water and also I am not going to test it either. If it encounters any rain and survives I will be happy.So my advise if you are just thinking about it..DONT. Just go any buy it and you will not regret. By the way women loves this one too!!!!
