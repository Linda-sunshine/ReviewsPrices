review/summary: Great Guest Bedreview/text: Purchased this for the constant flow of friends and family members that visit me and love it! I actually tested it and slept on it for two nights to ensure it was comfy and LOVED IT! I've had guests from 90 to 250 pounds sleep on it and all rave. It's tall so easy for kids and adults to get in and out of. One caveat: because it has a built in air chamber acting as a box spring, it doesn't work with fitted sheets. I remedied this with king sized sheets tucked under the whole thing.
