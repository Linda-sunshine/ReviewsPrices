review/summary: Great mount rackreview/text: I have read the reviews prior to buying and was skeptical about buying the cheaper of the mount rack, but decided to give it a go. I found the rack easy to install and not a problem with my nissan maxima with the spoiler. The spoiler actually seems to support the rack even more. I have used the rack several times now even on the highway and have not noticed any movement or shifting of the rack. The only reason I did not give four stars is that when carrying two bikes you have to be careful of one bike scatching the other during the drive. My girlfriends bike pedal scratched the underside of the frame on my brand new road bike! I followed the other suggestions of the other reviewers on here and put a sock on the pedal to prevent any further scratching. I noticed recently that the leading edge of the spoiler had some paint scratched off on both sides but for me was not a big deal since my car is old and not really concerned about it. If you have a newer car and worried about scratches I would definitely follow the other suggestions on here to place a cloth or rag in between the contact points to prevent any scratching. Otherwise this bike rack works great for the money and I would recommend as long as you take the precautions I mentioned earlier.
