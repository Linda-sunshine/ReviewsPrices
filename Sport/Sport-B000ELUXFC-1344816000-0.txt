review/summary: Simple yet works wellreview/text: Wanted a simple, inexpensive carrier for one or two bikes and this fits the bill. Used it many times and it hasn't damage my car yet. I don't known if I'd trust it carrying two bike cross-country, but it works well for my several mile jaunt back and forth to my favorite trails.
