review/summary: Can't beat the pricereview/text: This product has a GREAT price, you can't beat the price. But......the old saying, "you get what you pay for" is evident here. I am still using the device but from time to time it disengages from my pedometer and I have to re attach it and it's a little different when removing the clip from your belt loop. However I am still using this product and do not see me trying to find another.
