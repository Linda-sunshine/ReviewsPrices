review/summary: Love This Mattressreview/text: This is a second identical mattress that I bought in a couple of years. I used the first mattress for several weeks in a row twice in the past. I left it at a diferent place and decided to get another one for myself, and now bought another one as a temporary solution. So much for the temporary solution that I have found that I sleep on it better than on a $2K Stearns and Foster! Well, this is the second months that I sleep on it and I am not thinking of moving back to a large mattress...
