review/summary: brand new, but slow shippingreview/text: I did not want to pay full price for P90X but was tired of using the poor quality burnt DVDs that someone gave me. I purchased this from a seller on Amazon and once I received the product, it was as described; still in the original package. However, the seller did not ship the package as quickly as they said they would and I waited over a week for the item. Shipping is the only reason this product and seller did not receive the full 5 stars.
