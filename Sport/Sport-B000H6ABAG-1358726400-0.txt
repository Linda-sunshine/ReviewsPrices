review/summary: So happy with these pants!!review/text: I am an older woman who loves fleece pants which are hard to find. I bought these and cut bottoms off as I don't like the elastic. I have purchased them before at a store who no longer sells them. So happy to have found these online as they are nice and heavy and warm and I love pockets. They last for a long time, just needed bigger ones.
