review/summary: Like itreview/text: This is my second Omron pedometer. My first one lasted about 4 years and despite the good care I gave it, it just stopped working. I obviously changed the battery multiple times and changed it again even though that did not appear to be the problem. But since I liked my first one, I purchased the second one and it is doing the job. Like previous reviews have stated, it works whether I clip it to my exercise clothes or carry it in my pocket during my work day.
