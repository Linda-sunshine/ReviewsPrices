review/summary: Very Good Airbed - Highly Recommendedreview/text: This Intex "Pillow Rest Twin Airbed" is easy to setup and is exceptionally comfortable for an airbed. I am "big" man, coming in at 250-lbs, and was concerned that that this would not support me but it held up just fine. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Comfortable; had really good sleep on this+ Built-In Pump; no need to worry about losing it+ Quick Inflating; well under 3-minutes to full inflation+ Strong; held me just fine+ Height; easy to get on and off since it raised a bit from the floorCons -- Cord doesn't retract, but only a minor issueWe liked this one so much that we ordered a second one for my wife to use when traveling, which is my best endorsement.Highly Recommended!CFH
