review/summary: worth itreview/text: great intro into the insanity style wrokouts, wanted to try somthing cheap before spending all the money on the full program.. did this over 5 times and definatly could feel an improvement in all area's of my life. now doing the full insanity workout set.. recomend a few yoga mats or weight bench interlocking foam floor covering/you can buy at walmart/ to be nice to your knees.. and a good pair of cross trainers.. have heard they are also using this in schools for the kids too.. helps watching the people in the back of him having trouble keeping up too.. doubt i will ever do it perfect with shaun t.. but I will keep trying..
