review/summary: Ended up throwing mine awayreview/text: The idea is wonderful - a self-contained insulated water bottle (living in AZ, insulation is much needed). I didn't ever quite like it, though. I had a hard time drawing water through the mouthpiece. Mine also developed mildew inside after I forgot to empty it. The only way I was able to get rid of the mildew was by soaking it with bleach (not something I want to do if I'm going to drink out of it!). The deal-breaker for me was that water always seemed to taste like plastic. So, after about a year, I ended up throwing it away this afternoon.
