review/summary: Perfect Product!review/text: PERFECT product! This was my very first pair of (polarized) sunglasses over $100 and I absolutely love the quality of it all! My only issue is that I do not have an un-polarized version to compare it too, so I don't know if the "polarization" is actually working.Why? I heard the polarization was awesome, eliminating all glare from cars, signs, and whatever else may shine annoyingly in your face. I notice there is a definite decrease in glare, but NOT a complete elimination.Otherwise, it's a 10/10! Clear, crisp vision while making everything easier on the eyes - also, I don't even notice I'm wearing it sometimes! Thanks, Amazon, for the huge discount!
