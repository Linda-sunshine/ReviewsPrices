review/summary: Easy to use, solid quality, good value for the moneyreview/text: I've been participating in a work out program for a while where everyone had heart rate monitors, but I was simply too cheap to buy one. Finally, I decided that I needed to get a heart rate monitor to help verify during the workouts if I was reaching an optimal heart rate for my age, weight, etc.I searched around on Amazon and other sites for different options, pricing, user reviews, etc. I finally reached the conclusion, that for the price point, the Omron HR-100C was definitely the way to go. And, my own experience since getting this product has only confirmed my expectations. The chest band used w/ the wrist watch/heart rate monitor is very comfortable, and really I don't even notice it when working out. The wrist watch/heart rate monitor itself is made of high quality materials, and is not like other bulky obvious heart rate monitors, in that I could walk out with the wrist watch/heart rate monitor on my wrist and few people would recognize it as a heart rate monitor.
