review/summary: Giant Box of Hand Warmers!review/text: I bought these to distribute to homeless teens. It was nice because as you can see in the picture, they are individual packs of 2. It may seem like a lot, but who needs just one hand warmer over the winters. Just grab a pack and go or hand them out as stocking stuffers. Love them and would definitely purchase again.
