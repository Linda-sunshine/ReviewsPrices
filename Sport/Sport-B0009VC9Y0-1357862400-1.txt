review/summary: Use it everydayreview/text: This knife is a great everyday carry knife if you are just cutting the average item. It is not extremely durable. The tip is fragile. I have had mine for over a year and just resharpened it. The spring open assist is great but after a year it does not open all the way by itself. I have tried to clean the hinge but still does not snap open like the first 6 months of owning. I would buy another.
