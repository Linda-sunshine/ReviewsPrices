review/summary: Good Padding, Run Smallreview/text: Like these gloves a lot. These are the first lifting gloves I've gotten, so I don't have anything to compare to. I was just sick of the calluses I was getting at the base of my fingers, which led me to buy these. The padding is great, and my hands don't show the wear of lifting anymore. They breathe relatively well, so my hands aren't disgusting when I pull them out at the end of a workout. One thing though: as many other reviewers pointed out, they DEFINITELY run small. My brother has been using the Harbinger 155 gloves. He wears a Medium, and they seemed to fit me pretty good when I tried them on. However, because of the reviews, I bought a Large in these (the Harbinger 143). They aren't too small, but they're pretty snug. I'm worried that if they shrink at all, I'll have to buy another, larger pair. So, definitely buy a size up from whatever you think you need. Overall, great gloves.
