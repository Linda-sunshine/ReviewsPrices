review/summary: Love it!review/text: I've had this knife for about a year and a half now, and I have to say this is a great purchase that comes in handy all the time. It's small and easily fits on a keychain, and is still quite sharp! My only complaint is that the knife and file fold out the wrong way (towards the keychain rather than away).
