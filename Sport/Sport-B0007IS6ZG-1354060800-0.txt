review/summary: Easy as piereview/text: I was worried about adjusting the rope since I'm 5'2'' and knew that it would be much longer than I needed, but it turned out to be simple. Unscrew the handle cap, measure the rope, cut off the excess, and refasten the metal band. This all took less than 5 minutes. I like this rope. The rope spins easily within the handles so you don't have to worry about getting tangled up. If you need a jump rope then I suggest that you get this product.
