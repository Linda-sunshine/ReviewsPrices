review/summary: Cap doesn't screw on right; leaked my waterreview/text: The cap doesn't screw on right. With most water bottles when I put the cap on it should be ready for me to screw it right away, and I should be able to screw it until it stops, applying a fair amount of pressure. With this I had to try to align it just right, and when I screwed it, with medium pressure it snapped off. I screwed it back on applying only light pressure, and shook it a couple of times and it seemed alright. When I got to my backpacking destination it had leaked out, so I wound up traveling with less water.TL;DR despite my best effort my brand new bottle leaked. Should be permanent disqualification from the water bottle business.
