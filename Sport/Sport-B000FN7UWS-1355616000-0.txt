review/summary: Great productreview/text: The water taste clean, have used it for several weeks and no scratching or scuffs (though using it indoors, not for sports.) The squeeling noise is occasionally annoying but I just adjust the lid as other commenters have suggested and it's fine. It's spilled in my purse twice already - remember these are not leak-proof!
