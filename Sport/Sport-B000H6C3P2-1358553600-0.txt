review/summary: Excellent gripreview/text: This is a comfortable grip. The finger slots are in the right place, and the rubber texture of the grip makes for a positive feeling hold. I tried a hard plastic style, and it felt slippery, this one doesn't. I'll order another for my AR10 when it arrives.
