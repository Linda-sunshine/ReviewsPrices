review/summary: Good Earmuffsreview/text: I bought these too protect fmy hearing when using a lawnmower, leaf blowing and other power tools. They do an excellent job in reducing these noise level. They seem to be well made and fit my ears. I would recommend these to anyone who wants to protect their hearing.
