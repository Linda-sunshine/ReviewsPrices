review/summary: Works wellreview/text: We've had this several months and every time we pull it out it works perfectly. This is our second- we had to exchange the first one Amazon shipped because it deflated overnight the first night we got it... but it was super easy and hassle free- the new one works perfectly. I LOVE that the pump is built in and the chord wraps right up into it... you don't have to worry about keeping the pump handy or lining it up right in the hole to fill it. I like the height and it is easy to put sheets on. The built in "pillow" bump is nice as well- especially if you are low in extra pillows. :)
