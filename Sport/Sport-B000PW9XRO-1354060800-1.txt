review/summary: Very comfortable, easy to use, but cold.review/text: The gloves are very very well made, they fit perfectly to my hand and allow for full use with firearms or other activities.They truely are all weather gloves. They have a fair bit of ventilation via the mesh top and the leather seems to transmit temperature fairly directly to the hand. Its not so bad that I wouldnt still give them 5 stars, but they do leave your hands a bit cold around winter weather.
