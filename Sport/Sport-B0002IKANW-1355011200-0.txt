review/summary: Work great, errr, I mean not at all.review/text: Thus far, these snap caps preformed flawlessly by doing absolutely nothing.They're great for practicing action cycling, and clearing misfires. Bury a couple of these in deep in a mag and learn how to react when nothing goes bang.Just remember to pick them up when your done!
