review/summary: what, I can't hear youreview/text: I shoot all kinds of firearms at the range and they have the three sided enclosures that seem to magnify the sounds. It can get very loud in there. These Peltors do the job extremely well. I do wear ear plugs in addition to these while I am shooting but take them off when i step away from the bench. With the ear plugs and these on my Mosin rifles sound almost like mouse squeaks. Well maybe not mouse squeaks but surprisingly quiet. Comfortable except for I wish they would come up with a cloth like covering for the part that makes the contact around your ear. I guess it would be harder to clean but would be more comfortable to wear. I would buy these again
