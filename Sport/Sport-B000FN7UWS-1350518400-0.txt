review/summary: Perfect water canteenreview/text: I have been debating whether or not to purchase this canteen for a few years and I am glad i finally did. I had a knock-off that I had bought at Target for $10 by Giam (sp?) for about 2-3 years. You DO GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! I had to stop using my $10 Target bottle because the plastic inner lining was coming off and I had been swallowing pieces of if not knowing what it was. I had only stored cool water in it, nothing else. The company's website claims that this lining is nothing to worry about (not carcinogenic etc.), but I wouldn't want to to be swallowing chunks of plastic with my fresh water! Klean Kanteen does not use a plastic coating in their Stainless steel canteens and that's the way it should stay!
