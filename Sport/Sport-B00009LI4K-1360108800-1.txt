review/summary: great for the pricereview/text: I was surprised how well they worked at the range. Also liked that they are large enough to cover my ears without pressing on them, keeping the ear fully inside and allowing me to wear without pain for hours. Not too easy but simple to switch the ear covers upside down to allow for lower profile alignment so less to interfere with my AR. excellent price
