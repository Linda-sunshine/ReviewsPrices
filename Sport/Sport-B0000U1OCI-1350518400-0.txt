review/summary: Awesome pedometerreview/text: I bought this pedometer for a friend who is a gym teacher. She's really had a great time seeing just how much she walks in a day! I have a similar model Omron and wanted her to experience the accuracy, too. It's a great tool for improving your step count and very easy to set up.
