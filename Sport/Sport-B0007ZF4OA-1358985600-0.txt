review/summary: Perfectreview/text: One might think it strange that I use this to keep my bird warm, but it works well without the use of any harmful chemical fumes or electricity. I have a handicapped older bird who gets cold during the winter months, and this is perfect. I open up one at night, wrap it in a piece of flannel, and stick it in his little sleeping box. He cuddles up with it all night, warm and toasty. The size of the handwarmer is just right for him as well (lovebird).
