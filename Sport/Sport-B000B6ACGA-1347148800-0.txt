review/summary: Dont buy junkreview/text: One the second try a spring broke and allowed the card holder to drop to the bottom.We now try to use it without the card holder,but a great many cards always end up reversed either face up or on the side of the card pile.If I could I would send it back.it nothing but a pile of CHEAP plastic.
