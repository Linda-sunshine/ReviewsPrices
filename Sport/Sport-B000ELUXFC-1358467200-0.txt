review/summary: it gets the job donereview/text: But the look and feel of it, it does not look sturdy enough to hold two bikes, but it gets the job done. I use it often( once a week) to carry my bike for shorter distances of about 15 miles. Never had a problem with it. It does not scratch you car as long as you fix it properly. Make sure no bike parts are touching any part of vehicle when mounted. As this mount is not very sturdy and moves quite a bit. Last but not least price is great
