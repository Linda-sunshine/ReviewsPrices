review/summary: Sorely disappointed. Don't waste your moneyreview/text: Every time I try to drink from the mug, coffee dribbles down the side of the mug. Additionally, it is not entirely water-tight, as advertised. I have checked to make sure that all of the rubber seals are in place and that the lid is properly screwed in place. After a week of coffee dribbling down my shirt, I'm done. The remaining beverage that hasn't dribbled out of the mug does, however, stay very hot, I'll give them that much.I am very disappointed in the quality of this product.
