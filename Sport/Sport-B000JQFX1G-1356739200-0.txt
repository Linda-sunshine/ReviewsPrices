review/summary: Great watch for a reasonable pricereview/text: I was surprised when going over my previous Amazon orders, I ordered this Invicta Pro Diver watch in February 2009, almost 4 years ago. I have used it almost daily since I bought it and it has worked perfectly. The watch still looks good, though, as other reviewers noted, the shiny middle links in the bracelet and the clasp do show minor scratches (that aren't really noticeable from a few feet away.)For a traditional movement watch, it keeps perfect time, rarely gaining or losing more than 15 seconds a month. I haven't been able to tell if it runs fast or slow, as it usually is only a few seconds from the Atomic Time reading from my computer. The handy rotating bezel is still tight and setting the date on months of fewer than 31 days works perfectly.Over the holidays I looked at other Invicta diver watches and may buy one in another color as an alternative to this one. I am very pleased with the watch and would not hesitate to recommend it to a friend.
