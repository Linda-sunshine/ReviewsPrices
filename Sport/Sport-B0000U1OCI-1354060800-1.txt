review/summary: Excellent Productreview/text: Great product. I wear it almost all the time. My wife has one also and it is a contest to see who has the most steps at the end of the day. 10,000 steps is equal to about 5 miles so if you are a couch potato this product will give you an incentive to get up and walk.
