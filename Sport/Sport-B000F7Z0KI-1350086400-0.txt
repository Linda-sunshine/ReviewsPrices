review/summary: Works okay keeping drinks cool; leaks under pressure.review/text: I wanted an insulated water bottle mainly for soda and gatorade to take to work. I usually put 4-6 medium ice cubes in it w/ refrigerated drinks, and with the insulation on this water bottle it keeps them cold for 4hrs at room temperature. For that purpose it works really well. However a fatal problem I had with this bottle is if you put soda in it, and that soda shakes (from say sitting in a car drive) it will leak from the threads that the top part screws on with. The actual nozzle doesn't leak, just the threads, which is odd. Under normal use, say just some water you tip upside down squeeze with the lid shut - it doesn't seem to leak. I have the insulated camelbak podium bottle too, it also has a leaking problem (from the valve - not the screws), but the podium seems to keep the drinks colder for longer periods of time (4-5hrs vs 3-4hrs).
