review/summary: Worth the price!review/text: I move between places a lot and hence can't afford to buy permanent bed frames and mattresses. I wanted to buy this portable bed and use it for everyday sleep and also as a standby couch. It's been serving the purpose well so far for the couple of weeks. I've gotta wait and see if any major leaks occur in the future.Here's the reason for the missing star. It never becomes flat or very saggy, but needs air top up daily for sure. Especially since I'm using this also as a couch to sit, sometimes I need to inflate it for a couple of minutes before going to sleep to get the firmness I want. Of course it is absolutely not as comfortable as a box spring mattress on a frame, but I can assure that this is definitely worth the bucks if the need is an inexpensive temp bed for everyday use.By the way, this very same model costs $89 in Walmart when I checked, hope now it is not!
