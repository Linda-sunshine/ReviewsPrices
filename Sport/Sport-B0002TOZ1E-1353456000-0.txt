review/summary: Nice socksreview/text: I bought these socks as I had owned a number of pairs of socks by goldtoe and they hold up and wear well. I like them because the elastic holds up. I have big legs and they fit nicely over my calves. Of course I will not know how well these do for a few more months. They are a little pricey but are worth it.
