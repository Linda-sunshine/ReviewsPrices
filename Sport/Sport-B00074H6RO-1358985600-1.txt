review/summary: Great Glovesreview/text: I use these gloves 6 days a week for weight lifting. They do the job very well. The fit on them (which is very important to me) is absolutely great. I never worry about them falling off.The look nice, provide a very good grip, and do their job well. I'd highly recommend these to anyone looking into gloves for lifting heavy objects (or even just for looking cool)
