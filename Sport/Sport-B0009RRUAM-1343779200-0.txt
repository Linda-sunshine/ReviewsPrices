review/summary: Serves the Purpose Just Finereview/text: I bought the small pillow for my granddaughter to use on our camping trips and it works great for her. I bought the large pillow for my husband. Because I didn't want to pay a much higher price for the pattern I wanted in the large size, I bought the medium for myself and I regret it. The medium doesn't come close to a standard-sized pillow but takes up almost as much space as the larger size to store.When I received these pillows I was a little concerned because they are filled with pieces of foam and feel very lumpy. Thankfully they don't feel lumpy when you sleep on them. Also, I would have preferred a cooler (temperature)fabric cover but that's a personal preference.Overall I find these pillows are fairly compact to transport/store, are well-made, and are reasonably comfortable to use. But they aren't nearly as comfortable as my down pillow at home.They are pretty pricey too.
