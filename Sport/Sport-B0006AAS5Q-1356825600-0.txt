review/summary: Great value, great look and a good time-keeper...review/text: For less than $100.00, and with the first time look of a Rolex Daytona, the Invicta Speedway is an outstanding buy. Fit, finish and attention to detail is excellent. For those of you who expect a correct chronograph with a major second hand sweep, this is not for you; but if your not timing Indy cars, who cares. Frankly, it amazes me that Invicta can source and sell a product of this quality for the price. It keeps good time unless there is an issue with a second or more in a day. Rolex Daytona $24,000.00, Invicta Speedway under a hundred...sounds like a winner to me.
