review/summary: Thermos is a bit too goodreview/text: I bought this thermos for keeping my hot tea warm in the morning during my commute. Last night I had the brilliant idea of brewing hot tea, keeping it open at room temperature to cool for an hour, and then refrigerating it overnight (approximately 6.5-7 hours). After retreiving my thermos in the morning and commuting for around 75 minutes, I opened up it up and took a sip... STILL WARM! Holy cow! Well, this puts a dent in my making iced tea in that I'll have to use a less efficient container for storage and then fill up this one in the morning. Although I'm a bit disappointed my tea is warm when I really would've preferred cold tea right now, I can't complain for a product SO MAGICAL that it kept my hot tea warm in the fridge overnight.
