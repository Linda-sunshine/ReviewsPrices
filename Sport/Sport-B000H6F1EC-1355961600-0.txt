review/summary: Bit on the light sidereview/text: Pretty much what I wanted. I expected a bit heavier weight. Can't wear them outside on really cold & windy days. Drawstring not very sturdy anymore, waist elastic not really quality stuff either. Washed ok, wears ok. Just falls a bit short of the &#34;old days sweatpants&#34;.
