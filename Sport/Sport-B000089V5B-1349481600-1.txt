review/summary: These shoes are great.review/text: My daughter and I loved these shoes so much, she wanted a pair. She loves these more than the high top version she got previously. They are great shoe and versatile. I used to wear converse style shoes all the time when I was in high school, so it was fun to get another pair again. They fit comfortable, and felt true to size to me. Although a lot of people are saying they are not true to size. Because of that, my daughter and I bought the wrong sizes twice. So it confuses me why so many people are saying the sizing is off. So I am throwing my two cents in for that reason.My feet are about a 7 (one foot is a little longer than the other) and normal width. I'm not overweight nor extremely thin. I ordered the womens 7/ mens 5 and they feel just right. My daughter also ordered the size most closest to her foot size and she said they fit better than the other two pair we tried to over/under compensate with. Good luck!
