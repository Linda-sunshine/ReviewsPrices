review/summary: Finally ones I can wear.review/text: First goggles not to leak after trying a bunch. I do feel there's a little water in them, but not enough to stop my swims. I might just need to do some further minor adjustment. But I couldn't swim at all with other goggles I tried. I have a narrow face and probably my eyes are closer together than on most women and just makes for awkward fits with most goggles. They seem also more comfy to wear, they seem stay clear and easiest to adjust. I've spent frustrating time with other goggles trying to pull the elastic cords and wdhatnot and you just don't have any of that aggravation with these. I just put them on and swam. I love stuff made in Italy, it's on top of my list of countries to visit one day. I like Italian cycling clothes, bicycle gear, food, regular clothes, pocketbooks, shoes, etc and wow, now goggles.
