review/summary: Great pedometer, poor clip and batteryreview/text: I love the pedometer; it is *so* much more accurate and reliable than the cheapo ones. The memory feature is useful, as are the different types of data and the distinction it makes between steps and "aerobic" steps (based on pace). However, the battery it came with died after only 6 months of not-quite-daily use ($3 for replacement button battery), and the clip is just terrible: it's too short, it isn't tight enough to grip thin fabrics, and it doesn't open wide enough/grip well enough to clip onto belt+jeans. I've owned this for nearly a year, and I couldn't begin to count the number of times it has popped off when I leaned over while sitting, or bumped it with my arm or something I was carrying. Fortunately the device appears to be pretty tough. I highly recommend the pedometer, but find a different way to attach it.
