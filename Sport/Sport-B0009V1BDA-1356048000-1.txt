review/summary: GREAT GRILLreview/text: LOVE this grill!!! I shopped around for a portable grill for a few months and after a lot of research ended up buying this Coleman and it was EXACTLY what I needed it for......I can take it to the park for a cook out or use it in the parking lot for tailgating........it's also good for a balcony or apartment bbq'ing and it cleans up with great ease.
