review/summary: Comfortable undergarmentsreview/text: I found the material to be very comfortable all day, switching all my pairs to this brand. Be careful what you wash them with though. I had a pair get tangled up with one of my kid's velvro strap ped bibs in the washer and it cosmetically damaged the fabric in one area.
