review/summary: Blackhawk knows what they're doing!review/text: This is my second serpa holster from Blackhawk and I will continue purchasing from them because I know that my firearm is secure at all times. I have one for my Sig P220 compact and one for my Beretta 96. Both paddle and belt modes are versatile. I can't wait to set these up with the male female molle rigs!
