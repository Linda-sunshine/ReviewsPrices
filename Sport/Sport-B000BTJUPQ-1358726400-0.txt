review/summary: Warrior 8 year oldreview/text: We got this for my daughter for Christmas. As soon as she opened it we went outside and played with it for a least an hour in the snow! Amazing. Pulling back on the rope was a little difficult for her at first, but after a few tries she got the hang of it. We used card board boxes for targets as someone else had recommended. The darts shot pretty fast and far. The adults have had a ton of fun with it as well. We bought more darts because we were having a fun time with it.No complaints. We may buy one in a couple years for our 5 year old son. He gave it a try, but it was too difficult for him to pull back on the arrow. A few more push ups and he'll be there.
