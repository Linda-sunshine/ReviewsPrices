review/summary: Good Glove, but they sent the wrong one.review/text: I ordered the Flex Closure, in medium. what i got was a regular glove in medium. i dont feel like going through a bunch of bull to get this order right, but if you order this, dont expect to get what you ordered. it will be slightly different.
