review/summary: Well designed, well build - a good buyreview/text: It's a well build sturdy product, and I would recommend it as *the* pump when on the road.Pros:* feels sturdy and solid, aluminum tube and solid plastic handles* well designed - the 2 inner plastic and rubber pieces fit together for most types of valves, handle locks, light* after configured correctly - very good grip on Schrader valve, airtight* very easy to pump, and pretty efficientCons:* drawing on the packaging for configuration of the plastic pieces to fit a Schrader valve not detailed enough, also no other documentation.The pieces do fit smartly and well together, but it's not intuitive. May require some trial and error.* no pressure gauge - but hardly a con for a small pump like this. I'll definitely want a gauge on the pump I keep at home, but not on this.
