review/summary: Flawless Ken Onionreview/text: Very nice knife. It is well made. Fit and finish is superb. It opens with a flick and comes sharp right out of the package. Oh and the package is nice too. Cardboard box not that stinking plastic crap that requires an hour and a machete to open. Highly recommended.
