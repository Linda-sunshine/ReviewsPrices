review/summary: Does its jobreview/text: I use this to clean my rifle at the range following the use of corrosive ammunition. Fits in a snack-sized ziploc for convenient, clean transport and does a good job of cleaning. In my opinion it does not replace a thorough cleaning with a rod, brush and patches but works nicely for a quick cleaning in the field.
