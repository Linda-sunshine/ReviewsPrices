review/summary: Strength neededreview/text: I bought this for my daughter's 10th birthday. I read the reviews and felt confident she would be able to use this bow. Wow was I wrong. She can't pull it back at all and until she can I can't give a review of the product.I'm going to give you her height and weight so maybe this information will be helpful to some one else. She is 55" tall and weighs 60 pounds. She's thin but fairly strong from dance and gymnastics classes.I read in some reviews that seven year old girls and boys were using this bow. They must be very strong. After my wife pulled it back a few times her shoulder and fingers hurt.
