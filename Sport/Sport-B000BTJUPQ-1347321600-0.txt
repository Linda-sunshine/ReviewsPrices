review/summary: Great starter bowreview/text: Product came as describe. My daughter is enjoying it, as well speck. She having some problem pulling all the way back & it a 18lb bow.In my research, it was said that a 25 lb was good, so I went to a 18lb as she only 8yrs old. She can pull it half way & still hits here target.Hopefully she stay interested in it & with practice will get better & will upgrade to the 25lb & 50lb as she grows up.
