review/summary: something to brag about!review/text: I love love love this Thermos! I needed something to hold my coffee and keep it warm and at temp all day, but mostly LEAK PROOF!! So I took this Thermos to the test! I first put hot fresh brewed coffee straight out of the coffee pot into my thermos at 6am, with no creamer or milk. I took my coffee to work and by 6pm my coffee was still warm enough to drink without it being completely uncomfortable to drink (too cold). Next it is very spill proof as long as you do not fill it above the neck line/indentation, you should have no problems;) I brag about this thermos to my friends, co workers and teachers!! I normally preheat my thermos with hot water, then add my coffee with creamer to bring the temp down to drinkable, right then and there and it stays drinkable ALL DAY LONG!!!
