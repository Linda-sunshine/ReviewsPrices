review/summary: Great Choicereview/text: I was back and forth over which bike rack to purchase, but I'm glad I went with this one. I drove with it from Austin, Texas to Las Vegas, Nevada without a single issue. I checked it at every stop but it remained sturdy and secure. I put towels under the foam pads as other reviewers had suggested, but even when I didn't have them down while driving through the desert I had no issues. Happy customer!
