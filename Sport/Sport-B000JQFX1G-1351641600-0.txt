review/summary: The Best Affordable Automatic Diver Watch Period!review/text: This being my second purchase of the Invicta 8926OB with the new TMI NH35A automatic movement, I have worn my first one for nearly a year now and had to pick up another to keep on reserve simply because it is so durably built, reliable and extremely accurate over a very long duration. This particular diver style watch is as near ROLEX Submariner 16610 possible in every aspect. Design, quality and performance in my honest opinion beats my Submariner! If anyone is wondering why I would buy a $100 watch when I own a Submariner, it's too expensive to use during work and play and must admit I have become favorable to the Invicta period. Although I did not care for the bracelet quality, that I easily exchanged with a NATO strap on one and SHARK stainless steel mesh band on the other.This new NH35A movement is "scary accurate" I am experiencing -1,2 seconds a week! ROLEX does no better than +12-15 seconds every couple days serviced and well calibrated. So..I have no disappointments whatsoever with these watches. I highly recommend this watch to anyone. Please ignore the ignorance of some folks out there degrading upon the Invicta brand. I'm sure every company has its share of bad designs and faulty models. Not this one. As close to a ROLEX you can buy period
