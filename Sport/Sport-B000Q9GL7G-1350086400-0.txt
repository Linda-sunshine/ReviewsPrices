review/summary: greatreview/text: I use this holster with my glock 19. Fits like a glove. pistol slides into place with an audible click. Seems to hold very securely. When you push the release button, your trigger finger is conveniently in the proper place outside the trigger guard. Have mostly used it with the paddle adapter for concealed carry, but it also comes with a belt loop adapter. lightweight, comfortable. Can be integrated with a blackhawk tactical leg harness.
