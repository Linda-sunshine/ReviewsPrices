review/summary: Very handy little toolreview/text: I love these little swiss army knives. I always keep one on my key fob. The only problem is I have forgotten a couple of times to take it off when I am flying, therefore the TSA has enheirited a couple from me. The scissors alone are very handy not to mention all the other tools that come with it! Can't go wrong with this one.
