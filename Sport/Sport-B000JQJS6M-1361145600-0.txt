review/summary: Rolex?review/text: I have several high end watches such as Rolexes, Patek Philippe, Frank Muller etc. but I always have a few less expensove watches for rough days out hiking etc. I bought this watch for that purpose. It looks like my Rolex submariner and runs great. So far it keeps better time then my Rolex. Go figure. It's a good buy for the money
