review/summary: Work great, easy to adjust while riding, easy to install.review/text: The hardest part of installing these mirrors is cutting away the bar ends. If you have plugs in your bar ends, there's nothing to cut; you just remove the plugs. If you don't have a good sharp tool to cut away the ends, go to your local bike shop and ask them to do it for you. The rest of the installation is trivial.Each mirror comes with both a large and small wedge (which fit inside the bar ends) and they've fit on every bike I've tried using one wedge or the other.The image is clear, the mirror doesn't fog, and it's much more stable than typical helmet mirrors. I like having a pair of these, one on each side, for my recumbent bike although I was happier with my helmet mirror while riding my Schwinn hybrid. On the recumbent, it's very hard to turn around to look behind, so mirrors are essential, plus your head stays in one place so the mirrors don't have to be constantly adjusted (very much like riding in a car). On the "normal" bike, I find that I change my posture a lot (sitting up straight, leaning way over the bars, and everything in between) which requires adjusting the mirrors all the time, so the helmet mirror works better for me on that bike.If you lose just a few parts or break the mirror, you can purchase just those parts directly from the manufacturer. Instructions and prices for doing so are on the instruction sheet that comes in the package.This is the best bike mirror I've ever used. If you can't install your mirror in your bar ends (because you have bar-end shifters or some other reason) then I'd recommend trying one of Mirrycle's other mirrors. They're probably just as good as these, just with different mounts.
