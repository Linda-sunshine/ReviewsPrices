review/summary: Broke oftenreview/text: I bought these a few years back and figured I would finally submit a review for them. I'd probably stay away from these. I used them probably 20-25 times when they broke at the handle. Since I still had some rope left, I was able to fix them....for a few more weeks, when they broke again at the handle. At that point, I decided that jump roping just wasn't my thing and threw them in the trash.It's certainly possible I just had bad luck. I actually didn't have the problem that many reviewers state in adjusting the rope's length. I just don't think the quality is there. My jump rope saw very limited use (I didn't jump rope for more than 5 minutes at at time), and it still didn't last being used more than 2 dozen times.I'd probably go with another manufacturer for jump ropes, although this one certainly won't break the bank if you decide to give it a try.
