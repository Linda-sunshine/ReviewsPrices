review/summary: super fastreview/text: If you haven't used these before your in for a pleasant surprise. No matter how dirty the barrel gets, these things clean it quickly and throughly. Even after years of use and many machine washings, (yup it's alright) they still work very well. You can even add a few drops of bore cleaner or whatever else you want to the material and there's "no worry mate" about damaging your barrel like you have when using a cleaning rod!
