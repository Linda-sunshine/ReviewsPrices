review/summary: Good basic inexpensive monitorreview/text: This was just about what I wanted for a pulse monitor. Overall it works well. Just be sure to wet the back of the sensor before putting it on your chest. The only thing I wish it did was to provide a average, max and min of hear rate during the exercise period. This is available on monitors costing about twice as much. If you just want to be able to view your heart rate at any time during exercise and time your workout length this is a good deal and worth the money.
