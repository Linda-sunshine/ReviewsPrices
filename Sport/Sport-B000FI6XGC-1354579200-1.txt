review/summary: Great pump for the moneyreview/text: Great Value. Has come in handy many times. It would be just a little better if it came with some kind of pressure indicator, but would probably cost a lot more. Not much of a convenience tool, but great in emergency situations. Super light and, so far, very durable.
