review/summary: Fantastic!review/text: Needed a carry holster for range trips and open-carrying of my new Glock 19. This fit the bill VERY nicely. Amazingly well constructed and fits like a glove. The holster feels incredibly solid. Definitely felt confident with the button release to not have to worry about NDs/ADs and its still easy enough to get out should the need arise or while doing draw drills at the range. I highly recommend this product.
