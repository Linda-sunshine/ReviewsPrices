review/summary: Nice tight fit.review/text: When I pulled it out of the package,I thought no way this is going to fit. I have a Taurus PT140 Pro, just follow the directions and work it on. Looks like it's made for it. Have not shot the gun with the new grip yet, but it has a nice snug fit. Ithink it will be fine.
