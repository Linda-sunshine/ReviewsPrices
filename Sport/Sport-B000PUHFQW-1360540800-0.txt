review/summary: Yoga Matreview/text: I enjoy the thickness of my mat. It is true that it can be a bit slippery when 1st purchased. I washed mine with soap and water in the tub a few times and the more I use it, the less slippery it gets(also remember to wash hands of any lotion before beginning your yoga session). I would recommend this one to someone who is starting YOGA. There are probably better mats, but the price and the value is perfect.
