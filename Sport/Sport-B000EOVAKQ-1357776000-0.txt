review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: I never write reviews. After 6 years, this is the first time I've felt compelled to write about an Amazon purchase. Whereas I owned a similar product (Kayenne) before this as a new swimming aficionado... having applied a little defogging spray called &#34;Spit,&#34; the comfort and visibility from these goggles is superb!!! Combine this with a waterproof iPod Shuffle and swimming laps is FANTASTIC!!! Like, otherworldly!!!
