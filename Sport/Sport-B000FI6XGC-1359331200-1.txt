review/summary: Great pump!review/text: I'm only able to use one hand. This pump clamps onto the stem. Because it's short, it doesn't try to torque itself off the stem while I'm pumping. I used to carry Co2 cartridges and a pump that could utilize them, but I don't need those anymore. This pump, using one hand, will get me to a place where I can make a permanent repair and use my re-chargeable compressor to complete the job.
