review/summary: Missing battery, zero servicereview/text: I ordered the pedometer from Amazon and it arrived in a sealed plastic container. When opened, it had no battery. The battery is listed on the box as included. The video says it is easy to get started because the battery is included. I sent an email to Omron and got a prompt reply the next day. They said they include the batter when it is shipped. I seriously doubt somebody at Amazon is cutting the container open and stealing the batter, then magically resealing the container.It was frustrating to have it arrive without a battery, but even worse to have them tell me this was not their problem.I've not had the pedometer long enough to evaluate its performance but I did pay $4.29 for the battery.
