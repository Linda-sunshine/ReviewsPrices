review/summary: Polar insulated water bottlereview/text: The polar water bottle is working out great for my son, especially when the weather has been so hot in Southern California lately. It keeps the water cold the whole elementary school day. The color is a little muted, so if you like a colorful bottle, choose one with bright colors.
