review/summary: Great Water Bottle Except...review/text: I really do like this bottle. It fits well in my hand and even when it is full I can loop my finger through the top and carry it for long distances without it hurting me. It keeps my water cold for a long period of time and I really like the dust cap; however, I didn't realize that the bottle would "breathe" when I drank from it. It makes this high pitched squeaky noise like a seal barking really fast. This isn't a problem in a workout class or when I am out running on my own but when I am sitting in class or a meeting it is embarrassing to drink from. This is honestly enough of a deal breaker for me that I would send it back if I could but since I don't want to pay the $6 return shipping fee that Amazon charges... I will just keep it and try to sip quietly!
