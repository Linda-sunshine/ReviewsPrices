review/summary: Good, cleanreview/text: This is a nice water bottle in the sense that it keeps very clean when traveling. The only issue I had was that the paint chipped fairly easily when it hit against things. Bummer, because I wanted a pretty color and now it's pretty banged up. Oh well. It certainly does beat the hard plastic water bottles that get grimy pretty quickly. I was living in the tropics for 2 years and my Nalgene was disgusting! This bottle changed that and I didn't have to take it all apart and scrub it down every few days.
