review/summary: a little shortreview/text: I am 6'2 and bought these shorts thinking that they would fit me like they do the guy on the picture. I was sorely mistaken. They are about mid thigh length, but are also very comfortable for running so i decided to keep them. Great quality, just know that they are not that long.
