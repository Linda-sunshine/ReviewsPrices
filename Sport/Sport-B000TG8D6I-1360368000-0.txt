review/summary: Great Workout!review/text: So far I'm on my 30th Day of the Lean X program. I've lost 6lbs. I'm not following the nutritional plan exactly, but I am keeping track of my calories which helps. I really enjoy it and the workout calendar that comes with it has really helped to keep me on track and motivated :)
