review/summary: Wider than expected and good pump!review/text: I ordered 2 of these for some guests visiting for a couple of days, and they looked like a good balance (not the very cheap/manual pumps and not the very sophisticated ones that cost almost like a new bed)....PROS- Very compact packaging. You can (with some effort even put it back in the bag, as show in the photos/ads)- Good and intuitive pump (just turn left/right to inflate/deflate and plug in the power outlet)- Wide enough. Although it's a twin, sometimes these twin air mattresses are tiny and can fit only kids. This is a really good side bed.CONS- The top of the bed is not flat/smooth (has the wavy look as you can see if you look closer in the photo). So it's best to have a thich sheet on it, to make it feel even.Overall, a good value, doesnt take too much space and pump makes it easy/quick to set it up
