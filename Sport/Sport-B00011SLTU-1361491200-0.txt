review/summary: I like this a lotreview/text: This is a small, sharp and useful device. I have purchased a couple of these to keep on my keychains. Given the choice, I find the utility of the Victorinox Rally a lot better. The difference is the scissors are replaced with a bottle opener and slotted screwdriver. I personally find those things more useful, but a well made useful device nonetheless.
