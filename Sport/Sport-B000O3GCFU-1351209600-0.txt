review/summary: Did what is was supposed to.review/text: I bought this for my six year old to take to school for lunch. I followed the instructions, poured boiling water in for a few minutes to heat it up, and put her food in it. It stays warm until lunch and has not leaked yet. Make sure the thermos lid is dry before screwing it on or it could be difficult for your child to open at lunchtime (guessing it creates some sort of suction if wet). Great buy!
