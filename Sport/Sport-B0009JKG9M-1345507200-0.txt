review/summary: I love this skilletreview/text: I've had this skillet for a couple of weeks and I have had so much fun cooking with it. Chicken comes out so tender, and I love that I can take it from the stovetop and put it right into the oven. The lid is also a skillet, so this is like two skillets in one!
