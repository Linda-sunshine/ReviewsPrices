review/summary: ONLY DOES THE BASICS - NOTHING MUCH ELSEreview/text: I've just purchased the HRM. Very basic model. Yes it will display your heart rate, but I cant get it to show both my heart rate and the stopwatch on the same screen. It will give you feedback while you are working out, but not any usefull information after (i.e. what your average rate was during the session, your maximum, how long you were in your target zone). I should have done more research really, and it was pretty cheap for a chest strap model, but it will just be a backup unit if my "real" one (which does all that listed above) dies.
