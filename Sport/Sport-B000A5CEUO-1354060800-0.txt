review/summary: Love, love, love this!review/text: This is my second heart rate monitor and I think I have found my brand. The watch part of the monitor has a replaceable battery which is great! In my previous heart rate monitor I could not replace the battery which is any I had to buy a new monitor. The strap part of the monitor is comfortable and you won't know you are wearing it while you are working out.
