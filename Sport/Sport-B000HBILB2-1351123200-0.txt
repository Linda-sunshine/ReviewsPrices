review/summary: Reliable airbed at a competitive pricereview/text: Easy setup and it holds air reliably. I've been sleeping on it for almost 3 months and have no complaints. I like the extra height and the internal AC cord beats a battery operated airbed hands down, unless you're camping obviously. It will release some air though I'd say that's normal as opposed to something that just doesn't hold air and goes flat; so once in a while I add some air to keep it firm. I bought a similar bed at a retailer (out of immediate need) and the price was more than twice this one, for no discernable difference in quality if there's any difference at all. This has earned my recommendation and I would buy here if I had to do it again.
