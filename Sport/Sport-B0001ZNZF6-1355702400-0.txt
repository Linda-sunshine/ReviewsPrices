review/summary: Great boxersreview/text: I bought these comfortable boxers for a fall backpacking trip in Europe, mainly to save some weight and space in my bag. As luck would have it, my accomodation didn't have any clothes dryers. These boxers were completely dried overnight, even in the moist, 40 degree weather of the British Isles, whereas my normal boxers took the better part of a week to dry.
