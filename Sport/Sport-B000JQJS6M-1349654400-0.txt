review/summary: Lots of Value and Utilityreview/text: This watch proved to be a great purchase because of its form, funciton, and price.For starters, this watch is great looking. Overall, it is slightly smaller than expected but I didnt find that to be a problem. The links, winder, and trim around the bezel is in fact 18k gold plated and looks stellar. The blue on the bezel is wonderful. However the dial is slightly purple in appearance. I would give the watch a 10/10 appearance wise if the dial and bezel matched.If you read in other reviews, you may aleady know this. Rolex sued Invicta because of how much this looks like a submariner. That is why all of Invicta's newer watches look different. Google a picture and see for yourself! I have had people ask me if it was a Rolex.In terms of accuracy, I have had no problems with mine so far. My Pro Diver is always within a minute or two of the actual time. The rotating bezel works nicely and it is very 'cool' to see the movement through the back glass.For ~$90 w/ shipping you cannot go wrong.I highly recommend this product.
