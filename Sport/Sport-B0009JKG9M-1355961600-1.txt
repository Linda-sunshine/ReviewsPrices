review/summary: My favorite by farreview/text: This set is awesome - you're actually getting two pans in one. The top can be used as a shallow frying pan. The bottom is a deep frying pan, or stock pot.I use both to make French fries instead of a deep fry. Everything comes out crunchy when fried and tasty when boiled or seared. Large pot works for soups or casserole. Use peanut oil for best flavor when frying.
