review/summary: Motivatorreview/text: Easier to use than other pedometers I've tried, and far more accurate, plus it works by simply putting it in my pocket. The display is easy to read, and I like that it "remembers" seven days worth of data. and it automatically resets itself to 00 at midnight every night. I am an active 72 year-old who needs to lose about 20#. I do some ballroom dancing and lap swimming, but walking and hiking are the 'daily bread" of my exercise program. I now know that in an ordinary stay-at-home day, I get only about 3000 to 4000 steps. My goal is to reach that "magic" number of 10,000 every single day. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that I live in an area of bumpy cobblestone streets, and it registers some phantom steps when I am in the car. The Omron instruction book mention this possibility, so the manufacturer is totally honest about this small glitch. This pedometer was recommended to me by at least five friends scattered in different parts of the country, and I join wholeheartedly in recommending it to others.
