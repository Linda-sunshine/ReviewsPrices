review/summary: HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!review/text: Bought this watch as a gift for someone who could not afford a new watch after their old one gave out. They were really excited when they opened the box. It looks beautiful! Unfortunately, the watch did not work. NONE of the side dials were operative -- they were all frozen in place. It was impossible to even set the time. Sadly, this gift became a huge disappointment and this person remains, now again, without a watch. It is a complete hassle to straighten out this whole mess. Not likely to purchase this watch again.
