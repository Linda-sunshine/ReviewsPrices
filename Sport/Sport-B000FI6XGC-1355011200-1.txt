review/summary: Useful for small jobs, damaged two of my tubesreview/text: I was pretty satisfied with this pump.Then it broke the valve off two of my tubes.This is a great little pump for taking with you for the occasional small pump-up on the road. However, BE VERY CAREFUL to hold the valve end still. In using it for pumping up tires most of the way, I had two unfortunate situations that the movement back and forth of the pump actually sliced the valve off my tube, rendering them useless (with a big ol' hole in them).
