review/summary: Thin Socksreview/text: These socks are too thin for me and actually cause my feet to overheat because they don't fit well in my shoes. I don't run with these socks anymore because they don't cool my feet as well as my normal running socks causing blisters. However I do like these socks for when I am done running because they separate my toes from each other helping them not rub together.
