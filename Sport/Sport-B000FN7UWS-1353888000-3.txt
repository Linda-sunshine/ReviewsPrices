review/summary: Nice bottle but could be a lot betterreview/text: It's a nice bottle. I like having a reusable container for fluids. It's light and relatively easy to carry. The downsides of the bottle come very close to canceling out the positives.For starters, it is a chore to clean. I've tried several techniques and the best I can come up with are these tablets that soak in the bottle for a few hours. The tablets cost roughly $1 each which does add up over time.Secondly, the bottle is not very durable. Considering it is a canteen made for carrying liquids, it dents very easily. I've had mine for a few months and have dropped it twice. Each time was only a few feet. One time it rolled off of the seat of my car and hit the ground (about two feet). I now have three sizable dents in my canteen. I'm not rough on it at all. I'm very conscious of trying not to drop it or bang it around but things do happen.Thirdly, it is expensive. I don't mind the price but it seems a lot to pay considering how delicate it is. After another few months of normal use I expect it to be dented enough that I will have to purchase a new one (at which point I will look for a better option). I will do my best to baby it but that seems rather ridiculous considering it is a steel canteen. Maybe there should be something rubbery on it to protect it a little better. It would also add some grip for when it gets wet.
