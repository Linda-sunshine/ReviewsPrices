review/summary: Not a Rolexreview/text: I love the Rolex Daytona, and this is OBVIOUSLY a copy. That's why I bought it. A great beautiful copy. I may buy a another one or two in different colors. You won't be disappointed. The &#34;feel&#34; of it on your wrist is a little rough compared to finer watches that I have owned....but really, for the money...wow! Until prosperity returns to the USA, I'm loving this. The Rolex has to wait.
