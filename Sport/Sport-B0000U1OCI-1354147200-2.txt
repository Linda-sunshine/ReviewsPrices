review/summary: Everything I need in a pedometerreview/text: I love this pedometer and it's the fourth one I've purchased. The second for me because I lost one.The other two as gifts.I can customize the setting by entering the length of my stride, my age, and weight. Not only does this pedometer tell you how many steps you take, but how far you walk, and how many calories you burn in a day. At midnight it resets and it keeps track of your activity for a week. Also it keeps the time. I wear mine everyday and put it on the first thing in the morning. I don't think I would walk as much as I do if it wasn't for my pedometer. Anyway, I truly love this on model. It is reasonably priced and does more than what the average person needs.
