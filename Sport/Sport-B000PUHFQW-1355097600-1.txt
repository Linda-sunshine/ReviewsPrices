review/summary: this mat smells super strong of chemicals and slidesreview/text: when i opened the mat i figured the smell would wear off in just a couple of minutes. boy was i wrong. Three weeks later, smell is still so strong that I will probably have to buy a new mat. Also it slides . really bad.
