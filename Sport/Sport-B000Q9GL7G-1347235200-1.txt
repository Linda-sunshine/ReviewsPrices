review/summary: El Galloreview/text: So far so good. I did not buy this item from the seller, but did go out to buy it in my local gun store. I really like, because it is a great design. Quick to draw from concealment, really love the way on how you must remove the gun from the holster. No need to use other fingers. A must to have for anyone who is looking for a new holster for any gun.A bit bulky for my because the style of gun I bought it for. I will recommend any blackhawk holsters to anyone. Thank you for reading this.
