review/summary: Annoying in several ways, but does hold waterreview/text: Functionally this thing is ok. No leaks, no smells, will hold up over time.However, I am a bit nitpicky with stuff I use all the time, and this product is very annoying and I have stopped using it.Drawbacks:- Handle is very wide, always contacts legs on bicycle regardless of position- Valve doesn't have the best flow/play.- Threading on top isn't the smoothest. Easy to cross thread or not tighten 100% resulting in leaks.I will stick with my non-insulated, $3 16oz water bottles. No frills, but everything works better without any headaches. I don't really value the insulation.
