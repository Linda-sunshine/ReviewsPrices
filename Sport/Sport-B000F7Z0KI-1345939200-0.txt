review/summary: It works!review/text: How do you rate a water bottle? There are no buttons to push or knobs to turn or anything. Anyway, my bottle does not leak, but it does "sweat". I put the bottle in the freezer each night and the next day within seconds of taking it out, the humidity starts to condense. It is not really much of a problem, but I was expecting it to be more like a Tervis cup. They don't sweat. The idea is the same - a double-walled bottle.Like I said, mine goes in the freezer every night. I have washed it in the dishwasher. I have left it in a hot car several times. Needless to say, it gets a lot of use. So far neither the cap nor the spout leak. The Polar Bottle website says if anything goes wrong to let them know and they will make it right. I hope I don't have to test them on it...
