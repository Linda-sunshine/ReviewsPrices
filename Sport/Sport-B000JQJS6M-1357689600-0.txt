review/summary: About what I expected overall.review/text: Let me begin by saying that I was not amused by the ocean of scotch tape covering the watch from angle to angle when it arrived in the box. I would like to find whoever was responsible for the packaging, break his teeth, and stomp on his testicles. But really, WHY?????? This is not the first watch I've ordered from Amazon, but it IS my first Invicta, and also the first to be covered in tape, so I would assume Invicta rather than Amazon.com is responsible.Now, about the watch itself...Rolex look-alike or not, I think it's beautiful. I like the fact that it has an automatic movement. In my eyes it somehow makes it feel like a more expensive watch, and speaking of expensive watches I own a few.I really do love this particular design. There are a few signs of cost-cutting in the way the links feel (not quite as secure as a Citizen or even a Fossil) but I don't expect the thing to fall apart anytime soon. This is more like nit-picking. Also, I'm surprised that there is no button you can press to release the safety clasp but I have a similar complaint about my Tag Heuer so maybe that's not so unusual.If you're into watches like me and love the look, take the plunge. Those looking to con others into believing they own a Rolex will be disappointed to find "Invicta" written in rather bold lettering on virtually every corner of the watch.
