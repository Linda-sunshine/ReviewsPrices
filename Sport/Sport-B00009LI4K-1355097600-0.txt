review/summary: Hearing Protectorreview/text: We purchased this product on the basis of customer reviews and the recommendation of a friend, and have not been disappointed. The headset fits well, and can be adjusted quickly to accommodate other head wear. We use it on the pistol range, in the shop when operating noisy tools, while hunting, and while on the riding mower or pushing the snow thrower. Its noise reduction is better than other units I've tried with the same decibel reduction rating.
