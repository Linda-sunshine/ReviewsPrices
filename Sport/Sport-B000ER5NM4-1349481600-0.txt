review/summary: Sizing way offreview/text: The waist of these yoga pants is so small I could not get them on. No stretch to it. I held these up to other yoga pants of the same size in my closet and the waist was several inches smaller. The material was not soft and comfortable for what I would expect and want in a yoga pant.
