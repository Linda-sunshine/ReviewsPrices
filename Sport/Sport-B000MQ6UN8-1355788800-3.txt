review/summary: Great Glass just too smallreview/text: The glasses came in time, but they were wayyyy smaller than expected. I got a 58mm and i have a fairly big head so they looked like kids toy glasses on my face. I recommend you try them on in a store first. I'm going to exchange them for the 3026 62mm.
