review/summary: Cost-effective aid for tent campingreview/text: I plan to use these to place between the inflatable mattress and my sleeping bag while tent camping to reflect my body heat upwards. The idea here is to help insulate me from the cold air that will be in the mattress. The mattress air is chilled by its proximity to the cold ground. We'll see what happens in a supplemental review in the future.These are very thin sheets, and have no backing pad. They appear to be completely reversible, so there is no top or bottom to them.
