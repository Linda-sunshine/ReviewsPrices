review/summary: Difficult to Clean. Uneven Temp. No Low Temp. Heavy. Paint Peeling.review/text: Had high hopes for this to be my home and portable grill, turns out its no good for either. It's annoyingly heavy and awkward and large to transport. But what's worse is it's an absolute pain to clean. Basically your option is either to spend as much time cleaning it as you do cooking on it, or having rusty grates and grease fires. The grates fall off if you stand it too up right while transporting. The lid lock is lousy, the heavy grates fell on my foot. There is no low temp on this grill. It's way too hot. Cooking is extremely uneven. Cooking sausages on this thing is impossible. Don't buy this.
