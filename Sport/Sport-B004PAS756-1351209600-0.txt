review/summary: Insanity Workoutreview/text: Insanity Workout: Fast and FuriousThe first section of the DVD is geared to get your blood flowing and warm up your muscles. When I went the through program the first time I thought he jumped right into the workout. I didn't realize that the first few minutes is the easiest part.Next Shaun puts you through Dynamic Stretching which I use now every time I need to stretch. Its just a great way to start the real insanity workout.For the main portion of the DVD you will be doing a variety of body weight exercises: jumps coupled with push ups, football runs, the Heisman, and more. Its a grueling workout that will get you sweating fast.Finally he runs you through post-workout stretching. At this point I think one of the actors throws up of camera. Shaun references, "coughing," so I'm not sure if its more than that.The insanity workout is great because you can slow down if needed and push yourself as your stamina increases. I highly recommend it.Jim C[...]
