review/summary: Fantastic workout!review/text: I was apprehensive about getting this as I am not in &#34;great&#34; shape and some of the reviews made it sound like you had to be in order to do this. What made me just go ahead and get it was the fact that it was a great price and only a 20 minute workout. I have looked into the Insanity workout but so many CDs and so much time that I just don't have. This is a fantastic workout guaranteed to make you sweat and get your heart rate up and keep it there for the entire 20 minutes. Even the &#34;warm up&#34; is hard but it is worth it! I have been doing it for 2 weeks and have gotten to the point where I can only get through the warm up without stopping. Hopefully in another 2 weeks I will be able to get through the entire 20 minutes without stopping. That being said, I don't feel bad about taking a break as the instructor and the other guy have to take breaks themselves. Like I said, I have been doing this for 2 weeks, often doing it twice a day; in the morning before work and then another quick 20 minutes when I get home before I eat dinner. I didn't necessarily get this to lose weight but rather to get my heart rate up and get in better shape as far as toning my abs. If you are wanting to get your metabolism fired up this workout will do it for sure! This is actually the only workout that I have stuck with consistently and I have to say I enjoy it and look forward to getting up and getting this workout done! The 20 minutes goes by so fast and I feel great and ready for the day!
