review/summary: Useful, slim, tiny multipurpose knifereview/text: I used to have a red, plastic-sides version of this little knife back in the late 90' until I lost it, eventually. The plastic version has tweezers and toothpick, this one doesn't, so, please keep it in mind. On a plus side, this knife is slimmer somewhat. Looks pretty good as well. As a knife, it's obviously only useful for small jobs, due to a very short, non-locking blade. However, it does come in handy rather often. Scissors keep a sharp edge for a long time and the screwdriver tip on the nail file is a great idea.Beats carrying a huge multitool when all you need is to open a package, cut off product tags, tighten or loosen an occasional screw, or trim a nail. Recommended.
