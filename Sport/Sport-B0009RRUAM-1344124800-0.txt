review/summary: Excellentreview/text: This is a TERRIFIC travel pillow.It compacts very easily and small. When it is unpacked, it opens and fills quickly. The small is EXCELLENT for back packing.Sleeping on it is very comfortable. I took it on deployment though I used a hoodie under it to prop it up some, I slept very well with it and carried/used it without effort.Highly recommend this item!
