review/summary: THE gift for menreview/text: My husband probably thought I was goofy when I ordered him these underwear for Christmas. But, I couldn't get past the ratings. They were so touted. Wow, my husband was not disappointed. He loves these. They are pricey, so when we see them discounted we scoop up a few more and are working to completely switch out his collection to these ExOfficio.
