review/summary: Amazing Helmet!review/text: This helmet is amazing. The price is incredibly cheap, however it looks like one of the top of the line helmets. Durability is great (or at least I believe so, I've yet to get hit by a car, knock on wood). and the overall look and feel is top notch. The comfort is good and the straps do not chafe the skin.My girlfriend bought a helmet that was nearly four times as expensive, however the material is all the same. Schwinn is a brand I'm well acquainted with, and this helmet is a wonderful budget solution to ensuring you (or your kids) are safe while out and about.
