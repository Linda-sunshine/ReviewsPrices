review/summary: Pocketsreview/text: For me, shorts without pockets and a draw-string are useless. These shorts have both. I bought these shorts when they were on sale, great price and free shipping. They're well made and cool on those hot summer days, I even like wearing them around the house because they're so comfortable.
