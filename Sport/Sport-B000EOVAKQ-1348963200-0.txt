review/summary: Great in every way!review/text: These goggles are my new favorite! They are so comfortable to wear, the part that comes over the nose is silicone type material which doesn't hurt even after an hour of swimming! They do a good job keeping water out. So far, and I've only been using these for a month or so, they haven't started fogging up yet. One tip if they do start fogging up (my swim instructor told me this, haven't tried yet) - is to put them in the dishwasher. That apparently does the trick.
