review/summary: Solid Build Quality, Great Temperature Controlreview/text: I have been using the Thermos Nissan for hot drinks and some cold drinks. It keeps the contents hot or cold for a very long time. In one case, the cap was left open for about 3 hours, and I expected my hot tea to be cold. This was not the case. It seemed to be about as hot as it was when I left it 3 hours earlier. This product exceeds expectations.
