review/summary: leakreview/text: Tried these for a week and gave up. Maybe they fit some peoples faces, but not mine. Couldn't stop one or the other goggle from leaking no matter how tight I made them. If you even get a little bit of water in them it collects in the corner so you always feel there is some water in them - and when the water gets to much it starts getting in your eye. They drove me crazy. Worthless junk.
