review/summary: Cute little toolreview/text: After having my 15 year-old tiny knife confiscated from my carry-on luggage at the airport, I searched for a replacement. The best deal was on Amazon. The product arrived quickly and is as wonderful as my old one -- only now they come in more colors. Having tiny scissors and a little blade is very useful for lots of chores. The workmanship remains high.
