review/summary: Leaks constantly; threw it awayreview/text: Bought this for my 8-yr-old daughter. It is not possible for her to push the closure cap down hard enough, reliably enough, for bottle not to leak all over her schoolwork. I have difficulty closing it myself. It may be a bum bottle, but it appears to be constructed as intended.Threw it away.
