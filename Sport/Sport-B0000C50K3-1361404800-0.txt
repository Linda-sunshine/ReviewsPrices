review/summary: I can finally enjoy using Military surplus ammo!review/text: I got a new Mosin Nagant 91/30. The price for military surplus ammo is great, but they are corrosive and I hated the idea of messing up my rifle. With the bore snake cleaning is easy and fast. The best part is that the snake is washable. I just hand wash it but the instructions say it can be machine washed also.
