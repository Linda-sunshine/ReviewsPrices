review/summary: Handy pedometer for first-time usersreview/text: That's me so I can vouch for the above headline.The Omron HJ-112 is user-friendly and is good to use ar far as I can say.One thing to keep in mind though is that you should keep the screwdriver supplied with the product since you will be using it again and again.I have used it to change batteries and reset my weight, height, and walking pace statistics.Also, be mindful of the pedometer if you clip in on the hip.I can't recall the countless times it has fallen if I tried adjusting my pants or something along the lines!The good thing is the product is tough and fall-resistant so not too many worries.I kind of have an inkling that there are better pedometers around so I will be snooping around Amazon to see.This one was good for a first-time, relatively cheap purchase.
