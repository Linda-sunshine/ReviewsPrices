review/summary: Convenient every day carry knifereview/text: Love the Leeks, I own about three of them and have given out another five or so as gifts. The thin profile is perfect for everyday without being obtrusive. It's amazing how many times a day I find myself using it!If you get the serrated version, the smith pal pocket sharpener can sharpen both the straight and serrated edges
