review/summary: Good basic Matt, but hard to carryreview/text: About the same thickness/softness as a standard matt used in the YMCA. Good height and width, again like standard yoga matt. Not slippery so that you can grip it with feet and hands. In sum: just about perfect for my purpose. One drawback is that it's hard to carry and there is no reasonable priced carrying device on Amazon as of this review and purchase. There is a holder that looks perfect for less than $5, but the shipping charge is over $8- too costly for a small strap.I thought that I would just roll it up and carry it, but it's been too inconvenient when carrying a gym bag, water, keys, etc.....Would have been 4-5 stars if they charged a little more and included a strap for carrying or if they had made sure one was available.
