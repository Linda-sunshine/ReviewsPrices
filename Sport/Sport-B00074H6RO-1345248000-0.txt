review/summary: Size issuereview/text: I ordered medium sized gloves (as the size chart suggested me being a medium) and the gloves that were shipped were much smaller in size. I faced a lot of difficulty trying to grip onto weights and it just resulted in painful palms after the workout. I went to a sports store recently and saw the exact same "medium" sized gloves and they fit perfectly. I went back home to check whether my gloves were mistakenly marked as medium even though they were small but I don't think that was the case. Maybe the seller storing conditions might have affected the quality of the product. Long story short - I was not satisfied at all.
