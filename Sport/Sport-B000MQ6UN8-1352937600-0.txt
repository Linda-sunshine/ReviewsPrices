review/summary: I was SKEPTICAL at first, but I verified and the Aviators are 100% Authenticreview/text: Alright, I read a few reviews about these not being genuine and was skeptical and hesitant to buy...but after receiving them I compared my new pair (November 2012, Gold with G-15 XLT Lens, 58mm) to the exact same Ray Ban Aviators at Sunglass Hut and Dillards and I believe they are most definitely genuine.The white Ray-Ban logo is written on the lens correctlyThe weight/feel/glass quality are all the sameThe RB is perfectly/properly sketched on the other lensThe Engraving under the top nose bridge is correctThe nose pieces are elliptical, have RB on them correctly, are the right size/shape/materialThe precise writing on the inside of the frames is correct and includes model number, made in Italy, etc...The rubber on the end of the frames is the right shape/materialEverything was properly packed, included all the right materials in original packagingThe box had a proper label on it with model #, bar code, genuine infoLike I said, I was concerned. Around $80 for Aviators instead of the standard $140 is a great deal....IF THEY ARE REAL.I'm certain mine are, so I am keeping them...they were sold directly by Amazon LLC and shipped Amazon prime.
