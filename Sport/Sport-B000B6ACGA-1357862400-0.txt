review/summary: Mixes without Messreview/text: This was a perfect solution for our situation.Skip-Bo was the game. Many multiple stacksof sequential cards that needed to be dis-organized.I was constantly shuffling each small stack (12 cards),and merging them with other stacks and re-shufflingthe whole time during the game to get them mixed well.Now, just a quick shuffle or two and place them in thehopper, alternating sides. When stock pile expires,hold down the button for several seconds and a newstock pile is instantly available. Batteries hold up well.
