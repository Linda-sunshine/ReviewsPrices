review/summary: Very good but with one flawreview/text: The knife is compact and very sharp. It feels well made. It is however extremely akward to open. You have to orientate the knife in a very specific position and be very careful not to block its swift opening. If not careful you could even injure yourself. Also the metal is very shinning with lille grip.
