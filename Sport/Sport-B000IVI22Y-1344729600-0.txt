review/summary: Too big for my car's cupholderreview/text: Love the capacity vs my 500 ml Camelbak bottle, but that smaller one is tapered at the base, so it fits in my cupholder, and this one is not. Minor issue because the security of the bite valve means I can lay it down on the passenger seat. The info with the bottle says studies show that people drink more with the bite valve and I believe it -- I got this .75 litre because I seem to drain the .5 litre in just a few drinks! However, the .5 litre is a bit more convenient to tote around.
