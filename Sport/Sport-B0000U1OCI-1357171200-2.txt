review/summary: Omron HJ-112 Pedometerreview/text: I've been using this for about a year now to keep track of my steps. This is one of the best electronic gadget I've ever had, does what it says and easy to use. Mine even survived a cycle thru the washing machine without missing a beat!! Will without a doubt get another when this one quits working.
