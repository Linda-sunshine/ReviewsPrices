review/summary: Best water bottlereview/text: I never drank enough water before I bought this water bottle, but now I use it constantly. It's fantastic for the lazy water-drinker because you don't even have to screw off the lid. The little hook on top makes it easy to carry around on your finger or clipped to a bag. It also comes in plenty of awesome colors. I don't see why anyone wouldn't pick this water bottle--definitely the best.
