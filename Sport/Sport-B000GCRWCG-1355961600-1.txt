review/summary: Great for an emergency.review/text: Pack of 10 mylar emergency blankets. Simple and easy to use. They are very effective if you understand how to use them. It is best to have 2 of these on hand, one to lay on top of and another to cover yourself. They work on the principle of convection... trapping heat close to your body. As long as you keep drafts from getting under the blanket you will be pretty toasty.Great for putting in your pocket during camping trips, glovebox of your car and for emergency preparedness kits.Pic of product:[...]
