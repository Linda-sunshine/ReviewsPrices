review/summary: Perfectreview/text: I travel with my bike often, and this goes long distances with no problem. Easy to set up, and using one of the modified installation methods I can still get in my trunk and leave it on my car.Make sure to buy the extra bar if you have a girl bike (not a straight bar from seat to handle bars).
