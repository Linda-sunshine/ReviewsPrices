review/summary: Great bottle for pricereview/text: This is a great insulated water bottle. Cold with ice and no sweating of the plastic is wonderful! Haven't tried anything warm, but I'm sure it would work just as well. Cap is supposed to be top rack dishwasher safe, but since I'm having to wash the bottle, I haven't bothered to put cap in dishwasher. Like the indented hand holder as well as the hand loop. Wish they offered a flip-top cap too.
