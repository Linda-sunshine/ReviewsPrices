review/summary: Great mirrorreview/text: This is a high-quality, rugged mirror. I have purchased several over the years for my bicycles. The real-glass mirror (not plastic that scratches) gives a wide view because it is slightly convex. I have one on the left and another on the right end of my handlebar so I can see a good rear view when riding on a curve -- one or the other mirror gives rear view when the opposite side doesn't. I fell once and the mirror took the first impact. Only the glass broke. The manufacturer sells replacement parts at a reasonable cost with excellent service. The box even includes the hex wrench you need to assemble the mirror. I have only praise for this mirror.
