review/summary: Tired of the same weight training routine!review/text: It's great to get back to the basics with P90X. I never thought Yoga would be the hardest class to do, but it was an eye opener. The variety, focus on core strength, and simple exercises have kept me into it for 8 weeks now, and I'm already seeing improvements.
