review/summary: BEAUTIFUL WATCH....BUT STEM WAS MALFUNCTIONING.review/text: This stunning watch from Invicta arrived promptly, and the packaging was very well done. Upon opening the watch box, I was very impressed with the fit and finish of this timepiece. The only drawl back was that the stem did not function properly. I requested a replacement which was very simple to do, and I am waiting for my replacement Invicta. Look, manufacturing flaws occur, so I will give this watch another chance. My current Invicta, which I have owned for several months arrived in perfect condition. It is an automatic as well, and keeps very good time. All in all, I feel that Invicta make a beautiful watch at an affordable price. I own a Rolex, and several TAG's...but I would not wear them at my business. I truly don't want to beat up these much more expensive watches. The invicta is a great work watch, that has a very appealing shape,size and appearance. Many people ask about my Invicta, and they can't believe the price for such an attention-getting watch.
