review/summary: problem, but I still like it!review/text: First, this grill was easy to assemble, although the drip pan was already installed, which made me think it was missing (wish I'd discovered that BEFORE I ordered another one!). On its initial beach trip, it sprang open while my friend was wheeling it there (damaging the top), and it sprang open again when I tried to load it into the car (causing a few bruises). It seems to me that's nothing a bungee cord wouldn't solve, and so somehow I still really like this grill. It's a good size, and it's so much nicer to use than other portable grills that require a separate tabletop to get them to waist height. I like the space created by the side tables, and all in all, I think it provides a lot of utility for as compact and as portable as it is. It's not light as a feather, but by the same token it is a quite reasonable weight for its size, and when you factor in the wheels its portability seems ample.If you decide to buy this grill, here are some suggestions I found/would have found helpful. First, you may want to read the other reviews, mentioning not to use the "high" setting with the grill. Also be sure to take note that you need to pull out the two side trays before using it (not doing so voids the warranty!). As mentioned above, you may want to use something like a bungee cord to ensure that the unit stays folded; had I known to do this, my new grill would still look new! Finally, had I been thinking ahead, I might have lined mine with foil to help keep it cleaner (this suggestion isn't specific to this grill, but I thought I'd mention it anyway). It's a bit of a tedious job, because you have to cut out circles where the flame is and also provide a way for grease to go into the drip pan (would be a fire hazard otherwise), so it's not for everyone...but I wish I'd done it.
