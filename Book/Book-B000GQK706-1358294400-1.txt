review/summary: The Lord of the Rings is a really great read.review/text: The books take you to a number of lands in Middle Earth and the Tolkien describes everything in great detail so you can picture the scenery, the people and the action that happens. The books are hard to stop reading as the flow from one event to the next is so precise and engrossing.This is a great continuance of the Hobbit and just as well written.This compares well with the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov which I have also had the pleasure to explore.
