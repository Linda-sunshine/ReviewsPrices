review/summary: A world where everyone takes happy pills to ignore their issues....review/text: Hmmmm- this book along with 1984 should be required reading for everyone. If you spoke to someone from the 1930's and you told them that we live in a world where every move we make is recorded and everyone takes antidepressants to ignore their problems- they would be horrified.
