review/summary: Huck Finnreview/text: The moment when Huck chooses to help Jim to freedom Americans going to Hell in doing what he considers a bad deed is truly touching and shows a natural development of character. Moreover, life on the Mississippi was a genius dramatization for Twain. Very enjoyable
