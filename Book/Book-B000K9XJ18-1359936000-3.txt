review/summary: I've been devouring these booksreview/text: Since December I'e read 4 or five of the &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; series. Their easy to read and hard to put down. Running blind was a pretty good read. it wasn't until 3/4 way thru did I start making guesses about the ending. I'd recommend it as part of the series.
