review/summary: retraction of complaint and ratingreview/text: I recently wrote a review that was in error and I'm writing to retract my comments which were harsh. I was of the belief that the bookseller was negligent and lacking in response to my complaint. I now understand the circumstances for my original complaint and I am wrong in my admonishement.
