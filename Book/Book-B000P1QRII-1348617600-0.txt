review/summary: A Novel of Questionsreview/text: Set in a dystopian society where nobody sees in color and "sameness" is the standard, The Giver presents original ideas about societal values. At age twelve, each child is assigned the job they will perform for the rest of their lives. Twelve-year-old Jonas, though, is selected to become the new "receiver of memory": one person who carries all the memories of the past. As the story progresses and Jonas begins to receive memories of love, pain, hunger, sadness, he begins to realize just how shallow a life everyone in his community lives.I personally really have read and enjoyed this book many, many times, and I get something new out of it each time. If you consider the motives behind the "sameness," it doesn't seem like such a hard place to get to. After all, what could be so bad about ensuring that everyone is fed and cared for, that children do not have to face neglect, or hunger, or their parents' divorce. Ultimately The Giver presents the result of the choice to end these things, and the price was the loss of family, love, and true happiness. This book has forced me to come to the realization that there must be pain in order for there to be joy, because if you don't know how far you can fall, how can you truly treasure what you are given?
