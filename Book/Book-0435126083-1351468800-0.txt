review/summary: not what i expected.....review/text: The book is brand new and in beautiful condition, but the cover is different from the one advertised in the photo. The one online has a figure of a woman holding a piece of clothing across her body. I specifically bought this since I'm a very visual person and the picture drew me toward the book. When I received my Wuthering Heights, it was a plain and simple portrait of a landscape.... i'm rather disappointed since it was not what I ordered, but I guess it's what is in the book that counts...
