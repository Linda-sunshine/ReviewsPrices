review/summary: Must Read for All Kidsreview/text: I read this book as a child. At 50 yrs old I am exploring survival skills again. I got this book for myself. The determination and bravery of the main character are timeless traits for all to be inspired by. Get a copy for yourself. Hand it down to your children and grand kids.
