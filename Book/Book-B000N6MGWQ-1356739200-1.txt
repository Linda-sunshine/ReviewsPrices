review/summary: Great story except for minor detailreview/text: I am a husband who is truly in love with my wife. I am also a Soldier and a mechanic so I was able to relate . It was truly a great book except for one minor minor issue: Even the very first cordless drill was not noisy and certainly not anything you had to raise your voice over. I enjoyed reading this book but the mechanic in me had to say something even if nobody else hears me.
