review/summary: A classic, easy-to-read Christian apologeticreview/text: I have read this book twice over the past few decades, and it continues to edify me all over again each time. We bought 4 used copies of Mere Christianity to give to friends and loved ones who are agnostics. They arrived promptly and were all in good condition.
