review/summary: Sparks is the best!review/text: Seeing the movie first and then reading this book. I was scared that I'd find the movie to be a let down but actually it is well down and very similar to the written word. Nick Sparks is one of my favorite romance writers and this is one of my favorite books now, worth the read all the way!
