review/summary: A Collector's Delight!!!!review/text: I originally purchased this volume back in the early 80's when the series was first introduced. Each volume in this library has a beautifully decorated binding (similar to expensive leather bound books but much more reasonable in price) and when dispalyed as a set, the effect is stunning. I bought this copy as a Christmas gift for a friend in Austria who is an avid reader and book collector. As a European, I felt his library was incomplete without the greatest American novel ever written, Gone With The Wind. The copy is authentic and even though fairly old, it was in great shape! I highly recommend this seller and this set of masterpiece volumes for anyone who is considering assembling a library of literary master works.
