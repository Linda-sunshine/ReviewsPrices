review/summary: It's a hit at our housereview/text: I love it when a movie inspires my son to read - that's a VERY hard thing to accomplish. My 14 year old usually doesn't read for fun, but this book has sucked him in. If you're considering the purchase for a young adult/teen - I think you're found your book!
