review/summary: A definite challenge!review/text: I've been intrigued with the idea of reading this book for some time. The story is a vehicle for Ms Rands political views, of course, one of the principle characters expounding for 60 (count 'em 60) pages. The plot is somewhat dated and weak, some of the 'villains' almost comic. To be honest, I had to take a break about two thirds the way through with another book, going back to finish afterwards.
