review/summary: Exceptional!review/text: This book changed my life, freshman year of high school. We had to read this because it was required, and I did not want to read the book because I hated required reading. However, when I finally set down and read the book, I did not want to put the book down. Harper Lee pieced this book together in an exceptional way, and I did not want to stop reading. I recommend this book to children and even young adults.
