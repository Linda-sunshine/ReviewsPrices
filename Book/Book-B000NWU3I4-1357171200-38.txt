review/summary: Great quality for a literary classicreview/text: I initially purchased the hobbit in paperback after watching the Fellowship of the Ring. The initial movie in The LOTR trilogy spurred me to read the entirety of the hobbit and LOTR from beginning to end before the cinematic release of The Two Towers. I've since reread the series multiple times and as a result wanted a book that better represented how much I enjoyed the books than the cheap Walmart paperbacks I initially picked up. This was well worth the price to pay homage to this important series that has influenced so much sci-fi/fantasy, as well as other venues of pop culture.
