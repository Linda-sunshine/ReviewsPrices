review/summary: One of my All-Time Favoritesreview/text: A literary masterpiece to say the least. This book is about the life of slaves in the 1800s. It was very heartbreaking and eye opening to read the hardships of the African American slaves. It was also very inspiring to see how they drew strength from God Almighty, seeming to know Him more intimately than most Slave owners who introduced them to religion.
