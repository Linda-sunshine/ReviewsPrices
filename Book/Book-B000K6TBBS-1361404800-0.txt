review/summary: The Best So Far!review/text: Of the 11 Reacher books I have read this is by far and away my favourite!The book starts out filled with action in typical Reacher fashion with a beating for some unfortunate thugs as Jack tries to fix the world one problem at a time and then leads the reader into a deep and complex mystery which is only pieced together in the final few chapters. A crime which looks to be unsolvable is put together perfectly, making you check back to see if you really did miss all of the clues that Jack has somehow joined up.The story also puts Jack in a somewhat unfamiliar position of being settled down and having a proper relationship which adds another dimention to our hero.I finished this book in 2 days and it would have been sooner if i hadnt been working. Would recommend this book to any one the best in the series!
