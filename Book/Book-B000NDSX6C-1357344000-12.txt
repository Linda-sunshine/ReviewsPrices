review/summary: Middle Earthreview/text: Read in December, 2012formatPaperback (edit)my copyedit | removereviewThe Hobbit- J.R.R. TolkienThis was a rather difficult book to read at first in the beginning. I often found myself referring back and forth to the map at the end of the book to get a grasp of where Bilbo and his companions were traveling.If you are a fan of The Lord of the Rings books then you will enjoy The Hobbit!!
