review/summary: baroomilliantreview/text: Just started reading this book and the rest of the series after recently watching the movie, mainly because I wanted to see what would happen next, and now I'm loving them completely and can't believe it has taken me so long to read them, after I had the chance a few years ago, but never bothered to do so. Loving them now though, and also loving the film was completely faithful too the books as there are still plenty of delightful surprises in amongst the pages.
