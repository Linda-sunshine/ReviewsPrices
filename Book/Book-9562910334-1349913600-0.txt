review/summary: "The Book" within the book...Wow!review/text: Wow! That's all I can say...Wow!I read this in high school in the mid 60s, and I completely forgot about it. I honestly didn't remember it. I'm not going to talk much about it. For one, it's been heavily reviewed already, and for another, you really have to read it not knowing anything about it.But one exception. There was something that I found incredibly interesting this time around. "The Book". "The Book" was a book that the main character reads from at some time during the story. What made Orwell write that? How much of the theme of that book was merely his own imagination of how it could get in the worse case scenario and how much was based on some real reason why he would project such an idea?If anyone knows of any literary study or analysis on the subject of the contents of "The Book" within 1984, I would be very interested to hear about it.
