review/summary: Quite strange (in a good way)review/text: This book was exciting and also very strange. It messes with your mind which makes it very entertaining to read. It`s also a classic. The way the story is set up reminds me of my own dreams, where things don`t make any sense. I didn't like the way the story presented the ending. I liked the ending, but not the way it came in.
