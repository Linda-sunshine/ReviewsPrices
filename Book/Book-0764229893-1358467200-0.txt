review/summary: Excellent novel that is Biblically accuratereview/text: God and Kings was a book I simply could not put down. It was both exciting and saddening to understand the plight of King Ahaz and the impact it had on the life of Hezakiah! I would highly reccomend this read to anyone who longs for a taste of Old Testament history.
