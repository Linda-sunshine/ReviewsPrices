review/summary: "Our" Brave New Worldreview/text: I had to read this book for a class, but I quickly found enjoyment in the reading. The book is not like most modern sci-fi books coming out these days with about || that much depth. It's a probing and thought-provoking read that really makes you think again as you perceive the world. I liked it a lot. The book itself, if you're comparing this Brave New World to another Brave New World, has a pretty neat cover design with raised dots and lettering inked in something that really isn't durable enough to last-it started wearing off the raised dots literally immediately. The page edges are purposely ragged, which, stylistically, is pretty neat...
