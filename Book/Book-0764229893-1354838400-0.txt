review/summary: This is an excellent book for those who want to know more about Old Testament times.review/text: This is first in a series of books about some of the Old Testament kings, their relationship with God, good and bad, and how the country was affected by this relationship. The Bible only gives the bare facts, but Lynn Austin has filled in the gaps by giving her take on what could have happened in their day to day lives. I learned alot about what life was like in those times and am looking forward to reading the rest of the series. Lynn Austin is one of my favourite authors and she did not disapoint me with this book.
