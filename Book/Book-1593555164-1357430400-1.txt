review/summary: I've found a new author!review/text: This is the first Lee Child book I've read. I wanted to see the movie, Jack Reacher, but was curious about the story and wanted to read it before seeing the movie. I will definitely go and see the movie now as I really liked the book. It looks like Child has written quite a few books, so I can happily work my way through them! If you haven't read him yet, I heartily recommend this book, and although I haven't seen the movie yet, I could certainly picture Tom Cruise in the lead role! I read the book in one sitting, unable to put it down until the end.A sniper kills five people randomly one afternoon in a quiet town. It appears to be an open and shut case. Although this may sound too much like what has been in the news lately (which is why I wanted to read the book first), it really isn't about the victims, but about the sniper. Appearances are very deceiving and the investigation turns up all sorts of problems with the case.
