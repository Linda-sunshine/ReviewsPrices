review/summary: Great book for todayreview/text: It seemed at first that the book was too far-fetched, that It could never happen. However the more I read the more I saw connections to life today. In many ways it has been very prophetic. It basically displays what happens when a culture values convenience and comfort over honesty and truth.great read, recommend it to anyone.
