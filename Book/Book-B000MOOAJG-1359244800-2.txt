review/summary: Amazing bookreview/text: It's one of those books you can't put down. This is going to be the most remembered book from the 20th Century. 200 years from now everyone will have forgotten JFK, Nixon, Eisenhower, and the rest.... but they will know Atlas Shrugged was written in the 1950's.
