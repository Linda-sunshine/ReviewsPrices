review/summary: Inspiringreview/text: The title of the book caught my attention which spark my interests. I check out the book from the library to read to my son. This was a way to help developed his comprehension skills. Turn out, we both look forward each day reading the book to learn more of the adventure the main character endure. I would only read limited chapters during the school week, and more during the weekend. Later, we viewed a dvd movie version of the book. It was good; however, the book was better.
