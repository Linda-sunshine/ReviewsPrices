review/summary: Unjustifiably high expectations?review/text: I have a vague memory of having read The Hobbit many years ago, when I was much younger--so vague, in fact, that I chose to reread it. I recalled the basic plot elements and the overall premise of the story. And, because I'm breathing, I know that it's the prequel to the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy. And, since it's considered a classic, my expectations were high.I'm wondering, however, why I feel so underwhelmed by this novel. It contains all the elements of a classic, mythic heroic quest. It's not unnecessarily lengthy or bloated (a mere 255 pages in the edition that I read), and the episodic narrative moves along at a smart pace. Tolkien has indeed created one of the great fantasy worlds in all of literature--Middle Earth.Perhaps it's the skimpy character development that bugs me. Bilbo and Gandalf and Thorin are quite memorable (especially Gandalf, who figures prominently in the ensuing LOTR novels), but Tolkien provides minimal characterization. Each is rather two-dimensional, and, as a reader, I found it quite difficult to empathize with any of them. I also found Tolkien's narrative voice to be decidedly uneven--at times the narrator sounded charming and colloquial only to veer into bombast and melodrama, and the narrative tone fluctuated from self-deprecating to self-important. And a few of the major events in the story lack detail. For example, we are told rather little about the climactic Battle of Five Armies, and, of Bilbo's return home, the narrator simply states, "He had many hardships and adventures before he got back"--yet he describes none of them. Perhaps I'm quibbling--and I know many of the Tolkien faithful will accuse me of sacrilege--but I expect more substance and narrative depth from a classic of fantasy literature.
