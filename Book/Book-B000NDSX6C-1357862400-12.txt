review/summary: The Hobbit: A BBC Full-Cast Radio Dramareview/text: The Hobbit: A BBC Full-Cast Radio DramaOver all it's well done - however I have to say that I can't stand the music that is used. Sounds like a dying moose or a cat at times. In my opintion the 1970/1980s when this was made didn't always have the best sounding music.However, I enjoy the voices - though it is hard to tell them apart at times.I intend to give this version of the Hobbit a fair chance, but I will update if need be.
