review/summary: Yes, yes, I know.review/text: I have had to say "yes. yes, I know" way too many times while reading this book. I never had to say it while I was reading 1984 or Brave New World. No, this book gets the heads shaking because this book has been adopted into contemporary movements and those who support them or oppose them have reputations and, really, honestly, have probably not actually read this book.Ignore all of that. This book is good reading, good enough to carry you through 1,000+ pages. The woman can write and the story will grip you and you will recognize some of what happens in what is happening now. Isn't that the mark of a great dystopian book? Rand shows us the outcome of certain political ideals and does it as good as it gets. Orwell did it, Huxley did it, Rand does it right there with them, no more.She does it the same way, too. She gives us characters to identify with and grow to love and places them in a world harder and harder to love as the work continues, though she does it with so much ironic humor that I understand why this book brings so much controversy. Irony is tough for the ideologue, tough on both sides.So, all, check your politics and the Daily Whatever News' interpretations and enjoy a very good story brilliantly told. What started as a dare (if you read this I will...) has become one of my favorite books.
