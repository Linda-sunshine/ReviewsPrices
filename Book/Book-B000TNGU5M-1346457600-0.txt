review/summary: Primal and Profoundreview/text: Every year I read this book with my 8th grade classes. It is my primary teaching tool for offering insight into the Holocaust. Wiesel's memoir is effective in helping the students to at least begin to understand what took place, because they generally have only a very cursory knowledge of Hitler, Naziism and the Holocaust. There is no way to articulate Wiesel's experience. This book must be read.
