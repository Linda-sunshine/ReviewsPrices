review/summary: Great Book!!review/text: My opinion on Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is. . . it was a very good book and I believe you will like it too. The main character, Brian Robeson, age 13, is very realistic and believable. His unique personality can not be matched because he had "hope" in tough conditions. The story took place in the Canadian woods, and you would not believe how he got there! My favorite part was when the moose "visited" him. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.
