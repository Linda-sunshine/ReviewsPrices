review/summary: A beautiful bookreview/text: This is more about this version of The Hobbit than about The Hobbit itself (because everyone knows it's a brilliant book to begin with).This edition is beautiful and very well made. It comes with a case to keep it safe and it really feels substantial. I love hardcover editions because they hold up much better. This one looks great on my shelf and I fell in love with it immediately.
