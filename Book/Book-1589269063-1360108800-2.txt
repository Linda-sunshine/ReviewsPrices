review/summary: Interesting conceptreview/text: It's pretty early in my reading of this one to give an extensive evaluation of it. We're reading it and believe it has some merit for couples and will help us to look at each other differently, learning to keep in mind how we each respond to love [in our own &#34;language&#34;].
