review/summary: The Hobbit- English class book reviewreview/text: The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien is truly a "precious" piece of the fantasy genre. As the book is about a group of dwarves, a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, and a wizard named Gandalf whom embark on a journey through the world of Middle Earth. Along the journey they will meet new and unthought-of characters that will make the story even better. For example, along the journey the group meets dangerous goblins and giant spiders. You will not want to put the book down, as the adventure never stops from the beginning of the journey in the Shire to the end of the journey in the mountains where the dragon Smaug lives. However, the book can get a bit slow at some points when you are just waiting for them to do something. As a reader though, this book will attract the eye of a young reader interested in fantasy or someone who has read the Lord of The Rings trilogy because The Hobbit is a prequel to that series and written by the same author. The book is overall a good and a well-written book.
