review/summary: A true gem of English Literaturereview/text: While not Jane Austen's most popular novel, this story of longing, regret and love, full with the satire and keen observations of the social graces of the period, is one of my personal favorites. The heroine Anne Elliot is an interesting lady caught in a times where women had very little independence and means to pursue their own happiness, and where family connections dictated most social interactions. Her journey to reclaim her love and more important her sense of self is very heartwarming. And her dashing Captain Wentworth, while still a pround gentleman finally lets his own emotions towards Anne steer him, and her to a happy conclusion. I am great fan of romantic literature, and Jane Austen does not dissapoint.
