review/summary: My First Vonnegut Bookreview/text: I read this book in the course of a couple of hours over two days. It was a very good read, especially after reading a little about Vonnegut's past. One could empathize with the character and narrator with ease, despite a relatively strange Sci-Fi webbing that wove the story together. This book makes me curious to read another of Mr. Vonnegut's works.
