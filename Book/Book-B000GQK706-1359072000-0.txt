review/summary: Must Readreview/text: Be prepared for detail, extreme detail in some portions. For those who like the movies, the books offer so much more back story. Watch for places and characters that have show up in more recent literature and movies: large spiders (Aragog in Harry Potter), the creepy forest that people shouldn't go in -- Mirkwood (Forbidden Forest, again HP), Endor means Middle Earth (Star Wars anyone?) and many more!. How many can you find? Get to know the characters and what drives them. Experience the beauty and wonders of Middle Earth as never before. Prepare yourself to spend some serious time in Middle Earth and to come away with a whole new appreciation of the mythical world created by Tolkien!
