review/summary: definitely helpful and useful inforeview/text: After 14 years together, my husband and I went through a rough spot in our marriage. I think we both weren't feeling appreciated anymore. A friend recommended this book and after reading it and talking to my husband about some of what I read, we are both trying harder to show each other in the way that we each need that we're appreciated and loved.
