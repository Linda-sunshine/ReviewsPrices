review/summary: Great Info - Very Detailedreview/text: My wife and I were given this book by a mutual friend and we decided to read it out loud together each night before bed. We found that there was a TON of well-documented research in this book that can be very helpful. However, we did not finish it to the end and have since forgotten most of what we learned. For my taste it was a little TOO detailed to be easliy followed. However, I feel like I still have much to learn from this book and will pick it up again soon to see if I can do better this time around. :) If you are like me and need something simple to try out, I would suggestsomething like God: Six Weeks to Spirituality. It's not a "relationship" book per se, but anything that helps you to become "aware" will help you in ALL aspects of your life.
