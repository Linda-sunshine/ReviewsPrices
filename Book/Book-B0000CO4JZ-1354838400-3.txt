review/summary: AMZINGreview/text: For years I listened to people talk about this book but never understood what the storyline was, I thought about giving it a chance and I'm glad I did! It is by far the best book I've read in a long time, Fitzgerald creates a mystery within a love story within a friendship. He doesn't disappoint from beginning to end, I recommend to any book lover out there or anyone looking for something to keep them occupied. One of the greatest era to write about in the greatest city in America!
