review/summary: Faith in questionreview/text: This was a great book! It explores the depths of believing in things you can't quite see and the miracles of Faith. It asks you to question your faith in your child and the depths you would go to protect them. This is a heartwarming story of a child who sees God and the controversy caused by her healing! A must read for every book club!
