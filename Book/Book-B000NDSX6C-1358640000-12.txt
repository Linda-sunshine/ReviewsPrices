review/summary: The Kindle edition is great on the Firereview/text: I read this book to my 10 year old son. The kindle edition worked well on the Fire. The illustrations and maps can be zoomed to see more detail, though I wish that they were at a higher resolution. You can bookmark the maps to get easy access while reading.What I liked about the story is that it is at a leisurely pace, with plenty of time to absorb the characters.
