review/summary: Into the wildreview/text: I LOVED INTO THE WILD!The characters were amazing and I LOVED how Erin Hunter was so creative in names that change as they become warriors.I felt like I knew the the characters and missed them after I was finished, but, guess what this is only the first book!:)
