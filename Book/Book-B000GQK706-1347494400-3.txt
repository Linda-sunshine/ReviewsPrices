review/summary: Best novel ever written!review/text: I bought this edition back in 1997. I was blown away by the story and the way Tolkien was able to create an entire world rich with interesting races, creatures, and places. His descriptions are amazing. You will be drawn into Middle Earth like a moth to a flame.So, then the movies came out. I watch them every year during the Holidays. So, they are fairly well ingrained into my memory. I had forgotten much of the original story. So, I decided to read the book again. I found it even better the second time around. If you've never read the book and have watched the movies, I urge you to savor every word that Tolkien wrote. The movies are different from the book. The basic story is the same, but many details and scenes were left out.As others have said, there are a few minor printing issues with this edition. Some of the text is printed a little lighter than the rest on the page. But, it is completely readable. The artwork by Alan Lee more than makes up for this minor annoyance.I was very sad when I came to the end of this epic tale. I want more!
