review/summary: A keeper....review/text: I first read Atlas Shrugged about 30 years ago ... kept loaning my books ... and never got them back ... finally bought the hardcover and don't loan it out. I read voraciously ... and re-read this book about every two years ... now I have it on my kindle.I come away from each re-read with the need to review my lifestyle and often make changes that make me feel good about how I've chosen to live my life.
