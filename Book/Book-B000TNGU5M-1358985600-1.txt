review/summary: Night reviewreview/text: Night, by Elie Wiesel, is a story based on a Jewish boy's experience in several concentration camps during the Holocaust. Elie is brought to the camps with his family and is eventually separated from his mother and two sisters. He will have to spend the rest of his survival with his father. At such a young age, Elie is faced with life-threatening obstacles, tragedies and maturity in order to keep himself alive and make it through this ghastly journey and face the grim conditions of the winter that lay ahead.After going hungry and sitting through harsh torture during a cold winter, a conspicuous lesson is easily learned through reading this literary memoir: do not give up hope even during the hardest of times. Although Elizer struggles with his faith in humanity and in God, he is able to keep his head held as high as possible in order to withstand this bitter part of his life.I especially enjoyed this book because I was able to connect with the background of the story, being that I am Jewish. I find the study of the Holocaust and stories from survivors about their involvement in the concentration camps to be fascinating, yet horrifying to think about. To know that humans were treated the way Elie Wiesel describes them to be is shocking and chilling. I'd like to commend Elie Wiesel for having enough courage in order to write and share this alluring piece of literature with the world because to look back and regain memory of such a crestfallen moment in time is a difficult task to process. He looked back and realized how distraught all these innocent Jews were and was amongst the millions who were captured and is so blessed to be apart of the few thousand who survive. Being in that position, you can only help but feel bad and guilty that you made it to the finish line and so many loved ones did not.
