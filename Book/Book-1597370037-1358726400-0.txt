review/summary: It gets better as you get olderreview/text: This was one of my favorite reads as a pre-teen so I was eager to read it again 50 years later. What I learned was how differently I understood the story. As a young person, I enjoyed the premise and the supernatural aspect of the subject. Wouldn't that be cool sort of thing. But now, I see the struggle between good and evil, self-indulgence versus altruism, hedonism versus retraint and self-respect. I wish I had appreciated more of that as a young person; it probably would have helped me avoid some of the pitfalls of growing up. A provocative read for all ages.
