review/summary: I loved it!review/text: I really enjoyed this book because I thought Atwood wrote a very vivid description of how life must have felt for the main character, Offred. Even though it's not a horror story, it's still one of the scariest books I have read. Her life was cloistered and despairing, and there was nothing she could do about it, not even kill herself. It was so horrifying to think about everything Offred lost; not just her family and possessions, but also her identity, her right to voice her opinion, even the right to read.I did feel that I did not have all the answers by the end of the book, and we are left wondering what ultimately happens to Offred. But I liked that the book didn't give us the whole picture right from the beginning and instead reveals details throughout the book, it always kept my wondering and wanting to read more.
