review/summary: Classic tale of adventurereview/text: I will admit, I was supposed to read this book in high school but I didn't read it; and now I can't understand why not. Now that I'm a bit older, instead of watching the movie to avoid reading the book I have found myself reading the book in order to fully appreciate the movie. Amazing what a little maturity and perspective can do for you :)
