review/summary: totally inspirationalreview/text: I reread this book again after many years, since I had the chance to take my 13 year old son to Haarlem to see the Corrie Ten Boom house. When we were there he really didnt understand what was so special about it. Now I am reading it to him aloud, and he is finally able to understand why the Ten Booms took in so many Jews and how they were able to forgive the Nazis. For a child who basically only likes to play video games, that is saying a lot. He even added Corrie to his list of people he admired on Facebook.
