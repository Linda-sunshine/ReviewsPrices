review/summary: Excellent book, movie, and Audio CDreview/text: I loved the book (series) and thought the movie was great (5 stars)and now Scott Brick's audio version can be added to the 5 star collection. He has the perfect voice. He reads Burroughs very well which isn't easy to do. At least I sometimes have difficulty reading Burroughs until you get used to his style. This item is also available in MP3 format, however not all version show up during amazon searches. I done it several times and the MP3 version is the usual one that shows up. If you want the 6 CD set keep searching til you find it. Since this was released Scott Brick has also recorded audio versions of Book 2 (The Gods of Mars) and Book 3 (The Warlord of Mars). Same situation here, search for the version you want, either MP3 or traditional CD. they usually don't show up together. I have since order Scott Bricks - The Gods of Mars, and will review that after I have listened to it. You will not be disappointed in Scott Brick's telling of A Princess of Mars, although I must admit I am eager to hear a dramatized version with Scott Brick reading as John Carter. I'm glad I didn't get other readers version of the series, which I was tempted to do and my patience has paid off with Scott Brick's audio version of Books 2 and 3. I wonder if he will continue with the rest of the series.
