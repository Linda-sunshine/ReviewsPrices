review/summary: Beautiful Bookreview/text: I've always wanted my own set of classic books. These couldn't be more beautifully bound. They really are beautiful. I absolutely urge you to buy this book if you're on the fence about it. It'll at least at some visual interest to your library if you don't plan on reading it!
