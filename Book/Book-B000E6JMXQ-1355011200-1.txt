review/summary: Good for school studiesreview/text: Loved how the translator(s) attempted to translate what Jules Verne wrote, and especially how the notes helped also with certain passages and statements in the book. I also liked it that the translator(s) corrected errors they perceived in the book itself, and they gave reasons for such corrections. This showed that even at the publishing stage, mistakes can creep in. It is a pity that the 1878 (79?) translation by an English writer mangled the novel, but then he was English translating a French writer.......Good for students at school who may be studying the book for English literature.
