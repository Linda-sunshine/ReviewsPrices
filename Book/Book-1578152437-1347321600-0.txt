review/summary: a classic storyreview/text: Everyone knows this is a classic. Without giving away the plot, as with many of Dickens' novels, this deals extensively with the issues of poverty and social class in mid-19th century England. Through the novel, you bear witness to the different levels of society through Oliver's time at the workhouse, with Mr. Brownlow, Fagin, and others. A must-read.
