review/summary: Little Womenreview/text: Re-reading it now. A good balance between superfluous writing and practical observation of women in that era. I enjoy Little Women both for the natural and whimsical natures of the girls and have always been a fan of their funny personalities, especially Jo and Amy. Highly recommended.
