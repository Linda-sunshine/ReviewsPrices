review/summary: Great Seriesreview/text: The Harry Potter series in general is a fantastic way to get children started on reading! I'm 18 now and I started reading the books in grade school, and I still love them. Harry Potter really is what led me to start loving to read when I was young. With that being said, it is more than just a children book because people of all ages can get something out of this story. It is fantastically written and the intertwined plot points will keep you on your toes. It is quite the page turner. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has yet to read the series!
