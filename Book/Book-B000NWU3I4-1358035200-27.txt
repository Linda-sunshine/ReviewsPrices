review/summary: Very pleasedreview/text: I have read this book 2 other times and have really enjoyed it. I went and saw the midnight showing to the hobbits and thought it is pretty much like the book but some parts were questionable. I love this book and highly recommend it to everyone who is a j.r.r Tolkien fan.
