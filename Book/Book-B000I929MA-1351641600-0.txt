review/summary: A remarkable bookreview/text: I read The Handmaid's Tale for the first time twenty five years ago. It was a remarkable book, beautifully written, fascinating, a "cautionary" book. My second read, done in October 2012, again found the book to be remarkable, beautifully written, fascinating. But in today's conservative political climate---greater responsibilities for women but fewer rights and power---the cautionary tone of the book has become frighteningly more realistic.
