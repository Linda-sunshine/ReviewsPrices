review/summary: Surprising twistreview/text: There are still a handful of classics that have been on my "to read" list forever and this is one of them. My daughter read in high school and really liked it. Due to it's short length this is almost more of a novella. The decadence of that era was brilliantly portrayed. The grand parties were painted so vividly. Having not read spoilers I was a little shocked at the ending of it. I wasn't expecting it so it was refreshing to read a classic that I didn't already know the ending of.
