review/summary: Downloaded for free,review/text: This is the first book that I downloaded on the Kindle app. It was free and I used it to test out my device. I pretty much enjoyed the book. It's a quick, easy read.The book's main character is Tressa Jayne Turner. She's working two part time jobs, lives in a trailer on her parent's property, and drives a car that is on the verge of falling apart. Everyone discounts her as a "airhead blonde". She has a love/hate relationship with her brother's best friend, Ranger Rick.One night, after working both jobs, her car breaks down while driving home. She discovers a dead body in the trunk and an envelope filled with money in the glove box. She runs for help and runs into Ranger Rick. They come back to the car and the body is gone along with the money. Then she realizes that it isn't her car.We follow her journey where the police don't believe her, her life is being threatened, and she keeps finding dead bodies.
