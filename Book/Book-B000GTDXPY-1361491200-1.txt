review/summary: A fun readreview/text: For the most part, this book is grammatically correct; unfortunately, it does have a plethora of mistakes, which brings the rating of the novel down.I don't want to give away any of the details of this story so as not to ruin it for the next reader. It is reputed to be full of dumb-blonde jokes, but is also chuck-full of clich&eacute;s; too many for my taste. The book made me laugh aloud more than once, not in derision, but with humor, and that speaks volumes. The author was imaginative with her creation of scenes and kept you wondering what would happen next.I give this book 3.5 stars.
