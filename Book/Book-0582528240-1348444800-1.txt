review/summary: Huckleberry Finnreview/text: I understand people views of the book being racist. There are moments reading it that it can be interpreted as racism. However it is Twain trying to authenticate the story. Sadly a boy during that time would talk about slaves the way he did or for people to think the way they did in the story. Putting all these things aside the book is interesting. It takes the reader on an adventure they never would have thought about before. Twain does a good job of bringing the characters to life. At the same time he brings up social issues that were going on during that time. It opens people eyes while entertaining them. Twain does a good job of making characters that are appealing to read. Huck is funny and adventurous.
