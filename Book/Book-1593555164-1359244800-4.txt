review/summary: Great work!review/text: Another Reacher read as I work my way through them. I loved this one, it was a great story, very entertaining. The characters are all great, I love that Child brought back someone from Reacher's past, sometimes I don't like how he falls into bed with every girl, but this time it made sense. There were some typos in the text, wish they would fix those. After a disappointing read on the last novel (Echo Burning), Reacher is back!!
