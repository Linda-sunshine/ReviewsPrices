review/summary: The Hobbit reviewreview/text: This is the epitome of the great adventure tale. I have read this books more times than I can count! My mother and I read this book when I was 7 and it is a memory I cherish to this day. Since then, I have read it aloud to my cat who loved it. She renamed the book, &#34;The Perfidious Murder of Smaug The Good.&#34; I LOVE THIS BOOK!&#34;
