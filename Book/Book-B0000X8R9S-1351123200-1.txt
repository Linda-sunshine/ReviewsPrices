review/summary: Hatchet!!!!!!!!!!!review/text: Hey guys, if you want to read Hatchet, it's great! Hatchet is an adventures tale! I recommend it to kids 10-13 years old. I can't beleive Brian was in a crash landing! I really love this book. I really think it can happen in real life. Oh, and I also love the part when he has to survive in the wild. I hope you love reading this book as much as I did!
