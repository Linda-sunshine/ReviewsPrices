review/summary: Easy Read!!review/text: Amazed at how much easier it is to read these long classics electronically (which I love!) than bulky books. Jane Austen is one of my favorite authoresses, and this book did not disappoint! I love this time in history, and this was one of her books I had not read, or seen in mini-series form. Plan to read more of her lesser-known novels...her style and characters just keep you wanting more....this novel was up to her usual excellence.
