review/summary: A book of works All should readreview/text: Although C.S. Lewis was never trained as theologian, the books included in this volume of his works provide incredible insight into Christianity, including what it means to be a Christian itself. C.S. Lewis (known to his friends as Jack) was actually an atheist who, through logical argument and reason, eventually became a born again Christian. Although it is not touted as such, the book (within this volume of books) "Mere Christianity" maps out that journey Lewis took to becoming the Christian he eventually came to be.
