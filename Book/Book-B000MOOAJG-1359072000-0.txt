review/summary: A Cautionary Tale from Bitter Experience -- For Our Timereview/text: Rand's family owned a successful pharmacy in Russia, the story goes, and the egalitarian-entitlementarian communists thought it unfair that such crass capitalism should be going on in &#34;Anatevka.&#34; So, the people's party used the Russian version of Imminent Domain and took over so that the Rands would be free of their drudgery and better able to enjoy the socialist republic. American &eacute;migr&eacute; Ayn Rand's memories burned ever after and resulted in Atlas Shrugged and other cautionary tales about big governments slouching implacably toward totally egalitarian ash heaps of equally shared misery. Through her writing, Rand describes a philosophy that came to be called Objectivism, which promotes rational self-interest and laissez-faire capitalism. Somewhat dated, but still poignant, Atlas Shrugged is a futuristic peek at an American governmental dystopia in which the few remaining successful business people, those that carried the weight of the economies on their shoulders, one by one shrugged and just disappeared, and where John Galt announced that he would stop the motors of the world. Did he succeed? Better grab a copy and find out. Ayn Rand's works are more important today than ever before.
