review/summary: Hatchet Book Reviewreview/text: Thirteen year old Brian Robenson is forced to make difficult survival challenges for his life. He faced hurtful feelings before this accident which was that his parents got divorced. The only thing he has to eat are raspberries but, he calls them gut berries because of the taste. Then, Brian is left with a very hard challenge. You'll have to read it if you want to find out what this challenge is. I recomend this book to people who love to read adventures, and exciting books.
