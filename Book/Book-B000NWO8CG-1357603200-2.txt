review/summary: A tree grows in Brooklynreview/text: This book is the best book I've ever read, it's so well written and made me feel so close with the main character. I am so interested in the lives of all the characters and wish I could know more about all of them. I cried several times, and felt so connected with Francie Nolan. I now understand why this book is held in such high regard among many people I know.
