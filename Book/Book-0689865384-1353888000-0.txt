review/summary: I love this book!review/text: I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone! Especially if you are a fan of young adult fiction books. It is about Tally Youngblood who at first sets out to betray her friend, but changes her mind and tries to save her instead. This is a series, and if you read the first one you have to read the rest! I cannot wait to read the next book!
