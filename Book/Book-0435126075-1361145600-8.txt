review/summary: Very 19th Century British writingreview/text: I enjoyed this e-book very much because I have seen versions of the film and TV presentations and reading the book gives a more indepth study of the writing style of Jane Austen. The film and TV presentations couldn't include everything in the book such as a study of each main character. You must read the book slowly to enjoy her usage of words or you will miss the message because there are so many words to describe an event, person, scene, experience, etc. This book is very similar to a Harry Potter book - you need to read it more than once to capture the little things lead to something bigger. She gets you involved with her characters and you feel for them and you might even cry with them.
