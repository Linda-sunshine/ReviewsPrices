review/summary: Couldn't put it down!review/text: I am a huge fan of dystopian novels, and "Uglies," the first in a series of four, did not disappoint. Sure, I wanted to reach out and slap the protagonist a few times, but I thought it was fascinating to watch her reactions over the course of the book. I was also intrigued by some of the concepts and plot points that were introduced later in the book, and I am really looking forward to finding out how it all ties together in subsequent books. I've already picked up "Pretties" and can't wait to read it!
