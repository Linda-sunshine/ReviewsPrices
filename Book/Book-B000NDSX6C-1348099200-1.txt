review/summary: Loved this Book when I was a childreview/text: I loved this book when I was a child. It was my favorite J.R.R. Tolkien story. My niece has inherited my love of books and I wanted her to experience it also, so I got the book for her birthday. I was so happy to find it in hardcover, I had to read it in paperback. Movies leave out too much these days so I try to to get her the books first. Too bad instead of getting it in the promised two day shipping, it was late. Almost every package I get these days, that are shipped FedEx Smartpost, is late. Her mother lives some distance away but she knew how excited I was to get Brooke the book that she drove an hour to pick it up. I just wish I could have seen her face when she got it. So much for Prime two day shipping.
