review/summary: A classic!review/text: Bradbury's story was written in the early 1950's, but has great resonance for today, with all our high-powered, big screen technology. When a civilizationgives up books for the instant gratification of television and mind control, the results are terrifying. We should be warned!! The lasting power of his short novelis shown in how long it's lived, being published now for 60+ years.
