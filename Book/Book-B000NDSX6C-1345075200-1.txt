review/summary: Great for graphic novel enthusiastsreview/text: If you're into comic books or graphic novels, PICK THIS BOOK UP.If you've never read the Hobbit, go read the actual book first. This is a great way to revisit the story though.Very vibrant, detailed illustrations really make this book stand out, especially compared to "graphic novels" such as V for Vendetta, Watchmen, etc...
