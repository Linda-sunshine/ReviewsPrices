review/summary: One of my favorite booksreview/text: I love historical fiction and was unsure of how I'd like this book when it was recommended to me. I wasn't too familiar with the Old Testament story that this book is about, but this novel really made it come to live. I love Lynn Austin's writing style and have since read many more of her books. This book, though, is the cream of the crop. I loved the characters, the setting, and how the plots interwove together. I've read this a few times since I first read it and it's always as good as the first time.
