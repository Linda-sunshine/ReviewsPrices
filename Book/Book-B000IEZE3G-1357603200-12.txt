review/summary: Great bookreview/text: I loved it. Saw the movie first and was shocked at how well they followed the plot. I really enjoyed it. Great plot, fun story, great characters, it was really just a well rounded book. It is Harry's first year at Hogwarts. The book begins with Dumbledore, Hagrid and Mcgonagle dropping him off as a baby at his Aunt and Uncles after his parents had died. Then he is ten years old and odd things start to happen. He gets about a thousand letters inviting him to Hogwarts but his uncle doesn't allow him to read them. Finally Hagrid has to come collect him at which point he finds out that he is a wizard and his parents were famous. I could go on but I don't want to spoil it for the few who haven't read or seen it.
