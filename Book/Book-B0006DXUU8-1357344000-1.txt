review/summary: The best Christmas story!review/text: Nothing can top A Christmas Carol! I do not know of a story that could out do this one. It is a wonderful book about faith and salvation. The fact that it is still being read today is proof of that! It is also a story people know by heart and there have been countless productions of it ( with the most accurate surprisingly being A Muppet's Christmas Carol). Everyone should read this at least once in their lifetime.
