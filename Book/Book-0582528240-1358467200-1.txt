review/summary: Loved it!review/text: I love Hick Finn with all my heart! This book is good because it's a classic and Mark Twain writes so well that it keeps you in tune with the characters. I like that I felt that I knew each character like my own family, I also liked the ending it recaps the type of character that Hick was. Mark Twain stays true to his characters. I believe this is a book for teens and adults.
