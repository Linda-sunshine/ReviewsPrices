review/summary: A slow love ...both in the book and of it.review/text: This book, on first round, didn't blow me away. Unlike other Austen's, it wasn't full of young and overwhelming love. However, the more I pondered it and reread it, the more I enjoyed its honesty. The main storyline moves slowly but surely and I found myself invested in each decision made, willing the characters to bend to my will. Definitely one of the most hopeful and satisfying endings and well worth reading.
