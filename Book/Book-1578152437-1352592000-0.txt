review/summary: New but oldreview/text: I never thought that I'd enjoy reading Charles Dickins, but what a surprise, humour, sarcasm and excellent story telling, I now feel I want to read more, his writing is easy reading unlike some older writers who are hard work. Oliver twist as a film is missing the whole story, maybe it should be told in its entirety, will enjoy reading more of this brilliant author.
