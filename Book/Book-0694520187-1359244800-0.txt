review/summary: great book, great formatreview/text: Unlike most people who were forced to read this book in high school, I really liked it. When I got my new Kindle Fire HD for Christmas, I decided to download this free version of the book to read on it.A nice feature of this product is that you have a nice built-in dictionary feature. When Melville uses one of those out-of-date 19th century words, or some naval term I'm not familiar with, I just put the cursor on the word, and an explanation pops up. Very handy. It is also easy to bookmark pages with the Kindle.So far, I am enjoying Moby Dick again.
