review/summary: Excellentreview/text: I'm a lover of history and of course God's Word. This book was a culmination of both! I couldn't put it down. I felt as if I were really there in Judah "peeking" into the palace and the minds of King Ahaz and his son, King Hezekiah. I can't wait to read book 2.
