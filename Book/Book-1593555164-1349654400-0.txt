review/summary: Reacher One Shot - is not wide of the markreview/text: After reading 1,2 and 3 of the series, I jumped to "One Shot" because the movie will be out soon (Tom Cruise is great but will he be able to pull off the size difference). I am impressed at how each story is different enough not to be predictable. Very entertaining.
