review/summary: Best marriage advice!review/text: Absolutely love this book! Simple yet so impacting. Wish I had read this book sooner, the idea that we all have "love tanks" and how simple it is to physically and emotionally fulfill our spouses desires and vice versa, to create a successful marriage, by applying our spouses love language daily will change and save marriages everywhere!
