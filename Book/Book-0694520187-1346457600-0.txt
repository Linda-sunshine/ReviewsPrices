review/summary: Not enjoyablereview/text: I did not enjoy reading Moby Dick. Actually, I enjoyed the beginning, right up until the introduction of Ahab. At this point it was an exciting adventure story with a very interesting sea captain, Ahab, who selfishly put his personal agenda ahead of his crew. I liked the torment and allegories that Ahab's character represented. He was both inspirational and obsessive. The white whale, Moby Dick, took his leg and now the godly sea creature needed to be punished and nothing was going to stop Ahab from carrying out his revenge - even if it was to the detriment of his crew. Then it changed from an intiguing story into a detailed lesson on whaling, on the anatomy of the whale and on any conceivable tribute to whaling that could possibly be imagined. It was here that I felt lost at sea and hoping to be consumed by the whale. The very detail explored was great, and written with a fanatical clarity and depth that can not be questioned. But it was not for me. I tried really hard to enjoy it, but it did not eventuate until the last page when i was glad it was over. If the history lessons were not so long and tedious and if they did not overshadow the heart of the story then my rating would have been higher.
