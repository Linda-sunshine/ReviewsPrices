review/summary: Read it to my boysreview/text: I read this to my 9 &11 year old boys. Pirates and adventure and treasure, what's not to like? The language is a little difficult, but they understood the story, and looked forward to our reading times. I think the 11 year old enjoyed it more, so I would recommend ages 10 and up.
