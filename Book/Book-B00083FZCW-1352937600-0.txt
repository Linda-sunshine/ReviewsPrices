review/summary: A ride of maximum excitementreview/text: The first edition of the maximum ride series is absolutely amazing. The way that James Patterson develops the Flock characters within the plot line is top class, and the amount of excitement present within the book is the equivalent of four books by anyone else. I definitely recommend not only this book, but the entire series by Patterson, and go for the ride yourself.
