review/summary: Christmas giftreview/text: My son is an avid reader and is interested in reading the classics. The look of the cover is very nice according to my son. He said he is looking forward to reading The Count of Monte Cristo! It's is the second classic I have purchased for him and will continue purchasing more of the classics to help him build up his library of classic books.
