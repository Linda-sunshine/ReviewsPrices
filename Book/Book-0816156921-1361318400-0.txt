review/summary: Excellent Classicreview/text: Easily the best vampire story out there. Twilight simply cannot compare to this classic novel. For those of you who enjoy the macabre, I suggest this book to you! Everyone should read this book at least once, (although most of us by the time you are done with high school have been forced to read this book in class).
