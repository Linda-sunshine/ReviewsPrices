review/summary: Surprisingly good!review/text: I was surprised as how good this was. I was not looking forward to reading it but there's a LOT under the surface. The was he manipulates the reader with subtlety at times and openly at others is, quite frankly (no pun intended), charming. It contains well written autobiographical stories and contains a lot of interesting and useful information for readers today.This is a great historical book to read. It exposes both the positives and negatives of early American/colonial history. I would definitely recommend this to readers interested in history.
