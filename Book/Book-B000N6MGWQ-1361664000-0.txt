review/summary: 5 People You Meet in Heaven Gets 5 Starsreview/text: Mitch Albom was able to take the meaning of life and put it into a story that can inspire people. In this book, a man named Eddie, has worked in the same amusement park almost his whole life. When there is an emergency at the park, Eddie rushes to help. When he sees someone in trouble he tries to help, but he gets crushed by the ride. Eddie goes to a state of purgatory where he meets five people. They all teach him lessons and the importance of his life. This book was astonishing. I didn't want to put it down because it was so captivating.The lessons that were mentioned in the book can be applied to anyone's life now. They teach people the significance of life and that everything happens for a reason whether we like it or not. God has everything planned out for us and it will all make sense when we make it to Heaven. This book was inspirational to me. It really emphasizes the importance of life and everyone you meet. I loved this book and I look forward to reading more novels by this author.
