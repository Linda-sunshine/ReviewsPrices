review/summary: Is Fahrenheit 451 a good book for high schoolers?review/text: Despite Bradbury's encouragement of going against authority, which could be problematic for already wild high school students, Bradbury also shows readers how society can change and encourages them to fight for what they believe, which are two lessons in life that all high school students could use. I think this is a great book for high school students to read for class for many reasons. First, Bradbury shows that it is okay to fight for what a person believes. I feel this is a great life lesson because if no one fought for what they believed, then everyone would all believe the same. That is good for high school students to realize because most teenagers keep their beliefs to themselves for fear of being bullied or made fun of. Even though fighting for what a person believes can cause that person to go against authority, which should not be encouraged in today's society, the overall result is better than not fighting for their belief. Secondly, Bradbury shows how society is able to change by the using examples of how the society in Fahrenheit 451 has changed and the reactions the people have in the society. That is also a great life lesson for high school students because nowadays students are so focused in on technology and their social life that they do not realize that the world outside them is majorly changing, not always in a good way either. I think that the students that read Fahrenheit 451 will have a positive attitude after reading this book. Mainly because it gives the students a different perspective and point of view of today's world and how they can improve what they think should be improved. Bradbury makes an excellent high school book author because he knows how the teenagers think and so he can help express to them the importance of fighting for what they believe in their own "language".
