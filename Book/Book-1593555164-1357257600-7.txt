review/summary: Better than the Moviereview/text: This was my first intro to Jack Reacher. I read it out of order in order to have a little knowledge before seeing it in Theaters. While the move was OK, the book was better and had me interested enough to go back and start reading the series from the beginning. Good pace and action and a was really well written.
