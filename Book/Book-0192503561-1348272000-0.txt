review/summary: Love Lost and Refoundreview/text: Even though many people seem to prefer Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion is probably my favorite Jane Austen novel. It's a story that illustrates that true love never dies...And if you want to see a great movie adaptation, nothing beats the version with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root.
