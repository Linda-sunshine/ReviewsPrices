review/summary: Great book!review/text: This is the first Oscar Wilde book I have read...but it will not be the last! My curiosity brought me to download it onto my Kindle (I LOVE my Kindle!), and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.The plot was intriguing, the characters engaging, and the ending was not disappointing in the least.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever thought about growing older (or not growing older)...it is a very quick read, and you will be glad you took the time to visit Dorian Gray.
