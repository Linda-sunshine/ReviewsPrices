review/summary: Classic Fantastic Sci-Fireview/text: I know the book/series is dated, but it's still a terrific read. This man was so far ahead of his time in imagination and futuristic ideas. I read many of his books as a kid and it has been a treat to read this one again. The chivalry and romance and epic adventure is classic even if the "science" is entirely BS. Burroughs' prose makes you long to know what happens next. Can't wait to read more!
