review/summary: Those Who Kept Silent Yesterday Will Remain Silent Today...review/text: My 8th grade niece asked me to read 'Night' with her, as she is reading it (as required reading) with her class.I've known about this book for ever, it seems. It's always been there, in the back of my mind, but I didn't want to read it. Wouldn't read it. Yet, I absolutely love the author, Elie Wiesel.I want to pronounce his name correctly and I've listened to his speech and read his speech called 'The Perils of Indifference' many times. It's a passionate and powerful speech teaching us ALL that we become less then human when we are indifferent to what is happening around us. (paraphrased)From The Introduction of the new translation of 'Night'."...And yet, I still wonder: Have I used the right words? I speak of my first night OVER THERE. The discovery of the reality inside the barbed wire. The warnings of a "veteran" inmate, counseling my father and myself to lie about our ages: my father was to make himself younger, and I older. The selection. The march toward the chimneys looming in the distance under an indifferent sky. The infants thrown into fiery ditches...I did not say that they WERE ALIVE, but that was what I thought. But then I convinced myself: no, they were dead, otherwise I surely would have lost my mind. And yet fellow inmates also saw them; they WERE ALIVE when thrown into the flames. Historians, among them Telford Taylor, confirmed it. And yet somehow I did not lose my mind..."This is the newest translation of 'Night', Elie Wiesel's poignant memoir. I can only say that I am so, so glad that I read this book. I did not turn my back and pass it by for a prettier book. I needed to hear this nightmare for myself. We all do, or this time in history and these beautiful people will have died in vein.A Must Read for every single person--8th grade and up.
