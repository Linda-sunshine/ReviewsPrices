review/summary: A classicreview/text: The book that started it all. And a classic of fantasy.For those who have never read it, most highly recommended.If you are familiar with the Lord of the rings, the hobbit merely sets the stage. On many levels it is a happier story: it's villains not as villainous as those in the Lord of the rings: bad rather than evil. A good introduction for a young reader to the world of middle earth.I've probably now read this three or four times and each time enjoy it more.
