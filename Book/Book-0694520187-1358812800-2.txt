review/summary: A classic, not my tastereview/text: While there are countless reports on this book, I will spare everyone that and try to keep my review simple. I had to read this book for school, and it could be because I was forced I found it a little tiresome. I have heard many great things about this book, and will take their word on it, I personally could never come to like it. I have read many contemporary books for classes and found many to be entertaining, but more often than not, the books themselves ramble on about a minor, insignificant point. For those books, I would only give them 1 star. Moby Dick deserves at least 3, primarily because the author is able to make his points despite many of the cultural conventions of writing of his time.One major aspect that helped me to enjoy it was the knowledge that the author had a personal struggle in writing the book, oftentimes not sure if his characters were good or bad, even remarking when finishing that he may have created something terrible. I urge you to look up other information about it if you do decide to read it, as it may help make reading it more enjoyable as it did for me.
