review/summary: Mind-opening!review/text: I ordered this book just for the heck of it while browsing, not expecting much. I'm not that into 'self-help' literature to begin with, but figured why not give it a try, who knows, I might learn something.Well, boy did I learn a few things!First off, the book is divided into sections according to topic or personality, which makes it extremely easy to navigate through (if you'd want to skip to a relevant part).Secondly, it was very interestingly written, and the analogies used to explain complicated topics made it all the more appealing, because we all know that different trials in a relationship (and the causes of it) are really not that easy to grasp or comprehend, let alone FIX.And thirdly, the author, being a couple's counsellor, shares clients' experiences and personal testimonials in regards to their marital troubles, which on numerous occasions while reading the book made me go: "AHA, i recognise that! And look, the next paragraph deals with the solution!"This book opened my eyes to ALOT of things I hadn't thought about before, in terms of wrong-goings and wrong-doings in relationships. It explained alot of really BASIC things that might seem obvious upon reading them, but that people surely overlook (I know I did).I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone, trouble in paradise or not! It's a really interesting read and you will finish it feeling more enlightened for sure!
