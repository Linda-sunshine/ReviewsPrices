review/summary: A great adventure!review/text: The Hobbit by J.R.R.Tolkien is a great adventure story. I read this story to my granddaughter when she was a little girl. Bilbo Baggins lives a quiet unassuming life until Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, "looking for someone to share in an adventure." Not wanting anything to do with any adventure Bilbo wishes Gandalf a good morning to send him on his way. Gandalf leaves a magical mark upon Bilbo's front door. That evening his home is invaded by thirteen dwarves and he is called a burglar. And so begins the great adventure of Bilbo Baggins. An adventure full of trolls,Orcs and giant spiders and a fury dragon.
