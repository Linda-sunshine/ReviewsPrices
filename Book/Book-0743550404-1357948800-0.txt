review/summary: Thoroughly satisfied...review/text: There may be those who found The Colorado Kid unsatisfying, because it lacked the usual motifs and science fiction drama that new fans would expect from the author. Instead, King gives us a glimpse into the simple plain lives of northeastern residents and how they are momentarily interrupted, not changed, by strangeness. This is not the new sci-fi show, Haven, it is continuation of life and tradition even when adventure rears it`s curious head into pedestrianalism. TCK is a worthwhile read and a pleasure to own.
