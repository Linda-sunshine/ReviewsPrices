review/summary: Great surprisereview/text: I ordered this because I liked the picture on the front.(I know,I know! You should never judge a book........) But I couldn't resist.It turned out to be very good mystery. And the emotions were so real-life. The characters were so real-life. However, the abilities of Faith is only something we could wish for. I bought the book because it was on sale and got a wonderful surprise.
