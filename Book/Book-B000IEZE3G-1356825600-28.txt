review/summary: Look out for an owl from me!review/text: I've read a lot of books in the short 16 years I've lived, but, on the small fortune I've saved during that time, I'd have sworn to you that this is by far my favorite. Harry, that delightful little chap from the cupboard of house number 4, with his nasty little scar and his pretty looking future, is my new all-time favorite book character. Although I, myself, am not one to donate into the world of sorcery and witchcraft (being a God loving Christian) I cannot help but fall in love with the literature I found myself reading today. Expecting that I could honestly begin to tell people about the horror that is this magic-filled novel, I started into it. Now I find myself searching for book 2! Thank you J.K. Rowling, for giving me a lovely bit of entertainment this boring weekend. I am back into my dampened skin as I drown into the world of reading as I did months ago. Do expect to receive an owl from me, expressing my feelings in a formal letter, Mr. Rowling!
