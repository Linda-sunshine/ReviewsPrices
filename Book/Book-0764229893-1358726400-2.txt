review/summary: Gods and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings #1review/text: This series is amazing. I couldn't put it down. It brought the kings of Judah in the Old Testament to life and gave a glimpse of how their lives and the lives of the Israelites, in general lived and worshiped or turned from God.
