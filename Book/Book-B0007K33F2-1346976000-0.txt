review/summary: Don't buy and read abridged classics - go for the real thingreview/text: It is not quite true that the publishers hide the fact that this is an abridged edition - it is printed under the title but is difficult to notice. After the 30 introductory pages you'll find a "Translator's Note' that tells you that "a distinct prejudice against length now exists". Well, in my view it is a poor taste to shorten a classic book. The book is excellent but get the full version.
