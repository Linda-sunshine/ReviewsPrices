review/summary: remark on "The picture of Dorian Gray"review/text: This a well written unusual story with strong characters and definitely worth reading. Still, I would not rate this work of art as an excellent one. Its actuality for todays life is limited and, on my opinion, contains too much unbased social philosophy.
