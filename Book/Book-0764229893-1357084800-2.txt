review/summary: You won't be disappointedreview/text: Typically while reading Chronicles in the bible, one tends to be overwhelmed and therefore come out of it with a less than exciting experience.Lynn Austin puts you right smack into the scenes. You are not reading about the past, you are living it, feeling it, practically smelling it (smoke, incense, etc.); it is that real.Many times, I put the book down and picked up the bible for verification of characters, lineage, etc....it was all there.Get to know your biblical kings in all their glory (or lack thereof). Love them or hate them, you will love the book. I ordered the second one the minute I finished the first.You won't be disappointed.
