review/summary: An acquired tastereview/text: A strange read. It's hard to like a book when the main character is so odd, infuriatingly placid and unrelatable, along with incomprehensible taste in men. The first nine chapters seemed overall unnecessary in its length and read like a very depressing Anne of Green Gables. And yet I found myself caring about what happens to Jane, so I kept reading. Three stars, as despite the publisher's claim to superiority, there were many typos; especially annoying were the ones around page 175 where Rochester keeps calling her Janet.
