review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: One of my favorites of all time - if you haven't read it, you should - obviously not just a children's book, unless your children are educated readers. As an English teacher, I recommend The Hobbit to absolutely everyone - not only a great narrative, but a shining example of how a narrative should be. I'm so thankful to have it on my Kindle, because I read again it every year; it takes me away, and now I can take it with me! Looking forward to Peter Jackson's cinematic version - aren't you?
