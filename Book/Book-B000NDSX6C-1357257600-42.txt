review/summary: Great Book and I'm excited for the moviereview/text: I had to read this book before the movie, as it makes it that much better. I loved this book and J.R.R. Tolkien did a great job with relating the tale to the Lord of the Rings series. I highly recommend the read for anyone who's a fan of the series.
