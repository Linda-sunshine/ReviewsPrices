review/summary: A good rode trip read!review/text: I love the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings books, movies and all. It had been a long time since I listened to a reading of the Hobbit, but with the first Hobbit movie coming out, I thought I should revisit it. I had to make a long road trip and it entertained me for about 800 miles.
