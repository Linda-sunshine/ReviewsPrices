review/summary: Atlas Shruggedreview/text: If you really want to know what makes Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney tick, this is your book! Or, if like me, you just want a peek into the minds of these fools, this is still your book. It clearly illustrates how they really believe they are "better" than the rest of us. They see themselves as the "makers" and the rest of us as the "takers". they see themselves as super humans and the rest of us as sub-humans. They believe that without them, the rest of us would perish; that we NEED them. they are clearly very sick individuals; egomaniacs to say the least!
