review/summary: Tolkien's masterpiecereview/text: A true marvel of imagination and fantasy. Tolkien sets the standard for all English fantasy writing in this series of novels and is a true classic by any standard. A true must read.I would offer a complaint for the Kindle edition. I use the kindle app on my ipod and it is difficult to find and navigate to the bookmarks. I highlighted a few passages, and the highlighted passages and bookmarks were combined in one section on the navigation page and it was difficult to find my bookmark. For ease of use and portability though, it is awesome!
