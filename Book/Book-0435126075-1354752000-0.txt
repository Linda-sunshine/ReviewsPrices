review/summary: LOVE it...review/text: Of course you know why this rating is a five. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most amazing love stories I've EVER read. Honestly the writing style is not something I could read often, but this is a beautiful-reach in and touch your soul kind of read...Of course the movie is amazing as well, but I stand by what I always say-The book is ALWAYS better.
