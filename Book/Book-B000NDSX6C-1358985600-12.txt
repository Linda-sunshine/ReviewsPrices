review/summary: My introduction to fantasy.review/text: I have been reading this book since I was in 3rd grade a million years ago. Our teacher would read it with us so that if we had any questions with words or regarding the story he was there to explain/help us.I've most likely read this book hundreds of times and it will always have special meaning to me. I have had many copies in paperback that have gotten beat up from years of reading/lending. Haven't read my Kindle copy yet but can't wait.
