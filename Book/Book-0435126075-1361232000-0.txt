review/summary: So Not An Austen Fanreview/text: These are not my type of books. But I loved it anyway! The whole concept of 'I hate you so much' turned 'I love you so much(even though I don't want to)', is my favorite. I can't get enough of their bickering and denial of their feelings and everything. I may not usually read this sort of thing or pay attention to the author, but I love this particular story!
