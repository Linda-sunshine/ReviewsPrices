review/summary: Alan Lee Illustrations: The Hobbitreview/text: I wanted to have a decent copy of the Hobbit now that the film is comming. Multiple versions and formats are right now available however The Hard Cover with Alan Lee Illustration is a most to have specially if you want to have a collection with the Lord of the Rings (single book or 3 books) with Allan Lee Illustrations and to complete the collection the Sillmarillion but now with Ted Nazmith great illustrations.Alan Lee pictures inspired the films and portrait several calendars. The Paper is delightfull (kind of the one use for expensive magazines). Still I regret no illustrations index as with the Sillmarillion/Ted Nazmith edition but again this is a most to have if you truly want to have a good experience. I am happy to finally own a copy of this book with Alan Lee art contributions.
