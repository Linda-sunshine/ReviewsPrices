review/summary: An excellent adventure story!review/text: This is an excellent book and started the Barsoom series of books from Edgar Rice Burroughs. His main character is the famous John Carter and the book features action and adventure tossed in with some Sci-Fi and alien life forms. EG Burroughs was one of the early masters of Sci-Fi and this book is as good of a read today as it was when it came out in 1912. It is not so much a Sci-Fi story as an action adventure where a hero that has good fighting skills and extraordinary strength has traveled to the planet Mars and becomes involved in that world's politics and wars.The book is entertaining and fun to read and the action filled. I won't ruin the story by telling you all about it but you will like the storyline. It is not serious reading and it is just for entertainment but once you read it you will want to continue with the reading of the series. There are many good books in the series that you will enjoy. Edgar Rice Burroughs had a wonderful imagination and it shines in this story. I recommend this book to you.
