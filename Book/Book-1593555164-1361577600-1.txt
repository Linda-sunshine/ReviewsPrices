review/summary: Another Great Read from Lee Child's "Jack Reacher" seriesreview/text: As every other book so far has done, this one kept me interested almost from the beginning straight through to the end. I have thoroughly enjoyed every book so far, and will continue reading them all so long as they keep me entertained. This is not great literature, but it is very entertaining!
