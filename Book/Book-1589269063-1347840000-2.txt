review/summary: In preparation for marriage....review/text: I bought this book during a deployment in preparation for marriage. At the time, I was in a serious relationship with someone I thought was going to turn out to be "the one". (Come to find out, I was simply in the "in love" stage)But I digress. This is an AMAZING book. I didn't realize that it was written for couples who were already married, but nevertheless it has been very beneficial. Once you read the book, you'll start to see the similar pattern many of the married couples were going through because they weren't speaking their spouse's "love language." They weren't doing the things their spouse MOSTLY considers unmistakable expressions of love.There were at least two couples in this book who said that they had wished they had known this information (or read this book) 20+ years before so that they could've forgone the years of NOT feeling loved by their spouse. If that's not motivation enough for you to feed on this information Dr. Chapman offers, I don't know what to tell ya.I STRONGLY recommend this book to married couples, couples who plan on being married, and even single folks. There is so much eye-opening wisdom in here that you'd be doing yourself a disservice by ignoring it. It can save you years of hurt & misunderstanding. But positively, it can spur you and your loved one to newer heights of satisfaction and happiness in your relationship. Be blessed.
