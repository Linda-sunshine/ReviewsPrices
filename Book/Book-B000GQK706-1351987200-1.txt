review/summary: A good dealreview/text: The whole of JRR Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" for one reasonable price. I don't think I need to review the work itself -- some love every word, some find it dull in written form, you make up your own mind. This edition adds an interesting introduction on the history of the various editions of the work. My only slight criticism is that the footnotes are placed all the way at the end of the book, rather than at the ends of the chapters, but otherwise it seems a perfectly good version of this classic work.
