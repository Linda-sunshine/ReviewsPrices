review/summary: A classic.review/text: Kind of a scary take on a future society. The book reads well and at a quick pace, written in 1932 it never feels silly in its description of an imagined future, actually it feels a little to familiar. The sheep mentality, power in the hands of a select few, the desire to make everyone and everything &#8220;soft&#8221; around the edges and medicinal escapism. Yikes.
