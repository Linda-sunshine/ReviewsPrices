review/summary: Best book for teens teens and YAreview/text: This book is one of the best series openers there ever was. This book is action packed, full of thrills,at times can be somber, but overall, opens up a new world for readers to jump into ,and explore as if they too ,were there themselves. Also contains brilliant quotes that many can apply to real-life situations.
