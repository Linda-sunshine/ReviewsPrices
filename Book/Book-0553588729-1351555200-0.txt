review/summary: Heard this was a must readreview/text: All my friends with kids insisted I read this book. I found the video to actually be the most helpful in a practical sense. The book provides much more the background from Doc Karp which is helpful in understanding his philosophy.I don't have my child yet (7 more weeks) but definitely scared of colic after watching a friend go they it with her child. This book did give me hope that it can be overcome.
