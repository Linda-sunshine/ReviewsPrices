review/summary: If you read no other book - EVER!review/text: My favourite book. It's just that simple. I doubt I can add much to what is already written about this one. I started calling my brother Ignatius and since he also liked the book so much he considers it a compliment. But then, he's odd.It's the sort of writing that makes you buy an author's new book without even glancing at the synopsis. But the world was robbed of a genius with John Kennedy Toole's early death.If you read just one book, make it this one.
