review/summary: Love the illustrations!review/text: I have never actually READ the story, but now that it's on my Kindle, I am really looking forward to it! The illustrations are a very nice addition for us Kindle readers, too, since I haven't had those with most of my downloaded books so far. I did start reading it as soon as I got it and didn't want to stop! But I have another book to finish first, so that I can fully enjoy this one, which I know I will!
