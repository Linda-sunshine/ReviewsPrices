review/summary: Burroughs' Planetary Romance Masterpiecereview/text: "A Princess of Mars" may be one of the most enduring first novels every written. It launched Burroughs' career as a writer and became a cornerstone of the Planetary Romance sub-genre. As "Argosy All-Story" found out, having a Burroughs' story helped circulation and advertising revenue's increase. From the hook in the opening framing device to the ending that demanded a sequel, "A Princess of Mars" delivers an imaginative world, culture, and philosophy that both draws from and contrasts with Earth society. Love, friendship, honor, courage, and familial bonds are handled in such a way that you only realize what Burroughs has revealed about them when you reflect upon the story afterwards. If you're looking for a prime example of general audience pulp fiction from early 1900s, "A Princess of Mars" is sure to entertain with a sense of wonder.
