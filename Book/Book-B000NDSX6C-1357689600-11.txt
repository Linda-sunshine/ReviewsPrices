review/summary: The Hobbiyreview/text: It's a classic with so much life and character. I've grown up with J.R.R. Tolkien and I love all of his work including this wonderful tale of a hobbit taken from his comforts and sent on an adventure full of danger and things his own world had not allowed him to know existed.
