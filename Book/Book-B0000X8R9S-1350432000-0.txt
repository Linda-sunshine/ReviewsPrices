review/summary: Hatchet By: Cheesy Cheesereview/text: Brian Robeson, a 13-year-old boy, is going to meet his father for the first time after his parent's divorce. Brian is the only passenger on a small bush plane when the pilot dies of a heart attack and the plane crashes into a lake. Brian must survive alone in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but a hatchet. He must face challenges that most stranded people must face. He needs to find shelter, food, water and multiple other things to help him survive. I liked how the story ended, but if I told you what happened I would spoil the book for you. I think this could actually happen and I completely recommend this book to people of all ages that like action and suspense.
