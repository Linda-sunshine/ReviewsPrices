review/summary: A great read, for all history students.review/text: I enjoyed reading The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, it was like being transported back in time. Franklin was a great statesman of his time , and reading about his life and times helps the reader to get inside the mind of this great man. the beauty of the Kindle reader is you can read a few pages, bookmark the page and pick it up again when you get a few spare minutes.In conclusion i would reccomend this book to anybody, who has an interest in learning about the great minds who helped to shape the world we now live in.
