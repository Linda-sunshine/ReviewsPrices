review/summary: Back to it after 40 yearsreview/text: It has been 40 years since I first read The Hobbit..This kindle edition had some of the original art work throughout the book..Interesting that my second reading was far more exciting with the accumulation of knowledge and life experience gathered over 40 years..When I was 21 I thought it was sort of childish but it was the "in" thing to read at that time...Now I can't recommend The Hobbit enough especially for all the computer stunted minds out there today..JP
