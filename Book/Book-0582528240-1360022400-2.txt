review/summary: Decent plot, horrible writingreview/text: I read compulsively, so it's not like I'm a young or new reader. This book was hard to read even for a seasoned bibliophile like me. I understand Mark Twain wanted to write it in authentic dialects, but it was just too much. &#34;To Kill a Mockinbird&#34; is written in authentic dialect but still remains readable. If I hadn't been reading it with my husband who HAD to read it for class, I would have quickly put it down. I did like the issues the author dealt with (Jim's freedom, Huck's loyalty), but it was basically drowned out by the overly descriptive rants and hard to read communication between the characters.
