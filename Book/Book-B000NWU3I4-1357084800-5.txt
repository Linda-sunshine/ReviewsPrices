review/summary: Excellent read especially aloud to childrenreview/text: We loved this creative tale. The children begged for another chapter at every reading. We look forward to the next adventure Tolkien authored for our family readings. Very few authors are able to capture the attention of a wide ranges of ages and maturity as Tolkien is able to in his writings. I highly recommend this tale to children of all ages!
