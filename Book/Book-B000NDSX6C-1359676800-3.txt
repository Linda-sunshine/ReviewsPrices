review/summary: Beautiful!review/text: This is the gorgeous gold boxed edition with photocopies of Tolkien's own notes, hand-drawn maps, and original manuscripts inserted. Just beautiful.I love to find notes and sketches and highlights in books, so I bought an &#34;acceptable&#34; version, and it is pristine! I can probably see my face shining in the &#34;very good&#34; ones! :PI don't need to rate the literature itself. It's The Greatest Adventure! &#60;3 If you haven't read The Hobbit, I honestly feel sad for you; you are missing out on something huge, something magical, something beautiful.&#34;In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.&#34; Isn't that a wonderful beginning? ;)Yes, I'm that jerk who bought the book because the movie came out, but only because I hadn't read it in years and couldn't find my own copy. I wanted to catch up again before I saw the movie. Still haven't seen it!
