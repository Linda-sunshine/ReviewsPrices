review/summary: An Awakening to Some People's Impudent Thinkingreview/text: This is the best classics book I've read so far (though I've only read a few). It truly lives up to all the hype. So if you haven't read it yet, treat yourself to a wonderful reading experience and be sure to get your hands on this gem!This story provided an awakening to some people's impudent thinking. That in mind, I demanded and cried for simple human decency and glad that this book delivered.Incredible cast of characters, thought provoking, and illustrated a nostalgia for nobility. Definitely my kind of book! I'm one happy reader. :D
