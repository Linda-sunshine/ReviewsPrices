review/summary: Good Suspensereview/text: As always, great suspense and characterization. Lee Child is a great wordsmith; does everything right to build setting, characters, and develop the story without ever wasting any events or even details of setting. It all comes together from beginning to end. HOWEVER, I really don't enjoy reading his sexual events. Yes, he always gets the girl, but, please, just leave an illusion there. I'm not interested in the sweaty details.
