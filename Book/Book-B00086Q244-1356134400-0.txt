review/summary: I'm not easily impressed. Therefore, I rarely bother with product reviews.review/text: I was a little curious as to why the book was so successful; I had never even heard of it oddly enough. I'm glad I found it, I have only read a little bit, so my rating is based only on that but it is enough to warrant the rating.I tried some of the suggestions out during a conversation while getting my hair cut and I was amazed. I had the best haircut I've ever received and service to boot! This is coming from a person who is incredibly socially awkward. This isn't the only book I'm reading though; I've been integrating various ways to improve my social skills into a plan to implement and that was my first attempt, but it mainly consisted of advice from this book. I don't know whether the rest of the book will be as useful, or whether I'll have this great of success in the future but simply seeing a person become incredibly energetic from a few changes on my part is very awesome!
