review/summary: Not Quite LOTR, But Less "Heavy"review/text: In evaluating "The Hobbit", one naturally can compare it to the later "Lord of the Rings" works by Tolkien. While it may not live up to that epic trilogy, "Hobbit" is rather remarkable in its own way: Tolkien's ability to turn what essentially was a children's bedtime story into an engrossing novel filled with adventure.For a basic plot summary, "The Hobbit" sees Bilbo Baggins, of Hobbiton, set off on a grand adventure in the company of Gandalf the Wizard and twelve dwarves bent on reclaiming their rightful treasure from a greedy dragon named Smaug. Along the way, the company meets up with some eclectic creatures ranging from trolls and giant spiders to great flying Eagles and even a pathetic little creature called Gollum who is hiding a "precious" whose significance cannot yet even be fathomed.Whereas "LOTR" reads like an epic, "Hobbit" reads as if Tolkien is telling you a story (with both the language and tone of the book reflecting this). It is full of strange creatures and sometimes rather terrifying events, but at the same time it is rather light-hearted, with the merry gang progressing rapid-fire from one adventure to another. There is none of the doom-and-gloom or Middle Earth politics that is often the focus of LOTR.Easily the "crown jewel" of this novel, though, is the portion involving Gollum and his "precious". Whether read before or after LOTR, these scenes will stick in your mind long after anything else in this book. Much more reminiscent of the darkness of LOTR.Thus, "The Hobbit" is basically the "first steps" of the greatest fantasy story ever created. I can't rate it as better than any of the LOTR books, but if you like a lighter tone and less "weight" in a book, then this one might just appeal to you even more.
