review/summary: DWARVES, ELVES AND HOBBITSreview/text: I had previously seen all 3 of the movies and have just finished reading the Hobbit. I really enjoyed The Hobbit so I decided to read the Lord of the Rings. My God but there were alot of names that I could barely pronounce and place names of equal tongue twisting ability. I did however get through all the books and though I thoroughly approve the changes made for the movies I now understand more of the backstories for all the main characters.
