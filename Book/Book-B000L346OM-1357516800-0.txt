review/summary: Meaning Is My Responsibilityreview/text: Out of the worst of contexts, Viktor Frankl speaks the wisdom of how to live within suffering and find meaning. Staying present to the reality of what is happening right now and finding a glimmer of something that calls us forward seem to be the keys. Dwelling only on what has been lost or is being lost leads to meaninglessness and to a despair. This lose of all hope was certain death in the camps. Reading this book again continues to inspire me to manage my suffering in a way which gives my life meaning and purpose. I highly recommend this book for anyone for whom suffering is an issue.
