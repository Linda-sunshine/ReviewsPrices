review/summary: I Spy With My Mystic Eye--A Marvelous little volume!review/text: &#34;The Hobbit&#34; as a book, needs no review. It is too famous, and one of the more important works of fiction in recent decades. If you haven't read it, do so immediately.This Edition, however, is a charmer, that any true book lover will want on his shelf. Complete & unabridged, about the size of a hymnal, with a nice leatherette cover, gilded pages, and what seems to be acid-free paper, is is a joy to hold, to read from, and to look at on your shelf. If you love books, **as books**, you will prefer this adorable little volume above all others. Illustrated with pen & ink drawings by Tolkein himself, and with Tolkein's own maps as front & end pieces, I have never seen a better edition of &#34;The Hobbit&#34;.I **do wish** that the &#34;Lord Of The Rings&#34; would be issued in identically bound, complementary editions. I would snap up the set in a second, & treasure them.I **also** want to see more leatherette covered books in stores, as they are cheaper than hardcovers, and vastly nicer than paperbacks.
