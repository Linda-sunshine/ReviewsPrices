review/summary: My favorite Austenreview/text: I've read everything by Jane Austen, even her juvenalia, and *Persuasion* is my favorite. It's one of her shortest. It was published posthumously, and I think that she meant to flesh it out or add subplots, like her other books.As it stands, it's a wonderful work. *Emma* is supposed to be Austen's masterpiece, but I think *Persuasion* is a more mature work and, probably, more personal. The main character Anne Eliot is Austen's best character: mature, responsible, intelligent, and more wise than witty. She was persuaded to not marry for love when she was young, but to wait for a chance at a wealthier man. That chance never came, and now Anne is past her bloom, probably unmarriageable, and her inane father and sister are shoveling the family's little remaining money out of the coffers as fast as they possibly can. Anne gets a second chance with the man she loves, a chance that Jane may not have had.It's beautifully, and poignantly, told.I love Jane Austen. I tend to love writers and read everything that an author has written, and Jane was the first author who I fell in love with.V.
