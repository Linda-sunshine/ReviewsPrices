review/summary: Great book, especially for young kids interested in the outdoors.review/text: I have loved this book for many, many years. I actually read this one when it first came out and remember not being able to put it down. When I was looking for books to share with my own children - especially my son - I rediscovered this gem. Both of my children enjoyed the story and were entranced at the idea of &#34;living off of the land&#34;. They were suitably impressed with the character's ingenuity, determination and grit. I think the book is suitable for most age groups. There are some scary parts in it to be sure but nothing that most kids cannot handle. My youngest, 5, did not get scared at all, so I judge my opinion based upon her reaction. The book is not long and it is exciting and well written. This is the first book of a series of Brian books. I had no idea of that until I bought this one again several months ago. If you or your children enjoyed this one, I recommend trying out Paulsen's Fine Madness of Running the Iditarod book. It is a bit coarse and I absolutely glossed over some of the language and events in the book for my own kids. I suggest pre reading it before giving it or reading it to children under 13. It is a hilarious book though and full of epic-ness.
