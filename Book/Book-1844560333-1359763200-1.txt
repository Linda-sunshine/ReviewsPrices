review/summary: It was okreview/text: This book was fun but long.I'm sort of an impatient reader, plus I'm more of an action packed book reader,but it was masterfully written.If I have to read a book about tea and dances this is the one I'd pick.It's pretty fun for a Romance and I found myself hoping she would find her prince.Pride and prejudice is about a girl from a family of like four sisters and no brothers, so their all knight in shining armour chasers except for their father who manages to remain sane.If you like the book you might also like the movie.I know I do, I had a hard time getting through the book.But like I said I'm an impatient reader and I'd prefer to read the Lord of the rings or I am number four.
