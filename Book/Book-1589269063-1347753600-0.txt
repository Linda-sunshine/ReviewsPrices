review/summary: The Five Love Languagesreview/text: Loved this book! I see an individual counselor who recommended this book to me. In the past, I have been to marriage counseling with my husband. I found that this book helped us more than any of the marriage counelors that we have been to by far. Highly recommend it to couples before they get married or to couples that may have been married for years such as myself..........28 years. Wish we could have read this many years ago.
