review/summary: I want my stolen time backreview/text: After finishing this book, I am so disappointed that I wish there would be a way I could sue the author for my stolen time with such crap. The story is weak, lame and a completely worthless piece of junk and makes a shameless attempt to deliver her lunatic philosophy.
