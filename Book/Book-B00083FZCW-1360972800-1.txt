review/summary: Max Ride bookreview/text: I bought this book for my ten year old to give her something different to read after another Rick Riordan series. =) She has devoured every Riordan book she has ever read and I was looking for a different type of story line to offer her another avenue. She loved it! We ordered the second book the week after this one and now have books three and four on the way!
