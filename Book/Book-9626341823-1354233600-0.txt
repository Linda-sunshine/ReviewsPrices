review/summary: Ticking an item off my literary bucket listreview/text: Like everyone I know, I've seen the various cinematic incarnations of this story (Alistair Sim, George C. Scott, and the Muppets are my favorites, in that order), but I always meant to read the story myself. And now I have. I will probably never read it again, but that doesn't mean I don't think you shouldn't read it. If only to see what liberties the filmmakers took.Truth be told, these free classics for Kindle are a wonderful resource we should take advantage of while they're available. I've downloaded about 20 books on my reading list. I read A Christmas Carol first because it's seasonal, plus I can't seem to find the Alistair Sim version of the film anywhere.
