review/summary: Good not greatreview/text: I love the Jack Reacher series. I liked the way the book started although the end was a bit predictable. Wish I could give three and a half stars. I have not seen the new film with Tom Cruise, I have heard it's pretty good but Reacher should be six foot four. Maybe Tom's acting will carry it.
