review/summary: Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevensonreview/text: Read before as a child, now re-read many, many years later.The story of pirates, hidden treasure, the high seas and sailing with the wind have lost none of their attraction after a 50 year gap. It is a great tale, well told, exciting, possibly rather violent by today's children's book standards - people actually get killed. Relive your childhood, read it to your kids/grandkids (it will improve their vocabularies no end) and just enjoy it for what it is - a children's tale of adventure and derring-do.
