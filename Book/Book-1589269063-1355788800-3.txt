review/summary: Fantastic!review/text: ThoughThe 11 Pillars of Relationship Successand the 5 love languages share a lot of similarities, Pillars offers a few more "languages" and is a much quicker read. Despite that, the author Gary Chapman has created a great piece for those of us looking to take our relationships to the next level. This book has helped my relationship go from a place of uncertainty to a place of optimism and hope. Thank you!
