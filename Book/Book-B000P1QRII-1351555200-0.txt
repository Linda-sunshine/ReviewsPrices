review/summary: Fantastic readreview/text: How have I not read The Giver before now? It is a great book for children and adults alike. If you enjoy a read that paints another world so clearly that you feel like you are there, and gets you comparing it to the world you live in, then this book is for you. It is quite thought-provoking.
