review/summary: All 3 in one? Yes please!review/text: Let's see, I could pay $21 to get each of the 3 volumes (Fellowship, Two Towers, and Return of the King) separately, or I could pay $10 to get it all as one volume. Since I like to read the whole thing, and not just randomly re-read one third of it, it makes sense that it is all togehter. The book itself is fantastic. Tolkien had created a whole world, and the way he set this epic story in that world gave the readers the sense of that. Even though they didn't know all the details of that world or history.
