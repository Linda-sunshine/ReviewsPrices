review/summary: A Different Bookreview/text: Many people have seen the movie John Carter. However, this book goes deeper into the story. Instead of gaining a glimpse into his life, we begin to understand who he is. If you didn't like the movie, I highly suggest you read the book. And, even if you liked the movie, I suggest you read it.
