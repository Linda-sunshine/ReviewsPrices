review/summary: It is not all about Pride and Prejudice..review/text: A classic. Deserves to be read multiple times. After Pride and Prejudice this is my favorite Austen. I own paperback but found Kindle format to be equally enjoyable. Do wish alternate Austen ending was also included in this edition.
