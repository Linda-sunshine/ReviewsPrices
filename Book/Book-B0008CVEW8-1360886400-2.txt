review/summary: A classic coming-of-age adventurereview/text: Like you'd expect from a book from its generation, the dialogues and actions of the boy Jim are hard to picture a youth today doing. Unlike your expectations of the era, Long John Silver is hard to classify as fully good or fully bad, and character development happens at a fast pace more comfortable for modern readers. I'd definitely revisit it in a few years.
