review/summary: Beyond my Expectationsreview/text: I know for sure now why Charles Dickens is such a famous author for works other than A Christmas Carol. The reputation of the book and the author speak for themselves. I was overwhelmed with the quality of Dickens' writing, the intricate nuances of the plot and the many surprise twists. The illustrations in the book plus the alternate ending were also bonuses. I could not be more complimentary of this book and plan to read many more Dickens works starting with David Copperfield. Great Expectations is now one of my favorite books of all time.
