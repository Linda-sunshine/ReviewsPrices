review/summary: Hobbits on the Trainreview/text: I ordered this book so that I would have something to read on the long train trip from Rome to Palermo and it was exactly the right thing. It was also my first use of a Kindle book and I am anxious to repeat this experience as often as possible. I would recommend the book itself and the Kindle experience to anyone. I read the book many years ago and had forgotten most of the detail so it was a happy journey through not quite familiar territory.
