review/summary: Nonbeliever Cannot Enjoyreview/text: I usually like Jodi Picoult novels although they tend to be predictable/similar to one another. This one actually wasn't because the ending made no sense. I've never written an amazon review before of a product but decided to review this book because it pissed me off so much. The ending is absolutely terrible. The book was pretty boring throughout and way longer than it needed to be but I kept waiting to get to the end so I'd finally understand why all this was happening. She explains nothing. It was so stupid. Waste of money.
