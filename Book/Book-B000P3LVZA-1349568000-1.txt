review/summary: Test tube babies, feelies, and savages -- oh my!review/text: Brave New World transports its readers to a dystopian society in the future that worships technology, indulges in hedonism, and submits to authoritarianism. Individuals who question technological pursuits, reject pleasure-seeking, and fight against the sociopolitical system quickly find themselves in dangerous circumstances. While the true protagonist ("The Savage") is not even introduced until halfway through the book, which I consider an overall weakness of the story, the painstakingly detailed description of the setting and the intriguing cast of other characters we meet in the beginning creates substantial momentum to keep the reader quite enthralled. The themes are sobering, especially when compared to the realities of our day, and force you to think deeply about human nature, the interplay between science and ethics, and how to find true fulfillment in life.
