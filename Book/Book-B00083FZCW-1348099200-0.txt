review/summary: Excellent series to get young readers reading!review/text: My daughter started reading this series last week. She loved the first book so much that we went and bought the rest of the series for her. At her school library, the waiting list for book one is over 10 long. I cannot say enough about how well James Patterson writes, he makes it almost impossible to put down the book until you are finished with it, and then it is all you can do is think about starting the next one. This type of writing is what gets young readers hooked on the wonderful world of getting lost in a book, living out other lives many times over. I cannot thank Mr. Patterson enough for his talent, not only in crafting a great read, but for his efforts in getting young people reading. He is truly a gifted writer and this series is one of his best.
