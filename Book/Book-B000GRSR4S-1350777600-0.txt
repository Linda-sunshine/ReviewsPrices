review/summary: Masterful novel that makes you thinkreview/text: Vonnegut truly was a master. My favorite thing about his literary technique is that he penned stories that are enjoyable, yet have layer upon layer of meaning that, depending upon your mood, you can explore as you enjoy the book.In my opinion,Slaughterhouse-Five: A Novelwas his finest work. I only wish the book was longer as there is so much more he could have done with the story.
