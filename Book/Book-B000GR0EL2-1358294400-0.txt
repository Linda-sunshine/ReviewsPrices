review/summary: Made me laugh, cry, and have more faith!review/text: This is a TREASURE!!! I had seen the movie a while back (which is excellent). The book is so much richer, though, as books always are, and so compelling! I powered through it, reading it every night. And I plan to read it again sometime soon. And to my children, too.Corrie and Betsie Ten Boom are two of the most amazing people I have ever read about. The story rings true, too. It has no element of exaggeration, it is just their story plain and simple. I would love to have met Corrie while she was still living!!
