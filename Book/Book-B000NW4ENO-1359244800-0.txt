review/summary: Awesome book...review/text: I have absolutely loved this movie from the first moment I watched it (want to say I was 6 or 7!). I finally sat down to read the book and while it took me a loooong time to finish it, I couldn't put it down. I see now why this book is so controversial, even today still. I love how things that didn't make sense, or you just wanted more of, in the movie went more into detail in the book. Melly dying, the chaos that Rhett and Scarlett went though when Bonnie died, how Scarlett landed Frank. Very good book indeed!
