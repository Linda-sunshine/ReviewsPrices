review/summary: Never get tired of reading itreview/text: This is the third time I've read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I really enjoyed reading this along with Pottermore. Pottermore incorporates a lot of the details mentioned in the story. It was fun to pay attention to the little details this time since I know the story so well. I also liked reading the bonus material she wrote on Pottermore - it adds a lot to the story. I don't know if I realized this before, but J.K. Rowling is excellent at showing and not telling. For example: "[Mr. Dursley] hummed "Tiptoe Through the Tulips" and as he worked, jumped at small noises." She doesn't have to say that he's starting to lose it because I've decided that for myself. The books have so many fun characters that aren't in the movies. I love how optimistic and humble Harry is. I also like how light-hearted and quirky the books are. The movies tend to focus on the darker aspects of the story. I never get tired of reading these books.
