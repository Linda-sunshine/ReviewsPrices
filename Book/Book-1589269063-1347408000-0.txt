review/summary: The 5 Love Languagesreview/text: This book drove home such important concepts for me. It helped me put into words the frustration I have been having with a "dying" relationship and facilitated moving through and out of it with caring, love, and acceptance. Now onto to one where we BOTH will practice these simple, clear, and oh so valuable tools. Thank you!!
