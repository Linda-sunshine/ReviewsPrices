review/summary: Awesome book, even for a 25 year old :)review/text: This book actually had my heart racing toward the end! I've never read this series and have only seen the first movie. But now I'm hooked! :) can't wait to finish the series and be on board the Harry Potter train! (Station 9 3/4 ;D)
