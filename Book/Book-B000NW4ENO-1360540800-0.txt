review/summary: Great readreview/text: Haven't finished yet (300 pages left) but I'm loving this book... nothing horribly suspenseful happens yet I can't put it down. It's also easy to read- I never find myself thinking, &#34;Okay, let's get on with it&#34; as most people expect to do from books of this time period. It's very long (1037 pages) but don't let that deter you!
