review/summary: Atlas Shruggedreview/text: I first read this book almost 50 years ago, at which time I related it to Soviet collectivism. Reading it today, I found it to be a prophetic vision of the evils of big government and the failure of central planning, a chilling reminder that the direction that America is taking under Barack Obama will lead us to ruin. Ayn Rand is too often mistaken as a writer of fiction, whose philosophy is out of step with the mainstream of American public attitudes. This book is clearly as relevant today as it was when it was written during the dark days of the Cold War. It is MUST reading for all those who aspire to the American Dream and cherish the foundations of our republic.
