review/summary: Action packedreview/text: What can I say? This is Reacher at his best. Fast moving and full of action, I loved it. His knowledge about people, places and things is astounding. He is such a hero. Tough and hard as nails. A cross between Bond and Sherlock Holmes. I can't wait for my next encounter with him.
