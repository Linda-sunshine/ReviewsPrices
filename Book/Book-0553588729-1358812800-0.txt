review/summary: Great Info, Too Wordyreview/text: Great info with supporting facts and examples, but this could definitely be recapped to half the length it is and still get the point across just fine.As far as how effective his method is, my OBGYN and birth coach swear by it, and I use swaddled and shhh my baby all the time with great results. He isn't a fan of pacifiers so I'm just waiting patiently as he explores sucking his hand now (7weeks). And he loves his FIsher Price swing to entertain him and put his to sleep. I would definitely recommend this book, especially if you have a fussy baby!
