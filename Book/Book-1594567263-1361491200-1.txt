review/summary: Timeless Quest for Youth and Beauty with a Twistreview/text: The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is a classic about the timeless quest for youth and beauty. The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: "Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book. I liked the story and Wilde's writing style. It's a classic "must-read."
