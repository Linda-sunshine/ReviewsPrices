review/summary: Horrible book by a horrible woman.review/text: Ayn Rand is another example of how you can be smart, educated and stupid at the same time. This book tries to justify selfishness, greed and megalomania. You can't both believe in the selfishness this book pushes AND be a Christian. The two do not mesh. I understand that Paul Ryan requires those who work for him to read this book. I guess that explains some things about him. The really sickening thing to me, is that after she pushed this evil agenda of self dependance and hate for welfare programs, she, herself used them in the last years of her life. God does have a way of humbling us all.
