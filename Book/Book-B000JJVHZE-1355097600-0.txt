review/summary: My wife's favorite bookreview/text: I read this in high school and loved this book; however, I bought this for my wife because of the quality of the binding and the rough style cuts of the page. While those are minor details to the book itself, it is a book that is amazing and continues to be enjoyable to read year after year! I'll look forward to reading it with my kids when they are old enough to appreciate it.
