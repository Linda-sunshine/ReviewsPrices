review/summary: wonderful book for adults and kids alikereview/text: I am in my mid-thirties and just read this book for the first time. I enjoy reading the classics and just made my way to this one, which I am very glad I did. The book is a fast-paced, lean adventure story with all the expected elements of a great pirate yarn. The only thing it is missing is a dramatic walking-off-the-plank scene. Some of the jargon is outdated and can be hard to understand, but it is not impossible to get through. Minor Spoiler Alert for people who haven't read the book - don't read the rest of this review! Long John Silver is a terrific character, a more sinister version of the modern-day Capt Jack Sparrow. He is an interesting repository of moral ambiguity in a book otherwise populated by characters that fall clearly on the side of good or evil. I also really enjoyed how the regimented moral uprightness of Captain Smollett serves as a foil for Long John Silver. He is not such a fabled character, but he is an almost equal force in the novel and has the respect of all parties, even Silver himself. It was hard to believe he would ever consent to go on the cruise, since he seemed to smell a rat from the very beginning. Jim Hawkins, the main POV character, tells the story of his adventure with charming impulsive boyishness. A great read and a great story that still holds up today!
