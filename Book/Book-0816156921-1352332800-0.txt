review/summary: DRACULA by Bram Stokerreview/text: DRACULA by Bram Stoker as offered on Amazon.com as a free edition, is a delightful read. Since I like very descriptive prose, the details as seen through the eyes, thoughts and emotions of the characters create a suspenseful journey into the world of yesteryear hundreds of years ago. I read some of the critiques by some readers, and whether or not the "interpretation or modernization" of Bram Stokers original text was altered to their disappointment, that would be sad for they wouldn't enjoy this version.As for me, I am neither a literary genius nor am I a historian so this modernized English version (if that is what the critques say)works fine for me. I would rather comprehend what was being said and let the story tell itself with all the descriptive suspense, action, and lust that appeals to both men, women and anyone else who has always enjoyed a good Dracula "story". Actually, I don't mean to sound chauvanistic but the first encounter with the first three female vampires was totally and beautifully lustful.I'm not done with this book yet, since I've just begun reading but I look forward to more great reading until the very end.Would I recommend this book for a casual read? Droool, Droool, Bite, Bite, yikes, yikes, Ooooh my YES!!!Dracula by Bram Stoker stokes!!
