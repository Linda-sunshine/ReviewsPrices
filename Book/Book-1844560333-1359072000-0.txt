review/summary: Marvellousreview/text: Having seen the film and I think I have read the book before too, this reading absolutely took me into romantic bliss. Well worth the reread and I think I'll wait a bit before the next reading. But I will read it again. Recommended for anyone who has a slight romantic bone in their body.
