review/summary: A Mine of Informationreview/text: Benjamin Franklin is a household word. For anyone wanting to know exactly who he was and how he managed to accomplish so much, this is a mine of reliable information. However, the beginning and latter parts of the book are like a pile of notes published without even being divided into chapters. They do not reflect well on his capabilities as a printer/publisher. He seems like a self-absorbed person but one who is very anxious to share everything about himself that he can in order to help others. His is a model of a productive and surprisingly normal life. His adventures as a young man read like a historical novel. The book is an extremely valuable social history, with anecdotes stretching back to his ancestors who lived during Charles II's reign and had to conceal the fact that they read the Bible. I was disappointed that the book stops short of covering the period of the Continental Assembly and writing of the Declaration of Independence. It is not an easy read but it is unique and worthwhile. In contrast to the other biographies about him, this one comes right from "the horse's mouth".[...]
