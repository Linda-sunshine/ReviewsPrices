review/summary: It was good, but not his best workreview/text: So after seeing the movie I had to rush home to read the book. I haven't read it in a while. Upon completion all I have to say is the story is there, but it's really hidden. Me and my dad who are both Tolkien fans discussed it and we both came to the same conclusion. The movie is better. But this isn't a review for the movie. It was harder to feel like I was there in the Hobbit. One can tell that Tolkien has an amazing story going through his mind but he just doesn't quite convey it well on paper, but the reason for the four stars is that you can almost follow his thought process. I'll probably read it again sometime in the future, but it won't be for another ten years or so.
