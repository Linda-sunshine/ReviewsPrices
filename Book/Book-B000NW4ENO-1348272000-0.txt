review/summary: Scarlett is a pain in the neckreview/text: There are a few main factors that fed into how I reviewed the book:1. Scarlett is annoying, not that bright, pretty cruel, and not my idea of a great lady. She doesn't really change for the better and her violent reactions become predictable.2. The story is woven very nicely, though it is extremely verbose at times.3. Mitchell created vivid, interesting characters who were fun to observe (with the exception of Scarlett, at times).4. People rant and rave over it being a racist novel, which is, in a sense, true. It is a book written about a racist group of people during a racist period of history in an area that was known to be very racist at the time. It was interesting to see how unapologetically racist people could be, according to Mitchell's storytelling at least. The book, though, is not racist in the sense that it supports racism and bigotry. In fact, I walked away from this book with a heightened interest in learning more about what freed slaves endured during the years following the war. For me, the mark of a good book is whether it encourages further study and intellectual curiosity, which Gone With the WInd can do.
