review/summary: A magical bookreview/text: This is a magical book in more senses than one. I have not yet downloaded the Kindle edition but it would clearly be more convenient to carry around than the paperback. The book itself has a much more tightly focused story than The Lord of the Rings. (This makes me worry about the decision of the film-makers to turn it into a series of three feature films. There was easily enough material in The Lord of the Rings to support that treatment but I can't see how it will work for The Hobbit.) Anyway, for anyone who hasn't yet read it I cannot recommend it highly enough.
