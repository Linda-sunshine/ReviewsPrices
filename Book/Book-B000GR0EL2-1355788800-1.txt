review/summary: A Peek into the Past as Well as a Current Day Inspirationreview/text: I wasn't sure I would like this book but it has become my favorite, and one I will never loan-out or get rid of. What an inspiration! As well as being an historical non-fiction of the World War II era, it is also a spiritual lesson on how to hang on to your faith in a time of true crisis.
