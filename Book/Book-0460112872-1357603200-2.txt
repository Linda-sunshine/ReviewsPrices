review/summary: More than expectedreview/text: Believe it or not this was the first book I chose to read on my Kindle Fire. I've always wanted to read one of the old classics and so glad I read this one. Even though the language is a little old style, I found myself not wanting to put the book down. The dictionary feature was utilized numerous times and most helpful. The writer is very descriptive and the reader can easily visualize the characters, the landscape, everything. Read this book and allow yourself to be taken back to another time and place.
