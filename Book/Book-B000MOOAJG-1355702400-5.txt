review/summary: Not for the faint of heartreview/text: This is one of the best books I've read in a long time! It's a hard read especially at first, but hang in there because its worth it. This book will challenge you to think and it will challenge your beliefs. I am a born again Christian. I make that point because even if you are or aren't, you can get a lot out of this book. Ayn Rand was an atheist and its very apparent. If you can get past your argument against atheism, this book will give you insight into why some people don't believe. She had such profound insight into human behavior. These behaviors are found in everyone, it's just that Christians think they are hiding behind their self righteousness :-)....I found this book so incredibly relevant. If you're a hard charger who's ever worked for a big company where politics are over production, you will appreciate this book. I understand if some people would shun this book because of her somewhat whacked out philosophies, but that would be a disservice to yourself and the wisdom and insight found in this book.
