review/summary: Not the old one, but in brand new conditionreview/text: The only reason I marked this down was because the description was that it was a 1960's copy that was worn and beat up a little. When I buy used hardback I prefer that. Instead I received a brand new reprint. Still it is an excellent buy. It is that same edition, just minus the wear and tear. Weird thing to complain about I know, but still would've liked it slightly more &#34;loved&#34; Get this book now, after the movie trilogy comes out evryone is gonna jack the prices on this. Bought this to read to my kids.
