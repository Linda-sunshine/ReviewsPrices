review/summary: One of my favorites!review/text: I have had this book on my bookshelf for as long as I can remember. I don't even remember buying it, that's how long it's been. But, I recently got it for my Kindle so I could reread it prior to seeing the movie. I love a book that can take you into its world and keep you there, even when you are not reading it.I believe what Tolkien was able to do with The Hobbit and The LOR series is create a world we all hoped existed. Elves, goblins, dwarves, a dragon, and middle earth come to life and is a must read for all ages.
