review/summary: An Unexpected Book Reviewreview/text: In the various lands authors create J.J.R. Tolkien creates one of the best. The land of Middle earth is filled with many creatures and settings. This story is centered around Bilbo Baggins, a simple living hobbit with a big appetite (sort of like a modern couch potato). One day he is visited by his friend Gandalf, the wizard. Gandalf brings an interesting twist to Bilbo's life: thirteen dwarves on a mission.Bilbo decides to join them on their quest as their "burglar". Thorin Oakenshield is the leading dwarf. He has strong doubts about Bilbo being a real burglar, but sucks it up and lets him come. Once they set out on their adventure complications start: Bilbo complains about the lack of food (considering hobbits usually eat six meals a day) and Gandalf's random comings and goings don't help either.Somewhere along the way Bilbo gets stuck in a cave...alone (very different than being home alone). As he tries to find his way out he finds a gold ring. He picks it up, being the burglar he is. He keeps venturing through the dark, damp cave. He comes upon a murky lake. This lake is inhabited by an-uh-a...thing named Gollum. Gollum, with his extreme split personality called Sm&eacute;agol, have a game of riddles (lame!). If Bilbo wins Gollum and Sm&eacute;agol will show him the way out. Bilbo is shown his way."Adventure filled" doesn't cut the chase when describing this story. The action, complications, and escapes keep you reading. The songs may take up time, but they play an important part to the plot. Tolkien really keeps you on your toes.The Hobbit is the perfect beginning to the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. We learn to take opportunities and feed our since of adventure. Give poor Bilbo a chance: learn how it all began.
