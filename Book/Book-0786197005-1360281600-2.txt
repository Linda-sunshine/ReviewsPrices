review/summary: Different than John Carter, but I still liked it.review/text: After watching and enjoying the movie John Carter, I saw that it was based on A Princess of Mars.The book and the movie have a lot of character similarities, but the story is quite different.I must say that I enjoyed each and would recommend the book to anyone who is a reader and enjoyed the movie.
