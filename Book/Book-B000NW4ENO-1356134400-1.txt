review/summary: We're not worthyreview/text: OMG. How can you review probably the classic of all books ever written? No one has ever duplicated this magnificent book. When I was in high school, I stayed up all night reading it for the first time. I can probably recite it from memory at this point because it required re-reading every couple of years!
