review/summary: Always a classicreview/text: This was my third time to read this classic 19th century romance novel; as always, it was a delightful read. The witty banter, passion, and humor are expertly woven together to produce a story that is not only interesting, but riddled with new, interesting words and facts (this was where I learned what an entail was, long before Downton Abbey). I would recommend this to anyone!
