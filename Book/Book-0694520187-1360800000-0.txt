review/summary: Hawkbeak speaks: confusing and boringreview/text: I'm afraid to say that I actually couldn't even get past chapter three in this book. The author is garrulous and can't get to the point. For example, he will begin to describe a character but adds so much extra stuff that you forget what the subject was in the first place. Brian Jacques is a descriptive author who makes sense, unlike Herman. Also, the book is boring and I could tell it wasn't going to get better. If you want to read Moby Dick then check it out of the library.Good books I would recommendThe Redwall series by Brian JacquesThe Warriors series by Erin HunterSoul Surfer by Bethany HamiltonHawkbeakWindclan deputy
