review/summary: A Silly Premisereview/text: This book has been held up as a comparable to Orwell's 1984. It's not. Huxley is just trying to write about a lot of sexual intercourse and still get published in a previous era. There in no serious discussion of the societal woes that are the subject of the book until the final short chapter.
