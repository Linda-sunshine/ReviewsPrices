review/summary: Great Readreview/text: I should have read "Treasure Island" long ago, but it was worth the +/- 60 year wait. I loaded it onto my Kindle and read it when I had a few moments to spare. I was pleasantly surprised how deeply immersed in the book I became. I could almost smell the salt in the sea air. The characters came to life. This is a very well-written classic adventure story. My only regret is that I hadn't read it sooner.
