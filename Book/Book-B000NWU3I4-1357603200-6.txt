review/summary: I've Read the Hobbit 12xsreview/text: I have 3 copies of the Hobbit, including the paperback that travels with me when I'm re-reading it on the go. I downloaded this edition for my Kindle, the paperback is falling to bits, and I do love my KIndle. Child or Adult, this book is a book well worth reading when you would like some adventure.
