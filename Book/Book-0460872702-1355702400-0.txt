review/summary: The Best of the Classicsreview/text: To be honest, The Great Gatsby by Fitzgerald was the best of all of the classic novels I was obligated to read during high school. Gatsby sports an english accent which is splendid in its own right. Although written in 1922, this book is very far ahead of its time as today, many Yale grads decide to go into high finance similar to Nick's decision to learn about the bond business in New York. The novel shows young, impressionable high school students that hard work and a little elbow greece can put you anywhere you want to be in life, even if that position is into the higher echelons of society.
