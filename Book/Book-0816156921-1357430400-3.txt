review/summary: Not as illustrated as I expected...review/text: Okay ~ I am not reviewing Bram Stoker's Dracula, but if you must know, I hold Bram Stoker's Dracula right up there with the best of the best.However, please be advised this is a ABRIDGED version ~ Meaning, whole chunks are gone ~ granted, it's parts that somebody felt were not important, but who's really to say what is important or not in a novel? My thoughts are if the Writer put it there, the Writer felt it was necessary so I want to read it.Now, if you are here because of the word ILLUSTRATED ~Chapter 1 ~ map of TransylvaniaChapter 6 ~ Whitby Abby RuinsChapter 7 ~ Map of Great BritainChapter 13 ~ Map of LondonChapter 18 ~ A portrait of Vlad Dracula, Voivode of WallachiaChapter 20 ~ A nicely drawn map of central LondonChapter 25 ~ A map of Eastern EuropeAnd well, that's it. Now, I did like the illustrations and they were great, but I really expected more illustrations. This may be my own error, but because this book was not that illustrated, I am only giving it 3 stars. 3 stars because I did enjoy the few illustrations it does have and I had to take off for the abridging.
