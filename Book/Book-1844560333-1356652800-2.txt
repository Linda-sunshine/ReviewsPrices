review/summary: Beautifully designedreview/text: Admittedly, I purchased this collection of books not because I wanted to read the book, but because I am a huge fan of Jessica Hische (she designed the drop caps on the covers) and so I felt it really important to have them. I'm reading the books now too (they're great, glad I've got them to read as I find time) but the design is truly beautiful. The hardcover book has a gorgeous aqueous / soft matte coating, and it's almost as if the letters/ cover text are screened on top. Really beautiful. One should note that the page edges are also painted to match the color of the cover, so this book's page edges are red. The book is wonderfully typeset so it's very easy to read. I'm so pleased with my purchase. I've purchased A-F (the only ones available at present, and will undoubtedly purchase the entire collection. Not only will I have a gorgeous collection of books by one of my favorite designers, but I'll be reading classic works. There's nothing better!
