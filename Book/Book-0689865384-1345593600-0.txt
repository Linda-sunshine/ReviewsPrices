review/summary: A Nauseating Readreview/text: The Uglies, by Scott Westerfeld, was a nauseating read. The concepts were very juvenile, immature, and, quite frankly, unrealistic, the wording is horribly maudlin and simplistic, and the cover basically reinstated the fact that this book was just about some stupid fashion that shouldn't even have been written about.You cannot feel or understand the characters because of their insecurity and immaturity. And who likes to read these childish words, the first sentences of the book, an introduction to the sappy atrocity that this book is?"The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.Of course, Tally thought, you'd have to feed your cat only salmon-flavored cat food for a while, to get the pinks right. The scudding clouds did look a bit fishy, rippled into scales by a high-altitude wind. As the light faded, deep blue gaps of night peered through like an upside-down ocean, bottomless and cold.Any other summer, a sunset like this would have been beautiful. But nothing had been beautiful since Peris turned pretty. Losing your best friend sucks, even if it's only for three months and two days.Tally Youngblood was waiting for darkness."A nauseating first image, combined with silly metaphors, an addition of typical teenage jargon, small, unintelligent phrases, and an average dose of sickeningly naive romanticism.This book was utter rot.
