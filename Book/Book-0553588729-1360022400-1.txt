review/summary: great to read before you have your baby!review/text: This bok is great! Its very hands on and easy to read. I recommend it for all expecting parents! I especially appreciate the fourth trimester concept. I think this book is applicable to all babies but especially helpful for those that need more help in calming down and soothing.
