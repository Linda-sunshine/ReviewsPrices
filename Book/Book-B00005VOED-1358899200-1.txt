review/summary: The book "A Confederacy of Dunces"review/text: This book was mentioned on a TV program and sounded interesting. I don't believe I have ever read about or known such a disgusting, obnoxious, pitiful and intelligent character as Ignatious. The author certainly had a marvelous imagination...too bad he did not live long enough to see this book published.
