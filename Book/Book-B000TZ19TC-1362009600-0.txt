review/summary: Fahrenheit 451 Reviewreview/text: Fahrenheit was an interesting book to read. I am one who does not enjoy reading, but after seeing a roommate read the book I became interested. It has a good plot to it and it is not a very lengthy book. Because if this it makes for a very quick read and is great for those that do not have lots of time for reading. In the past I have read other dystopia novels such as 1984 and I did not enjoy them. I find them to be disturbing and rather boring to me. On the other hand I was able to keep focus while reading this book and I actually enjoyed it. It is good to finally read a dystopia novel that would not want to give me night terrors at night. I found the book to be helpful and made me think about what if these things were true in today's society. There are times when the book can be a little confusing and boring to read, but that is the same with any other book you will read. You just have to be patient and continue to read it through. Over all I thought this was an excellent book to read and I highly recommend it.
