review/summary: For Parentsreview/text: I decided to write this review after seeing the recently released The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey film.This version of the text, with accompanying illustrations, is a must for any parent who wants to ensure their kids read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings before seeing the movies. The movies are a blessing and a curse from a parent perspective: we want our kids to read the books and to enjoy the movies, but easy access to the movies may result in the reading portion being ditched. After reading this version, your kids should be able to tell you which parts of the movie(s)(more are coming out!) were accurate and which were not. The Hobbit, as a story, has a significantly lighter and more playful tone and plot than The Lord of the Rings. Young children will naturally gravitate toward The Hobbit (a quest to recover gold from a dragon is mighty tempting to any youngster) but illustrations give the text tangibility and will solidify retention of the story. Reading The Hobbit, particularly this version, is a great way to get your kids hooked on Tolkien before turning to the Lord of the Rings, which is a much more challenging text. Hope this helps if you're deciding whether to make this a family purchase.
