review/summary: Really enjoyed, but be aware it isn't the first in the seriesreview/text: I had not read any of Lee Child's work before seeing the preview for the upcoming Tom Cruise movie. I really enjoyed the preview and thought I would read the book before seeing the flick. So I bought it. I really, really enjoyed the book, but I was about halfway through the book when I thought that perhaps this was an ongoing character. Jack Reacher has been the main character is 17 books and counting! But I was disappointed to discover that this book was the ninth book in the series. Only disappointed because I wish I had started at the beginning. Nevertheless, despite being clueless, I loved the book, and I am planning to start at book one and work my way through the whole series. The character is very enticing and the plot was fun and hard to anticipate, which is part of the fun of this kind of novel. Great fun, quick read. Perfect for the beach, for escape, for fun.
