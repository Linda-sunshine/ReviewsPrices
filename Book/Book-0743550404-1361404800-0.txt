review/summary: The (not quite a) storyreview/text: Thank you, SyFy's Haven! You got me wanting to read this!Well, for a horror master, this turned out to be quite tame. No real horror at all (except cringe-worthy times of "reflecting" on a different area's accent) and, for an author not afraid of using any given cussword, this wasn't only mild in the lanugage department, there also wasn't much in the ratio as a normal King book I've read. But those are minor details.What's this about? 2 newspapermen tell a new woman about the most enigmatic case they've ever worked on, giving specific details (at times, overbearingly so) as to why it's so strange for them.I wish I could say much about this story, but unlike other novellas and short novels of his I've read (like Carrie and The Gunslinger), this felt lacking in King's potential storytelling method and style. Really, it's nothing but a story being told within a story, and not evenin the same way as the famous scene in Shakespeare's Hamlet, just giving detail;s, making snide references, checking that the men did certain investigatory details, make a couple jokes, but ultimately, no real resolve. So, the story's tagline felt misleading, but at least one good thing cam out of this novellum.It gave birth to a really good SyFy show, Haven.
