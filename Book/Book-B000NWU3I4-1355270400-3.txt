review/summary: Review on The Hobbit.review/text: I love this book! It's probably my favorite out of all the Lord of The Ring book series. It's absolutely brilliant! The main character Bilbo Baggins is funny, and just plain awesome. My favorite part in the whole book is probably the riddle challenge with Gollum. This is a book people are going to read over and over again. I sure know I will and that most of my siblings have already. The little stories that go along with the main one really add element to the book. I stayed up reading for hours then hours more thinking about what I'd just read. I was sad when it ended but glad at the same time because I got to start reading the next book.
