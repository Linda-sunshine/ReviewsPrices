review/summary: Truly visionaryreview/text: I am a fan of 1984 but I find this scenario that Huxley paints to be more likely in today's world. We are a society that entertains ourselves to death and the idea of controlling society through hedonistic desires is frightening because it would work so well. As long as the individual is getting what he or she wants, there is no reason to fight for these vague ideas of liberty. That's what I found so compelling about the book. Sure, there is a drug that is used to keep people happy and not thinking deeply, but the main controlling agent is that everyone is being distracted through games, through sex, through social events, and no one ever stops to think, they are purposefully prevented from thinking. It is quite a revealing book and makes me reevaluate the entertainments I indulge in.
