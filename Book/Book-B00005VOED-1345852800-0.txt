review/summary: Fascinatingreview/text: A Confederacy of DuncesBeing a literate WASP, I found this book to be an intriguing look at the balance between good and evil, right and wrong, and the related literary content within this book's varying shades of gray which have beleaguered me all my life. I found it insightful, well-written, and worthy of the Pulitzer Prize which it can count among its accolades.Keep a dictionary and thesaurus handy. Even with a well-developed vocabulary, you may find some of the antiquated word selection difficult to digest without some of the alternate contextual definitions used by the author. Subtleties within this text can be overlooked if one assumes the author's meaning of spoken or narrative words or colloquialisms are used in the modern context. Keep in mind the publishing date, and enjoy, as I have, so far.I am currently reading this book in small segments while riding the train during the commute, and highly recommend NOT reading the entirety of this book in only a few sittings. Digestion of each sub-chapter, with breaks between continuations, has provided me with more than a few hearty inner-dialogued chuckles and discoveries of subtleties giving new meaning to the continuation of the story. Had I not taken the time to really think about the previous readings, I would have missed a great deal of truly clever subtleties which, hopefully, will be validated in the final two chapters.Worth every penny, and a sack of gold to go with it.A Confederacy of Dunces
