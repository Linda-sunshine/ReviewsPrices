review/summary: Hystericalreview/text: Before reading this I was convinced that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Dr. Hunter S. Thompson was the funniest piece of English literature. I was mistaken. Next on my reading list is Joseph Heller's Catch-22. Read this and you will not be disappointed. May Fortuna smile upon you.
