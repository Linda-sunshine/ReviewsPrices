review/summary: All hail Edgar Rice Burroughs, the Pulp Fiction King!review/text: What a wild, fun, and creative adventure story! Of course, that's hardly news for Edgar Rice Burroughs fans. The whole Barsoom series is a great read, as are many of the author's other works (i.e. Tarzan).One thing to note, though, is that these stories were not written to become classics or, honestly, even "literature." Burroughs wrote for the joy of writing, and then learned he could turn a nice profit from writing pulp fiction for cheap magazines. The stories are simple, often hokey, and far beyond belief. But really that's what makes "A Princess of Mars" and other books in the Barsoom series so fun to read!Don't pay any attention to the somewhat painful 2012 film version. This book is far better than that, and I recommend it for any and all fans of swashbuckling sci-fi adventures!
