review/summary: one long monologreview/text: OMG I cant believe i actually finished this book. It is a miracle that this book ever started the vampire crazzzzzzze...Sry i fell asleep writing this review of the most boring book I've ever read. The only reason i fought to finish it is to say i went through it . Like climbing a mountian..why because it was there.....Now to read something more interesting like my lawn mowers owners manual.
