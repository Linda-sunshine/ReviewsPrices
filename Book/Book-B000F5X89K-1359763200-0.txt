review/summary: The Old-School Coolreview/text: For those like me who had heard a lot about Frankenstein (book or the film) are in for a nice surprise.The monster isn't half bad as he is popularly conceived to be but may be a product of society and circumstances. I picked this book up to look for answers on the questions of identity and wasn't disappointed.Very interesting and definitely worth a read at least to understand the monster's perspective. And if you think its 19th century origin might be a turn off for our present generation of readers, well you will be surprised.For Mary Shelley knew how to keep up the excitement and of course the gothic appeal will have the 21st century reader turning pages with delight! :)Enjoy!
