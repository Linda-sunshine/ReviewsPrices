review/summary: So depressing. So Good.review/text: I really like this book. I can't even explain why. It's quite the downer and the characters make you frustrated, but I LOVE it. You really feel what the characters feel. You get frustrated for them. You pull for them when you really shouldn't. You want it to work out for them even though you know it's impossible. It's a love story without a happy ending, but also a twisted happy ending at the same time. Twisted is a good way to describe a lot of this book. But I loved it with all it's twistiness.
