review/summary: Not very racistreview/text: This was an excellent book. I love it. However, I was sceptical about it because other reviews said it was racist, though I found it not to be so. The "N" word is used almost every other sentence, though it's not to insult. Every person in the book said it, and not one said "African" or anything similar. It is used as a label, and nothing else.
