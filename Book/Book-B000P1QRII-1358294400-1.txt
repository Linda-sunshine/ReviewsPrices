review/summary: Left wonderingreview/text: I read this because my 7th grader will be reading this soon and wanted to be prepared. As a caveat to my review, it is important to mention that she is 3 yrs behind grade level and relatively immature for her age. It took reading half way through to get the "utopian" idea. Prior to that language could be tough to follow without knowing the theme. I would have enjoyed more time with the giver and the development of that relationship along with a more purposeful recognition of Jonas' realization of his community and parents. I realize this was written from Jonas' perspective, but she made me care about how the "community" would manage the memories and I felt I was left wondering. I did enjoy the story but felt there was more to say. I am not sure what she will make of the story as a whole. There are certain topics within the story that she will understand, with guidance, but I don't know how well she will grasp his "mental leaps" .
