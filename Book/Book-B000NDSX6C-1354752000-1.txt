review/summary: A choice - Book/movie/book/movie - MOVIEreview/text: I know that J.R.R. Tolkien is a wonderful writerBUT,Had I not seen the other movies, this book would have left me with so many questions.Like, why did Gandolf take Bilbo?Where was Gandolf most of the time?What did these creatures really look like other than being horrid?Why did Bilbo go?What was the purpose of the journey?What about the ring's importance, that is completely overlooked in this book?Does anyone else grow tired of non stop attacks/fighting?In the books that follow, Bilbo mentions all his travels, yet in reality, he only had this one great adventure?The last 20ish pages were really good, or else I would have given it 2 stars.Book/movie/book/movie . . . . Movie.
