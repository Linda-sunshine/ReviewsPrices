review/summary: 500 pages of ideas and action jam packed into 1188 pages.review/text: This book is at least twice as long as it should be. The ideas, though interesting, are presented in the least interesting manner I could possibly think of: by being repeated over and over and over and over and over. At one point you just want to scream at the book &#34;WHO *IS* JOHN GALT?!&#34; because you've wasted the past three hundred pages reading about the sex lives of industrial magnates and the state of the copper industry due to piracy.The characters that you don't hate, that is to say, all of the capitalists, just move so slowly that it hurts. If you want the ideas written about in the book, read one of the many, many commentaries about the book. If you want to read a bland novel with (admittedly many) flashes of brilliance, go head, but you've been warned.
