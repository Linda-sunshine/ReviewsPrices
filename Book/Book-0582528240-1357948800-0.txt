review/summary: Font is too smallreview/text: There is a reason the paperback Dover edition is $3 (green and black line drawing of a steamboat on cover) The font is way too small and the spacing between lines is non existent. Couldn't read more than a chapter without eye strain (and my high school son said the same). Not worth purchasing.
