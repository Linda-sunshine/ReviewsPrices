review/summary: Wuthering Heightsreview/text: Emily Bronte was a special author. Not only did her writng have the power to transport you to seemingly another world, but the memorable characters and personalities make Wuthering Heights a book to remember. The charming tale takes place in windswept England on a lovely castle. Told through a narrative of an old housekeeper, the story of love and hate take place first hand. While quite unsuspecting, Mr. Lockwood, a guest of Thrushcross Grange, visits, he hears the tale of the Earnshaw family who used to live in Wuthering Heights. In a tale of backstabbing, lying, cheating, love, and hatred, he hears the tale of Hindley and Heathcliff and their sibling rivalry along with their lover Catherine who marries Hindley but is in love with Heathcliff. At the end of the book, all members of the original family are gone, and Mr. Lockwood takes note of how quiet and peaceful the grange has become. The true charm of this book are the characters. The way in which they speak is charming and brings out personality. Emily Bronte had a wit an charm about her style of writing, something that is very apparent in Wuthering Heights. While filled with quite a bit of drama, Wuthering Heights is a book that will transport you to the old English estate country and leave you with a story in which you will find entertaining as well as charmming.
