review/summary: Classic imagination - soon to be brought to lifereview/text: Exit Darkness, Enter Light: Book One of the Earth CycleI have just read the Hobbit in time for the movie so it is fresh in my memory. Overall it is excellent although not as epic or deep as Lord of the Rings, but it was aimed at a younger audience. Bilbo is very much the reluctant hero and gets swept away on an adventure to slay a dragon with a band of dwarves. Alot happens in the novel and it is well paced. I like the interaction with the goblins and wargs. Tolkien's mythology is rich and detailed. I think this could have been longer as some parts feel glossed over such as the episode in the forest with the elves.Some find the ending unsatisfying but it was important for Tolkien to tie up the story of the dwarves; the squabbling over the treasure with the elves and men after the death of Smaug was realistic.I can't really see how this will justify three movies (2 is pushing it) but I am sure it will be fantastic. A shame Tolkien never lived to see his imagination brought to life.
