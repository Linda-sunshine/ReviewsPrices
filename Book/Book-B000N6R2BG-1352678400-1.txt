review/summary: "Perplexed at the Ending"review/text: This is the first Picoult book I've read, although I've seen two of the films based on her words: My Sister's Keeper and Plain Truth, and enjoyed both films. Keeping Faith is the first of her works I've read.I was totally caught up in the book. The POV -- shifting from 1st person to 3rd person -- took a bit to become accustomed to, but other than that, the book held my attention. As the trial got started, I literally could not put the book down.That said, I was disappointed in the ending. Maybe because I liked things to "wrao up" neatly. This surely did not wrap and nothing about it was neat. I have read 50-60 reviews from other readers, hoping to learn something from them about the ending. Without giving anything away, can anyone help me?What did YOU think about the ending?Thanks and happy reading.
