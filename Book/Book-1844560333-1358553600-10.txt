review/summary: review of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austinreview/text: I got what I paid for. I paid zero and I got a story written about 200 years ago. Pride and Prejudice is about a poor girl and a rich english noble. Not much of a plot, Will the girl become a princess? I do read love stories but they should have a interesting story plot.lee sullivan
