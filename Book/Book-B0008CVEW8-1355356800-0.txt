review/summary: Charming, to say the leastreview/text: To be honest, I began this book quite reluctantly as an extra-credit opportunity for my English Studies course. The first 20 pages or so had to be trudged through. But once through this beginning bit, the reader will find themselves delving into a seafaring world of adventure, piracy, and suspense. Progressively this book improves on itself the longer you read. For those interested in well written, enchanting books, this is one for you. All those who enjoy a minor literary challenge, requiring you to take a step back from time to time to reread a passage due to swashbuckling dialect and jargon, will find great fun in this novel. All in all, this book is deserving of the five stars I've rewarded it with. Highly recommend for younger, ambitious readers.
