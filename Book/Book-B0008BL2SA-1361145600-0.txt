review/summary: Little Women by Louisa May Alcottreview/text: A truly heart warming story. Even if you want to give up pretty please with cherries, sprinkles and every thing sweet. I suggest you keep this story in your heart forever. Read it over and over again. It is on the list of my favorite books. Every one in the world would love it, but if you don`t like it your crazy and need to love it with all your heart and respect.
