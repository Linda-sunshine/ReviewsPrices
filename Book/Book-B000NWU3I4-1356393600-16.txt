review/summary: read this bookreview/text: awesome book. i think everyone should read this book at least twice in their lifetime. this amazing book is basically about this hobbit who goes on an epic adventure (with dwarves!) to get revenge on an evil dragon who stole all their (the dwarves') gold.from this description you can probably deduce that this is a book worth reading. oh, and, GOLLUM! you'll get it when you read it.also be sure to pick up copies of the Lord of the RIngs series while you're at it.
