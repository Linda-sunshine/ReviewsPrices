review/summary: Excellent read!review/text: Keepying Faith is one of the best books I've read recently. The characters were well developed, and the mother's doubts and fears about her ability as a parent echoed many women's feelings about raising a child. It was a fast-paced story that i found hard to put down. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good, positive story with some depth.
