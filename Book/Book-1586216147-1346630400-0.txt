review/summary: A too, too charming fairytalereview/text: "Notebook" is an appealing fairytale. Two talented, beautiful people are in a land of magic. They are charmed into abandoning all for love. The magic of their love accompanies them even to their very old age, when she is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and he from cancer and stroke.But this fairy tale has a critical flaw. When they abandon all for love, Noah and Allie abandon *conscience* for love, with few ill effects. Allie, while engaged to Lon, sneaks away to look for her former lover (Noah). Forgetting questions of right and wrong, Noah and Allie give in to their desires and enjoy a thrilling time of beauty, love and lovemaking. It feels so "right." Allie, after hesitating, decides to marry Noah.This is the sort of thing that we wish would come true--in the wishes of our worst moments! Betrayal doesn't work in most fairytales, and it doesn't work in real life. Not really."The Notebook" is an appealing but sick fairytale. Such fairytales can fill our imaginations with sweet, deadly illusions and lead to tragic mistakes in real life.We are better off with Tolkien's marvelous "Ring" trilogy. Or the story of The Beauty and the Beast, where the heroine is pure of heart.
