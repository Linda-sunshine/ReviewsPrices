review/summary: Return to the original...review/text: So, finally finished this classic. I would say that it is surprising, and both better and worse than I expected, going in. It was surprising because of the ideas I had about both the novel and the monster (from various screen incarnations). I like to be surprised, and finding Dracula both weaker and more powerful than I had imagined, was fun. I am a huge vampire fan but have been jaded by modern vampires (and their fans).It was better than I expected/feared, in the way that it was able to still convey the horror, to me, today, even living in the horror-saturated culture I do. I thought the way it portrayed the quintessential vampire was refreshing in a world where everyone is reinventing the monster in their own image.I was disappointed but not surprised by, the limitations of the mid-late nineteenth century novel form. I was reminded of the worst of Emily Bronte, E. M. Forster, which is a plodding fascination with detail and a pace not suited to a modern life. The idea that each scene in a book should move the plot forward, is a fairly modern one and this book needed a good editorIn the end, I think it would be interesting and useful for modern writers to return to the original, or even the sources of the original, before they set out to re-imagine him. It seems to be they all re-imagine based on a copy of a copy and all the work if flawed and reads like cardboard tastes.Every vampire I see today began with Lestat, and not Dracula, in mind. Lestat (and his world) was brilliant, but not a place to start the imagining.
