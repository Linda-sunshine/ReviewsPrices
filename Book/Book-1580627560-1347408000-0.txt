review/summary: Applicable, humorusreview/text: Funny presentation of some very helpful, and true advice. I very much enjoyed the book, and only wished I had read it when I was younger, since I've had the wrong philosophy all these years. I've recommended it to several of my friends, and my 16 year old niece, of whom have also found it useful. Thank you
