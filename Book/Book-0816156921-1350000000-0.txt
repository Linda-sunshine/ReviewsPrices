review/summary: Oh Yah !!!review/text: I've seen the Bella Lugosi, Dracula probably 60 times, ( at least, so as not to exaggerate). These old scary movies were marvelous. I have even transcribed some of the script dialog to paper from the movie. This movie may be the reason why people are afraid of spiders and bats. Imagine, scaring the film audience with a rubber bat that you can see the strings.The book is fantastic. You'll want to read it more than once. If you like the Dracula movies it would be a shame not to read the book.
