review/summary: First read on the Kindle Fire HDreview/text: Although I, like so many other fans along side me, have already read this book before I can say it is nice every once and awhile to read it over again. With the fantastic imagery J.K. Rowling uses it has always been clear to me why this series was such a success.To add to this short review, I did state in the title that this was my first Kindle read. I do believe that 'normal' books will end up getting recycled to the nearest donation spot! What a way to read!
