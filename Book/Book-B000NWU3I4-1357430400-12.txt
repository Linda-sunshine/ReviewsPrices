review/summary: Best book of all time!review/text: I have read the Lord of the Rings many a time, more than I care to realize, and I thought that there would never be a better book. The Hobbit is the one exception, filled with adventure and fantasy. I would need pages and pages to write a review explaining it, but I can guarantee you one thing: don't rent the book, buy it, because your going to want yo read this again and again!Praise for Tolkien, the Magnificent!
