review/summary: Love this book! So simple yet so importantreview/text: Something you'd probably never think of, something so simple and yet something so important. Who would have thought we all speak love a certain way?! It makes so much sense, and I have been able to realise so many things from past relationships as well as my present one. I can now see how love languages came into play where we had butted heads or ended up in a stalemate with love and intimacy. We both needed different things to feel truly loved, a certain way - this book demystified why things kept getting stuck and why we didn't feel overflowing with love at times - despite the other partner thinking they were being loving.There is no doubt a book like this can save marriages. We aren't born knowing how to be great in a relationship, how to make sure our partners needs are met or how to work them out - what really makes them tick - but this can help. I recommend it to all couples I know.
