review/summary: A riveting explorationreview/text: Brave New World absolutely rocked me--it's the quintessential dystopian novel and a true classic. Set in a futuristic, atheistic world, it presents a truly horrifying nightmare vision of what society can become, a consumer-based machine that is completely mechanized and lacking humanity.It's hard to believe that it was written so long ago (it was written in 1931). It's testament to the author's incredible insight and almost eerie intuition, because I feel like there are many ways that our current society does represent his vision. Huxley had a deep understanding of societal issues and an extreme viewpoint of evolution. Brave New World is set at the Central London Hatching and Conditioning Center, where they develop a scientific process for cloning, that they call "The Bokanovsky Process." Embryos are developed to produce twins, and then put into different castes where they're conditioned to play certain roles in society until they're fully developed.The exploration of the "new world" Huxley creates so vividly is riveting--the setting alone is enough to keep you turning the pages. I did have some issues relating to some of the characters, though; I wish some of them had more dimension. The premise is so creepy and provocative and unique, it really makes you wonder if something like this could ever happen.Brave New World is very compelling and thought-provoking. Make sure you're ready to be disturbed!
