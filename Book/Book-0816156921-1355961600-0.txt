review/summary: The prototypereview/text: As obsessed as I am with vampires, I can't believe I didn't attempt to read Dracula, the prototype for all things vampire, until now. I enjoyed it, although, there were definitely some slow reading interspersed with key plot points; however, I now have a point of origin for the myths.
