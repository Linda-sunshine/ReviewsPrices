review/summary: The Hobbit - A Classicreview/text: What else can I say - this book is a classic. Sure it's Tolkien at his lightest and is the easiest entry into his world, but it's still a masterpiece and an amazing story. If you like this and enjoyed Lord of the Rings, then also check out Children of Hurin - a much darker vision by Tolkien.
