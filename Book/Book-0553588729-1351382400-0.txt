review/summary: Must read for new parentsreview/text: I enjoyed this book and suggest reading it BEFORE baby gets here. Unlike me who ordered it when he was 2 months old and I was desperate. The tricks/ suggestions in this book totally worked for our baby and he STTN at about 12 weeks. I was stunned. He's still a great sleeper and a happy baby!
