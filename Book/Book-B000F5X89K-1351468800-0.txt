review/summary: Well worth the read.review/text: This was a very thought provoking book--precisely the kind of book that I enjoy. It was a very short, quick read. Frankenstein's story and his struggles were tedious and sometimes boring, at least until his wedding night. Frankenstein's monster's story and struggles were fascinating, heart-warming, tragic, and horrific. Well worth the read to get into the mind of the monster of Frankenstein.
