review/summary: If you haven't read it...you simply must.review/text: I put off reading these books for years, but now that I've taken the plunge, I could not be happier! Book 1 is whimsical, funny, and heart-warming. Colorfully written with realistic dialogue and an impressive array of craftsmanship, &#34;Sorcerer's Stone&#34; is NOT just for children. Anyone who can appreciate magic, good writing, and all things imaginative will be glad that they picked up this book - regardless of their age or predilection towards perhaps more serious literary fare. I have already ordered Book 2 and am eagerly awaiting its arrival.
