review/summary: Christmas Classicreview/text: What an amazing story. As an English teacher, the no holds barred story penned by Dickens is essential to remember not only during the holidays, but each day before and after. My students remember the Muppets and Mickey Mouse versions, and while they are pretty good for nostalgic purposes, this read really brings about the true message of living with Christmas in your heart. To some people this may seem like a &#34;dark&#34; book, but that was the purpose; to scare the readers into the realization that there are consequences for our actions.
