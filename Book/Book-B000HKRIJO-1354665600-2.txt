review/summary: Lewis at his bestreview/text: Who am I to judge the quality of Lewis' work? Though the language is dated and very Brit, Lewis' explanations of his ideas are crystal clear and compelling. He may not incent conversion but he gives a damn good rationale for doing so. Would that our many diverse churches were as forthright and compelling in telling the Christian message. Compare his treatise to the many excruciatingly hard reads one finds in the typical papal encyclical; the latter being doctrinal dissertations, the former being a well thought out and smoothly presented argument. Well worth the time.
