review/summary: Very thought provokingreview/text: I really enjoyed this book. It was very thought provoking. There were times when it got a little slow but for the most part it held my interest and really made me think. Claire Danes as the reader was excellent.Could this scenario ever happen? I certainly would hope not. It's up to us not to let the world get out of control.
