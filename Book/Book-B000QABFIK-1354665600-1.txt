review/summary: Unconditional love is timelessreview/text: This book is timeless in it's appeal to the generations since it was written. I loved it as a teenager, and loved it even more as a grandmother. It shows how enduring the power of love is even though we have serious flaws. When we as children are loved unconditionally, we can grow to do great things,in spite of poverty and other adversities. We in turn learn to love unconditionally too.
