review/summary: Classic Picoultreview/text: Another book by Ms. Picoult that kept my attention throughout. I admire how she can turn current events into a riveting and believable story, the kind that makes any parent recognize the feelings and thoughts that the characters experience.I have every book she has written and was only slightly disappointed in one of her very early ones. I'm looking forward to her newest that will be coming out in early 2013!
