review/summary: Must read before indulging the Lord of the Rings Triology books or moviesreview/text: Wish I had read The Hobbit first before reading the Lord of the Rings triology books or watching the movies.The Lord of the Rings triology books and movies would have been so much easier to follow and appreciate.The Kindle version of The Hobbit allowed me to zoom in on the maps and pictures (using the View Notes & Marks feature of the Kindle), easily toggling back and forth from where I was reading along in the book. I was surprised how easy it was using the Kindle book version...easier than trying to flip back and forth using a paper back book version.
