review/summary: Great, classic storyreview/text: Little Women is about a time and a place that our generation knows nothing about. I'm 36, and the world today is nothing like the world when Little Women was written. It's a great story about a mother and her daughters, and their struggles and joys at a time when the country is at war and their father/husband must go off and fight. The story is filled with happiness and sorrow, love and pain.
