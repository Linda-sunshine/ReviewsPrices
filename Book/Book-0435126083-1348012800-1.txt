review/summary: Bronte sistersreview/text: The Bronte sisters have always seemed to come up as respectable classical female writers and as story telling goes, I will agree that they can tell a story. I have notice though, that their stories have the common denominator of detailing the ugliest side of humanity. Whether it is unconquerable cruelty or the amount of abuse it takes to break a naturally good spirit and turn it black with bitterness and spite, both Bronte stories that I have read dwell solely on the darkest aspects of life. The only silver lining in this story is that eventually perhaps, after enough suffering, fate will turn your hand. Eventually. Maybe.If that is your thing, you will appreciate and perhaps enjoy this book. As for myself, I prefer books that vary in sentiment. Sometimes happy, sometimes sad, sometimes crazy, etc.
