review/summary: READ IT AGAINreview/text: Did you have to read the Hobbit when you were in school? There is so much to this story that is missed when you first read it for plot, which is typically what is done when you read something for your High School English class. This time, enjoy a slower pace and drink in the awesome details and background to one of the jewls of the English language literature. The increidible journey of 13 dwarves and one hobbit, which became the spark and foundation for the Lord of the Rings, is rich in detail that will only enhance your appreciation for these amazing stories. This particular edition contains illustrations and passages, which are later linked to the Lord of the Rings. The illustrations are Tolkien's own and I was delighted when I watched the movie and found them come to life in the big screen. Have fun rediscovering the Hobbit.
