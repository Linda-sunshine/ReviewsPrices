review/summary: I wish I got this 25 years ago... I think they should teach courses on this in High Schoolreview/text: To think I stunted myself and created so many bad habits in communication by not knowing the basics of how to make others feel appreciated and important... I recommend this book. It's written very clearly and explains in easy to understand and easy to emulate steps, how to win people's confidence and loyalty, both as a customer and as an associate. A must for anyone who wants to go far in life. I'm ordering three copies for Christmas gifts. One for my lawyer, one for a friend and one for a favorite customer. I hope they don't take it personally, as though I doubt their people-skills... for that is not the reason I'm gifting them with this book. It's just because I feel they could benefit greatly by the skills outlined in this classic how-to book.
