review/summary: An effective relationship check inreview/text: I'll be honest, nothing in this book is rocket science. It was,however, a really effective tool for me to organize my thoughts. I really enjoyed most if the book. It was a quick read, it makes sense, and I particularly like the end of chapter questions and tasks. It's never a bad idea to check in on your relationship. This was a great tool to do just that.
