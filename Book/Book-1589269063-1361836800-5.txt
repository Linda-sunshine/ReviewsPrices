review/summary: Counseling for the penny pincherreview/text: I feel like this book has greatly helped me understand myself. I am trying to determine my husband's love language still however I am willing to do the 6 month experiment to find out. If there is something he wants me to do that will make me a better wife in his eyes I will do it. I have wondered for some time now if I should go to marriage counseling... it's expensive. When a friend of mine told me about this book I thought "why not?" Now I am glad I bought it and plan to pass this information along. I also plan on buying the one for children. I want to have a close and loving relationship with my children. I want to be the best mother possible. I think it will help in that area as well. Thank you.
