review/summary: Beware - Black and White illustrations!review/text: Though it is clearly stated in the product description, I didn't notice that the beautiful Rackham illustrations have been rendered into black and white until I got the book. This detracts a great deal from their charm, especially considering the quality of the reproduction, which is fuzzy and muddy. Otherwise the book seems to be well made. Dover has a paperback version which keeps the coloring. I wish that the publisher had popped for the color and charged more.
