review/summary: Correct the Coverreview/text: This story is a classic, astounding tale. However, the Kindle version's cover is that of Thomas Jefferson, or a highly similar portrait. I wish such a semblance could be corrected because it appears like a major mistake and lack of concern on the publishing end. Maybe this is just my opion but still, I thought someone should mention it. I highly recommend this story though!
