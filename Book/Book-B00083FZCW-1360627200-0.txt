review/summary: Really Goodreview/text: I loved this book (I recently finished the third one in this series) I think it is very origanal. This is the type of book you really can't put down. I dont remember once getting bored. So there are six kids who call themselves "The Flock" they are 98% human and 2% bird, so they have wings and can fly (which I think is really cool). They grew up in a place called the School where evil scientists make experament with DNA. They were some of the "mutants" in the School. But then they escaped from the School, and now Eracers, another DNA experament, half wolf half man people, are trying to caputre them. Angel, one of the flock is captured and sent back to the School, and the rest of the flock, Max, Fang, Nudge, Iggy, and Gazzy have to rescue her. It has some humor, but its pretty funny humor. Lots of people said it didnt have a complete ending, which I think is somewhat true, but it was a good enough ending for me.Now there were minor things I didn't like. First of all, this book makes science look bad, and science is not bad and is very important. The other thing is the names, I mean Maximum, Fang, and Angel are great names but Nudge Iggy and Gazzy? Really? And Jeb too. I thought Jeb was sort of a wierd name. Nudge's real name is Monique, they could have just stuck with that, where did they get the name Nudge?
