review/summary: Anyone who has ever enjoyed a Dracula movie should read this classicreview/text: Not as great a novel as Mary Shelley's &#34;Frankenstein&#34; but fun to read. Here are ill-fated Lucy, her friend Mina and her husband Jonathan, and, that scourge of vampires, Prof. Van Helsing. The story can be irritating at times. For example, when Van Helsing holds back information or plans from his vampire hunting partners, it doesn't seem to make sense, and I'm not sure that the story requires it. But it's Bram Stoker's story!
