review/summary: A tedious beginning, but fairly rewarding conclusion.review/text: It's no Pride and Prejudice, mainly because the style is strained and nearly unbearable for the first ten or twelve chapters. I could sense the writer struggling against writer's block or imagination failure or something, and it took forever to plod through the staggering, wordy, pieced-together writing of the first third of the book. I doubt it would ever have made it past the slop pile nowadays. A second or third draught might have been a good idea.Anne was very wise and introspective, and while it works great later in the story, in the beginning, I came about half an inch from reaching into the book and cuffing her a good one. Seriously, quit with the pity party Miss Elliot and quit sabotaging yourself.Seems that there were quite a lot of serendipitous plot engines, too. I had a wee bit of trouble suspending my disbelief in some of the more convenient circumstances that occurred later on, and while a little bit of coincidence is never a bad thing, when multiple instances of situations reading like they were manufactured with the express purpose of working out something mentioned no more than two pages (or paragraphs) back, I start to feel like I'm being forced at gun point over a rickety bridge of plot points rather than being gently guided along a carefully crafted path of meticulously arranged thoughts to the inevitable, but still rewarding conclusion.If you have to read this for some strange reason, I'm sorry for you. You'll have to commit to the beginning. If you're reading for leisure, suffer chapters one and perhaps two, then skim the next eight or ten. You won't miss too much, and the writing becomes much more tolerable thereafter. And, if I'm wrong and you find yourself lost, skip to the last three chapters, because they're all anyone ever read this book for to begin with, and you'll get a fairly good summation of it therein.
