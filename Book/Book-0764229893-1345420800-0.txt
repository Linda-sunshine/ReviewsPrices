review/summary: I lost sleep over this bookreview/text: This book had me from the start. The details bring you to a time and place so flawlessly. The story has a huge correlation to our society now and the way we follow the loudest and most powerful instead of what we know is right in our hearts. You will be touched by this book and want more with the turning of each page.
