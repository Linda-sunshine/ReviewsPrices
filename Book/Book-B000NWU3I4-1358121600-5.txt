review/summary: This book changed my life many years agoreview/text: I first read this book when I was about 16 years old in the early 1970's. Back then it was mind blowing. It was the first of it's kind inventing a new world and a whole new language. Of course it is a timeless fairy tale. One immediately falls in love with 'hobbits' and can easily imagine the world in which they live. Children as well as 'big kids' will love it. I cannot believe there are so many still in this world who have not read it yet? Go on, get it!
