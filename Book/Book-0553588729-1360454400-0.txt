review/summary: Solid advicereview/text: Reading the advice in this book give parents ideas to help calm and sooth an infant.It is straight forward, easy to read and the ideas are things all of us are able to do.It's early days with our baby so time will tell if everything (or many things) actually end up working. So far so good.
