review/summary: the book that started it allreview/text: I have loved Bram Stoker's Dracula since I was in high school. I reread thi sbook at least once a year and it never gets old. This book is what got me hooked on the vampire genre and led me to Anne Rice. I love how in this novel the vampires are dark, evil and soulless unlike those shiny vampires. If you love a good vamp story in which they are not the good kind then you will love the original vamp that started it all.
