review/summary: Literature classicreview/text: I gave this book only 3 stars because I didn't consider it enjoyable reading. I'm sure some will glean much from the writing style of the author. It might be of interest to some to make a study of the different characters and try to figure out what made them as they were. With that said, most likely, to most everyone else this book would be rated with at least 4 stars. For myself, I was really glad to finish it and move on.
