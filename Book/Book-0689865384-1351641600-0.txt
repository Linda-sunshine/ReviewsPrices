review/summary: One of the Bestreview/text: My class started reading this book together. I realized how much I loved it and so I could not possibly resist reading ahead.Tally started off as an average Ugly missing or New Pretty friends. Then she met Shay and was lead into a life of, following akward clues, falling in love, betrayal, which made this book an interesting, adventure full, life, story that I recomend for mostly young adults butother ages too. I will be readig the next four books, Pretties, Specials and Extras. I can not wait to find out what Tally Youngblood's life becomes.
