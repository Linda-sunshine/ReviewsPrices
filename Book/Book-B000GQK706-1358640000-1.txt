review/summary: Built-in reference links (Kindle)review/text: All three books in one (cheaper than all three separately).I've noticed that when certain character or place names are mentioned, you can examine the underlined reference that gives you the page numbers of where this name is mentioned.Tolkien has thousands of characters and I can get the names mixed up. Nice perk for the kindle version.Other than that, best way to get the whole LotR trilogy for cheap.
