review/summary: Eye-opening real hellpreview/text: This is one of my favorite books because it helps me understand how to grow relationships. It applies to spouses, children, employers, employees - anyone you have a relationship with. I have found when people feel loved/appreciated they give their best effort, are willing to work out compromises, and have a sense of belonging. I would recommend this book to everyone, but especially people who supervise other people.
