review/summary: The number 1 suspect in a mass murder says, "Get Me Jack Reacher" and then shuts up.review/text: This story is vintage Reacher. The good guys led by Reacher must get past a dupe to find the bad guys deep in the shadows. For those who like to finger the villain early in a mystery, this book offers a twist - you meet the puppet master about mid-book but then have to figure out how Jack is going to bring him down. Don't fret about him settling down, Lee has him headed for the bus station even before the final mess is cleaned up.
