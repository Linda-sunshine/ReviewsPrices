review/summary: A Monumental Work of Fantasyreview/text: I have to admit that I first tried to read this and the Hobbit forty years ago. I simply couldn't get my brain around it. My interest was rekindled by Peter Jackson's movies, yet I resisted. Finally, as the release of the first Hobbit movie approached, I picked up the copy that's sat on my shelf gathering dust for nearly thirty years. I was hooked and immediately ordered this single-volume edition. I'm now a complete Tolkien fan. I spent a lot of time reading fantasy, and I can honestly say that Middle-earth is the most completely realized fantasy world I've ever experienced. It simply comes to life in Tolkien's capable hands. I'm usually ready for a book to be over by the time I'm finished reading it. In the case of The Lord of the Rings, I was sad that it was over. I wanted more, and I will have to continue reading about Middle-earth. This is the highest praise I can offer any book.
