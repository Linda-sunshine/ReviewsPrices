review/summary: A Timeless Classic - Worth the Time it takes to get through itreview/text: This should be required reading for every high school student in America.It explains capitalism vs socialism in a way that forever leaves an imprint upon you.Before reading this book, I had a vague notion that capitalism somehow makes the world work, but I didn't have a good way to put it into words. Atlas Shrugged answered all the questions I had and drove the point home in a way that I will never forget. The style is fiction, and Rand uses her story to entertain you and educate you at the same time.Granted, this book is huge and it will take you as long to read it as it would take to read 10 books of conventional length.That is, in my humble opinion, the only legitimate gripe of this book. Sometimes the author takes 50 pages to explain something that could be explained in 5. Nevertheless, it is well worth the read. I recommend it above almost all other books.
