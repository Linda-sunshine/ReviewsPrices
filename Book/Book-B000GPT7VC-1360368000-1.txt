review/summary: Not Who I Thought He Wasreview/text: I don't know why I'd not read this book, but I'm glad I did. The &#34;Uncle Tom&#34; connotation has a whole different meaning to me now. It means resilience, strength, long suffering and peace, not the &#34;yes me&#34; it is known for today. Slavery will forever be the sad, destructive reality to not be repeated.
