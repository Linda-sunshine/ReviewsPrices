review/summary: Relationship 101...review/text: Being back in the dating game,I was the one that gave and gave and got trampled on..I thought nice was a good thing but I learned alot from this book. You can still be nice but I had to learn that my life didn't revolve around his life and that I had one to... This book pointed out alot of the things that I was doing and to my amazement I tried out a few of the points they made and it works...I no longer sit around waiting for a text or phone call. And hes showing more interest when I say I have other plans....
