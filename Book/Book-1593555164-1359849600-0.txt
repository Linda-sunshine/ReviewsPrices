review/summary: I liked it a lotreview/text: This was my 1st Lee Child/Jack Reacher. I listened to it on a book tape. I liked it so much I proceeded to buy the rest of the books available. I naturally had to go see the movie, which was a disappointment, and then I wanted to reread the book to see how they compared. I would truly recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it and those of you that have....give it another go.
