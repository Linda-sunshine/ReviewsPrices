review/summary: The book that started it allreview/text: I was 15 the first time I read this book. You know how the teachers are always giving you books to read and report on, &#34;Of Mice and Men&#34;, &#34;The Great Gadsby&#34; and so on. I figured this was going to be one of those. Instead it started me reading and I haven't stopped. I am so excited to see it out again.
