review/summary: Probably one of the best books about coping with serious misfortunereview/text: This is one of the most important books I've read this year. It definitely gives a philosophical and psychological perspective onto how humans can cope and survive almost anything by establishing or finding a meaning to their lives. The first part, which deals with life in the conecntration camps, is for lay people. The second part is more targetted towards psychologists or psychiatrists and can get a bit dense.
