review/summary: slow pacedreview/text: So in the past I've read many books like this but I just don't have the willpower to finish reading this one. it is still unfinished right now and I have absolutely desire to finish it. I believe the story is really slow paced, I don't see the connection between the two, and the story didn't provoke anything at all in me that made me curious as to how it ended. over all I give this book a big thumbs down.
