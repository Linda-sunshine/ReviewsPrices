review/summary: Revisit the hobbitreview/text: While the Hobbit is written in a very different style than the Lord of the Ring, Tolkien timeless classic, it is still a fun read. Written in a style and tone suited best to juvenile readers, it still has a great charm to it for the older reader. This was my first reread since the 70s but none of magic of the tale has diminished.
