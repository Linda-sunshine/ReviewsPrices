review/summary: A classic that only gets better with agereview/text: A true good versus evil story and what is best about it is the hero isn't always the typical hero and is often makes the decision most of us would make in difficult situations. The best thing about this Hobbit book was the illustrations. I have a 6 year old and and 8 year old that I am reading these stories to and most of the illustrations in other books are pretty simple drawings. These illustrations are ones that you could look at for quite some time while dad was reading because of the detail they have in them. I will purchasing the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the next few months and the only ones I will be buying now are the ones illustrated by Alan Lee.
