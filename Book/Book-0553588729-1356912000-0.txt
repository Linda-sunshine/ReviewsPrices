review/summary: Good information for young infantsreview/text: This was a good book to read because we're new parents. I was hoping that there was going to be more information than just the 5-6 tips to making out baby happy, but the 1 or 2 things I hadn't heard of where worth learning and trying. We do really have one of the happiest babies, which isn't entirely because of the steps we used from this book. It was worth the read.
