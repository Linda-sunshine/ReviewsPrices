review/summary: Magicalreview/text: I have read the paper version to the point that it fell apart.The electronic version will last longer and its still pure magic. Tolkien really created a classic that is timeless and so full of situations to create in your mind.I am looking forward to the film as The Lord of the Rings series was in some cases better than I could imagine.There is a quality feel about the Hobbit that I miss in the Harry Potter books. (They are great too)Read the Hobbit now, before the movie comes out as it will give you all the background to enjoy the visual version even more.
