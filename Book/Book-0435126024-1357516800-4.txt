review/summary: Beautiful empowering storyreview/text: I never read this growing up and I had no real idea what it was about but just as you grow up and hear about Romeo and Juliet or other things that people around you refer to at times, I had heard of Jane Eyre in passing. I always wanted to go ahead and read some literature and some classics but didn't know where to start so out of the blue I saw a message in email one day that Jane Eyre was free so I downloaded it and began to skim through it. I ended up reading it right away and devouring it. I absolutely loved this story and the writing was so beautiful and thought provoking and I immediately thought to myself &#34;THIS is what a writer should 'sound' like&#34;. I want my daughter to read it because I take away from the story that it is okay to be yourself, to be humble but proud of being who you are. To be true to yourself and be strong and though difficulties come your way, you can and will get through them. I wish I had read it when younger and had made it a part of my references as I grew and to have it to fall back on in my mind but I didn't but I am sure glad I have finally read it and now I look forward to also watching a movie about it that I found :). I know it won't ever be as good as the book was but I will watch it anyway and probably - I may even read the book again!
