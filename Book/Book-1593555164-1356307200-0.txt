review/summary: My review of Jack Reacher: One Shotreview/text: I enjoyed the book immensely Jack is my kind of guy, but I never could figure out where he got his money for food, lodging & other expenses. If it's from his savings where did he keep it under his pillow? Also, picking Tom Cruise for this character is terribly miscast.
