review/summary: Great Literary Classicreview/text: As I have said before in other reviews, I am not much of a past tense or old-school fiction reader, but I must say that Charles Dickens is very descriptive. Although hard to understand at times, if you have access to the dictionary on the Kindle or Internet, this is yet another tool to help expand on your vocabulary and reading comprehension. Furthermore, I always wanted to see what all the rave was about as far as every play that has been performed in high-schools throughout the country. Now I can understand. Although Oliver Twist experienced some rough times, and was an Orphan and left motherless, I suggest you read if you don't believe that Charles Dickens does do happy endings. You will not be disappointed.
