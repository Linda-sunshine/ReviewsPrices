review/summary: re-reasreview/text: I am re-reading all the Jack Reacher novels I can find on Kindle. He is one he bes characters Mr Childs has written about. Who wouldn't like the 6'5&#34;--220# hitchhiker with thre free will and smarts he has. Was one of my favorites long before there was a Kindle. Now I need the enlarged print that kindle can give me and I'll keep reading any that are put on Kindle.
