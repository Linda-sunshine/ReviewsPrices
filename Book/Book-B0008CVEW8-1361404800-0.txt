review/summary: What a good book!review/text: I had never really thought about reading this book until my teenage daughter was looking for something to read, and I recommended she try it. She told me what a good book it was, so I had to read it myself. The story moves along very briskly, is an easy read despite being written so long ago, and was a real page-turner. No wonder it's become a classic! I had always thought of it as a &#34;children's&#34; book, but it's got enough heft that adults will enjoy it, too.I was so impressed with Robert Louis Stevenson's writing that I next read &#34;Kidnapped.&#34; Another excellent book, and a real eye-opener about Scottish history that I was unfamiliar with. Do yourself a favor and read them both.
