review/summary: Best Book Everreview/text: This has been my favorite book since I was a child. The book is so much better than the movie. I encourage anyone who has only seen the movie to make sure they read the book.The story starts out with a young Scarlett. She is a spoiled young woman who has never had to work for a thing in her life. She is different than many girls her age, because she thinks for herself. The setting is one where women were still property and a womans role in life was to be a wife and mother. Women didn't need any more ambition than that.Throughout the story, we watch as war changes Scarlett's life forever. Never does one scene happen in a battle, but you can feel the impact of the war in the various characters during the story. The author, Margaret Mitchell, gives us insight into the personal history of other characters in the book. This helps us to understand their motivations.The Scarlett in the book shows her human side more than the one in the movie. In the book it becomes obvious that Scarlett was doing the best she could to survive a terriable situation the world thrust upon her. In the movie, she seems like just a selfish b****. More than one scene in the book brings tears to my eye when I visualize what Scarlett was going through.
