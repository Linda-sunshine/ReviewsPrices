review/summary: Interesting story goes on and on and on.....review/text: The story is sometimes fantastic. There were moments where I was genuinely enthralled and couldn't put the book down. However, the books prose sometimes comes off as a diatribe and the most persuasive elements become increasingly repetitive.Forgetting the political undertone, which I happened to find interesting and not without foundation, the book could have been written 400 pages shorter and wouldn't have left out any important details.
