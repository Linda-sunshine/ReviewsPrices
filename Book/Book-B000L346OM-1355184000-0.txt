review/summary: In case you are looking . . .review/text: Superlatives are inadequate to describe the power and relevance of this small book. Framed in a specific historical reference(The Holocaust), that we all know well, still the significance of human experience, suffering and endurance is deeply accessible to me, here and now in this reality of 21st century catastrophic climate, cultural and geo-political conflicts and swaths of soul-numbing entitlements . . . where we still hunger for meaning.
