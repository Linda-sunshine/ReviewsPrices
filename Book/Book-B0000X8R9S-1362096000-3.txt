review/summary: My Reviewreview/text: A good story, well written. Easy to understand and be sympathetic with the boy and his effort to survive..Clear discriptions and thoughts without vulgarity. Most of our writers today would not have enough words to constitute a &#34;book&#34; without being crude. I am one of those who believe that those who have filthy mouths and/or filthy pens have not only a poor vocabulary but a filthy mind. For instance, I have just gotten into another book I purchased; &#34;Resuscitation&#34;. After turning about 10 pages the two major players, an MD and a law student, can't speak English, which tells me the author cannot.One of the good things about the Kindle is that such books can be quickly deleted!
