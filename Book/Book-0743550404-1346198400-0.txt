review/summary: Stephen King tries to be Jerry Seinfeld, and fails.review/text: I understand the experiment Stephen King had going with this book. "Is it possible to write a book about nothing?" The answer, at least in this case, is a resounding NO. Mr. King tried to write a book who's merits stood strictly on the narrative. As he repeatedly said throughout the book, there is no story. "There is no through-line." It is a highly unsatisfying book, not because there is no solution to the mystery, but because there was barely any mystery. It was so mundane. At no point did I really care to figure out the mystery. If Mr. King had given me something to sink my teeth into, then maybe I would have been interested and I would have gotten involved. Instead, I finished the book, just to finish it. As the kids say, EPIC FAIL.
