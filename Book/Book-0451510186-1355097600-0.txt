review/summary: Amazingreview/text: This came out in a series of hard back &#34;horror&#34; novels. I love them all. The stories (Dracula, Frankenstien, Dr Jekyl and Mr. Hyde and Dorian Gray) are amazing but so are the hard foe leather books with shiny inlays and great cover art. They made a great gift for any book collector.
