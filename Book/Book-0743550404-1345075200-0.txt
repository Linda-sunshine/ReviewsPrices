review/summary: A Stephen King mysteryreview/text: "The Colorado Kid" is a mystery written by Stephen King. The three main characters are two older men and a young woman, all newspaper reporters, and the story is told through a conversation between the old-timers and their young employee.Years before, and unsolved mystery took place in their small New England town. The Colorado Kid was found propped up beside a trashcan on the beach, a piece of meat stuck in his throat and likely what killed him. The unsolved case sparks theories as to what happened, why he was found thousands of miles from his Colorado home, and if he suspected what was coming his way.I'm a huge fan of Mr. King and loved reading this story. [I hope others won't be upset that it isn't in his usual horror genre and will enjoy this novel for the great read it is.]
