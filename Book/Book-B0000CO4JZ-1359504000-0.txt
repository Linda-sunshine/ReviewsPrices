review/summary: On &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34;review/text: In the struggle among the ones who criticize and the ones who praise &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34;, I enroll myself with the second group.The style is so clear and the language is so accurate that it explains why this Fitzgerald&#8217;s novel has been taken five times to the cinema since 1926.
