review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!review/text: I purchased this book for my high school lit class and found it to be a huge rip-off. Besides lacking page numbers, the opening epigraph, and consistent formatting, the copy is also printed in an extremely small font, making it quite difficult to read. Save your money and buy one of the other versions of this book!
