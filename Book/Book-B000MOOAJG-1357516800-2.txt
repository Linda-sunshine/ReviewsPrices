review/summary: I adore this book, my paperback copy was so well read it was falling apart.review/text: This is probably my most read book of all time. I finally bought the Kindle version; I also have it in paperback and hard back. There are a few typos and punctuation issues in the digital copy, but nothing so severe that it makes it unreadable. For some reason, it stumbles over Wayne-Falkland Hotel every time.It's nice to have a digital copy that I can highlight and bookmark portions of, without resorting to highlighter and notes in the margins. For that convenience, I'll tolerate a few typos.
