review/summary: unfinished assignment...review/text: As i'm sure is the case for many a young student i was assigned to read this book in high school and of course i read the first to chapters and quickly place the book don't and picked up a video game controller. After finally completing the book i can't help but feel like i've filled a hole in my literary knowledge. This book is certainly still, if not ever more relevant as we continue to make choices that determine the direction of our society.
