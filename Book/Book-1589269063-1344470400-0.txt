review/summary: this has been great, lots of good insightreview/text: So my husbands work sponsors marriage retreats now and then and they USE this book for almost all of them, and i was having a hard time understand why he had been acting so negatively lately, which caused me to be a HUGE B*&!H, and we just kept going in circles. Well i read the book and LOVED it, the 1st 2 chapters are more of an introduction but the rest of the book is GREAT, so great in fact we downloaded the audio version(Mens Edition), so we could hear it and sit together to listen to it. He may have save our marriage who knows if that rotten circle continued how many more years we would have really been married with out it.
