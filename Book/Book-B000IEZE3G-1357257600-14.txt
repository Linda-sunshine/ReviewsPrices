review/summary: Welcome to Hogworts.review/text: Well, this is the book that first kicked it all off. It was a pretty easy read and no one can deny Rowling's creativity. Harry Potter, who is an abused child has nothing good in his life and suddenly he is confronted with the choice to go off to a magical school for those with magical gifts. The school has it's own bank, sport, unique, classes and much more. It is very easy to be drawn into the 3 main characters in this books which will motivate the reader to work their way through the rest of the series. This book is not as dark as some of the ones that come after it. It does introduce us to Voldemort but he is weak in power at this time but Harry is marked as his ultimate enemy. Rowling's style of writing is rather bouncy and fun. She adds a good taste of humor to a complex story...such as Harry's aunt and uncle's house getting bombarded with owls trying to deliver a message. I would say this book is enjoyable for people of all ages. It is fantasy meets modern day.
