review/summary: Unfortunately surrealreview/text: I read this book in a few hours over the course of a day. Its contents are hard to accept as true events, so to honor what the Jews went through, I constantly remind myself that this is a true story. That's the only way to acknowledge the strength of the Jews and the inhumanity of the Nazis. There is a passage near the end of this memoir where it hits me: the transformation these people underwent to survive...stripped of their humanity. Because no one in a peaceful, humane place could imagine making it through these horrors. Only when you are in those moments do you realize what you're capable of...and that's what touched me most in this story--the brutality and horror of this transformation, yet it's the very thing that got some of them to the end.
