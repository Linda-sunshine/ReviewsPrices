review/summary: A Poignant Readreview/text: Keeping Faith is a very poignant and well written book. While it does speak to the issue of God, and what each of us believes that to be or not to be, I think this is mostly a book about the relationship between mothers and daughters, and to a minor extent, between fathers and daughters. To what extent would you go to protect your daughter or to let her know you believe her and have faith in her? Would you be willing to go as far as to have others question your sanity and not just that of your daughters? Good side issues in this book include the workings of the hierarchies in the Catholic and Jewish faiths, the workings of the mental health system and the workings of the judicial and legal systems. This book makes you think on many levels. I would highly recommend it.
