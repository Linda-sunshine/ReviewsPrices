review/summary: Disappointed, Expected Morereview/text: In Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand portrays a dystopia, plagued by corrupt politicians and business leaders who promote a communist/socialist set of laws that rob hard-working people, especially the super-talented giants of industry, of the fruits of their labor. These are hard-working who ask nothing except that they receive rewards for their efforts. Several things bother me about the book. The redundancy is a problem. Ayn Rand says the same thing over and over and over again. She is so didactic--preaching, not telling a story much of the time. The ideology is troublesome: the worship of God has been replaced by the worship of money. Capitalism, unchecked, is the desired goal. The heroes, we are led to believe, are self reliant people who reached success through nothing but their own efforts. All this is unrealistic. Money does not make people happy. Capitalism without regulation does not work and people only reach success with the help of "a village" (their genes, their parents, their teachers, coaches, schools, luck, etc.). It is hard to believe that this book inspired so many people like vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan.
