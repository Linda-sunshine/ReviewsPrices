review/summary: This book will put your own life into perspectivereview/text: Attempting to understand how anyone could endure the holocaust without giving up hope is of itself almost unfathomable. Yet Frankl, through his own direct experience, shows us how to find meaning through assisting others, thereby creating the purpose to continue on despite the suffering.In the second part of the book, Frankl then goes on to demonstrate how Logotherapy can be used in so many of the situations we inevitably encounter in our lives; from terminally ill relatives through to a reason to get out of bed each day and make a difference to the people around us.This book will put your own life into perspective, and will make you see the world in a vastly different way. Well worth reading.
