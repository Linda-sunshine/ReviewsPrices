review/summary: A Seminole book for all timesreview/text: Many others have done a great job reviewing this book so I will only add a couple comments. Beyond the writing, the insights and perspective on attitude, choice, freedom, judgment and the influence of circumstances is poignant and riveting. This is one of those books which seeps into your soul and alters your behavior and the perspective with which we see others.
