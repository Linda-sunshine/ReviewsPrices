review/summary: Great Versionreview/text: An unabridged version of a classic Holiday novel. While it is still a small novel, at 80 pages, it offered great insight to Dickens storytelling skill. While most people are familiar with the story, this version included new portions that I have not seen in film or television specials. At a great price you can easily purchase this Holiday classic knowing that you are getting the best version possible. There are added benefits to this version. Included are notes, glossary and definitions of terms that are not common in the 21st Century.
