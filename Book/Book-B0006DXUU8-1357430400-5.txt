review/summary: A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickensreview/text: I used this book as an ancillary text for my CAHSEE (California High School Exit Exam) class. Even though it presented some difficulties, comprehension and vocabulary issues, the students felt very proud that they could read this classic and know the story along with so many others. Most of the class had never heard of The Christmas Carol, so I was excited to share it with them. I used study materials along with the novelette, and then showed the Jim Carrey version to help them visualize the events, etc.. It is a classic for a reason, and I never fail to get new insight to the tale as well as the Dicken's characters.The only suggestion I would make would be to add illustrations. That's the only reason for the &#34;okay&#34; rating.
