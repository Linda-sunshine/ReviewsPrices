review/summary: Amazing, hilarious, thought-provokingreview/text: I love this book. Quixote-like, a self-taught medievalist who lives with his mother battles corruption at home, at school, and in the cinema. Then he is forced -- kicking and screaming -- to enter the world of business. Its an amazing ride.
