review/summary: Classicreview/text: Orphaned Jane is abused by her aunt and her cousins until she is sent away to boarding school, a place her aunt is certain will be the death of Jane. But Jane lives. And thrives. And having made a success of her life away from the abuse, she applies for a job as a governess. Her new employer harbors a dark secret that Jane doesn't learn until her wedding day - a secret that threatens to change her life forever.Written in an older world style with &#34;million dollar words,&#34; one can excuse the sometimes awkward writing style n favor of an outstanding story that shines through and tugs at your heart. The reader walks with Jane through her courage, her stubborness, her pain and her victories. In the end, even with her now less-than-perfect hero, it is easy to understand how she can finally realize happiness.
