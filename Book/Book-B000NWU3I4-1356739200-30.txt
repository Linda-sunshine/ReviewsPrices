review/summary: Loved itreview/text: First let me say I don't read many books and I'm not obsessed with lotr at all.But I found myself unable to put this book down till it was finished. It was well written and provided some pictures to give you visuals of areas.I took off the cover immediately though, as its just for show. Makes holding it a chore while reading.Great book.
