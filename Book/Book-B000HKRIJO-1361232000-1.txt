review/summary: Outstanding book for those who have questions concerning why Christians are Christians and how a Christian should live.review/text: Very well written, easy to read with simple examples that clearly explain the point the author is making. Great book for anyone who has questions about Christianity and also for us who have been Christians our whole life. It was an eye opening read introducing me to concepts I had never thought of or realized. If I follow the principles identified I hope to become a better Christian and person.
