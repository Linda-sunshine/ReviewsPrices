review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: I am reviewing only the book, as I have not read the Kindle version. This is my favorite book of all time and when I got the Kindle Fire HD, I wanted this on it. I have not read it on the Kindle, so I cannot rate the Kindle version. I'm hoping there aren't any problems with it. There's not much I can say about the book itself that hasn't been said by many, many people. It is probably the most popular book of the Twentieth Century. It's a must read. I hope the Kindle version is a good one.
