review/summary: ATLAS SHRUGGEDreview/text: For those that have never read Atlas Shrugged, I highly recommend this book even though it isn't an easy read. This book was written in the 50's and sounded like science fiction, back then, when I 1st read Atlas Shrugged. It made a big splash. The saying around campus was &#34;who is John Gault&#34;. I recently saw the 1st movie of Atlas Shrugged and enjoyed it very much. Had I not read the book, some of the movie would have been a little disjointed. It is amazing how it paralels our society today since it was written over 50yrs. ago. Ayn Rand was certainly a woman before her time, she also wrote The Fountain Head.
