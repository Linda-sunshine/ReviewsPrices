review/summary: Beautifulreview/text: I have had my own copy of this edition of The Hobbit since it was first published and I have been looking for a very long time for another copy for my daughter. Found. It is so beautifully bound and the illustrations by Tolkien add a new dimension to one of the best books ever, ever written. A huge Bilbo Baggins fan.
