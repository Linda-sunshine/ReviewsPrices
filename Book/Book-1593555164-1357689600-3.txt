review/summary: Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacherreview/text: It is an insult to Jack Reacher for Tom Cruise to be his character in ANY movie. All I can see is Tom C. jumping on the couch on the Oprah Show to declare his love. The character of JACK REACHER would never in a life time do something so stupid and out of character. For future movies, dump Tom Cruise and pick someone like Tommy Lee Jones.
