review/summary: Great Collectors Itemreview/text: I ordered this from a distributor associated with Amazon and paid extra for expedited delivery. It came within 5 days and I figured that was because of the Holidays. The address label showed it being shipped from Walmart. This concerned me but the contents were in good condition. It was sold as new and I am happy with the order. The dust jackets are perfect but the outer sleeve had a little crushing. These books are a great addition to any collection. I bought them to replace the paperbacks I had that were damaged in a flood. I can't wait to start reading them again.
