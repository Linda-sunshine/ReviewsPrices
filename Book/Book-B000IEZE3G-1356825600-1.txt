review/summary: CLASSICreview/text: This is the first time I've read this book since fifth grade, and I enjoyed it just as much as I did as when I read it first. Knowing that there are 6 more wonderful volumes awaiting me after this just adds to the appeal and joy that comes along with reading the first book in the series. I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone because I believe the Harry Potter series can be enjoyed by all ages and fans of all genres.
