review/summary: A Novel that Has Seen Better Daysreview/text: Maybe this was good reading when it was first published over 100 years ago, but it can't compare with today's novels for readability and interest to modern readers. The characters are boring, and the book is about 200 pages longer than required to tell the story. It does give some insight into the lifestyle of well-to-do Europeans of that era. It even has an intelligent woman in it, which is more than can be said of some books from that time. The price was right: free on Kindle!
