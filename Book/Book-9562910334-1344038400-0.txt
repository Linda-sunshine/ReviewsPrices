review/summary: A Timeless Cautionary Talereview/text: Volumes have been written about this book, so it's hard to add something new to everything that has been said about it. So I'd like to emphasize one aspect of 1984 that in my opinion is often overlooked when people discuss this masterpiece. Quite often, this book is criticized for things like simplicity of its plot or flat dialog. Whether you agree or disagree with this kind of criticism (I personally disagree) I think reviews like this totally miss the point. Yes, there are books with more compelling characters, with much more sophisticated plots and with more complex relationships. But this is not the reason 1984 stays popular. What make this novel special is its masterful portrayal of totalitarianism.Majority of modern Western readers who open 1984 have no personal experience with totalitarianism and very vague idea of this kind of society actually means. Sure, we all read news about countries like North Korea, but we read on the same page that talks about Kim Kardashian's marriage. It takes a book like 1984 -- and there aren't many books like this -- to show true horrific nature of totalitarian society. When you read this book you can almost feel how suffocating a society like this is. You nearly experience the monstrosity of a place where even thinking about something forbidden is a crime and where the state completely owns its citizens. The book reminds us that societies like this have always existed and helps us appreciate the freedom we have a little more.This is what makes 1984 special and this is why this book stays relevant for decades.
