review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: I really enjoyed reading this book as I am an avid reader of J R R Tolkien Books, his wiritng style is very decriptive and watching the movie afterwards just brought all the characters alive. I highly recommend this book. The ease of downloading the book on my amazon reader was effortless and quick.
