review/summary: Losing out because of fear of manreview/text: This is a wonderful classic. I recommend this to anyone. The scarlet letter is a great tale of love lost for fear of how others view them. The only judgement that should matter is that of God; he is m e merciful unlike man. The reverend and Hester are heroes because they were strong and understood why the things that happened to them happened. Although they came together towards the end,the child still suffered, and then again she gained a lot because of that silent love.
