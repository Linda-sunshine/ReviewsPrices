review/summary: timeless classic!review/text: I haven't read this since the 80s. With the movie coming out, I wanted to go back and have another read. This really stands the test of time. Amazing that this was published as a children's book. There is so much depth and core philosophy you can imagine being formed as Tolkien witnessed the horrors of WWI trench warfare. Blind hunger for power and glory. Unquenchable thirst for immortality. The human condition.
