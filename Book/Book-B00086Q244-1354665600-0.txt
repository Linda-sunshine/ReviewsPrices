review/summary: Great bookreview/text: From reading the first few chapters it has changed my outlook on how I interact with people. You read with a consideration of all the illustrations given, and really gives you constructive ways of using these skills to deal with people. It does give you a very frank view on human nature, but it shows you how you can use this to your advantage.All in all, anyone looking to improve thier social skills should definatly consider this book, very insightful.
