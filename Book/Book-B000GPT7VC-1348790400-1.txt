review/summary: Finally read this classic...review/text: It took me a long time to read this classic and so happy I did!HBS delivers a great but sad story into the lives of Tom and his family and how they migrate away from down south to Canada.The writing style was true to the time period, so don't expect it to rival today's works of fiction.I was privileged to have read it and appreciate Stowe's contribution to American Literature.
