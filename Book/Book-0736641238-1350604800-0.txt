review/summary: Classics are sometimes bestreview/text: I read "Little Women" when I was in junior high school and I loved the book. I decided to re-read it and I am glad I did. So much fiction today is lacking in plot, character development, and thought, in short, this is good literature. This is one of the best books around for people of all ages. I so appreciate that the March family experienced the joys and pains of everyday living and handled both with dignity, spirit, and a genuine love for each other. Even though poor, the March family rose above it. So many lessons are taught in this book that young people, particularly, could benefit from reading it. I will add this to my reading list of books that I read every couple of years!
