review/summary: One of the best books for women!review/text: I have read this book at least 2 times. It is amazingly written, concise, everything is explained to the point and simply. I would definitely recommend this book to every lady out there who feels her man is not the same as he was the first months since they've met.It's true what they say - if you want to change the world, start with yourself. And if you want your man to change, stop trying to change HIM, change your attitude and respect yourself to the point, where he will start respecting you back!If you're not sure how to do this, then READ THIS BOOK!
