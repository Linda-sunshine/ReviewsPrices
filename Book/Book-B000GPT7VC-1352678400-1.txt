review/summary: Still relevantreview/text: Excellent work and easy to see why it is a classic, not only regarding the history of American slavery in the 1850s, but also as a testament of faith in adversity. How many of us could pass the dark night of the soul as Uncle Tom did? Love the unlovable as Eva did?
