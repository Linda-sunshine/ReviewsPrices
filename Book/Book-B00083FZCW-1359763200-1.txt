review/summary: Natalie Boydreview/text: PLOT: Maximum Ride is a fourteen year old girl with wings who is the result of some experiments at a secret lab to inject avian genes into human embroyos. Max is the oldest of the six members of her family, or as they refer to themselves as the flock. The others are fang- a boy who is four months younger than max. Iggy- who was blinded by experimentation on his sight at the lab. Nudge- a young girl who talks non-stop. And two kiddies, the Gasman- an eight year old boy with persistent intestinal problems. And Angel, his six year old sister. Max and her companions were kept in cages and subject to repeated scientific experiments during their life at the School (the lab). They were eventually freed by one of the lab scientists (also known as whitecoats) named Jeb Batchelder. Jeb brought them to his mountain home and raised and educated them ever since. But then one day Jeb suddenly disappeared two years ago and the flock has been on it's own since then. Suddenly, erasers (experimental beings also developed at the lab who can morph into powerful wolf-like creatures) raid the family's mountain hideaway and kidnap Angel. It's up to the flock to save her.CONFLICT/RESOLUTION: Angel gets kidnapped by erasers and it's up to the rest of the flock to save her. That might lead to Max having to save the world.SETTING: Maximum ride and her flock- Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman, and Angel. Late summer in New York City.
