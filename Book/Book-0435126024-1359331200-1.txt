review/summary: Jane Eyrereview/text: This book is a jewel, a true love story without being cheesy at all, it is also the story and struggle of the little Jane from her birth till her mariage. When reading the story, you cannot help but feel what the characters are feeling, to care for them and hope that everything will end well. Bront's way of writing is marvelous, everything goes with peotic fluidity yet it is clear and somewhat concise.
