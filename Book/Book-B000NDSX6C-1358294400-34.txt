review/summary: An excellent book at a great pricereview/text: We saw this book at BooksAMillion and my 17 year old daughter fell in love. We were disappointed when we saw the price of $35 so I looked it up on Amazon and saw that they had it for $11.95. As soon as we got home I ordered it for her and she waited patiently for it to be delivered. It is a beautiful book with full color pictures along with pictures that had be done by J.R.R. Tolkien himself. This is a wonderful addition to her Tolkien collection.
