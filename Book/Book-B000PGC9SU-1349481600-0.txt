review/summary: Life lessons and a reflection on Americareview/text: I'm reviewing the 1928 edition of the Riverside Literature Series from Houghton Mifflin.If you want to understand Benjamin Franklin than I suggest searching for the most authoritative biography available. Mr. Franklin's autobiography is a short book which covers only some of the events of his life, stopping well short of the years where he solidified himself not only as a founder, but also a key framer of the U.S. Given it's brevity and lack of breadth, it's not all it could have been. This book does make for a wonderful treatment of a man creating the template of someone living the American Dream.I read it now in spite of having also read it in high school like so many other public school students; that's because I thought thirty-plus years later I'd have a different perspective and hopefully be prepared to better appreciate some life lessons that escaped my prior adolescent reading.What I recall then was the template for fulfilling the American dream, which resonates every bit as much now as it did all those years ago. What I learn in this go-round is how much systemic effort Franklin put into becoming a better person. He didn't passively coast through life encountering events in a way that had him reactively attempting to meet some ill-considered standard of virtue. Instead Mr. Franklin used spreadsheets to track his defects in character for a given virtue, where he focused on a one or a handful of virtues at a time to become a better student of each. For example, on page 97, he reveals his focus on practicing temperance where he notes the times he fails in a columnar table of days where each row is a virtue.One gets the sense reading this book that perhaps more than any other founding character, we'd be a very different place if Franklin never existed.
