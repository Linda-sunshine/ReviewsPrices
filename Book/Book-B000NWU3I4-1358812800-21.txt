review/summary: A great treat!review/text: In an earlier time, and in a different place, there was once a time of magic--a time of wizards and dragons and elves and dwarves. And, in an unnoticed corner of the world there lived a race of hobbits: a small people with furry feet, and too much common sense to go on adventures. But, when a particularly stable hobbit named Bilbo Baggins is visited by the great wizard Gandalf, he soon finds himself in the middle of an adventure with 13 dwarves, facing ogres and orcs and all sorts of dangers. Is the adventuring life too much for one small hobbit in the great big world? Read this book and find out!OK, everybody knows the story of the Hobbit, right? Well, if you haven't read this book recently, then it's time to reread it! My children are now old enough, and every night I am reading a little more to them from the adventures of Bilbo Baggins. They love this tale, and reading it again is a great treat for me! This is a great book, correctly considered a classic of western literature, one that my children and I highly recommend to you.
