review/summary: Amazing read.. History wrapped around fiction.review/text: I loved Gone with the Wind.. The time period was a crucial time for shaping America as we now know it. So many things stand out in my mind from the book but the one that I see the most is the relationship between Scarlett and Rhett. I think we know he loves her from the moment on the stairs at Twelve Oaks.. Scarlett to me seems like our modern day power hungry woman.. going against tradition in a mans world and proving a woman can survive..however she did marry Mr. Kennedy..but he was just a means to an end.. nothing more to her but a way to get what she wanted.. Then again like many modern day women her children were not anyone she really cared to be around and left them in the care of others while she worked hard to get the money she so wanted.. I think Scarlett always loved Rhett and did not know it till the end and when she found out she saw that she finally had all the money she could need but she did not have the one thing that could truley make her happy.. LOVE.. The story left me a little sad because of all that the people went through during those years of war and reconstruction.. but with those changing times we saw the freedom that so many deserved and the way of life of the South forever changed (regardless of those who can not seem to except that after all these years) I myself am a southerner and I can say that there were many things about the old south that seem magical..but so many others that were just plain wrong. Gone with the Wind shows so much of the Old South and of all the characters I think Mammy was the strongest and smartest of them all.. She was a woman that could tell you right from wrong in a world that you thought you knew everything and she stood by her "family" through more than blood kin would have.. Gone with the Wind is a must have on any book shelf.
