review/summary: Wonderful Adventure for Young Readers!review/text: My wife teaches a third grade Gifted Magnet program and this is the third year that her class has read this book. One Sunday, I decided to read it and see what all the fuss was about. I am glad I did! This is an adventure that pulls in the young reader with a story that makes them look forward to every new page. What a door the author swings open to a lifetime of reading enjoyment. There are many life lessons taught by reading "Hatchet" but perhaps the most wonderful is that reading really is fun!
