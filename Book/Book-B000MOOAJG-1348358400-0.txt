review/summary: Atlas Shruggedreview/text: This book is a classic I read in College. I cannot see how politicians are saying it condones the greed of our current big business model in which 1 percent make all the money without doing much to obtain it. The small business people are being shortchanged and losing their businesses and homes due to the greed of the Banks that are Too Big to Fail. I think Ayn Rand came from a different era and cannot be compared to the certain economic recession.
