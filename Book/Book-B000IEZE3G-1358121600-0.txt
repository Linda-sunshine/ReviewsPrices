review/summary: The book that got me reading!!!review/text: I must have read the Harry potter books already 50 times but the story never ceases to amaze me. I wasn't an avid reader before I read the first installment in the series. But this book has me hooked... one of the best books ever about friendship love and magic....and jk Rowling 's writing weaves the magic!!!!
