review/summary: You will not regret reading this book!review/text: I was browsing the free kindle books and came across this one and downloaded it as I did with a few other random books I came across. I have to admit I wouldn't have downloaded if if it wasn't free as I had already purchased one too many, but I am extremely glad I did! It was well worth the read and went on to purchase all the other books in the series.The only thing that I felt was undeserving was the $0.00 price tag. For all the emotions and faith it stirred in me I would have wanted to purchase this book to support the author, but if her intention was to capture new readers with a $0.00 price tag, she has certainly succeeded. I had never heard of Lynn Austin prior and have only just caught onto Christian fiction and she has already made it to my list of authors to watch out for.My mother in law has just finished reading this book and she tremendously enjoyed this book as I have and is now onto the second book.I highly recommend this book!
