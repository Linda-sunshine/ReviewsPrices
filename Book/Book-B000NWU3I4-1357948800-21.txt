review/summary: The Hobbit: The Best Book I've Ever Readreview/text: The Hobbit was the best book I've ever read and it was full of never-ending adventure and thrill. When I first started reading the book, I knew that there was a magical ring involved. I kept reading until that ring showed up. When it finally did, I got up and did my &#34;touchdown dance&#34;. The Hobbit actually is the best book I have ever read and I hope that if you have not read it you will read it and love it as I have. And for those who have already read the book, I hope you've had a great time reading it.
