review/summary: Pride and Prejudicereview/text: A wonderful tale that shows the importance of upbringing , character and morality. Ms. Bennet deals with the issues central to life in the 19th century; manners, education and marriage. Ms. Bennet and Mr. Darcy allow us to hope that there is hope through love and understanding.
