review/summary: Thought Provokingreview/text: This was an okay book for me. Granted, it kept me reading, but I just didn't care for it the way I did Tuesday's with Morrie. It was interesting to see who the 5 people were. Eddie is a grizzled war veteran who feels trapped in the same work as his father before him - fixing rides at a seaside amusement park. On his 83rd birthday, Eddie is killed in an accident at the park while trying to save a little girl. He awakens to find that Heaven is a place where your life is explained to you by 5 people who were in your life. It's an interesting premise, but I wasn't as thrilled with this book as I thought I would be. Thought provoking, yes, but it just didn't quite do it for me.
