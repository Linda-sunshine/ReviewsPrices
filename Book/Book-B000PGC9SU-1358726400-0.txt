review/summary: Should be titled "Partial Autobiography"review/text: Unknown to me at the start of this book was the fact that thisauto does not include his prospective as the colonies relationship with England began to fracture, experiences crafting the constitution nor exploits in France during the revolution. I still would have probably read the book if I was aware of this, but with a completely different expectation.
