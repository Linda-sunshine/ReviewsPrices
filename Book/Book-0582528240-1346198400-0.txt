review/summary: Unabriged with Original Illustrationsreview/text: The reviews on this page are misleading because they do not clearly indicate what publisher/edition they refer to. After reading some of them, I was afraid I would get an expurgated, simplified edition of Huckleberry Finn. This Dover edition is neither. It is the "unabridged replication of the edition published" in 1885 by Charles L Webster and Company, with all the original E. W. Kemble illustrations. Thank you, Dover. This is exactly what I was looking for to use as a hostess gift for an author I will be meeting shortly in England. I know she may have read it, but I love this book and I wanted to give her something meaningful and authentic.
