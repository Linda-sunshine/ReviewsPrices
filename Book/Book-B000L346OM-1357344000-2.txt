review/summary: Man's Search for Meaningreview/text: Excellent! A very different perspective than most Holocaust victems. We could learn much about ourselves as well as people in general about going forwars after tramatic experiences. The ooones that searched for a reason to survive; did and those who gave up expired. In view of the mess the world is in today, we need to be reminded to hold close those things that matter if we are to not just survive, but to thriive.
