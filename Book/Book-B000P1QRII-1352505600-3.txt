review/summary: the giverreview/text: Lately, I've been reading best sellers from the past and that's why I read "The Giver". I wasn't crazy about it. It left out too many details (didn't explain how it all came to be, for example). I'm finding that just because books make the best seller list, doesn't mean they're very good.
