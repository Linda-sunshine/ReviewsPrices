review/summary: Quite an enlightening readreview/text: If you feel at all like you lack the ability to love someone the &#34;right&#34; way, this book will certainly help indeed. I feel so much more able to love those around me as I now have a better understanding of how people want to be loved. I loved reading this book and really desire more people to read it. It truly is and inspired lecture.
