review/summary: Just OK.review/text: Another depressing book picked by my book club. I didn't hate it. I didn't love it. It gave a really moving story of what it was to be poor in this country in its early years. Really made you think how much we have now. Also, gave you much insight on the struggles that immigrants had when they first came to the land of opportunity. It was not a face paced book. Took me awhile to get through it. I finished it so that says that I liked it somewhat. It made for an interesting book club discussion. However, it was just too slow for me.
