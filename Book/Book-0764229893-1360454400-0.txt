review/summary: Great read!review/text: This was a great book for reading if you like to read books based on the Bible. I enjoyed getting my Bible alongside this novel and just comparing the accuracy of the novel. It really makes the Bible come alive as they way it could have happened in the lives of the characters. I really found myself unable to put it down as I wanted to see the characters develop. Looking forward to the next book in this series. Definitely a 5 star read!
