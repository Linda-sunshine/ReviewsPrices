review/summary: A Princess of Marsreview/text: I read this book as a young teenager - around 14 years old. I actually read the whole series and loved them all. I recently saw the movie John Carter on TV. I never realized that it was from this book until I saw it- the name John Carter didn't sink in. If they had kept the book name, I would definitely have known. I decided to reread the book and see how closely the movie followed the book since I forgot so much as I am now 62. I am still thoroughly enjoying the book. It grabs you from the beginning and I am now 3/4 done and it is still grabbing me. I gave it three stars because it is not exactly a literary work of art, but most books aren't in my opinion. As for being a good, exciting, unusual read...I give it 5 start. i will probably read the next book as well
