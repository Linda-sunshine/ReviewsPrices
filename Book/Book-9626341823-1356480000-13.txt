review/summary: A Christmas classicreview/text: This book brings me back to remembering why we are here - to serve others and to share with others. I try to read this each year near Christmas and am always thankful that I took the time. There are great movie versions but the book has such rich writing and imagery that can exceed the movies. I will be back next Christmas for another round with Scrooge.
