review/summary: So Much Irony in these Reviews...review/text: I was assigned to read this book when I was in 7th grade and I LOVED it. It opened up my eyes to how the world really is. I've been looking at some of the one-star reviews...So many people have been saying, "I don't believe our society could ever become that pictured in this book....BURN IT!" I can't even find words to describe how ironic that is...Anyway, I'm an 8th grader and Bradbury is my favorite writer. I highly recommend this book Or anything else by Bradbury for that matter.
