review/summary: Lee Child Never Disappointsreview/text: I have been a fan of Jack Reacher for years and each time I read one of his novels, I think it can't get better, but it does. You know that the crime (which the authorities have called a &#34;slam dunk&#34; case) will not have the assumed easy solution, but Reacher, in his &#34;cool&#34; way, carefully moves the investigation along, arriving at the usual surprise ending. Of course, Reacher is really Lee Child and I'm a firm believer that he's one of the best crime writers around. Can't wait to read the next one.
