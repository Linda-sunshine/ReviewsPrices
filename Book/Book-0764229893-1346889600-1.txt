review/summary: One of the best books you will read!review/text: I have read a few of Lynn Austin's other books, and I really enjoyed them. This series was THE BEST! The first three books essentially make up the story of King Hezekiah, and the last two books are about different characters. This series ranks right up there with the Mark of the Lion series by Francine Rivers...really, they are that good! I was addicted to these books, and convicted by these books in my spiritual life. Awesome, awesome read, I will read them again. LOVE THIS BOOK!
