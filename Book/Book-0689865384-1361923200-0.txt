review/summary: Review just for Turtleback School and Library Binding Editionreview/text: I would like to start by saying that I love this book and my students love this book. If I were writing a review about the book itself, I would give 4 or 5 stars. This review, however, is just for the Turtleback School and Library Binding Edition and intended for librarians.When my previous library-bound copy was lost, I had to order a new copy. I chose this version because it was the only library binding edition at a reasonable price. When I began to process the book, however, I realized that the title cannot be displayed on any surface of the book if I place my barcode and spine label stickers in their usual position. I place barcode labels in the upper-left of the front cover. If I do this, the already hard-to-read title (it is written in a different color, but in line with all of the other titles in the series (ugliesprettiesspecialsextras)). The title on the spine is in the lower portion of the spine in fairly small letters. This is right where spine labels in every library I have ever seen go, and it is completely covered.So in summary, I have to choose between placing my stickers in a different spot for this book, or not being able to see what the title of the book is. For this to be specially made for libraries, they sure weren't thinking about how libraries actually process books.
