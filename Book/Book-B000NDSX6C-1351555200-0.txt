review/summary: It's still epic after all these yearsreview/text: I read the hobbit as a boy, and with the movie coming out soon decided to read it again. I was worried it would not hold up since I am about 15 years older. Not only does it hold up, I once again found myself whisked away to far off lands having adventures, battling dragons and goblins and hunger. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful book.
