review/summary: Love Lee Child's writingreview/text: Story is fantastic.Very Jack Reacher. Have read all the &#34;Reacher&#34;series and love them. Was very disappointed when they chose Tom Cruise to play this character.Lots of friends agree with me.Not sure I want to see the movie and have my illusion shattered. But the books are great.
