review/summary: The Hobbit, Kindle Editionreview/text: This book is the the prelude to &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; which many believe to be a classic in its genre. Although lighter in tone than LOTR, it sets the stage for Tolkien's Middle Earth and is a classic in its own right. Read the book as a young adult and wanted to have it in my Kindle collection. A good read again.
