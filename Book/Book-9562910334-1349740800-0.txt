review/summary: A story that just needs to be told.review/text: A story of what could be. A story of what we thought was coming. A story of what still might be.I was supposed to read this is high school but did not. I wish I had. On the level of Catcher in the Rye or To Kill A Mockingbird this novel is thought provoking and never dull.
