review/summary: Wasn't a fanreview/text: I found it to be somewhat of a diatribe preaching to type A workaholics. Yes, corruption, old boys clubs and complacency are bad, but in a day and age where everything is GO GO GO I found it hard to connect to a book about how we should be working more and harder.
