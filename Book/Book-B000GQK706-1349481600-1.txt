review/summary: The Lord of the Rings: One Volumereview/text: First read LOTR, in three volumes, in 1966. It was a long read at that time, but fascinating. Read LOTR now, at age 65, and it was a rich experience. My Kindle has prompted me to read much more. And of course, as a retiree I have more reading time. Amazon makes old favorites and new friends so affordable -- some even free! This is an adventure and complex allegory for most everyone at some time in their life.Kindle Paperwhite, 6" High Resolution Display with Built-in Light, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers
