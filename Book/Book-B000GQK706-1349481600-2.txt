review/summary: Possibly the Greatest Literary Fiction Ever !!!review/text: Well, what's left to say that hasn't been said far better than I ever could for decades. The Lord of the Rings, often and erroneously refered to as a trilogy, ( the three volumes published seperately over a period of years)remains a literary masterpiece.Those of you that have not read it, or have only been exposed to the LOTR through Peter Jackson's films, need to do yourself a favor and read Tolkien's works. I think you'll agree, that it is the finest example of fantasy ever written and quite possiby the finest work of literary fiction period!
