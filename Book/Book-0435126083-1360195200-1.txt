review/summary: Classicreview/text: I remember reading this many years ago and it is still a good read. I feel very sad when I talk to the younger generation and they don't know what I'm talking about if I say I'm reading &#34;Wuthering Heights&#34;. They've never heard of the Bronte sisters or Louisa May Alcott. It's a shame.
