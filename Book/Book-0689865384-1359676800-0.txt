review/summary: My favorite in the series!review/text: I love the entire Uglies series. The writing is beautiful, thoughtful and most importantly action-packed. The characters face surreal problems, such as enormous government conspiracies, and also with issues we each must face in our lives, such as feeling inadequate, or the complex relationships we have with our friends, or having to make the choice between doing what is right and what is easy. It also makes us question our own society and the emphasis put on beauty and fame, our unsustainable lifestyles, and the hidden price of living in a sheltered 1st world society.In particular, I love this book best out of the entire series, because of the way that it begins: Tally isn't out to upset the status quo. She isn't trying to rebel against the system. She just wants to be with her friends, to be older and able to have more and do more. Slowly and believably, she starts to realize that there might be bigger concerns, some of which are worth fighting and sacrificing for. She learns what a true friend is. She learns how unimportant physical appearance is in comparison to creativity, critical thought, and deep emotion. She grows so believably from a typical (if a bit mischievous) teenager into someone determined to change the world, from someone who is mostly self-centered to someone who is mostly self-sacrificing.The series as a whole give us the full scope of the dystopia society so closely based on the ideals of our own. I recommend reading them all. But for those who really seek a character-driven story, this first book gives us a heroine and a coming-of-age story not to be forgotten.
