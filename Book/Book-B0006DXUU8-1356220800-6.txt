review/summary: My Christmas Traditionreview/text: After reading that Patrick Stewart reads &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; every year, I felt that it was a tradition that I could join in. So, for the past 7 years, I have done so. This is the first year that I had a Kindle, and so I tried it on that format.The book reads just as well, and the illustrations are just what I want. I enjoy reading it in landscape mode on the Fire over portrait.
