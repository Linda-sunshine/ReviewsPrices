review/summary: Terrifyingly elegant and possiblereview/text: Atwood's dystopia proves all the more chilling because of the America's puritanical penchant in addressing social issues. With a push here, a nudge there, the totalitarian regime described in this subtle tour de force could evolve into a terrifying reality.Atwood's writing structure also adds to the despair, the gloom, of the protagonist's recounting of her sordid ordeal. So much of the prose was passive. In other instances, this would've been weak writing. But Atwood deftly employs this construction to intensify the violation of Offred, women, and the nightmarish society she so masterfully constructs. The slights happened to her; events controlled her. Our heroine had no power to determine the course of her existence.This tale also forces one to consider how we as a society deal with such moral quandaries. This book is all the more terrifying because of the rampant sexual assaults and "gender" violence that occur today. Pushed too far, the public could acquiesce to such ideologically driven regimes.Germany still bears the scars from Hitler and his genocidal Nazi regime; Russia has Stalin and the great purges. Even in America we have seen the abdication of freedom for so called security. One can certainly imagine in a time of successive crises the American public meekly falling in line.Atwood scoured my soul with this work, but made me think of how I should cherish life and its simple, its sublime, moments, its beauty and love, instead of blankly, passively, existing.The Handmaid's Tale is not for the weak or those who do not want to examine their own internal motivations or values.It is starkly, yet beautifully, written. I highly recommend it.
