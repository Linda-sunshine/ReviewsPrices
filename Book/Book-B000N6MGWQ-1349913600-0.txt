review/summary: If this is Heaven, I'm not going.review/text: I thought I would read this before purchasing Mitch Albom's more recent Time Keeper just to have some exposure to the author's writing. In a way, I'm glad I did. I have not read a more depressing story since Old Yeller, and that was a substantial number of books ago. While I get the comparison's to It's A Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol (and no, the book does not have anything to do with Christmas), this is a sad story about a sad man who lived a sad life. The fact that the people he meets in Heaven can help explain why, does not make it any less sad. I think I'll skip Time Keeper.
