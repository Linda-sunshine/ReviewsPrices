review/summary: A Marvelous Bookreview/text: I love this book. I have reread it several times & will read it again. In fact, it is, along with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, my go to book when there is nothing else to read. The illustrations in this edition are wonderful. My 4 star rating has nothing to do with the story, the writing, the characters, etc. it has to do with the audio portions of this edition. Despite my deleting & reloading several times (6 at last count) I can't get the audio portions to work & I've been unable to get any help making them work. Maybe it's my reader, maybe not, but I wanted the audio portions to work. Other than that, this book is perfect.
