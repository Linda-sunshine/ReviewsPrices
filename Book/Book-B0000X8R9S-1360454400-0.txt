review/summary: Must Read Classicreview/text: After a Newberry Honor and years in print, Hatchet hardly needs my recommendation. Yes, it's good. Of course you should read it. Fast paced and adventurous, the only fault I found with it was my mom came out too often: "Use the radio, now, before you fly too far from the flight path!", and "Don't eat those berries!" I also felt the ending was quite abrupt, but really, how else was it going to end? Today an author might add a death defying hike to rejoin civilization. That's not necessarily a good thing.
