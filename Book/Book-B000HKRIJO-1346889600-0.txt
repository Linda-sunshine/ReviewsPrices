review/summary: A little more than Merereview/text: A logical approach to the understanding of God as the Creator and Christianity. Appeals to the intellect. You do not have to put your brains on the table when you become a Christian. C. S. Lewis in a masterful way explains his faith. Is an excellent book for the seeker of the truth.
