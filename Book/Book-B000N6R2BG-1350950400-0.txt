review/summary: Keeping Faithreview/text: Jodi Picoult is an amazing author who gives great insight into difficult topics in society. Her character development is wonderful and makes the reader feel attached to the people in her stories. Her writing causes serious discussions about current issues and gives you creative ways of approaching dilemmas in our lives. I have read almost every book that she has written and am never disappointed.
