review/summary: A strange novel.review/text: It is not consider good form to laugh at deranged people. The main character is dreanged, and if you ever personally known someone like him, you would not like this novel. On the other hand, I read it to the end. The really likeable and funny character is Jones. I hope the fact that he is black does not offend anyone. His character makes everyone else look insane. This is a well writen book, and since I listened on tape, the narration was excellent. There really is no plot in the book. Its a bunch of miserable characters living in disorder. If there is a plot, its Riley's descent into madness. And again, apologies to New Orleans, but where else is more likely to discover a cast of characters living on the edge of sanity.This is not a book to take to the Beach, or read after a friend or relative is hospitized for a mental disorder. It will not help you understand the problem. The only benefit this novel has, is to remind us that there is a lot of troubled folk out there.
