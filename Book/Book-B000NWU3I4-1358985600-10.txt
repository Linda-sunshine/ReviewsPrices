review/summary: One of my favoritesreview/text: Just finished reading this to my son and it was just as good as I remember. I remember having this book read to me for the first time when I was nine by my Dad. He was a big fan of the Tolkien and felt it was time to share his love for these epic stories. I can still remember getting into bed while he sat in a metal office chair reading till I fell asleep.At the age of nine I was enthralled by this story with tales of Wizards, Goblins and Dwarves. It was all so fantastic I was transported to a different world and loved every minute of it. After this tale my Dad then read me the Lord of the rings trilogy and even though I am not a fan of Sci- Fi, I do love these stories and still get a thrill out of reading them over and over.All these years later I am a father now and wanted to share this with my son and possibly start a tradition that I hope he passes on to his children one day. My son is young and has no idea what is going on but he loves to hear my wife and I read to him. So I chose The Hobbit and she chose a different story, but I know when he is older I will reread this to him in hopes that his face lights up with wonderment and joy as mine did this time, and all those years ago.
