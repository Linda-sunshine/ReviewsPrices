review/summary: Great and Glorious!review/text: It has been a great many years since I last read "The Hobbit". That is a great many years too many. My memory of this book was one of boredom, dryness, and an overall lacking. It is quite apparent that either my memory is lacking or I read this book much to young to appreciate it fully.This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I particularly appreciate and identify with a hero who is not macho. He is not strong. He is not selfless and morally superior. He is made of real things, and is enjoyable with his flaws. You root for him when he comes through in a pinch; he has an ability to come up with clever ideas under pressure. But he, good old Bilbo Baggins, would rather prefer being at home taking tea and eating cakes.There is great wealth here - in imagery, action, character, conflict, and, yes, humor. This classic fantasy is so entirely engaging that you are constantly eager for what happens next. How on earth can they escape the goblins? Surely the party will all die at the legs of giant spiders!Often you hear of books that are "must reads", and there are so many of those that you just brush off as fluff an nonsense. This is one to not be brushed off, as it is timeless in its appeal to all audiences (well, above a certain age, since I in my single-digit youth didn't fall under its spell, naturally). Read it, enjoy it, and share it. This is a bucket-list-worthy book, undoubtedly.
