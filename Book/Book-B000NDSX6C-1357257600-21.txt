review/summary: A Timeless Classicreview/text: There's nothing I can say here that'd be in any way original. I read the book as a teenager and really didn't get into it, but I read it as an adult when the LotR films came out and enjoyed it a great deal. It's definitely a different &#34;flavor&#34; compared to LotR, but that doesn't mean it's not as good, it's just different. I re-read the book just before the film was released, to refresh my memory of the story, and I found myself catching more and more little gems and tidbits that I'd missed on previous readings. Can't recommend it highly enough.
