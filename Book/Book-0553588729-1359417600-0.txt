review/summary: Great info!review/text: I am expecting my first baby in 3 months and hoping that I don't need half the info in this book but know I probably will :) It is written in a way that is clear as to what the 5 main steps are to soothing a colicky baby. Really great practical info and a quick read. Would highly recommend!
