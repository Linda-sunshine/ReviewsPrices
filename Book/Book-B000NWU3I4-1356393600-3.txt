review/summary: Beautiful Bookreview/text: I was able to get this wonderful book for $11. I will not comment on the story more than to say that it is truly a great story. Tolkien sure makes the story come alive as you read it.The focus will be on the materialistic part of the book. The cover is truly beautiful. Gold, green, red. It is covered with dwarfish rune language. The paper on which the book is printed is high quality. It is thicker than regular paper and even feels good to touch.The animations are in beautiful colorings on special photo paper. There is for example a picture of Rivendale, very similar to this: [...], however, it comes across even more beautiful in the book than it does on the screen of my Macbook Pro.I bought it for $11 which is a great price for this beautiful piece of art. I noticed when I wrote this review that it is $18, which is a lot higher (63%). The raise in price is most likely due to the Hobbit being out in theater. I am not sure that the price will go down. I would like to guess that the price will go down in a few months (unless the DVD and Blu-Ray release of the movie spikes the demand in Hobbit related products). If you would wait close to a year, I am afraid that the release of the second Hobbit movie would increase the demands, and thus the price of this book again.Recommendation: Buy it. If not now, in a few months (before the DVD/Blu-Ray release).
