review/summary: Better than the movie for sure.review/text: If you saw the movie, you may really like the book. Beware. A book is never the same as a movie.... They are better, more detailed, more thought and less hollywood crap ideas of what the public is supposed to want.It was also written by a man from the distant past. So don't beat up the author, that doesn't have our knowledge. GREAT BOOK
