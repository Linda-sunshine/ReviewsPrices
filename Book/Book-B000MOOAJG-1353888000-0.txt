review/summary: Stuck in the Ditch on the Rightreview/text: As a Christian who is fairly conservative in religious practice, one would think I would have just loved Atlas Shrugged. I most certainly did not. Ms. Rand's philosophy like her name, on the surface looks strangely elegant, but just a little scratch shows that it's a self-delusional fake. Look, I can understand why she would jump in the ditch on the right, having grown up under Soviet Communism. But her Objectivism is as about as feasible and effective as the Communism she ran screaming from. Uber rigid hard-liners, be they on the right or the left end up self-centered, boorish, and alone. Want to find out the real scoop on hypocrisy of her Objectivism? Read "Judgement Day, My Years with Ayn Rand" by Nathaniel Branden. (This is the couple that co-wrote "The Virtue of Selfishness.") Rand and Branden, married not to each other, nevertheless decide to have an affair with each other. Some time later, Branden decides to have an affair with someone else not his wife or Rand. When Rand found out, my my my, she had a corker of a conniption fit. And that dear readers is the ultimate failure of Objectivism: It's okay if *you* are the one behaving selfishly to the detriment of those around you. But when someone else behaves in like manner and it negatively affects you? Katie bar the proverbial door, Mount St. Ayn and her kin blow their tops.
