review/summary: interesting philosophyreview/text: I first read Atlas Shrugged in college and was impressed then with Ayn Rand's view of the destructive potential of social policies taken to extremes. Over forty years later on a Kindle instead of a huge paperback, this book still has a powerful impact.Since her own family was victimized by Russian Communism, she had a justifiable fear of government grabbing power from people in the name of social welfare. In Atlas Shrugged she creates a divided America where, for her "heroes", neither marriage nor family is as important as integrity and excellence in one's profession, but for her villains, greed, envy, manipulation, and power hunger drive all their actions. Rand creates enemies to her beliefs who are seemingly incapable of understanding their self-destructive behavior will have consequences. Considering the extremes that the characters run to, it's a relief to believe that Dagny, Franscisco, Hank, and of course John Gault have the sense to "throw in the towel" and head for the mountains.I thoroughly enjoyed the love stories, as idealized as they are, and salute Rand for making Dagny the protagonist. Wisely, Rand does not provide children to the dysfunctional marriages, so the partners are torturing only other adults.The 4 instead of 5 star rating is because of the sixty pages of philosophy Rand forces Gault to expound as an explanation to the world of why everything is falling apart. Without doubt, however, this book is an important contribution to understanding the potential for abusing the philosophy that underlies much of the foundation of American democratic government. She delineates the major forces that create the dynamic tension of our country.
