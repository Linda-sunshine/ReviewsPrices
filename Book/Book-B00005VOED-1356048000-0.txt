review/summary: Absolutely the funniest book I have ever read !review/text: How anyone can honestly say they did not think this book funny, and that they did not laugh out loud, I simply cannot understand. I have read hundreds maybe thousands of books in my long life, and this is the best of the fiction. Too bad it has not yet been made into a movie.
