review/summary: Beautiful bookreview/text: This is one of my most favorite books which i love re-reading once in a few years.What makes this one a timeless classic is that it never grows old despite the story taking place more than a century ago. Why? Because we can always relate to the characters.My 12-year-old daughter, who is a modern child of the modern world, loves the book as much as her mom. We like to talk about the characters, analyze their behavior and choices.i don't agree when people says this book tells the girls to become housewives. It does not. Sadly, those were still the times when women did not have many choices, but it did not stop them following their dreams (especially Jo).This book also teaches us to be grateful for the opportunities we have today--the ones that the little women did not have.
