review/summary: stunning talereview/text: i had put off reading this for a while. a friend told me it was great but the little breakdown on it seemed dull.this story is not dull. i couldn't put it down. offred was heartbreaking in her account of how she went from being a normal person in a world we could recognize to being a piece of property.the story was written so well that it was almost easy to imagine our world sliding into that way of being. many hours after finishing it i find that story still creeping into my thoughts.i definitely recommend this story to anyone interested in the dystopia genre.
