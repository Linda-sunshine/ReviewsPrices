review/summary: a fine edition though the binding is not very good.review/text: I've seen the LOTR films so I thought I would by a really decent edition with some x-mas money. I received this in great condition with shrink rap and a thick, sturdy, durable case in which to hold the leather bound book in. The thing I love about this edition of the LOTR trilogy is the gold trim on the edge of the pages. If ever quality were to be at its high for a book, this would be it. I have a complaint about the binding of this pristine, elegant set or collection of the LOTR trilogy. Though Houghton Mifflin published a suberb set for the 50th anniversary of the trilogy, they could've spent more time on the durability of how the book's spine would hold, more so the binding felt cheaply put together with crinkles and crackles when opened up for a read. The price is steep for the contents of the book, I would urge LOTR fans to by this if you're loyal to Tolkien lore. For people who just want to read this at a cheaper price, just by the set in paperback. Overall I like this set but wished time would have been spent on the binding and the durability. The paper could have been a little thicker like the Houghton Mifflin edition for The Hobbit.
