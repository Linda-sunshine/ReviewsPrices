review/summary: a deep and profound love storyreview/text: In British literature, my favorite writers are Bronte sisters.Bronte sisters are the genius that their names were known to by a few novels in the world.The heroine Jane Eyre in Charlotte Bronte's novel was brought up by a mean aunt.Therefore Jane Eyre received terrible bullying.The problem of the bullying becomes the great problem in Japan now.In a school a few children sometimes are bullied, and to my surprise, a few parents in Japan abuse their children.The first scene of Jane Eyre is her unhappy life's departureI watch deep depth of human existence there.That chief director who took care of Jane Eyre must be crazy , if we consider by modern sense.It is odd that he is a Christian .Because Christ taught love and impressed the human. And Christ taught us that we are the light of the world.Helen is a kind friend of Jane Eyre in the school and has the heart like the angel.That chief director did the evil that he lets weak Helen walk in the rain .Thus, Helen dies.Furthermore, everywhere in the novel, a British beautiful rural scenery is pictured with the fresh and young sensitivity of a young woman .The mansion which she visited as a tutor is right attractive like an old cave.A big mansion has a secret.A thing that suggests a modern horror novel drifts.Gradually young Jane Eyre is charmed by middle-aged Rochester with the naivete such as the wild beast.This description will be a example of the love story's masterpiece .There are "The sorrow of young Werther", French "The lily of the valley", Russian "Anna Karenina" in the world love stories.But in their novels ,three women are the noble or the rich.In that respect, Jane Eye is from the misfortune.I am interested by the existent problem that this human being is born.Jane Eyre gets true love by power of her intention in the misfortune.It is not at all a light novel.On the contrary, it is a heavy novel.I read Jane Eyre and remembered "Light in August" of Faulkner.
