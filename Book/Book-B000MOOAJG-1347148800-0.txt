review/summary: Good with some caveatsreview/text: I enjoyed this book a lot but there are some negatives that diminished my enjoyment of it.The Good:- I loved the protagonists (Dagny, Hank Rearden, Francisco). They were strong, intelligent characters and I was rooting for them right from the start- the story was interesting. I was anxious to find out how it would all end and it was gripping- the philosophical disadvantages of Socialism are well-presentedThe Bad:- it seems very exaggerated. I don't think the staunchest defenders of Socialism would identify with the "Incompetents' (my word for them) in this book- the antagonists in this book (James Taggart, Wesley Mulch, etc.) seemed to be the same person. They are one-dimensional with no redeeming qualities- it was very, very long. A few times I wanted to stop because it was so long but I really wanted to find out how it all turned out. John Galt's speech on the radio could have been cut down to 10% of its length with no loss of meaning or impact.Overall a good, enjoyable story and I recommend it
