review/summary: Had to read or would not havereview/text: My daughter had to read this for an extra credit assignment. It was brutal for me as much as it was for her, listening to her complain about how boring it was. If you like this type of classic writing you might enjoy it but for a 15 year old it didnt seem like the right book to get them interested in reading.
