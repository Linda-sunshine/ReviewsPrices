review/summary: THE BEST OF THE 4 BOOKSreview/text: In my opinion the Hobbit is the most amusing book by kinship to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I have been readingthe four books every two or three years since my teens, can never get tired of them, now I am in my mid sixties.The author's imagination is beyond generous.
