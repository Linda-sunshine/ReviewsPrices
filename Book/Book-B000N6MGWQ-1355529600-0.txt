review/summary: Merry Christmas you old Savings & Loan!review/text: I find Mitch Albom a bit preachy, but more intelligent in his plotting than other cheesy inspirational authors. Maybe I'm just a typical Plains-dwelling glib gus, but sometimes some people don't need inspiration.Still, he's got a great style and there's some bittersweet symmetry that's poignant if a bit too much like George Bailey on the bridge outside Bedford Falls begging Clarence to let him live again.
