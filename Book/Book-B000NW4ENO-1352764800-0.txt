review/summary: Knew the movie by heart but had never read the bookreview/text: I know this film so well and often quote dialogue but had never read the book. My first purchase on the Kindle and off camping. A thousand pages of southern saga sweeping off the page. It amazed me how the characters in the book are simply written descriptions of the eventual actors. You would recognise Clark Gable and Vivienne Leigh, even Melanie and Ashley like old friends. It was amazing. Also made me understand better a few things in the movie that were not clear to me - the Ku Klux Klan for example.If you are a fan of the movie but had never read the book - do so. It may be from the 1930's but the story holds, as does the film. Well worth the read and a great camping weekend relax.
