review/summary: Good Book, Great Helpreview/text: A friend highly recommended this book to me because I am having marital issues with my wife and we're close to calling it quits. After reading the first three chapters I bought another copy to give to my wife to read. We both enjoyed it.We started counseling a couple of weeks ago and when I told the counselor we've read the 5 Love Languages, she was excited for us. She institutes a little bit of the book into our counseling sessions and used it as a baseline for our first session.The book showed me ways to communicate/love in a language my wife understands. It's teaching her that it's not helpful to us for her to keep bringing up past events and harping on the negative if we're to make our relationship work. The best part is the books gives real situational examples and teaches you how to judge your spouse without being judgmental.
