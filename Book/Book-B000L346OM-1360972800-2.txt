review/summary: Still Relevantreview/text: Much of what we know about life in various Nazi concentration camps comes from Frankl, I realized as I finally read his book. I bought it when I was trying to support a friend who was enduring one of life's random tragedies. I do not believe in a god who never sends us more than we can bear. In fact, I don't believe God sends us good or ill events, and Frankl's work supports my view. What he does show is that under the most heinous of circumstances, humans have the ability to make moral choices, and that is powerful information.Frankl-- who survived when his pregnant wife, parents and other relatives did not-- went on to show that not all prisoners were moral and all guards immoral. Within extremely narrow parameters, both had the freedom to embrace life and to aid others. He was also insightful about what signaled impending death. I guess I should not be surprised that after the war, Frankl opposed the theory of collective guilt; he was loathe to condemn whole societies, which is what makes him out of step with many Holocaust scholars and (in my reading) with other prominent moral teachers of his era.The last part of the book sets out his theories of logotherapy in which he held that the purpose of psychotherapy is to help patients make meaning of their lives rather than find happiness or resolve various complexes. It's interesting that logotherapy is almost unknown today, although some of his ideas seem to bubble up in existential therapies. As it turns out, Man's Search is condensed from longer writings he produced after liberation. The book in English is so lucid that I forgot that he lived all this experience "in German." Unlike many psychological writings, this one does not suffer from the restriction of categories that don't quite translate. I suspect that's one reason is still resonates with readers as it did with me.
