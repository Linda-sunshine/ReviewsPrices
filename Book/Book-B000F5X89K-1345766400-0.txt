review/summary: good but not greatreview/text: This book was pretty good but for some reason it did not do much for me. When I would tell my friends and family the plot they would all say wow that book sounds great or sounds like a really exciting book. But in reality to me it wasn't. I think that it might have been because there was too much unnecessary writing in between the interesting parts. Other than that it was a great plot and I might be too harsh on the classic book since I do love classics!
