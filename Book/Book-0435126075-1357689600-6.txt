review/summary: The best book second only to the Bible!!!!!review/text: This romance captures you right from the beginning. Miss Austen, though never married, understood true romance. She describes both Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy so vividly the reader cannot fail to have a pure picture in mind. I would fail to see how anyone could read this novel and not want to start a new romance.
