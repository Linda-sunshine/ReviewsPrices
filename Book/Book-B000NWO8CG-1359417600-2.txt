review/summary: 3.5 stars. Beautifully written through the eyes of a youthreview/text: Written around the depression, the book deals with poverty and all the difficulties of growing up poor in Brooklyn as seen by a young girl . It's her recounting on her days, seen with such wonder and hope. Very touching
