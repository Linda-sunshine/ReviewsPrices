review/summary: knsmithreview/text: WOW! This is an AMAZING book! This was a required read for my methods of teaching social studies class for college, but I know many individuals who read this during their social studies curriculum in middle school. Everyone who I've discussed this book with has absolutely loved it. Elie Wiesel does a fantastic job of putting such horrific events in perspective and leaves readers feeling like they were with him in the camps. I definitely recommend this book for everyone middle school aged and older!
