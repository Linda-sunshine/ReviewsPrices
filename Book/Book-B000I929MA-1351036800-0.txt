review/summary: Great Dystopian Readreview/text: This book was a furtistic read on a dystopian society, but so many of the horrors were real to many women in our past and are still real to some women in the Middle East! Atwood tells a terrifying story of history repeating it self in an extreme way. The details of day to day life were so interesting to me, I was sucked into that world and when I was able to put the book down I felt relieved! It was a page turner for sure, but not a book that was easy to pick up once I got away from it. Although the world Atwood described was gripping, I wanted more of a story instead of just an idea of what society was like. I wanted to know more about Luke and more about what ever kind of resistance there was, I wanted a war. I wanted some kind of a climax to the story and I don't feel like there was one. The ending didn't tie all the loose ends up for me instead it had an opend ending for you to imagine what you wanted. I would rather have a nice tidy ending, but that's just me. A dark, horriflying, disturbing read! Four stars for me
