review/summary: One Shotreview/text: I enjoy Lee Childs Reacher series very much. One Shot was top quality. I saw the movie first but it doesn't hold a candle to the book. Of course that's the norm. The book was bad casting. A different person should have played Reacher.One complaint I have with the reacher series is he's just too perfect. No one is that good.
