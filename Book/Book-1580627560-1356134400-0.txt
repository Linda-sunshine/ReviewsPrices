review/summary: Excellentreview/text: Really a book about self esteem. How men or for that matter others view someone with it vs. without it. What your actions say about your self esteem. I recommend giving this to young ladies who are just starting to date. It will help them to not make the novice mistakes so many women make and some never learn not to make. Also the lessons can be applied to other situations in life.
