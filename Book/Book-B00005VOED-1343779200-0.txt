review/summary: Unique, but not that funnyreview/text: I am really mixed about this book. I read it because people were passing it around at work and they raved about it. It certainly contains unique characters but the main one just annoyed me, although I loved Jones, the floor-sweeping guy. I stopped reading halfway through because I was bored, then pick it up again because I hate not to finish a book. I can't find that there's a real plot here. If you're looking for a mix of laugh out loud and quiet humor with southern dialect I'd recommend the series by TR Pearson: A Short History of a Small Place, Off for the Sweet Hereafter, and The Last of All There Was.
