review/summary: Better than I expectedreview/text: I am not a big fan of horror books and movies, so I was a little reluctant to starting on this book. But after the first pages I got totally captivated and I couldn't leave it out of my hands. It is actually a very interesting story about how people don't always foresee the consequences of their actions and about men's creations that can go dangerously out of control.
