review/summary: Gorgeousreview/text: This addition is so beautiful and is so worth forming a part of your library or collection! As for the story itself, if you love epic fantasy novels, then you will this one! It is like the Shakespeare of Fantasy Novels, and a masterpiece to boot! One of my favorite series.
