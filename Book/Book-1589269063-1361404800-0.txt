review/summary: Good book to have when trying to understand how to "say/show" someone you love them.review/text: This book is a great tool for understanding relationships. I've read several other books such as the Men are from Mars, Woman are from Venus books, and this book takes a different approach to understanding love and how we express love to our partners.This book put into words what we see happening in our relationships but weren't able to decode the meanings behind it. I've learned a lot about myself from reading this book. For example, knowing what my languages are for love, helps me to explain to my significant other why I do things for her (service). And how my service to her is the way I say I love you, without saying the actual words. I think service is one of the main languages the male population expresses love. But at the same time, the book help me to understand that I too need to understand my s.o.'s language so that she knows that I know how to say I love you in her language too.It's a great read and I think I'm a little better at love than I was before this book. So kudos on a great read on love.
