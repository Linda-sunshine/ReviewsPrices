review/summary: Too Much Objectivismreview/text: I read this before, about 45 years ago, and was surprised to find that the only thing I remembered of it was the female protagonist's name. This novel consists of a good story, but structured so that about every 20 pages, one of the four heroes makes a very long (4-5 pages)speech, has a very long discussion, or thinks for a very long time about objectivism. Or so it seems. The interesting thing about the book is that much of the "entitlement" programs or rights of today are predicted, and are considered to be major evils. I had to force myself to finish the book. Go see the movie instead and save yourself some time.
