review/summary: Intriguing light reading.review/text: Haven is only very loosely based on The Colorado Kid. That being said, it's still a fun story and having the images of Vince and Dave from Haven made it better for me. It reminds me of the science fiction tales I read in the 1960s. There is no resolution at the end, but that's not the point. So just enjoy a good yarn.
