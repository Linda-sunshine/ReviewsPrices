review/summary: Atheist turned Christianreview/text: Lewis delivers complex Christian concepts distilled to intellectionally rich bite-sized and digestable pieces...give yourself time to absorb it. I had to read it while in a quiet place. It is an ideal book for the intellect who cant see her/his way clear to Christianity. This is a perfect intellectual "seekers" book.
