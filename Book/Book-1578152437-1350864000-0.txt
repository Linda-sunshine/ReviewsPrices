review/summary: Rather funny!review/text: Dickens was a very funny guy. The dialogue is hilarious, and I love highlighting particularly snarky passages (ad seeing what other readers found amusing). Definitey worth reading in a serial format, as it's less pressure to finish -- you are obliged to take your time.
