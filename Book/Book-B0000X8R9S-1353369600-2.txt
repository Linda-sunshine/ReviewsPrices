review/summary: this review is not because of the content of the book...its because of the condition it is inreview/text: this book was advertised as being &#34;very good&#34;. Since when does very good mean that left over food particles are going to be found throughout the book? Also, the cover is quite worn and several of the pages were folded and creased.
