review/summary: I view everything different nowreview/text: It's amazing how some books can change your entire viewpoint in life. I had similar views about capitalism and government intervention prior to reading this book, but seeing the way the government communicates the &#34;urgent need&#34; for more of their intervention, it is amazing how this book told the story so many years in advance. I listened to the (very long) audiobook primarily, but wanted to have a physical copy as well for my bookcase (both as a reference, but also a conversation starter). I can't recommend this book enough, and it's definitely worth the time it takes to read!
