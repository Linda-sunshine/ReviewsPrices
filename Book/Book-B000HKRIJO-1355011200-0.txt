review/summary: Always a good read...review/text: I've read Mere Christianity a number of times and never tire of it. This is the first time I've read it on the Kindle App for iPad and found it a new experience, seeing what others have highlighted and being able to highlight/copy/paste portions of the book for reference. Five Stars on content and Five Stars for it being on Kindle.
