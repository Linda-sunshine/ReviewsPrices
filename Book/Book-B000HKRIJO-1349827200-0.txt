review/summary: This is still a great book!review/text: I first read Mere Christianity many years ago. I re-read it because I wanted to talk with my grandson about being a Christian in the 21st century. Although C.S. Lewis' book was published in the 20th century, his thinking and writing are still insightful and inspiring.
