review/summary: Classic, but not a must...review/text: Overall, this novel was a good read. However, it lulled in many places and a lot of determination was required to finish this novel. I am pleased I did though, as the ending was very well written and the portrayal of characters by Austen (particularly Elizabeth and Darcy) were very captivating - but not on a level with Dickens.As I suggested to a friend, this novel is a classic, by all means read it. However, don't be in a hurry to do so and if you never get round to it, oh well!
