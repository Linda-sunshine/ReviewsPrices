review/summary: Lostreview/text: Brian, a thirteen year old boy, is lost in the Canadian wilderness from a plane crash after the tragedy of the pilot. Brian is alone with few survival skills and tons of unknown animals. While alone in the wilderness, Brian thinks mostly of his parents being divorced. Brian struggles to survive, since he is more of a city boy who knows just about what he reads in books. Brian learns how to do things in the wilderness. He learns how to see things diiferently but one thing holds him back from everything; the secret! The secret is the one reason why Brians parents split up. Brian wants to tell his father but he just can't. I think that if you like books with a bit of mystery and exitement this is the best book. I did this for a fith grade class project and I loved this book.
