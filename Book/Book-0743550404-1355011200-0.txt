review/summary: Not Very Goodreview/text: I was expecting more from Steven King. I bought this because I like the TV show &#34;Haven&#34; and it was suppose to be based on this book. I was really disappointed because I thought it would give more of a background of the show, but I guess Hollywood made it more than it really was.
