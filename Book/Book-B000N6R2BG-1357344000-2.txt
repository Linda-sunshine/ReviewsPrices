review/summary: Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors.review/text: Although this was not my favorite Jodi Picoult book, I liked it. I enjoy the way Jodi writes with suspense and a plot that moves along and keeps your attention. The ending of the book is never obvious...there are plenty of twists and turns along the way.
