review/summary: Obvious Consumerism and It's 'Benefits'.review/text: This is a story of how loud 'leaders' who lack honesty and respect can mislead others who tend to be followers. It is a story of self-centeredness, disrespect, dishonesty and obvious consumerism. It was so discouraging that I finally quit the book, which I very seldom do. There is just no entertainment in self-indulged depravity.
