review/summary: Really good read!review/text: The Hobbit is written a bit differently than The Lord of the Rings and is, at times, much easier to follow. It is a great story of hardship, adventure and sacrifice. It sets up locations and characters that are present in Tolkien 's next tales and makes LOTR easier to understand. I thoroughly enjoyed and loved reading this story!
