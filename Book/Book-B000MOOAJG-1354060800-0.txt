review/summary: The book was big on speeches of Rand doctrinereview/text: I got the book to reread because it is so popular with Paul Ryan and I wanted to understand what his point of view was. The premise is do not GIVE things to people because that diminishes their person-hood. I had read this in college and it fit with my student mentality just fine.
