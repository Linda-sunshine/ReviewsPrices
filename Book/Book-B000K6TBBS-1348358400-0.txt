review/summary: Running Blind (Jack Reacher No. 4)review/text: I thought the ending was a bit "flat" compared to the first three Jack Reacher books. Also, I thought the degree to which the FBI tried to set Reacher up stretched believability and necessity. However, all in all I have enjoyed the Jack Reacher books and will purchase future titles.
