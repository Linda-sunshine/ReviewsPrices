review/summary: Utopiareview/text: This is one of my favorite books of all time. The reasons are even obscure to me but I suppose it is probably because I read it as a student at a critical time of my own development. It questions so much and most of all takes us to the meaning of very fundamental issues in life. I always want to think of it as a bad prediction which never came true but the truth is quite the opposite and that is something which I don't like and don't want to be true. Somehow I need to know that the true meaning of Utopia is based on love. The ideal wine to accompany Nineteen Eighty Four is champagne; it gives you faith in the future.
