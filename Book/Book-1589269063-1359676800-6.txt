review/summary: Wished I read this marriages ago.....review/text: I tell all of my clients about this book, my profession is counseling people through grief and loss. Not only would this book assist people when they are that verge of breaking up, not communicating, literally feeling no hope, it will also help siblings understand parents and why they loved them the way they did growing up. It makes perfect sense to me that we speak different love languages we are not all cut of of the same mold! What feels loving to one person may feel totally annoying and unloving to another. The author works with real couples in the book which could not it make it more clear. You will have your Aha moment!AND give your relationship a beautiful gift.
