review/summary: Draculareview/text: This book is quite different from the movies I have seen. The main characters are the same and the beginning of the story is the same (Jonathan Harker's trip to Dracula's castle) but other than that any similarity is pure coincidental.The book has four major scenes:First is Jonathan's visit to the castle Dracula to hand Dracula his deed of purchase of a property Dracula bought in London. Jonathan eventually escapes. Dracula orchestrated his own journey inside a box.Second: Dracula and his boxes arrive in London. Here we meet Lucy, a friend of Mina, which is Jonathan's fianc&eacute;. Dracula gets hold of her and turns her into a vampire. Dr. Von Helsing is sent for by Lucy's friends to come and help. He figures out what has happened. So Lucy is released from her vampire status by means of a stake through the heart.Third: it is Mina's turn to get relieved of her blood. She is now Jonathan's wife. All her friends now team up to protect her and to fight Dracula to the end. They are successful in so far as to make Dracula flee London and head back (in his box) to his castle in Transylvania.Fourth: the friends chase after Dracula. The ending is for you to read and find out. But I can say it is a bit abrupt (in my opinion). I was hoping for some more melodrama.This is the story, told via diaries from several of the role players, media clippings, letters etc. This makes it interesting and different to most other novels. The only thing that bothered me is that it is slow moving. Many meetings and discussions are narrated in great depth, overshadowing the real actions.Still I enjoyed reading the book.
