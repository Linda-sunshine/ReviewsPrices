review/summary: What a difference two centuries make!review/text: I've read this beautiful novel only three times. A British Prime Minister read it 26. My novel, "The War Less Civil"THE WAR LESS CIVIL, deals with issues Miss Austen would be shocked, and in some cases, horrified by. But never would she fail to understand the unchanging character of the human condition that I wrote about in 19th & 20th century America. Her insights into the human spirit and behavior in the early 1800s, seemingly so simple and commonplace, are as deep as the most profound novelists of any age. If one desires a book offering endless pleasure, one that could be reread once a year for a lifetime, then I strongly urge one to read "Pride and Prejudice."
