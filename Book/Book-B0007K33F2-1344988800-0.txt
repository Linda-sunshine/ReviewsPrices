review/summary: Best revenge book ever!review/text: The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexander Dumas is one of my favorite books. I had to read it for English class and it quickly became one of my favorites. The way that Edmund Dantes goes about taking his revenge on all of the people who had a hand in his imprisonment was enlightening. A well written, can't put this book down read! This is a book that I can, and have, read over and over.
