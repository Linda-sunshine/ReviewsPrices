review/summary: Gone with the Windreview/text: My most favorite book and move of all time. I had not read the book since high school and 50 years later, it still is my most favorite book. I also read &#34;Scarlett&#34; and &#34;Rhett Buttler's People&#34; - sequels to Gone with the Wind. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!
