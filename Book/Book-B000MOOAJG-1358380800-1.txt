review/summary: Relevant book for today's timesreview/text: You would swear this book was written today. Rand weaves a wonderful addictive plot that takes place in a dystopia with philosophy of capitalism, welfare state, and moral ethics. Today's health care, destructive welfare culture, fiscal cliff, the 1%, corporate bail-outs, government industrial subsidies are all in this book. I understand why this book has become &#34;cult-like&#34; to Rand fans. More current than some of today's political pundit books and it has a great story.
