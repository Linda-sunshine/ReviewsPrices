review/summary: Great Book,..as prophetic as it getsreview/text: I am not going to add in to the already voluminous verbiage on the brilliance of Ayn Rand But this book is worth the lengthy read,.. says much about the cannibals we are dealing with in the 21st century and considering it was published in 1957,.. amazingly accurate!
