review/summary: P&Preview/text: How can one describe Pride and Prejudice in a few words? Impossible. This is one of the best novels in the English language, both for style and content. The various movies and TV editions, though excellent and immensely entertaining, do not do the novel justice. All I can say is "Read it."
