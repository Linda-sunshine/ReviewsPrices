review/summary: Yawnreview/text: This novel might have made a decent short story of about 50-60 pages. After you've read that far you've gotten all there is to be gleaned from it and it's a struggle to proceed further. Yes, we get it Margaret Atwood, you find religious extremism scary. And well you should, when we've seen what the Taliban and Islamic fundamentalists have done to women and gays all over the world. Had your story been more mythical, as opposed to a poorly veiled attack on Christian fundamentalists (and I am not one so I have no particular dog in this fight) it could have been intriguing. Instead we have a dull and misguided polemic about how backward and misogynistic Christian evangelicals are.
