review/summary: Love.review/text: Jane Eyre is a wonderful novel. Jane is such a strong character and considering the time this book was written, its amazing to me. Mr. Rochester is such a protype of the male hero we see now. It is one of those books that make me want to cheer the characters on, weep with them when terrible things happen or slap the living crap out of a certain male cousin. One of my favorites!
