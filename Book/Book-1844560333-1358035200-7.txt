review/summary: Timeless novel to read more than once or twice in a lifetime!!review/text: I have read this book five or six times! It is almost lyrical, or musical in the cadence of delivery. I do love it. I will read it again and again. It is like Jane Austen crystalized a period for us and polished it into a gem to enjoy for lifetimes to come!
