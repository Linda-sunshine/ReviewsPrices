review/summary: Excellent studyreview/text: Victor Frankl shows himself to be very timely even years after the event he describes. His insight into human behavior continues to offer guidance in our current experiences. Though the tragic events have their own authenticity, the lessons Dr. Frankl provides are freshly verified in out times. A better appreciation of humans' ability to find meaning in the slightest or most tragic events could provide a bridge across cultures and individual experiences and reveal a bond of humanity.
