review/summary: Interesting Bibical readreview/text: I found this a rather interesting dramatization of the story of King Hezekiah, heir to the throne of King David. While I understand the story is based on the writings from the bible, I realize that this is also a story which has truth and fiction blended together in a interesting and thoughtful story. Very much enjoyed it and look forward to reading additional stories taken from the bible by Lynn.
