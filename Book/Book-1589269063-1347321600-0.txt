review/summary: Gets the Dialogue Startedreview/text: I found this book to be so helpful in my current relationship. I especially liked that you can go to the website and take the test to find out what your love language is. I sent my results to my partner, not really thinking he would take it very seriously but he took the test too, and sent his results back to me and we talked about it. The Five Love Languages has really helped me to let go of my stubbornness and pay attention. I've learned that I just need to communicate in a language my partner can understand. It has made my life so much easier!
