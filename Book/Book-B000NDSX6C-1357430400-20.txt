review/summary: My travels start with Bilbo...review/text: I have read The Hobbit more times than I can even remember. I now am over 80 years of age and still love to travel with Mr. Baggins and the dwarfs and last but not least, Gandaff. I cannot read very long at a.... time anymore because of poor eyesight..but once again I have started off on my travels with good company...looking for the dragon and the treasure!
