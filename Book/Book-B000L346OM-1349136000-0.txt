review/summary: Philosophy Classicreview/text: Despite being an inmate in a Nazi death camp, Frankl realizes meaning in his life. He also invents the theory of logotherapy, an existentialist analysis/psychotherapy based upon finding meaning in one'(tm)s life. I recommend this book to anyone who feels that life has dealt them a bad hand or anyone interested in finding their place in the universe.
