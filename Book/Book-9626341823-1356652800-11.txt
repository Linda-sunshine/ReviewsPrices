review/summary: A great piece written by a great authorreview/text: I have begun to think that just recently the books we have begun to forget like this one are some of the burst writings that we know of. This book is a fantasy and a classic from many years ago and is still treasured today. Thinking about it, some of the, no, most of the books from properties like "Alice in wonderland" and the Grimm fairytales are what fuel our minds and without them we wouldn't have the fantastic minds we have today. We write using their methods and their knowledge but they wrote without many book to mentor them.
