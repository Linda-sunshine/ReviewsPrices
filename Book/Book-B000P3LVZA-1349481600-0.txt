review/summary: Woe of the Worldreview/text: I had read this book as a required reading in college (many years ago) and I had forgotten how dismal I thought it was back then. My view has not changed. It give credence to the suggestion that a group of monkies hammering away at a bevy of typewriters could somehow produce a work of this sort. It appears that Huxley simply entered random words on paper as they popped up in his brain(?). Brave New Worlds, indeed.I would suggest reading Mad Magazine instead.
