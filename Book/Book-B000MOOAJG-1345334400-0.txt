review/summary: Why so longreview/text: I think the book is good and makes an interesting point. I don't think people should go out and try to live by Ayn Rand's teachings but I make the assumption that, as fiction, that was not the point. My criticism is just that her story could have been told with half the words (see 1984). After a while, I found myself saying, "you said that" or "I don't care anymore".
