review/summary: Good Read, Slow for a long time but came together wellreview/text: Lee Child's Jack Reacher: One Shot is a book that I only heard of after seeing teaser footage from the upcoming movie. The concept in the teaser was rather nebulous but proved to be enough for me to look into it. Honestly, I'm glad I did as the read was worth my time. It was entertaining, well thought out, well written, and while it started off very slow, and remained so for the majority of the book, it managed to keep me interested enough to make it through to the other side satisfied. I will say I had some major flash backs, regularly, throughout the book to when I read 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo". If you have read that book then you will know what I mean, unless I'm crazy.In the end a good story and I will actually go back and start at the beginning of the Jack Reacher novels because of it.
