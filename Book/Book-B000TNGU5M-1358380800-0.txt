review/summary: Amazingreview/text: This book is full of heart break and sadness. Perhaps it's more saddening because these are real accounts of the holocaust. However, though this book is at some points very saddening, it's at tremendous read. And I recommend this book to anyone especially if they are seeking to read a holocaust book.
