review/summary: Struck by similaritiesreview/text: This is a classic I never read before, but the Kindle price was certainly right. I enjoyed it, but as much for the history of English law regarding estates as for character development and plot. I was struck by the similarities between Pride and Prejudice and PBS' series Downton Abbey--same issues regarding inheritance of a major estate when all the children are daughters, the role of a male relative, the ambiguous relationship between the male and female protagonists, etc.
