review/summary: A Classic That Will Never Get Oldreview/text: Where do you start? This book is an epic journey where good must continuously battle evil. If you like the movie, there is enough that is different in the book to enjoy it. This version is the most accurate version of what Tolkien wrote. Read the section at the beginning to get the whole story.
