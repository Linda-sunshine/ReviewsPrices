review/summary: Better than the moviereview/text: I'm a big fan of the movie. Decided to rad on kindle (book is big so easier on kindle). So much better than the movie. I did have the movie characters in my head while I was reading, but that just made it do much more real. The movie is great, but the book is just so much better!
