review/summary: An epic classic!review/text: My daughter, a Freshman in High School, was assigned this book to read. As I had never read it, I decided that we would read it together. Upon completion, we were both pleasantly surprised that this was not a boring, mandatory read; but one that we finished very quickly and enjoyed discussing. Thank you Mr. Costa (my daughter's English teacher)!
