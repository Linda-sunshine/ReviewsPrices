review/summary: Everyone today should read this!review/text: Wow! Although first published in 1957 this novel contains an absolutely a compelling story very relevant for today. Our current political climate seems to parallel what is described in this novel. Are we headed for the same disaster? &#34;They don't give their fair share.&#34; &#34;Universal healthcare.&#34; &#34;To each according to his needs.&#34;As a person who at heart is rather liberal socially but who is practically conservative, I found this novel rather scary.The story is a bit one sided in that it portrays the &#34;industrialists/producers&#34; as always right and virtuous and the &#34;socialists/do-gooders&#34; as totally villains. Knowing many folks on both sides of this fence I recognize this to be a gross exaggeration. Some on each side are evil and some are good but most are in between.As I read the book I couldn't help but recall a conversation I had with a relative who was a staunch union man. He told me how much he disdained a very successful business man. He said that the man was a scum bag who was taking advantage of all the poor who worked for him. I thought about it for a minute an replied, &#34;I tend to agree with you but we need to recognize that if it were not for this &#34;scum bag&#34; those same people would not even have work.&#34;If we make sure everyone &#34;gives his fair share&#34; and &#34;take care of everyone's needs&#34; we may find that no one has the incentive to produce and have that &#34;fair share&#34; to give. How then do we take care of the needs?
