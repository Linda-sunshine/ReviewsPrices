review/summary: You think Mittbot is bad? Read The Handmaid's Tale.review/text: The Handmaid's Tale is one of the scariest books I have ever read; the most frightening aspect of the book is how POSSIBLE it is. The society portrayed in Atwood's world feels eerily close to political themes bandied today: conservative religious fervor resulting in a theologically fascist state where woman's rights have regressed to a pre-reformation level of oppression and control, facilitated by systematic brainwashing and aversive control. This book is a must read for progressive women everywhere.
