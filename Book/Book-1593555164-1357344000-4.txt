Okay, so I am already hooked and I will probably not stop until I have read all of the Jack Reacher novels. This guy gets himself in all kinds of situations, the action is always fast and you have to keep reading to find out what happens next - who are the bad guys and who are the good guys, it is sometimes hard to tell but that is what makes this novel good..
