review/summary: Wonderful bed-time storyreview/text: My daughter (9) was having a really hard time falling asleep this Christmas Eve and I thought it would be nice to share the original version of this poem with her. She thought the introduction was a little long but I enjoyed the history a lot. My daughter liked it a lot! Especially knowing it was written for the author's own children :) would recommend to any parent and child who enjoy original literature and this classic poem
