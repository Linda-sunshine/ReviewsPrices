review/summary: Encouraging bookreview/text: I am reading this book for the second time. It has a calming effect on me. Brother Andrew encourages the Chrirtian to focus on keeping God close even in simple tasks. This helps keep life from getting too complicated and includes our maker in every decision. I believe this book will be helpful to anyone who wants to know God better.
