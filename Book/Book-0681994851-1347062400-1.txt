review/summary: Charlotte Bronte's writing is like food for the soul!review/text: One of the most delicious books I have ever read. Bronte's command of the words she uses to paint a picture are exquisite. My sister and I decided a few years ago to read some of the 'classics' we had overlooked. Jane Eyre was our first selection. We are forever grateful we did not pass through this life without reading it. Oh, what we would have missed!
