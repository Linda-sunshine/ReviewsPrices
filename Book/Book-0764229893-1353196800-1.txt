review/summary: Wonderful book! Can't wait to read the rest of the series.review/text: This was a Scripturally accurate work of fiction that brought a wonderful depth of understanding to the book of Chronicles. I will never read it quite the same again, as I now have images of just what the reality of worshipping idols meant. Its one thing to know in your mind that Molech required child sacrifice, its quite another to see it unfold in this story.
