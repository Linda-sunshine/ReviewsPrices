review/summary: The Hobbit - Read and read againreview/text: I wanted to read this book again because, after watching Peter Jackson's film of the first part, I was not sure I had seen the same depth when I read it as a young adult many years ago. I was pleasantly surprised. Although the book had the same avuncular, almost childish, style I remembered, the depth of story and myth telling was there in spades and I could see why it was such a mine of a story for the film maker. The Hobbit should never be read as a predecessor to The Lord of the Rings, but it remains an ancillary story which is fun, and tempts the reader to explore the whole Tolkeinverse.
