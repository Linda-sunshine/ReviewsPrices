review/summary: Don't get what all the fuss is aboutreview/text: I was not assigned this book in English class or anywhere else - I decided to read it out of my own initiative. I LOVED (became slightly obsessed) with Jane Eyre and figured this might fall in the same category. Unfortunately, I was very wrong.The writing is so utterly dull. I cannot understand where this great love comes from between Catherine and Heathcliff - they are just in "love" and we are supposed to believe it. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if it was not told by Nelly's accounts, whom I find extremely annoying, overly motherly and controlling for a servant. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters and just wished they would all die already, as seemed to be the prevalent theme throughout the novel.I also found it somewhat disturbing how easily people married their first-cousins back in those days. I get it - it's the 1800s, but really does Cathy have to go from marrying one first cousin to the next? Is there no one else in this town that she is not related to?!I was really hoping to enjoy this book - especially considering this is such a "classic". But I find myself underwhelmed and wonder if people have just not picked up better books in their lives to find more interesting. I'm just glad I got this as a free download and did not waste a cent on it.
