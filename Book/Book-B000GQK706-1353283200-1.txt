review/summary: Richly Conceively and Beautifully Done.review/text: Wiser reviewers than I have written better than I could hope to. Heck, this trilogy (and other Tolkien creations) are college courses on many prestigious campuses. And yet, I still have to comment because this world created by Tolkien has left such a stamp on my taste.I found Bilbo, quickly followed by Frodo, in the 5th grade and never looked back as I followed them into a world populated by Dwarves, Orcs, and Elves. In a very real sense I stepped out that door with Bilbo and found adventures and terrors that have rarely been matched and never been outdone.I have been a regular reader of the trilogy ever since, coming back time and again and never failing to come away with some new enjoyment. At first it was simply the fascination with the sheer fantasy: The characters, The settings, The battles. Then the depth of his world pulled me in. I often found myself reading the glossary and studying the various languages and histories of the races for hours before re-reading the story. And then again after because I didn't want to say good-bye so soon. Finally, well past my own innocence I began to see new complexities and allegories that have only served to deepen my appreciation for this modern myth that Tolkien created.But always and above all else, it was simply the story. Yes Tolkien was an incredibly gifted writer but he, too me, was first and foremost a fantastic story teller. And whenever I want to leave the academic exercises behind, go back to the 5th grade, and lose myself in a great tale, Frodo is always there waiting.
