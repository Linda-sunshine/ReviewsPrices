review/summary: all politicians should read it!!review/text: I read this book for the first time about 50 years ago and remember having enjoyed it even then. Of course Ayn Rand deals in extremes. Her pictures are black and white only without any shade. I can identify myself with her partially, but not totally. Too much government is bad for everybody, rich or poor because government does know about collectecting money (taxes), but in most cases is unable to spend it correctly. Same thing with people: the ones who do not know how to make it, not only do spend other peoples money (social security) wrongly but start depending on it and asking for more without making an own effort to improve their situation. I'm not against helping the poor and needy, but a strict control is absolutely necessary. I'm considering myself a democrat, but do share at least partially the worries of the republicans.
