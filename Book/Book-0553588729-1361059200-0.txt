review/summary: Worth It but Wordyreview/text: This is an excellent book. The idea of the fourth trimester is genius and we have a very well adjusted happy baby because of the ideas in this book, with that said the book could be much shorter than it is. It is poorly written and states the same ideas over and over. We found we skimmed the important ideas rather than reading word for word.
