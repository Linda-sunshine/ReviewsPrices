review/summary: Man's Search for Meaningreview/text: The first part of the book was well-written, poignant and interesting. However the second part was pendantic and thus boring. The author would have been better served if he used the examples in the first part of the book to sparingly illustrate the philosophy and theory in the second part of the book.
