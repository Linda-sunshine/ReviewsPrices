review/summary: Informativereview/text: The information in this book/ the concept is awesome the only two negative things I have to say are 1) the book could have been summed up in fewer pages ( quite a bit of unnecessary dialogue) and 2) it seems the book was written more for men at some parts the author could have been more general (especially since he already has another book designed specifically for men). but again i reiterate i love the concept of 5 different languages and partners speaking a different one.I think this is a perfect gift for newlyweds.
