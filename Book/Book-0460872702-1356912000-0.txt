review/summary: WHY AREN'T YOU READING THIS RIGHT NOW MY GODreview/text: If I could go back and time and tell high school me to actually read this book for class instead of ignoring it and assuming it must have been bad... Ah...The fact is that Gatsby deserves its consideration as a Great American Novel. It's fascinating in language, story, and scope (as well as, you know, meaning), and it's like as American as possible. Unlike many other modernist American novels, it actually explores America in America from an American perspective. Like, it doesn't take place in Europe and it isn't about America compared to Europe. It is actually able to comment on American aristocracy as it is because of this, not as it is in comparison to other societies. So, seriously on the 'America' part of 'Great American Novel' is what I mean.I actually feel hesitant to write a review on it. Everything that needs to be said about The Great Gatsby is is the book. Everything I could write has been explained better by Fitzgerald. This is by no means a bad thing (check out my rating, come on), and in fact it's a great achievement. Fitzgerald managed to embody the modernist idea of an artwork that stands for itself, by no means an easy task. This is a book that must be read.
