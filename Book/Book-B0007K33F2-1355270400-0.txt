review/summary: Great Novelreview/text: IT has themes of betrayal, love, duels. This is not an in depth review but I wanted to mention that I would not normally choose this book if I were to see it in a library. My English professor made us read this, and I am glad she did. (I am fairly young too and it kept my interest!). It had a great plot, it did get a little slow towards the beginning, but it was a well written book with lots of depth. The movies gave it no justice! Do yourself a favor, read this
