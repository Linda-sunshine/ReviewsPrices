review/summary: Just try to figure who did it without reading the end firstreview/text: This was my fourth Jack Reacher novel in as many books. Lee Child delves deeper into the psyche of Jack Reacher, exploring his need to wander, his desire for the freedom of the road. In the previous book, Reacher finds what could be the love of his life, Jodie, the daughter of the general who made his career and was like a second father to the big lug. But Reacher needs constant change. He doesn't want baggage or a mortgage. He's an unusual guy, a constant ass pain to authority. He gets things done his way. Not theirs. This theme permeates &#34;Running Blind,&#34; where the mystery of former women soldiers appears impossible to solve. Child takes it right to the end before he lets any of this make sense. Fun ride.
