review/summary: Regret Not Reading Soonerreview/text: Unfortunately, I was never into these books as much as my peers were until recently. I got a free month of amazon prime on my new Kindle Fire and I thought: "What the heck, Harry Potter's free, might as well give it a try." I didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as I did. Harry Potter really does deserve all the recognition it gets! This book took me on a journey that I never imagined experiencing. J.K. Rowling' s writing and use of detail are flawless and extremely captivating. I strongly suggest reading the books if you've only just seen the movies. The books make the movie experience just that much more amazing, and I look forward to enjoying the rest of this series. Again, I honestly regret not hopping on the bandwagon sooner!
