review/summary: Classic Draculareview/text: This version was a bit harder to get into than I was anticipating, but the story was good. Classic Dracula story, without all the gore. I liked how it was written in diary and journal entries, making it seem more realistic, like someone actually gathered the information themselves to provide the story.
