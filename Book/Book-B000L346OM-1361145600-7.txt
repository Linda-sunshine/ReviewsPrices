review/summary: The content of this book tells of the ability to have a meaningful life no matter how entirely grim your life presently is.review/text: This book has been a college required reading in some schools.It tells of a man living in a concentration camp in implorable conditions. He observes how human nature drives some of the prisioners and the ways their lives are lived simply through the mind and the thoughts one gives it.You can also actually feel what he lived through and the process after the American's set the people free and the way life had changed for them. Also you can see the victory achieved by 'right thoughts'. Very powerful book. I'm glad to have it on my bookshelf next to &#34;Night&#34; by Elie Wiesel which was a winner of The Nobel Peace Prize.The horrors allow you to look at mans inhumanity to man and know you want to empower yourself to move toward love and forgiveness.
