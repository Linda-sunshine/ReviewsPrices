review/summary: Romance.... Yeah rightreview/text: I usually stay away from classics since most likely I won't like it at all, but since I like romance and heard that Wuthering Heights is a great classic story, I decided to give it try.I just don't see how can this be a great classic romance story. There was hardly any romance. The characters aren't likeable that I just wanted them to just die basically. The whole story was just so boring and had this dark depressing feeling to it, which basically is the main point of the story.This will be the first and last time that I will read Wuthering Heights. Good thing I downloaded the book for free and didn't spend a penny on it.
