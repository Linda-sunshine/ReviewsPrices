review/summary: Would you believe I've never read this before now?review/text: Truly a classic. This story had popped up in my childhood first as a Disney movie and later as an elementary school play. However, up until now I've never actually sat down and read the book. I wasn't disappointed.If you are looking for an illustrated version, keep looking. This version is only text. It allows for the readers imagination to "see" the story. Some of the imagery is convoluted and makes this a challenge, but in a good way.Nothing is better than enjoying a good book on a dreary afternoon. The remembrance of childhood was just an added bonus.
