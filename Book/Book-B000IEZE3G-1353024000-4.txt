review/summary: Great and enjoyable readreview/text: I first read this book back in 2006 when I had a surgery during summer on my leg and was unable to participate in normal summer activities. Let's just say I was glad I picked this book. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was the beginning to a long and wonderful series that I got to read. This book started it all off and with a bang. It is an exciting adventure throughout the whole book showing the story of a boy looked down upon by the world but little do they know he has magical powers. Such a fun and exciting book for kids and even adults. Continues to let the mind wonder and create this image with magic and spells. Along with this, it keeps your attention the whole time. Each page contains exciting new information, it is just hard to put it down. Could not wait to get my hands on the second book after I finished this one. Such a great series and would recommend it to anyone who wants a fun and enjoyable read. My kids will be reading these books in the future.
