review/summary: Gondor needs no King!review/text: I watched the movies before I read the books so I had a preconceived vision of what the characters and landscapes looked like but I don't think this matters at all. It's always interesting to see how closely the screenplay matches the original novel. I think the most impressive aspect of TLOTR is the environment and civilisations that Tolkien has created. He was apparently an accomplished linguist and it show in his creation of the fantasy languages in the novel.The fact that this novel has a cult following not just with fantasy nerds but also many other subcultures shows it's attraction and perfection.
