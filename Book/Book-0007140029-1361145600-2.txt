review/summary: Awesome Seriesreview/text: My eleven-year-old began reading these books at Christmas. Before that, he told me he would never read a book of more than a hundred pages because it was too long. It's two and a half months later and he is deep into the twelfth book in the series. The longer titles run around three hundred pages, and he finished one of them in twenty-four hours. He's nuts about the Warriors books, and so am I.The authors have taken several classic plots and woven them into an exciting storyline for kids and adults. Graystripe and Silverstream are Romeo and Juliet. Fireheart balances his loyalty to Thunder Clan with the love for his kittypet sister. Their social order is honor-bound. Kids get into the rigid structure of right and wrong - following the Warrior Code at all times. Tigerclaw is a satisfying villain that you love to hate. Negative reviewers said the books were too violent and they were offput by the description of how the cats killed and ate their prey, but my strict vegetarian son had no problem with this. He understands that it's natural for carnivores take pride in their hunting ability.The vocabulary is challenging for kids without being intimidating. These books are best described as Lord of the Rings with cats as the main characters. Fireheart is on a quest to save the clan, protect his family and lead fearlessly. If your children enjoy fairy tales from King Arthur to Star Wars, pick up this series. It made a reader out of my son, and I am grateful for that.
