review/summary: Must read!review/text: This is a must read for any man in a relationship whether you are married or not and especially for those like myself that have been married for 20+ years! Dr. Chapman does an excellent job of writing this from a man's perspective so that we can easily understand the opposite sex and how to figure out their love language. While I would like to think that my wife and don't have that many problems, after 28 years its easy to get in a rut, doing the same things day in and day out and forgetting what it really takes to make a good marriage even stronger. I owe a big thanks to my wife for suggesting that we read the book together, wish we had done it years ago!
