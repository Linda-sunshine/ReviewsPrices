review/summary: I heart Tolkien!!!review/text: What can I say about The Hobbit? Here's my review in one word: Awesomeness.J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the greatest authors ever and if we're being honest, I'll stop being your friend if you say anything bad about his stories or him.It's been so long since I've read the Hobbit that it was like reading it for the first time. I forgot so much of it and I love Tolkien's way of telling a story. I laughed at many lines, grew to love each character and was reminded again that Tolkien was a genius. If you've never read the books, put them next on your list!He created a language, incredible story lines, creativity beyond most people and even today's famous books are influenced by his story (I love me some Harry Potter, but you can't help but notice the similarities with Lord of the Rings). I am so excited to see the movie coming out this weekend! Not sure how three movies will pan out, but I figure that's just more Tolkien radness on the big screen.After every read or re-read of Tolkien, I'm left with one single question: Is it too much to ask for Middle Earth to be real and for me to be an elf or rider of Rohan?I didn't think so either.
