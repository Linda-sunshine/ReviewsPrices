review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I expected an adventure similar to the grandeur of the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; and I am very disappointed. I have read 60% and the best I can say is that the plot is flat. Tolkien learned from his mistakes in this novel when he wrote the Ring Trilogy. This book is not worth purchasing.
