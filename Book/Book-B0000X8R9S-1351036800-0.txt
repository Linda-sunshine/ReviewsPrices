review/summary: A Must Read!review/text: Gary Paulson has written many good books, but Hatchet is exceptional! Young Brian finds himself lost in the Canadian wilderness. Brian must learn to use local plants, animals, and even a rock overhang to survive. Brian is a smart teenager,but always lived in the city. He felt lonely and thinking about his mom's cooking made him senseless. My favorite scene was when a moose pushes Brian in a lake. I recomend this book because it makes the reader experience a variety of feelings. Will.
