review/summary: A Second Rate "1984"review/text: Brave New World is a unique satire on contemporary society. It uses a futuristic utopia to critique modern (1932) issues of science, religion, and society in general.The problem with the novel is style. It's pedantic. There are a few gems in Brave New World. For example, in the beginning when Huxley goes between narratives 2-3 times per page. However, for the most part, Huxley bluntly reiterates the same ideas. The Savage's conversations on the virtue of Shakespearean morality is especially obtuse.Orwell's "1984" is a masterpiece. In comparison, "Brave New World" felt like a sophomoric attempt.
