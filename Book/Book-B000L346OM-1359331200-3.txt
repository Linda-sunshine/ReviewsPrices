review/summary: Not what i expected.review/text: I enjoyed this book tremendously. I highly recommend this to anyone who thinks they've got it bad. What i found interesting was that it is a self help book in disguise. The message is that things are only as bad as you make them, and that there is always something or someone worth living for.
