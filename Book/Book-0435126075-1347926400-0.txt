review/summary: Large Print Pride and Prejudicereview/text: There is nothing to say about "Pride and Prejudice" that most readers don't already know. It is a brilliant novel from the pen of Jane Austen, and therefore should be read be every intelligent person. I already had a copy or two of the book, as well as countless film versions, but I needed a large print edition since I'm now old. And it's nice to be able to read the book without my glasses again. So if you're in your 40s and love this book, your home library or bedside table needs this large print edition of it.
