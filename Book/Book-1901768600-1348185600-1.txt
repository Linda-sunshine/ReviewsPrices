review/summary: Jane Austen Persuasionreview/text: It took a little getting used to the phrasing being used in the early Eighteen Hundreds. (So many commas.) But as I began to get into the story it held me entralled. I could easily visualize the characters and relate to their feelings. The discriptions are so appealing of the countryside in which the story takes place. Ms Austen paints a broad picture with her words.I found it very hard to put down. I wasn't sure that I could enjoy this book on the Kindle but found it just as engrossing as a hard cover book.
