review/summary: My first dark cravingreview/text: i have to confess this was the first book to whet forever my craving for darkness. it seems so light and brainy after years; but then i can go back and read again and again, now it only takes an hour or two, and each read it pulls me back into that original mood like giant vultures' wings slowly flapping over me. heathcliff is of course the most truthful embodiment of a woman's fantasy. emily dug far down, long before evolution was the buzz word, when all we knew was that adam and eve fell, and emily knew the coldness of life's force. my professors, one of these i'm thinking of male, the other female, dismissed my theory as misreading of a revolutionily defiant woman. how can they be so far from their own guts? the worse was the male professor, a diehard wimp-roaster who was jealous of heathcliff's hardness and fevered coldness. even my deep love kate bush missed the mood with her whininess of "heathcliff it's me Cathy i'm coming home now"--so much sentimentality! emily goes further into any heart of darkness that light and cheery old joseph ever could dare. even though this masterpiece has seemed airier and brighter now i've dipped further, in other works, it is so strong it can still trick me back into its spell.
