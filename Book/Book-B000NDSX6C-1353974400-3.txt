review/summary: Beautifulreview/text: Beautiful reproduction, high-quality printing and materials, sturdy jacket. beautiful addition to my library.I love how it preserves the book the way Tolkien originally intended it to be. It even added the coloring to the jacket that was originally taken out by the printer due to cost issues. If only all great classics were recreated to imitate the first editions!
