review/summary: Romance revisited and absolutely enjoyable!review/text: first read Jane Eyre when I was fifteen. It was such a wonderful joy to my then teenage mind full of dreams of love one day.Rereading it every now and then it takes on new understanding each timeThe language would be difficult for teens today (no lol or texting talk!!) But I hope some will try-it is a very good storyAll in all I loved it all over again!!
