review/summary: Atlas Shruggedreview/text: I was excited to get my copy of Atlas Shrugged. It came in paperback form and was reasonably priced. The only real problem with the book is the type is so small that I cannot read it...kind of like the extremely small print in Amazons 'The Fine Print" rules!! So much for small factor paperbacks!!
