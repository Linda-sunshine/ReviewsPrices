review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: This is not the first time I have read The Hobbit but it's exciting to have it on Kindle. I did not want to pull out an old paper copy and now with Kindle, I didn't have to. Over the last many years reading The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, it has been a pleasure. More so now with this technology. I urge you to do the same.
