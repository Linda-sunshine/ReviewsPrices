review/summary: Read it before you see the movie!review/text: I think I read this in high school but didn't remember it at all. With the new movie coming out I felt it was appropriate to read it first since it is a classic. The story is a simple one we know well - a tragic love triangle (but more like a love octagon) but we see everything through the eyes of Nick Carraway, who is just a witness to it all like us. Just like we are fascinated by rich, famous people, Nick is fascinated by Jay Gatsby and we get brought into his world. Definitely liking forward to the movie and then re-reading it!
