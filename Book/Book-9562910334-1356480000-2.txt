review/summary: Powerful!review/text: Powerful imagination of Orwell shines in this stounding novel. Through out the novel, you reach for some shred of hope, some inspiration to hold on to. You will NOT get any. What is depressing about this book, is that it is acutally not all fiction. It is really happening in our world in some degree in a country or another. I actually had nightmares about Orwell's 1984's world during the time I was reading this book. Then I read Animal Farm and it reminded me so much of what happened to many countries after revolution. It seemed that he had predicted the whole ordeal. I am so depressed reading these two novels back to back. I may have to order a silly shallow love story to forget about real life tragedies for a while!!!!
