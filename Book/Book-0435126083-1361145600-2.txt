review/summary: May be a Great Movie but....review/text: I wanted to read this book guided my by my thought as &#34;it must be a great book, because Hollywood has filmed this book 4 times&#34;. There is some misery at the beginning which drags you into the book, but especially during the second part of the book mainly the third generation of the characters I found myself reading the same type of cruelty and anger exposed by Mr Heathcliff to young generation even to his own child over and over again, so the book lost the plot and it became a blind vengeance of a man who has been tortured during his childhood. Now I'm thinking what atracted the movie makers? the blind passionate of this guy?
