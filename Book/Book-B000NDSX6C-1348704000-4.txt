review/summary: Entertaining read.review/text: I have read all three Lords books, and in fact I read them before watching any of the movies. I enjoyed all three books more than the movies. this book most probably will be the same also, as it entertained me; it was an easy read, with the same style as the trilogy books. If you want to read a book that will not tire your brain, like after work, at night before bed, and you like the Lord of the Rings storyline, then its a good idea to buy, enjoy yet another JRRTolkien book.
