review/summary: Easy readreview/text: This book is an easy read. The charactors are lovable, the story line is easy to follow and slightly unexpected. This book has meaning, depending on where you are in your life and what life challenges you had or are going through it will effect you differently. Very good book. I will read again knowing my take will be different next time around.
