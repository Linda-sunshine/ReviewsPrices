review/summary: An fun adventure talereview/text: This light-hearted tale is surprisingly great. I first read this book when I was 20 years old, so I didn't have the attachment to it like many people I know. I read it, enjoyed it, but felt like it was a trifle compared to The Lord of the Rings books that I read soon afterwards.I've gone back to reread the book in preparation for the new movies. I'm glad I did. Tolkien's writing is fantastic. His authorial interventions give the book a good dose of humor and set up the tension for the story very well. Gollum emerges as a well-defined character right from the start. The "Riddles in the Dark" chapter is definitely the highlight of the book.I had a few issues with the book. Some of the resolution to the story isn't as satisfying as I'd like (certain actions are done "off screen" and other actions are performed by minor characters that we haven't followed on the adventures). There are so many characters (specifically dwarfs), that very few leave a real lasting impression. The book doesn't line up very well with the sequel, but I guess that is more the problem for the sequel.In the end I was surprised how much I got sucked into the book and the writing right away. The world of Middle Earth isn't as fleshed out and "real" as it is in the Lord of the Rings, but what is here is a great adventure tale that is thrilling and well-written.
