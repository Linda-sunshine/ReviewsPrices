review/summary: AMAZING!!!review/text: I purchased this book after looking at quite a few books online and in various book stores, I said at less than $5.00, it's worth a try! I just received my book!! WOW!! It is beyond beautiful! It is stunning! I wanted a book that I could read to my son (5 mths currently) for his first Christmas (yes I am thinking ahead!) and that I could start a tradition on Christmas Eve, we could cosy up by the Christmas Tree and read, but nothing caught my eye, I read the previous reviews and decided on this book. I thought it would be a standard sized book and fairly decent at the for the price... Its a huge beautiful table top, beautifully bound, beautifully illustrated and i love that it has little facts, cut outs, interactive bits and pieces and activities included. This book is more than worth it for the life time of memories you will create with it!
