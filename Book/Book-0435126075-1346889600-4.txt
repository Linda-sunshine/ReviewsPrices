review/summary: Pride and Prejudicereview/text: The print of this book is attractive as is the simple cover. The size is standard but handy so I can put it in a tote or bookbag and have it ready for access whenever I have a spare moment. So far it is sturdy and doesn't look dog-eared even when it's been toted many places.
