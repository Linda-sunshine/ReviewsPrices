review/summary: Jodi Picoult is an excellent writer...review/text: This is surely one of her best books. Got me so absorbed in the characters & their story that Istayed up way past my bedtime wide awake because I was intrigued & wanted to know what happened next.This book was worth losing sleep over. A definite must-read!!
