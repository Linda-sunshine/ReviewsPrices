review/summary: Awful. How can somebody like it?review/text: I must say for starters that I am 38, so maybe this book is for teens only. I have read other YA novels which I enjoyed (like the Twilight Saga or The Hunger Games) but this was hard to finish. A huge disappointment. Characters are shallow and unrealistic. You don't get to connect with them. There are no surprises, you can tell what is going to happen from minute 1. Just Terrible.
