review/summary: Very good readreview/text: A very good holiday read to help remind you the positive side of people, situations and the holidays. Of course it is well written, it would not have risen to it high status without being so. If you've seen any version of the movie, take the time to read the book. The descriptions in the book are just as vibrant as the movie(s) and have the benefit of the authors reasons for the imagery.
