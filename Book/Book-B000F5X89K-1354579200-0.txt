review/summary: Unexpectedreview/text: Unexpected because: 1. I didn't realize that it would be like reading Austen - similar, flowery style from a similar era, and 2. I didn't realize how different the story was from the movies. This book has themes about the responsibility of the Creator, about selfishness. I enjoyed it and am glad I read it. If you read it, be sure to get an edition with a good introduction - the background is quite interesting.
