review/summary: A nice story for teenagersreview/text: The Giver by Lowry is an exciting book for teenagers, that we read in the school. It is a very imagination story and I like how Lois Lowry describes the memories that The Giver transmitts to Jonas, the protagonist of the book. The characters are described in great detail and also the community. It is also a very funny book where all the rules are important for childs. I could image the landscape very well. Some chapters are a bit boring, because they were a bit to detailed. I recommend this book for all how like imaginative stories.
