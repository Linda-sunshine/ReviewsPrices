review/summary: I really, really liked this bookreview/text: Although familiar with the Old Testament, this particular story is not one with a lot of detail, or often retold. So...the culture was familiar only in a vague way. I really liked the way the author took the few facts from the Bible and constructed a compelling story. I enjoyed it very much!
