review/summary: It might take you a few tries to get through...review/text: While some of the passages are rather hard to get through as they go into excruciating detail about the ship on the sea, the men on the ship on the sea, the ropes on the ship on the sea with the men, the mooring-clips the ropes are attached to on the ship by the men in the sea... The action of this novel and its imagery and prose of foreshadowing make it a worthy classic. Characters are well defined and often poignant. Everybody should at least attempt this book at least twice in their lives.
