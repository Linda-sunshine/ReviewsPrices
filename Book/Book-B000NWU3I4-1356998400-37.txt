review/summary: Lovely Bookreview/text: I find the book very interesting and entertaining. I find all of the characters quite amusing, especially Bilbo Baggins. I didn't dislike anything about it , although I don't know what half the words mean, but that can be overlooked. One of the best so far that I have read!
