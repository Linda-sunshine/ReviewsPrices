review/summary: Great story line, but the editor should be fired!review/text: I read this book with my 11 year old son. It was a very good book. The story line was eloquently written and very descriptive. A real page turner! However, the character repeats words in almost every paragraph which was really annoying. Like "the hatchet, I'll have to get the hatchet. Somehow I'll have to get the hatchet.". "food is survival. If I want to survive I'll have to get food to survive. ". All in all a very good read that will keep your young adult wanting more.
