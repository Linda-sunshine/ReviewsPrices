review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: This book is great. The author has captured the character of the time and people very well. It's great to read a fictional recreation of a Bible story that seems to lost in the shuffle of the Old Testament. It brings the history to life in many ways. It's amazing. I love the book and the author's writing style is fantastic. VERY well done.
