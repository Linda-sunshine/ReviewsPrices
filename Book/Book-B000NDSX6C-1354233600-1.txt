review/summary: What's to say?review/text: If you need my review, here it is. The best young adult's book of all time, bar none. Sorry Harry Potter fans, but this is head and shoulders above all others. Like the Potter books, it's also great for adults as well. Read the book before you see the movie! From what I've seen, they've taken greater liberties with this movie than they did with LOTR. Galadrial and Legolas, and presumably others, do not appear in this book, and I don't see how, if it took LOTR 3 movies to complete, how can it take 3 movies to do the &#34;Hobbit&#34;? Anyway, enough about the movie, a great book, a classic. I wish I'd been made to read this book in high school (although I'd already read it in 5th grade), instead of &#34;Mill on the Floss&#34; or &#34;Walden&#34; Gah!
