review/summary: Blurry printreview/text: The print was smudgy and really not clean throughout all three volumes. There were no illustrations in this edition. I was unable to separate Amazon's reviews between the different editions of the LOTR, so it was easy to make the mistake of ordering this one. I returned it.
