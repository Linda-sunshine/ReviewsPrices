review/summary: Classicreview/text: I first read this story as a teen and I've read it many times since, when I got my kindle I got this for free and just was pleased that I know have it on kindle so when every the mood strikes me I can read.If you want to look at how editing has gone down hill in the books being published today you only need to look at the classics.
