review/summary: Not just about ancient Judahreview/text: This book is not just about ancient Judah. It is about here and now. Judah's leaders squander the nation's wealth in tributes to the Assyrians. Our leaders squander ours not only to other nations but in tributes to favored factions here at home. Judah's leaders slaughter their own children in sacrifices to the god Molech. By abortion we sacrifice ours to our own idols of sexual license, materialism, and self-interest. Judah abandons its heritage of faith in the one true God Yahweh, and the rulers of Judah silence the voices of the prophets and the few remaining believers in Him. And are not the Faithful today under attack in the public schools, in the media, and by government mandate? As this book comes to its final chapter, there is hope for the nation under its new king Hezekiah because of his renewed faith in Yahweh. Unfortunately, our nation does not yet have this renewal of Faith and has just re-elected the evil king it deserves.
