review/summary: Great Non-Stop Adventurereview/text: There is so much to like in this exhilarating book: a wizard, a dragon, dwarves, trolls, giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves, evil goblins...and the tricksy creature Gollum.I read this as a kid but I vaguely remembered it; with the movie coming out I was inspired to pick it up again. I love the simple beginning "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit." It plays to my curiosity immediately. Bilbo is such a likable character. His initial hesitancy to do anything unexpected is relatable. I think his subconscious sense of adventure lives in a lot of us...in me. While on his journey he realizes what he is capable of. I like how he accidentally saves his traveling companions from perilous situations over and over again coming off as the unlikely hero.The subtle finding of the "One Ring" was intriguing leading to the introduction of the mysterious creature Gollum. I like his big round pale lamp-like eyes. The game of riddles between Bilbo and Gollum was particularly entertaining while full of angst. His eagerness to eat the juicy "scrumptiously crunchable" hobbit was creepy.The Battle of Five Armies was swift and exciting. "The elves were the first to charge. Their hatred for the goblins is cold and bitter. Their spears and swords shone in the gloom with a gleam of chill flame, so deadly was the wrath of the hands that held them." I love it from beginning to end.
