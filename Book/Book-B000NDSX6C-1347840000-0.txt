review/summary: Excellent, as expectedreview/text: While I had read the Lord of the Rings trilogy years ago, I had never read The Hobbit. Since the movie was coming out in December, it seemed like a good reason to do so. I actually found The Hobbit to be an easier read than the LOTR trilogy, but just as excellent: highly recommended!
