review/summary: certainly not the originalreview/text: Well, foo. This is not what I was necessarily hoping to get when I downloaded this book. I was really hoping for the original, unabridged version. The formatting wasn't too bad and I suppose overall it was okay, but this is more like the if you have never read the real thing this might be interesting version. I kind of liken it to the shorter more clipped versions of stories you would find in an intermediate textbook. Not awful, just could have used a bit more info in the description about what this book was.
