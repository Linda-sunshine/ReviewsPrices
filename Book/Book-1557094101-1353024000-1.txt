review/summary: The original with old-fashioned picturesreview/text: For those who want the original poem. I don't specifically like the picture on the cover, but made my purchase based on the reviews. I'm buying Christmas books to keep the kids busy during the holiday season. I started withHistory of Santa Claus - Book 1 (Santa Through the Years)because I just loved the look of the book and it also had good reviews. That series is interactive, this book is not. The joy of the season is in the words with decent enough pictures; it will be interesting to see how the kids react to the different books.
