review/summary: Best Revenge Book Everreview/text: This is my favorite book: The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas (published in 1840).This 1200 page juggernaut is a story of one Edmond Dant&egrave;s, a young sailor on the verge of being promoted to captain, and starting a life with his longtime love, Mercedes. Plotted against by jealous rivals, Dant&egrave;s is implicated as a Bonapartist traitor and thrown in prison. Revenge ensues!Dumas writes revenge like no one I've ever read. Though at times the main character seems needlessly ruthless and not particularly likeable, I just could not put this book down - well, except when it got too heavy to hold (Whew ... 1200 pages is heavy!). This is a book that will remain on my bookshelf forever (though probably not one I'd read as a bed time story to a kid).Pick it up (if you're strong enough) and give it a go - I don't think you'll be disappointed.
