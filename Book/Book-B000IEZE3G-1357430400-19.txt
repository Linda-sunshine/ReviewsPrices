review/summary: couldn't put it down!review/text: I wasn't a big reader until a few years ago. this is the first book that I read and I could not put it down!! I loved J. K. Rowling's writing with the entire series as well as the story lines. I would recommend this book to anyone, any age! I'm saving my copies so that my kids can read them when they are old enough!
