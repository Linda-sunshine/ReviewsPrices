review/summary: Dated but relevantreview/text: I had heard of this book for years before finally reading it as part of a book club. I will not debate theology here. Instead, I will make several points: 1. Like the works of Shakespeare, this didn't begin as a book, but as a series of radio speeches given in England during WWII. The language is very formal and very dated. (Years from now, I can imagine a reader wondering about our use of terms such as &#34;dude&#34; and &#34;LOL.&#34;) 2. The speeches were given during an extremely dark period in the history of mankind. 3. Who requested the speeches? The king? The church? 3. Why? To raise moral? To provide spiritual inspiration? 4. Each person gets something different from the pieces. (The discussions in our book club made this obvious.)
