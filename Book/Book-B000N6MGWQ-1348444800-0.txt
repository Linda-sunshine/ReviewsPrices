review/summary: The 5 people you meet in Heavenreview/text: I just read the 5 people you meet in Heaven after you die. It was interesting but since I had just lost my Mother and baby brother I was probably looking for answers for myself about them so this book kind of disappointed me. I think others will like this book if they are not seeking an answer like I was. It is an interesting read and well written and holds your interest til the end. I recommend it for just a quick pleasure read but not really comfort for hurting people who just lost a loved one.
