review/summary: Adults shouldn't waste their time on this.review/text: I've struggled with this book on and off for a few years (well, decades I suppose) I first read it when I was about 10 or so. When I first read it I was a bit disappointed. But the Alice story persists. It's imagery pops up time and time again in other media, films, TV, video games, art. The Alice story is a lterary classic. Legendary even. Even people who haven't read a book in their life know at least something about it. They know many of the characters. Criticism of it is shocking, possible heretical.Meh. To me Alice In Wonderland is simply a nonsense story aimed at children. Nothing less, nothing more. Now, today the word "nonsense" has a perjotative ring to it, but back in the 19th century "nonsense" was pretty much a viable genre. But it's a short story, with little plot, no particular likeable characters, and filled with some of the most annoying literary creations ever. As some have said the events in the book are mostly non sequiturs, just seemingly random encounters that Alice has. It's written in rather sedate prose too, with little description of what Wonderland is actually like. In fact more information on the nature of Wonderland can be gleaned from the atmospheric illustrations by John Tenniel.I think Alice in Wonderland has survived through the years precisely because of it's vagueness and ambiguousness. People will read into what they want. It has provoked philosophical, moral, social and mathematical speculation. But I don't think there are any real hidden meanings or metaphors behind it all. It's an almost blank canvas for people to project their theories and speculations on what Wonderland is supposed to be. Something like a Jackson Pollock painting for the Victorian Age. Okay, maybe not *that* bad.
