review/summary: Fast, easy readreview/text: This book was "assigned reading" in my 14 year old's Reading class. What a great choice for classroom reading! I have read a lot of Patterson books and was curious, so I picked it up myself. Maximum Ride is definately a "page-turner". I read this book quickly. In fact, as I got toward the end, I intentionally slowed down because I was not quite ready to get to the end. Fun and easy read. Great book if you just want to escape into some fantasy. Young and old will enjoy this one.
