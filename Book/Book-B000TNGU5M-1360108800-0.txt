review/summary: Captivatingreview/text: Through and through. Elie Wiesel has not failed to impress me with his clear sight into his past since I first read an excerpt of this book in a high school English class years ago. I would recommend anyone to read this book who wants real perspective on the world and what a person can endure if they must.
