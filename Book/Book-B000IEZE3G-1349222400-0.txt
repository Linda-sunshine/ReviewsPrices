review/summary: Good for reading aloud to your children at bedtimereview/text: There are thousands of great reviews about this book and there is probably little I can add. Having said that, I've twice read this book out aloud to my daughter at bedtime. It is not always easy finding a book that reads well in your head and yet can easily come to life on your tongue. Especially a book that is as rich as this, which has word plays, and paints such wonderful pictures. Yes, it is a good read, but I particularly recommend this book to parents seeking to provide a vivid bedtime story experience to their children. It is so easy to read out aloud!
