review/summary: Winning friends indeed!review/text: It's true...this is a great book, especially for those interested in the ART of communication. The introduction suggests the best way to approach the book (first skim, then, reread the chapters) and it's probably best to follow those instructions. Also, pay close attention to the chapter summaries, they really help galvanize the points. After reading the book, you will better understand the beauty of listening and this where the book makes its mark. It's amazing how poorly we listen to one another. If you stop and listen to two people having a conversation, pay attention to the responses made by the second person in the conversation. Often times, you'll notice that instead of responding to what was said, listeners often try to establish their prior points. It's as if the conversation goes in circles for longer than necessary. In the end, the HTWF&IP's aggregate point stresses respect for others during the communication process. Add this one to your library and read it often, you won't regret it.
