review/summary: A Wonderful Classicreview/text: Quite simply, this is one of the best fantasy novels available. This version of the book is actually a bit better than the one I grew up with. There are a few illustrations, but not much else that you wouldn't expect. Now I just need to watch the movie to see if they were able to do justice to this classic piece of literature.
