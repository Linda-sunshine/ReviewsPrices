review/summary: Hard to put downreview/text: I got this book without knowing a whole lot about the author or the storyline. The book is narrated by the main character who finds herself separated from her family after the country is taken over by a faction with an extremely bizarre biblical beliefs that put women in a position of being essentially male property. In this scenario women are either wives, servants or surrogate mothers of male high ranking officials. The world in this story is painted so realistic by Atwood that it's chilling. After the first few pages you find yourself so involved with the main character's narrative that it's hard to put down. There are a lot of cautionary tales out there, but this is one of the best &#34;post apocalyptic&#34; books I've ever read. I would recommend starting this book on a weekend because you'll be up in the wee hours reading.
