review/summary: Maximum Ride (mom's perspective)review/text: Maximum Ride series is great for tweens because it really pulls them in quickly and is adventurous, humorous, and sarcastic (like they are). I have a son who does not like to read but he can't put this one down. The characters have attitude, but no where near as much as kids on tv do..
