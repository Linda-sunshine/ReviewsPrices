review/summary: All-time Classic!review/text: One of the best mystery/horror classics of all time! Bram Stoker is a master of the genres. This is the one book that inspired a host of vampire stories and mythology that we know and love. Anyone reading this for the first time is in for a real treat. Can't recommend it enough!
