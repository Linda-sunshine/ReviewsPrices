review/summary: Still here with the windreview/text: The book actually provides a well-balanced explanation of southern attitudes and responses to the Civil War, reconstruction,their "culture",womens place in society and class consciousness among both blacks and whites. Great history. But Scarlet and Rhett do get tiresome, I do understand better now what made them tick.
