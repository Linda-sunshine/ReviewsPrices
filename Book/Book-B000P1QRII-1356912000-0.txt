review/summary: Memories are meant to be shared.review/text: Short but thought-provoking. I picked it up because I've seen this title every time I read a review on an utopia/dystopia young adult book and was curious. I've read various books with very similar ideas (Delirium and Matched) of a society where everything has been decided for them to avoid suffering, wrong-doing and chaos; but is that a life worth living? No uncertainty but also no control. No suffering but also no passion. No choices, no freedom.Jonas was selected to be The Receiver of Memories of everybody that has ever existed so that people don't have to carry their burden. Only he will learn from these experiences and will have the wisdom to advice society on unprecedented matters.&#34;The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the loneliness of it. Memories are meant to be shared.&#34;I had this interesting thought that this is how I feel about reading books. I experience someone else's memories or stories and it makes me wiser although they are situations I've never been through.
