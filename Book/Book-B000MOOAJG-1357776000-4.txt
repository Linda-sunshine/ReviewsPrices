review/summary: Eeryreview/text: Long read, but mostly very engaging. Some of the monologues drug on in a preachy way, but overall the book was great. I found it interesting that there were multiple instances of the book's politicians sounding eerily similar to our politicians today. There was even a speech that sounds like President Obama's "you didn't build that" speech. Remember - this book was written in the 40s!
