review/summary: Cannot find the words to do justicereview/text: Let me first note that I am still in high school but I didn't read this as an assignment. So far in the past couple of years I have had to have read numerous boks in a modern day point of view and I have just become so sick of all of these stereotypical plots. Girl finds boy, they fall in love, save the day, the end.But when i read this book I was so awakened, so jarred into the brutality of reality that I was fascinated by Ms.Bronte's writing and frank honesty of everything.It was disturbing, witty, insightful, and overall captivating. Nothing ese really compares to this classic. I was sometimes lost at points and was forced to look back. It was philosophical and even though it didn't have much elegance, it was charming. It showed loss, failure, a world without love. Jane Erye is like nothing I've ever read before.I know several people criticized the way Bronte took away all love from Jane's world. But to me it just made everything so much more worthwhile; whenever Jane got the slightest shred of kindness i truly felt it considering all of the hardships he went through.His review cannot do the justice that i wish i could explain but the book was just so amazing i cant put them into words. Please take my word for it and read this book.
