review/summary: Highly recommendedreview/text: My review will be short; frankly I feel a bit foolish appending any comments at all to Mr. Weisel's memoir of his time spent in the concentration camps at Auschwitz and Buchenwald. My main reason for reviewing at all is simply to add another voice to those who have already praised the book as austere and powerful, and hoping thereby to help bring the book to the attention of an even wider audience.One point I am surprised by is the fact that some reviewers have chastised the book for its 'pointlessness'. They seemed to have been expecting a summation at the end which would impose an structure on Mr. Wiesel's experience. It seems to me that the pointlessness is entirely the point. So be forwarned, Mr. Wiesel's story in this volume will end upbruptly, and will not provide any catharsis. And I believe it deserves to be read not in spite of that uncomforting thought, but because of it.
