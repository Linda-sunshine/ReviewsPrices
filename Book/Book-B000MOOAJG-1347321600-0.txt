review/summary: A Classic Textreview/text: You might well say this is a classic and a 'must read' in literature. Rand espouses objectivism as a philosophy and that is well and good as far as it goes. The book is long and is interesting as are its predictions of what the world could become from her period's point of view. Objectivism has much to recommend it and her thesis that business should be 'unshackled' to do as it will falls short with the realization of how industry has often polluted the areas where industry has been allowed to operate unhampered. Her ethic needs to be updated as the results of industrial processes and pollution are often all around us. The point may be that Rand's objectivism needs to meet the reality of ecology.
