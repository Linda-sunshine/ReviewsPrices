review/summary: Do not be fooled by the Titlereview/text: This book should be a required reading in any school. It teaches you how to relate to people and be compassionate, something that is sadly getting lost in this world. If you need some great advice about life in general, look no further than this book. It may have been written many years ago, however relates more than ever to this day and age.
