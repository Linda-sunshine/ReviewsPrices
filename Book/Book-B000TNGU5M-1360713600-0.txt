review/summary: Night - A first hand account of the horrors of WWII concentration campsreview/text: A great read for anyone interested on what was going on inside the German's concentration camps. Night covers the author's experience as a prisoner and his battle both physically and psychologically to survive. Night also shows a darker side of humans one that many today are not really aware of. Elie Wiesel has created a brilliant memoir for such a horrific event and for that Night has joined my list of favorite books.
