review/summary: Good Science Fiction but with some flawsreview/text: Having reached the age of 71 I finally decided I should try to read Atlas Shrugged. I looked at this massive 1168 page book with foreboding but once I got started I was surprised to discover it was much better than I expected, exciting and suspenseful, and I flipped through the pages except when I got to the sex scenes which I well could have done without and which as someone else here has said were a torture to get through. (Incidentally, in these sudden violent unexpected outbursts of passion, in railway tunnels, and elsewhere, what sort of contraceptive measures do the protagonists use? Miss Rand never discusses such mundane details.) The heart to heart conversations between Rearden and d'Anconia I also found embarrassing. Miss Rand seems to have no conception of how men, even saintly geniuses, speak to one another in private. And as for John Galt's nation wide speech, I find it difficult to believe that more than a handful of people didn't turn off their radio after the first 5 minutes.Atlas Shrugged, of course, is a science fiction novel, maybe one of the best ever written, and should be read as such. (That is not to denigrate it in any way.) I loved all the amazing coincidences, the fantastic events, the destruction of the evil kingdom, and the triumph of the magicians (for that is what Rand's heros are) at the end.My greatest disappointment was in her description of the villains, especially the intellectuals. Rather than having them make infantile comments condemning logic and reason, if she had them speaking the nonsense that real academics and intellectuals actually do speak, it could have been a much more powerful book.I suppose the moral of the book is that ugly and stupid people hate good-looking smart people and use morality to try to destroy them, but by a certain age everyone should know that, even if they haven't read Ayn Rand.
