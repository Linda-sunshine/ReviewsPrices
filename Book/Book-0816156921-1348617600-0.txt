review/summary: Awesome!!!review/text: With our current fascination with vampires, I thought I'd go to the beginning of things. One word to describe the book: awesome! Stoker was a brilliant and imaginative writer and very visually provoking via his word craft. I REALLY enjoyed this via my kindle app! I'm not an avid reader, but kindle makes the experience quite enjoyable with dictionaries and other resources right at your fingertips! Looking forward to my next classic!
