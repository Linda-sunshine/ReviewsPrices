review/summary: What kids want nowreview/text: This was an excellent book for my taste, it made you think about life but...We all know teens would dislike this book. What they want now is action, love, revenge, hate. Not a book that teaches you about life's meaning. Let's face it, nowadays kids do not like this kind of book, although I loved it, they want more modern books that could happen in a near future. They do not like classic or boring things, they want heart-breaking books that leave you wishing more and more. It's the same with everything; games clothes, TV series, music... People's likes change during history, everything changes. Here are some examples of books teens usually read: Divergent, The hunger games, Starters, The kill order, Unwind, Delirium and much more. I repeat, I loved this book, every grown up I know and read it, loved it. But ask your kids if they LOVED it or if they would have wanted something more new, modern.Make yourself the question: Do our kids like the same things as we did when we were their age?Think of it.Anonymous Reader
