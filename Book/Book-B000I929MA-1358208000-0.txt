review/summary: Left me wanting morereview/text: I love dystopian novels. Overall, I enjoyed the writing and flow of this work. However, the ending was definitely something I wasn't expecting. I really wanted a better conclusion, but artistically I understand why she ended the novel the way she did. Again, a great read for anyone who likes dystopian novels.
