review/summary: The Great Gatsby.review/text: I picked this book out for school; I had to write a ten page paper after reading it.An enlightening love story that consists of poetic pieces of work depicting the proclamation of one's love to another, and the walls people put up in times of abandonment and grief. At times, this book can seem to drag on to it's readers; it is a build up to a fitting end for Fitzgerald's characters.The Great Gatsby is a must read for adults and young adults alike! I recommend it greatly.
