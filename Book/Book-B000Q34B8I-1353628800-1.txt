review/summary: An earnest reviewreview/text: A pathologically witty play--signaled immediately by the pun lurking in the title--which punctures the trivial bubble of Victorian society. The text reads with the rapidity of Voltaire's Candide, so the comedy's pace must be absolutely white hot in performance. The actors would have to wait for the laughter to die down, a real challenge with this farce. One should, of course, see it on the stage, and I must admit that I've never had that pleasure. I will try to remedy that omission before I die! My favorite line from the play: "To lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness."
