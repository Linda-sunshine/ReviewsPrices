review/summary: Persuasion is to Literature as Mozart is to Musicreview/text: Other than to die hard Austen fans, this &#34;other&#34; perfect writing may be somewhat unknown. It should not be. If a person believes himself or herself to be a well-rounded reader, but does not insist upon reading every major work of Austen's, they deceive themselves.I thought I had an adequate idea of Austen's works by watching the films &#34;Sense and Sensibility&#34; and &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;. I decided to read these two books, simply out of curiosity as to how they would stand against the films. I found the movies to be lacking the absolute finest portions of each story, so I decided to read Austen's other works that I had not been familiar with.Persuasion, as well as everything I have read from the pen of Jane Austen, does not disappoint. Well, except that it does, eventually, end. It's worthy of as many accolades as her more famous works, and as the others do, causes a sense of general happiness in its reader.
