review/summary: Fatous Slackdomreview/text: I read this years ago, and found myself disliking it immensely from the first chapter. I forced myself to finish it and seem to remember liking that at least we sort of got somewhere, to some sort of plot conclusion, at the end. That's about all I can say in its defense. It's turgid, not funny, and I really don't care about what happens to a single character. Now, I had to read it again for my book club this month,and I put it down after just re-reading the Kindle sample.Ignatious is a slacker and unattractive person with no redeeming qualities. Other characters are just foils for his so-called antics and are neither believable nor interesting. I think the writing is poor, and I guess I just don't get the hype. I wonder if the author received the Pulitzer for dying, much as I think Heath Ledger won the Oscar for the same reason.If I want to read a book in which the characters are slackers, I'd rather re-read Steinbeck's Tortilla Flat. That at least had both real humor and real pathos. This, in my opinion, is just crap.
