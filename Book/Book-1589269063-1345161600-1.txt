review/summary: Critical to Marriagesreview/text: My wife and I read this book several years ago and we were changed forever by the wisdom presented. In fact as a Pastor I use this as a required tool for couples getting married, in counselling married couples, and with "911" relationships. It will revolutionize how you approach the precious relationship you share with another. In many ways it can be utilized for any relationship, friendships, family, ect... Of course the intimacy parts do not apply to non-married relationships, however the principles are important to act upon. Maybe because it is very much based on the manual for living...the Bible.The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts
