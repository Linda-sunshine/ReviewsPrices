review/summary: It sucked.review/text: If you are looking for a story about a dystopian society in which the government censors people's entire lives to the point where citizens aren't even allowed to read, then Fahrenheit 451 the perfect book for you. In the book, Guy Montag is a fireman who burns down houses with books hidden within them. He starts out really dedicated to the job, but then he meets a girl one night walking home from the fire station that really gets him thinking about how he is living his life. Guy begins to rethink everything he does and decides to fight the system. The idea of the story is fantastic; however the writing is not the greatest. The way Ray Bradbury writes is highly confusing. He uses metaphors, symbolism and similes like there is no tomorrow. He also has a tendency to jump from one topic to the next, one time to the next and one mood to the next. When he is talking about the Salamander when going out on a call to look for, and burn books, he describes the Salamander in great detail and then just switches to talking about the house, at which they have just arrived, without saying anything about the house until after the explanation of the house. So while the reader thinks Bradbury is still describing the Salamander he has actually gone into talking about a house instead. All in all, the book had a great point being that if someone challenges you; challenge them in return for what you believe to be right and just. However the style of writing just didn't agree with the way my mind thinks. But if you are someone who enjoys metaphors and jumpy writing, this would be a good choice for you to look in to reading.
