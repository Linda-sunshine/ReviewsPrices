review/summary: CHARACTER STUDIESreview/text: THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS BOOK BEING A CLASSIC. IT IS A CHARACTER STUDY PAR EXCELLENCE!!!!EVEN THOUGH THE HABITS AND MORES OF 18 CENTURY ENGLAND WERE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM OURS, THE HUMANITY OF THE PEOPLE ARE THE SAME.THE TITLE TELLS THE STORY---2 PEOPLE EACH DENOTING THE CHARACTER TRAITS GIVEN THEM IN THE TITLE--AND HOW THEY FINALLY COME TO A MEETING OF THE MIND AND HEART.THIS BOOK IS TO BE ENJOYED MANY TIMES OVER!!!
