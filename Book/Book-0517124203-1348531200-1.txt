review/summary: A true classicreview/text: When I was a child I looked forward to my summer break. It was then that I opened my copy of "Alice's Adventures..." and dove once again down the rabbit hole. I even played Alice in a play when I was a young teen and it stands out as one of my most cherished memories.Alice is everything that I think a young girl wants to be - adventurous, clever, compassionate and even a bit funny. She is wonderful.Many editions of the book have been published over the years, and the Kindle one lacks the illustrations of some other versions. That was not a detriment to me, as I loved to imagine Alice and her adventures when I was a child. I know there are some gorgeous illustrations out there and perhaps the Kindle version can include them, but the lack of illustrations should not stop anyone from reading this book - for teh first time, or the thousandth.
