review/summary: Disturbingly possiblereview/text: After a violent uprising and coup, portions of North American are controlled by a theocratic society called the Republic of Gilead. In Gilead women own no property, hold no jobs, and are relegated to specific roles. They are not permitted to read, to speak with men, to have any human touch outside the specific regulated ceremonies. This book tells the story of Offred, who has had everything taken from her; her husband, her daughter, her job, her money, even her name. She is a handmaid, and her job is to become pregnant by one of the elite men of Gilead and give birth to a healthy child. She must live by the rules of this society or suffer an unknown fate.This is an above average book made more powerful by the current political atmosphere. What makes this more powerful, terrifying really, is the realistic possibility that this could happen in my lifetime. I do not particularly like Atwood's writing style, and I think the addition of the historical notes at the end was a mistake. It is a good but flawed book, but it should be read far and wide as a warning of what could happen.
