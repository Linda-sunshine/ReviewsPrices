review/summary: Has helped our Relationshipreview/text: As others have written, this is a great book that begins a discussion with positivity. Starting a conversation with &#34;here is my love language&#34; instead of &#34;you could communicate better&#34; makes a huge difference in my mind. So far this book has helped us to not only learn more about each other, but also about ourselves. I highly recommend this book to anyone in a relationship as a start to mending broken bridges.
