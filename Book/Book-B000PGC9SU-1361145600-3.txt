review/summary: Fascinating Readingreview/text: I grew up hearing about Benjamin Franklin and how he played a major part in creating the foundation of the United States of America, and I actually thought that he was one of the early presidents. Reading "The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin" was fascinating and insightful.Reading a biography or autobiography can tell you a lot about the individual, and reading Franklin's autobiography most certainly revealed his character and his experiences in the Colonial times up to the Independence War of 1776 and a bit afterwards. I was quite fascinated with his working with 13 virtues and how he'd apply them to his way of living. He was most certainly an exceptional individual of his times and beyond.This is a wonderful material for any lover of history or literature. It's to be recommended.
