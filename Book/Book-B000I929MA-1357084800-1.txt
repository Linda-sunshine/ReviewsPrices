review/summary: Read thisreview/text: Scariest book I have ever read, artfully written by one of Canada's national treasures, how she could see where the future was heading back in the '80's I have no idea. It should be mandatory reading for all young women along with a guide to current and past legislation that is working to bringing about Margaret Atwoods prognostications of a future where women are baby making machines and are again the property of men.
