review/summary: Amazingreview/text: Well this is a long book and I'm taking my time with it so I'm only about half way through when Amazon requested a review in an e-mail. But since I'll forget later I simply must respond now. There are times when I'm reading in this book, written in the 40's I think, my own current events. Orwell saw the potential future in 1984 but I think Rand shows us how we get there.
