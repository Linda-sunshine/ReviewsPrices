review/summary: A Gem!review/text: I have read this book many times in my life and get something out of it every time. Many lessons can be learned from this and all of Tolkien's writing. I picked up this version to have on my phone and enjoy being able to highlight phrases and parts I want to note or read again later. Those just getting into this book from the movie should make sure to read it too! Pick up a copy and enjoy.
