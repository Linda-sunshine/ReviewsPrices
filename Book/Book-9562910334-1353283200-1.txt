review/summary: Freedom is the freedom to say that 2+2=4review/text: "Freedom is the freedom to say that 2+2=4." Winston Smith in Gorge Orwell's 1984 is forced to accept anything the Party of Oceana tells him, not only must he accept it but he also must believe it. If they say that 2+2=5 then he must believe it even knowing it is not true, this action of forced acceptance is called doublethink- the idea that you can hold two seemingly apposing concepts and accept both as true.Winston does not truly believe The Party and begins to work against it under the radar even while knowing he is bound to fail. As the story progresses he befriends a young woman named Julia and together they attempt to do the party harm through their own mini rebellion.Winston and Julia are believable though not lovable. I don't think Orwell wanted them to be lovable so he could emphasize how The Party sucked the humanness and lovability out of its subjects.The story was incredibly well written. It was simple to understand, even though Winston and Julia's situation was far from simple.This would be a good book for anyone from fourteen up. This was a great book that deserves it many awards.*This review is written by my son- 14 years old
