review/summary: A big waste of timereview/text: This is the most depressing and boring book I have ever read. Just what the literary value is in this book, I will never know. I kept waiting for some sort of a plot to develop. It never did. What a fluke to have received the Nobel prize.I actually would rate this NO STARS.
