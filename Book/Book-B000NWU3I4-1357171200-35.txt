review/summary: Entertaining & funreview/text: I read it after seeing the movie, thinking I had already read the book as a youth. After seeing the movie, I realized that I hadn't read the book so I uploaded it on my kindle. My timing was perfect. We had a cold snowy few days, so I sat by the fire and read.
