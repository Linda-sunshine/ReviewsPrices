review/summary: Simply beautifulreview/text: I picked this up as a gift for my brother and decided to get myself one too. I wanted a nice heirloom-quality book that we could keep and pass down to our kids. This book is just plain beatiful. The cover, pages, and maps are all great and exactly what I wanted for my library.You can't beat this edition.
