review/summary: Most compelling book I've ever read!review/text: Having lived under this type of government, Ayn Rand's writings are uncannily predictable and insightful regarding our government today. America take head! If we do not honor our creators, we'll lose their genious and the wealth that goes with them! They will take their ideas and income to other countries where they can live as they please--without government rules, regulations and taxation! Read this book. Though written over 60 years ago, it is hauntingly accurate for our time!
