review/summary: My Language Arts Classic Bookreview/text: This book was so vivid and moving, I was shocked to see how short it actually is. I would recommend this to anyone, as it is a nice, quick read for those who prefer shorter books, and a detailed, gripping, if not slightly brief epic for those who tend to read between the lines, as I do.
