review/summary: Sure shot!review/text: The best of the series! This is the kind of writing that makes one read more. High quality writing, suspense, thrill, an absolutely smashing plot, and most importantly, fantastic character development. Even in the alpha male world of Reacher, the female characters hold on their own. And even being the alpha male, Reacher is human enough. Even being a tank of a man, Reacher beats the odd only with some responsible help.One may think the Reacher series is all about Reacher the one-man-army, but as with the others in the series, and more so in this installment, the suspenseful plot is the real star. So seemingly disjointed, only to gradually converge into a smashing climax! I have heard this novel has now been turned into a major motion picture, but I can guarantee the movie won't even come close to the thrill of this read.If you ever wanted to sample a Reacher novel, make sure it is this one.
