review/summary: Bit hesitant but wowreview/text: I am bit hesitant in ordering this book. I am new to Lee child and the only driving force is because the character enacted by Tom Cruise. But when I started reading I am so much involved I have to this without any break. I am now became a fan of Lee Child. A wonderful mystery. The way the story narrated and the way the mystery revealed wonderful. Great writing. A must for mystery novel readers.
