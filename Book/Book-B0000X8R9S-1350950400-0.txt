review/summary: Hatchet is a great story of survival.review/text: The name of this book is Hatchet, written by Gary Paulson. After 13 year old Brian's parents divorce, Brian is traveling to the Canadian wilderness to see his father for the summer. He spends the school year with his mom and the summer with his dad. While Brian is flying to see his dad in a bush plane, the pilot suffers a tragedy and Brian finds himself stuck 7,000 feet above the wilderness. I did enjoy the ending of this book. My favorite part is when Brian tries to catch a bird. I would recommend this book to 10-12 year old readers. If you enjoy tales of survival, give this book a chance.
