review/summary: Classic, must readreview/text: Everyone should read this book once. I could'nt put it down. I read it cover to cover. Classic dystopian novel, yet more relevant at this moment than any other dystopian novels I have read. I saw one reveiew of this book stating it is "to old to understand". I don't think the message Bradbury gives us could be clearer. Do yourself a favor and buy this book and read it!
