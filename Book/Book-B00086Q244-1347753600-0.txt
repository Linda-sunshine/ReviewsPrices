review/summary: How To Win Friends and Influence Peoplereview/text: How To Win Friends and Influence People is by far the best self help book I ever read and I have read alot. I am currently reading it again, not for the second time, but for the third time. I have always had a problem with my relationships with others, starting conversations, making friends, and being a good person. It has caused me much sorrow. After reading this book I finally feel like there is hope for me. I like the person I am becoming by practicing the principles in this book. It has changed my life for the better. Thanks.
