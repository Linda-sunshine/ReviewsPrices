review/summary: A great book in the public domainreview/text: This is a challenging book. During some of Melville's soliloquies on the scientific aspects of cetaceans and whaling technology you may lose patience but stick with him. This is a great tragedy in the traditions of Shakespeare and Sophocles - a fearless exploration of insanity and the nature of evil.
