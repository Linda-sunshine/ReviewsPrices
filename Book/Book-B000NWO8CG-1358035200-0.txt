review/summary: A tree grows in Brooklyn is truly a classic.review/text: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is all about achieving the American dream through determination, imagination, and education. Life for the Nolans was very harsh in the sense that they didn't have much in the sense of money. The father, an alcoholic who at best brought occasional income was a charming lad who was very well loved by his family, up until the bitter end, when he died, leaving a posthumous child. The mother is a strong woman, steady, responsible, and caring. The heroine in this book, however, is Francie Nolan, who loves to write. In the end, she doesn't become a published writer, but she did keep her stories real, describing how life in poverty really is, and stands for herself when an ignorant teacher tells her that her writings are sad and ugly.
