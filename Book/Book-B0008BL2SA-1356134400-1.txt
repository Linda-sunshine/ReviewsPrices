review/summary: A Timeless Treasurereview/text: I was pleasantly surprised by "Little Women." It was one of the best books I have ever read. I highly recommend this book, it is one of my very favorites. It's a million times better than the movie! I loved how Louisa included so much about "Pilgrim's Progress." Throughout the book I found countless truths and beauties that I shall always remember. Loved it! :)
