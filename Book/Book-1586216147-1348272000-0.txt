review/summary: Ughreview/text: It was too mushy for me. I couldn't get into it. I finally finished the book mainly because so many people had told me how wonderful it was. I guess it wasn't my type of book. All it was, was feelings, feelings, feelings. It never really went anywhere. It's hard for me to list a book as "I don't like it" because I can usually find some quality to like in a book which I did here when the couple was young, but eventually even that got to me. I'm glad the author is doing well, he has quite a following.
