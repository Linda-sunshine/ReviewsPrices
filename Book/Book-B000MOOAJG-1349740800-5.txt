review/summary: One of the Great Minds of the 20th Centuryreview/text: Can't put it down, even though it's my second time around with Atlas Shrugged. It's that good . . . rich and sumptuous, as a powerful work of literature is supposed to be. So much of what passes for public compassion and institutionalized good intentions today was exposed as claptrap more than 50 years ago by this wunderkind of philosophy and literature. A powerful commentary on the spirit of man standing against the levelers and merely mediocre, who cloak their mediocrity in the robes of the "public good," believing that it shields them from legitimate criticism. But Rand exposes motive-driven ideologies as the scams they are, and she issues a powerful clarion call for individual economic freedom. One that should be heeded. Two thumbs up, and Five Stars!
