review/summary: It's a classic!review/text: There's not much new to say about Jane Austen though in my experience readers of classic novels either love her or hate her. When I was younger I found her books to be too sugary for my taste but now I find her work to be very enjoyable. Perhaps it comes with age :-). It's a great love story to read on a stormy night in front of the fire. Wonderful character development. If one prefers more angst I'd recommend something like Rememberance of Things Past :-).
