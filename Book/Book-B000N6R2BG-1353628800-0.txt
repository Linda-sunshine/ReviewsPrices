review/summary: Brilliantreview/text: Yes, Ms. Picoult is a wonderful, accomplished writer but this book may be my favorite of hers. The story is not just compelling; it's riveting and thought provoking. Her characters are complex and the dialogue rings true. Her subject matter, religion, is a brave choice which could alienate many people. But she is so deft and even handed that one never feels like she is sermonizing or judging. She is telling a fascinating story about a touchy subject, adroitly. I loved reading this book.
