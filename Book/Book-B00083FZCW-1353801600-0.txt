review/summary: OK, best left to the Young Adults to readreview/text: Both my mother and my daughter recommended this book. I have to say, I found the author's attempt at a 14 year old girl's voice to be unconvincing and annoying.Despite all the "action" not much happens in this book. The kids run away from the bad guys a lot...and inexplicably they all get away, they all live. Why are the Erasers chasing them and beating them up all the time? It doesn't make sense at all how the flock always gets away, especially the scene on the beach when Jeb shows up. The next chapter offers no explanation on how the flock got off the beach without the Erasers stopping them.Obviously nothing happens because the author intended this to be a series from the get-go, but I won't be reading the rest. This is one YA series best left to the teens.
