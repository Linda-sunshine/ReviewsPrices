review/summary: HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONEreview/text: Harry potter is a amazing book. When I first read this book I was very surprised. How could a author write a book this interesting, it has great details and he made up a lot of fun adventures. The ending is really great. It's one the greatest books I've ever read.
