review/summary: Very good readingreview/text: The story is very interesting. The style varies from a slow meditatve pace to a rapid sequence of events. It would have been nice to have the small pictures that were included in the original version and in pdf form for free somewhere else. The merit is the popularity of this book which gives some insight into the 18th century ways of life, which in some aspects is quite modern!
