review/summary: Love Languagesreview/text: I read this because it was recommended to me. I'm in a relationship that is on the verge of ending. I was hoping for something to help me fix it or at least give me a way to cope. This book was astounding. I intend to try speaking my spouses love language, if I can change our relationship it might save us from losing a 6 yr relationship. I intend to recommend this to all of my friends. You never know who it might help. Fantastic book and highly recommend for everyone. Enjoy.
