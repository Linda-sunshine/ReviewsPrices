review/summary: A Gripping Dystopian Talereview/text: Although the subject matter is uncomfortable (life in a dystopian world where warped fundamentalist Christian values control all human activity - especially human reproduction) Ms. Atwood creates a compelling story that slowly reveals the complex life of the protaganist before and after the radical cultural shift. All the more gripping because of the troubling and bizarre world it describes - a world wrought by fundamentalist values run amok.
