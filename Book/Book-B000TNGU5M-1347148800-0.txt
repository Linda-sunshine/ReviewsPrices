review/summary: Soul openerreview/text: Ever since I read this book in sophomore year I have been dying to read it again. Now that I have, it hit me the same way it did 11 years ago. It's sad, but so strong in wanting the ready to understand. It made me thankful and at the same time more merciful. This will always be a favorite of mine.
