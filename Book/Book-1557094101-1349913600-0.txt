review/summary: Beautiful Artwork for a Wonderful Traditionreview/text: I have always loved this poem. My parents read it to me as a child and then I read it each year as I was growing up, cherishing it as a tradition, like my favorite Christmas carols.Over the years I've seen many versions. The illustrations by Jane Daniell are works of art, sure to become classics. They are so rich in detail! I was sucked into each illustration, fascinated by the mood of each and her obvious love of the holiday. I notice something else each time I look! I love the details, like the girl looking at the tree ornaments while keeping her prized teddy bear in tow. I'm a cat lover, so I was delighted with all the wonderful cats I found peeking out; and the sweet sleeping mice! I loved all the rich decorations, good food cooking, candle light, and the homey feel. Added to that were the elves, visions of sugar plums, shop windows, and the vision of Santa with his elves on the sleigh making their rounds!I bought this book for myself, to have a beautiful version of the poem to enjoy each holiday season. I'm not yet lucky enough to have grandchildren, but you can be sure this book will be shared with them every year when I do! LOVED IT and highly recommend it!
