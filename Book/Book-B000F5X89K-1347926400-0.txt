review/summary: frankenstein, as read by a court stenographerreview/text: i am getting into books on cd, as i hike a lot. listening to a book on cd while hiking is so relaxing ---- unfortunately, the narrator of this wonderful story sounds more like some guy reading instructions on how to assemble a machine, or install a heater, or the like. although his enunciation is perfect, he's horrid at putting anything of himself into the story. unless he truly is as boring, mechanical, and flat as his reading sounds.i don't understand how people can tolerate his droning.
