review/summary: One Shotreview/text: I saw that this title was to be the basis for the new screenplay "Reacher"...so I dove in and re-read this great one from Mr. Child. The read was even better the second time around...especially knowing that it will soon be released on the silver screen. Lee Child never ceases to amaze with his succint, believable prose, style and flair. This book is a Classic Reacher novel....the biggest problem that I have is how in the hell did they decide the 5'2" Tom Cruise could play our muscled, laid back 6'5" Reacher? Read the book...question the movie.
