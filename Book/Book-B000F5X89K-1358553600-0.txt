review/summary: Shelley's "Frankenstein"review/text: I'm glad I read it, although I doubt I'll ever read it again. The style of the writing -- Walton telling his sister the story told to him by Frankenstein -- did little to engage my interest. The separation of the narrative from any action slowed the pace of the story to a crawl, which is why it took me so long to finish. This was very much a chore to read, and Frankenstein struck me as one of the most sniveling, pathetic characters ever written, but I enjoyed the descriptive language, the characterization of Frankenstein's creation, and the last chapter, which did much to redeem the book as a whole.
