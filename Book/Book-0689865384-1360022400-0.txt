review/summary: a good readreview/text: This book was recommended to me by my mother in-laws and I was a bit sceptical at first but it didn't take me long to be submerged into the world of tally Youngblood.What teen agger hasn't just wanted to fit in and her futuristic world isn't to unbelievable I can't wait to read on in the series.
