review/summary: a very good set of books, not sure why nobody's ever read themreview/text: really enjoying these books. Should be considered required reading for fantasy fans. Not sure why they haven't made them into films, it seems like the story would lend itself to that sort of thing. I guess this precious little treasure will be all mine.
