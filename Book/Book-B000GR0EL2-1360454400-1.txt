review/summary: Daughter had to read for school...glad I read it too!review/text: My 8th grader had to read this for a school assignment and I'd never read it so I decided to read it as well since it was an ebook and I could access it too. I love reading historical novels so I knew I'd probably enjoy it and I did! Would highly recommend for all ages!
