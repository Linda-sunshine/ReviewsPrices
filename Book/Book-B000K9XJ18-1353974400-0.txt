review/summary: Review &#34;The Visitor&#34;review/text: Wow! What a story line, didn't clue in till I'd almost finished, slow as Reacher maybe or looking in the wrong place.Grat story line, characters very beleivable.cannot seem to get enough Reacher stories, I' now reading them for second time.Well done Lee Child
