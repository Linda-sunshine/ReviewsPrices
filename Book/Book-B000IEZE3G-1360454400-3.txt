review/summary: My opinion on Harry Potterreview/text: Once in a blue moon comes a book that is more than that. All of the Harry Potter books fall under this category. The characters are loveable, and many quotes and comparisons are made to this series. I love all the books, but the Prisoner of Azkaban has a special place in my heart. This is a series that everyone should read, now and in generations to come. These are classics and will always be around for those who love a good story.
