review/summary: Amazing Literature in classroomreview/text: A classic read in the Literature class and practically an enthralling and touching narrative. Mrs. Stowe has portrayed the slavery and tied the characters with emotional bond. Mistakes made by ancestors are revisited and Americans find the way to knowing and correcting the fact which the book portray about the inhumane cruelty of the early 1800s. Mrs. Stowe has the influence of Christian religion and saw the religion as universal religion and others should embrace it. Slavery made them cling to it as a source of comfort and the black slaves were purposely taught by the slave holders, through various means, the full scope of Christian redemption. This and other melodrama writing and approach may not be accepted. A classic, the book touches the heart with the title character, Uncle Tom, who enlightens the reader to true spiritual conversion and self-sacrifice, as he followed the example of His Lord, Jesus Christ. Reading the book makes one realize the inside turmoil and the anger for abolishing the Slavery. Indeed, a classic read and should be on shelf of every Library.
