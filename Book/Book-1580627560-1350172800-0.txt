review/summary: so good i bought a copy for my daughterreview/text: This book is a must read for women today! Times have changed but our primate selves have not. Men still need to hunt. Women also need to learn to play by a man's game. She will be better off for it. When a man thinks he has you figured out. Your not as exciting game over! Great read! Bought and mailed my daughter a copy.
