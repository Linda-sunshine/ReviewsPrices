review/summary: Crappy stinky paperreview/text: After reading a lot of positive reviews for this book, my wife asked me to order it for her. We ordered it, and paid for overnight Saturday shipping (an extra $8 on a $10 book).The book arrived as we paid for, but the book is made of really crappy paper, it smells bad, and the print is too small to read. As a result, neither of us wants to even touch the book. It's really unfortunate that the printers have resorted to making books of such low quality.
