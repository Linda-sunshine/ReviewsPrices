review/summary: I would give it 10 stars if possiblereview/text: I have loved this book since I first read it in high school and of course the movie too. Margaret Mitchell paints so vivid a picture of the South and their culture. The story between Scarlett and Rhett is timeless and classic. You will never find 2 people so made for each other. I love how in the end Scarlett and Rhett do not end up together and he ends up leaving her. I reread this book at least once a year and it I feel gets better and better every time I read it. This book has everything: action, romance and love and some of the best character development I have every read. I love this book.
