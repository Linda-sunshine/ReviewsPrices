review/summary: Must-have for Tolkien fansreview/text: This book is absolutely fantastic! My teen and pre-teen brothers think it's neat, my toddler sisters like me to read it to them while they look at the pictures, and I read it for fun. Excellently drawn, mostly word-for-word excerpts from the book... altogether excellent!
