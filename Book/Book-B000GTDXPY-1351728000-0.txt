review/summary: calamity jane reviewreview/text: With no expectations I downloaded Calamity Jane onto my kindle because it was free.I actually really enjoyed it. In some places I laughed out loud. And all in all it was nicely entertaining. It isn't a deep book and the plot is not meant to be probable. It has a quirky flavour that saves it from being too cliche but still delivers the formulaic satisfaction of a light read with a happy ending.
