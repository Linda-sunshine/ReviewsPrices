review/summary: A classic for sure!review/text: The Hobbit is a wonderful book. It's become a fantasy classic with a good story and interesting characters.However it just doesn't drag me into it like so many other books do.I don't loose myself in it and at times I kind of found it hard to pick it up again after having put it down.I feel like there is a constant distance between the reader and the characters. I didn't get to know anyone as well as I wanted to. Some people might want to lynch me for having this opinion as this book is almost holy to them on the same level as Lord of the Rings, but I just can't bring myself to give it a 5 star review as there are so many other books that have given me more.I read the Hobbit once as a kid and recently in Januray 2013, and I think that maybe I enjoyed it more as a kid as it feels more like a children's book to me. It just wasn't as good as I remembered it to be.It's still highly recommended, it's well written after all, and who doesn't love Dwarves and Elves and Hobbits ;)
