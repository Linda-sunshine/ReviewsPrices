review/summary: The Great Gatsbyreview/text: I have always meant to read this classic book - have enjoyed the film and now it coming out again with Leonardo Decaprio as the Great Gatsby I finally took the plunge. It was excellent - I must admit it me took a little while to get into the old style of writing - but once there it was worth the effort. No wonder it is a classic - it is wonderful to take yourself back to a bygone era when money and perceptions took over and no-one really knew where someone came from or how they got there. I loved it - would highly recommend everyone reads this book at least once in their lives.
