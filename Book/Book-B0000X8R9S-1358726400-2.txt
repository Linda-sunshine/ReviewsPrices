review/summary: Good readreview/text: I completely enjoyed every page of this book. It can be read and enjoyed by children (9 and up) and adults alike. A good book for parents to read to younger children without concern for the subject matter. The story is compelling, written from the prospective of 12 year old Brian. A must read.
