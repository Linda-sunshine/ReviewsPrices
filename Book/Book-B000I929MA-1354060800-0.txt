review/summary: A feminist tome.review/text: This is an intriguing concept, a slice of Orwell, a slice of Bellamy, and a big slice of feminism. It could serve quite well to generate discussions of difficult ideas. I rate it an interesting academic read, but found myself reading to the end out of discipline rather than enjoyment.
