review/summary: Fabulousreview/text: I haven't read this book in four years! I swear that it was better the second time. The series starts off with a bang as Harry, an abused, unloved orphan, discovers that he is a wizard and is sent off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry experiences many adventures with his best friends and partners in crime, Ron and Hermione. From knocking out a troll to rescuing a dragon, the trio has done it all. Amidst all of the run, Harry is faced with true peril and danger as he tries to save the Sorcerer's Stone from the most evil wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort. Will Harry succeed or will Voldemort come back to wreak havoc on the wizard world. To find out, read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
