review/summary: Margaret Atwood at her bestreview/text: I've always enjoyed Margaret Atwood's books. This is one of the first I'd read by her and when I saw it was available for my Kindle I decided to read it again. It's a very interesting and sad story of a male-centered society and the two classes of women in a post-apocalyptic-type country. There is triumph and tragedy that keeps the pages turning.
