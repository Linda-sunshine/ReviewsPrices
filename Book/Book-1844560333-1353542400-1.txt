review/summary: Far better than expected.review/text: I was familiar with the BBC TV series which was beautifully produced. i read the book to see how it compared and it was excellent as the characters were exactly as expected. The authors use of english is very enjoyable and more accessible than I thought it would be. Best bit of 200 year old chicklit you can read.
