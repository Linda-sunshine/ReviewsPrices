review/summary: It gets better with every readreview/text: I decided to reread the novel in light of the pending release of the 2013 film. So glad I did. I was once again instantly absorbed into the story, the expressive language and the emotion with which it is written. I'm sure that the new film will pale in comparison, but I am excited to see the story brought to life nevertheless. I can always return to the pages if I find anything lacking.
