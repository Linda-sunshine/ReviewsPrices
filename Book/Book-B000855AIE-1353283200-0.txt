review/summary: An enriching and inspiring little pamphlet!review/text: I bought this little book/pamphlet about 5 or 6 years ago and read through it all in about 45 minutes to an hour(and I am a slow reader. And I read it once a day for the next two weeks probably. I recently came across it again in my book collection and read it again as it is significantly important to re-read this on and off repeatedly until it becomes embedded in your psyche and becomes natural for you the lessons in this book. Highlight, make notes, etc. It is easy to read and gets right to the point without any ambiguity. But do not just read the words. Actually take the time and think about what the author is saying and think about how it is true in your life and how accurate and relevant it is that one's thoughts make a man: hence the title of the book As a Man Thinketh.While the message is beautiful, lovely, and accurate to a T, it is not always easy to control your thoughts and avoid the evil and malicious ones entering your psyche which prove disastrous to one's health, future, endeavors, the relationship he has with the world and himself. And the author makes it a point to have a goal in your life , a passion, and aim straight ahead to attain that goal and not be distracted from negativity and base thoughts and sooner or later he will be awarded accordingly.This is truly one of the best self help books I have ever truly read. It is a must read for anyone who is floundering around for the perfect self help book. Best of all is its brevity as it is only 70 pages or so in length.
