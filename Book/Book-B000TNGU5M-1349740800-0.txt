review/summary: Night...Was a Nightmare for Elie Wiesel and so many other Jewsreview/text: This book is a real look at life as Elie lived it as at the hands of the Nazi rulers. You get the feeling of what life was like as a teenager being thrown into a dark world and put into a concentration camp. Beatings, hunger, seeing death around you, watching his father get beatten and then watch his death, working endless days just because he was a Jew. I do admire this man "Elie Wiesel",for letting us look into his painful past.My grandparents talked about their families being sent to concentration camps and talked about very few members of the family making out alive. No one wanted to share details with me as a child and now I am finding out more details from books like "Night".Never Again...I pray history will not repeat itself!
