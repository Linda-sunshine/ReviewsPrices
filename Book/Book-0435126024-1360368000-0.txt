review/summary: More than just a love storyreview/text: To get right to the point, this book is one that every girl needs to read. Jane never forgets or loses who she is no matter what she goes through. And in the end, not even her wildest dreams could compare to what became her reality and it's all because she stayed true to herself. Jane Eyre, in all her bravery, quickly and easily became my most beloved heroine. She never tried to change Mr. Rochester into something he wasn't. She wouldn't allow him to spoil her with superficial things. She didn't want anything his money could buy, she just wanted to be needed, to be loved. And in the end, that was all Mr. Rochester wanted as well. What more could you ask for? Charlotte Bronte worked wonders. She made Jane feel as if she is an old friend telling her life story through laughter and tears. Reading this book will be one of the best decisions you've ever made. I guarantee it. Disney princesses can suck it. Jane takes the crown.
