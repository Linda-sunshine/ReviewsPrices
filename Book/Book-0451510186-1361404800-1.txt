review/summary: Exquisite Literaturereview/text: Everyone should read this book. What interesting ideas and philosophy are presented! It is not your average battle between good and evil - this is a pained battle. The protagonist does not behave like any usual protagonist - good, pure, lovely. You're not quite sure who you're rooting for throughout the book an the ending seems both just, unjust, mercuful, and harsh. What a book. Really makes you think.
