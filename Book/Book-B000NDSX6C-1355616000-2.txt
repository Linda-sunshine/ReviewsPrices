review/summary: A great bookreview/text: I first bought this book in paperback and really liked it so I got the Lord of the Rings series an Im reading thm now.It is a very well written book that goes much into detail about how Bilbo got the Ring and the adventuring during which he did.I really liked it!But seriously, does anyone notice how every time movie based on a book goes out EVERYONE buys the book, just because of the movie(Hunger games was a big one, I read th book way before the movie came out)?
