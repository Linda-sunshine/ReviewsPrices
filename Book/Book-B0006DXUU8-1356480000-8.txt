review/summary: A comfortable well known tale.review/text: We all know the story of A Christmas Carol. We've seen the movie every year for years, but do we really know the story. For my part it was a joy to read Dickens own words because every film is a slightly different version of the book. After reading his words I feel I finally know the story. I recommend it to everyone.
