review/summary: we know we are loved but do we feel lovedreview/text: Awesome easy read. Realizing your primary is simple once u discover yours and your spouse's everything will change...for the greater...if u choose to love him/her using their primary and secondary love language. Read it and gave it to my aunt and uncle. Like I said simple stuff with a profound impact. Already on page 24 of the five love languages for children so excited for what is in store for our family. Highly recommend for even a great marriage...it only gets better.
