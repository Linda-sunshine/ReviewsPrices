review/summary: Great Love Storyreview/text: Nicholas Sparks keeps me so interested in what is going to happen next that I cannot put his books down. I even love the way he goes from present to past without losing my interest because he has such smooth transitionings. I only can wish that I had had a love such as this in my life.
