review/summary: Awesome read, abrupt endingreview/text: I bought this book because I was intrigued by the storyline and read it in just about one sitting. Eddie dies in a freak accident at the amusement park he works at and meets five people who have shaped his life in some way, whether he realized it or not while alive. Extremely unique and facinating, I really enjoyed in particular the second person he met. How cool it would be if we all had this opportunity after death! The ONLY reason I didn't give five stars was disappointment with the ending ; it seemed like lots of time was devoted to the first four and a rushed, abrupt meeting with the last individual (almost as if the author bored of writing and just wanted to finish!) Overall, I would absolutely recommend this as a great read, and the $6.00 price for the ebook is worth it!
