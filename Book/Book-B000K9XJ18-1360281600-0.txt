review/summary: Not the best Reacherreview/text: An interesting idea for a crime spree, but this is one padded story with a fairly predictable "twist", especially as Reacher books go. And there are some scenes that make almost ZERO sense. If you're a Reacher addict, you'll read it anyway. If you're not, save your time and money.
