review/summary: A classicreview/text: This is still a good read. Given when it was written you must admit it has prophetic qualities, though the media people are addicted to these days are increasingly ones that Bradbury had not imagined. There are uncanny parallels between the 'family on the screen' in the book and the way many people relate to media like facebook. The reason why I don't give it a higher rating is because I personally think the style of writing feels a bit dated. The text contains many features that I myself would have edited away in my own writing. I wonder if a modern agent or publisher would have commented that the manuscript needs polishing before being publishable. It should be stressed that these are my private opinions and I am sure many don't agree with them. Read it and decide for yourself. This is a powerful story about being entertained to the point of loosing touch with everything that matters in life. Though our media landscape is not the product of an evil society there are many similarities between the way we and the characters in Bradbury's book live through the media.
