review/summary: It makes so much sense, why didn't I think of this?review/text: After reading this book I started to notice the love languages of all of the people in my life. I can see how connecting with people on their level can only enhance my relationship with them. Wish I read this book years ago.It's a very easy read with many stories of unhappy marriages becoming loving again using the principles in the book. The book, itself, didn't seem to be particularly geared toward woman or men, but I did find certain chapters focussed on one or the other. That was slightly off putting to me. Also, the quiz at the end can be pretty sad for those who haven't had love in their relationship in a long time. The questions are phrased as if the spouse has been doing the loving things.If you're not feeling particularly loved in your relationship this book may give you some insight and may help turn your relationship around. Definitely worth a read.
