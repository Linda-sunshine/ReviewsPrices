review/summary: Still A True Classic and I liked it!review/text: I didn't grow up reading this kind of stuff, so I guess you could say, I am trying to make up for lost time. I haven't read many, and I can't seem to read them in succession, but I am reading them. This is the second Jane Austen novel I've read, and I really couldn't tell you which one I liked better. I think it would probably have to be this one. Maybe it was because I had already had a little practice with Pride? I don't know. But this one, to me, seemed to be a love story from the start, and also seemed to be much sweeter, somehow. But I'm not sure what it was that struck me closer to the heart, because Pride was just as much so...wasn't it? Anyway, if you want to read the classics, and can get past the old english, which to me is kind of elegant, then give this a try. It is a good read, after all...
