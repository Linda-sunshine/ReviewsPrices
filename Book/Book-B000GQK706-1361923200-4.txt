review/summary: If you want to escape for a change try this Trilogy!review/text: Folks this is my fourth time reading this trilogy and it just seems to get better every time I read it. I love all kinds of books but to relax and start reading something like this just takes me away to another place. If you like Fantasy (even for a change) I don't think you'll be disappointed.Jay
