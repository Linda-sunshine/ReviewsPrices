review/summary: Always a fun read!review/text: This is probably my fourth or fifth time through The Hobbit and it still rewards. I read it as a kid, read it to my kids and still find it enjoyable and meaningful.I bought the Kindle version and it is well done and worth having on the Kindle. It has a few of the drawings and maps, although they can be hard to read. The text is fine and well-done.
