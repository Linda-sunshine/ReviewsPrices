review/summary: George Orwell's 1984review/text: I normally don't write reviews however, this time i feel compelled. I want to start off saying everyone needs to read this book. I originally read this on my kindle windows phone app. As you can see it's no longer available electronically. When you read the book you'll understand why they don't want it to be so readily available. Although most of what's happening in todays world is beyond 1984.I ordered & read this three months ago. Then approximately a month ago Amazon deleted it from my phone!!! Totally elligal. They did not refund my money nor did they offer to. Not only did they delete 1984 they deleted ALL my books!!! About eight total. I also was in the middle of reading Behind The Green Mask (another MUST read) by Rosa Koire, exposing the governments agenda for the 21st century. I'm surprised this is still available on Kindle.Well, people i'm just going to have buy the hard copy of 1984. The government won't be able to steal THAT copy from me!The answer to 1984 is 1776.
