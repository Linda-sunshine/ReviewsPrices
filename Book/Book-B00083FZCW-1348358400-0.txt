review/summary: BEST FREAKING BOOK EVER!review/text: Im currently on book four in the Max Ride series, and i stopped by to say that James Patterson did an exeptional job with this book. ( yes its so good im talking like an adult when im Max's age, lol) it hooks you at the beggining and never gets boring. I was a Warriors fan before Maximum Ride, but now, Max first, Firestar and the clans second! buy this book!
