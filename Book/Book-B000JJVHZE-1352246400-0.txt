review/summary: A classic must-read!review/text: If you only read one book this year, read this one. It's a timeless classic about doing what is right, vs doing what is easy. Each time I read it I find something new. Atticus Finch is a true hero. Wish this was available for Kindles - my paperback copy is held together with a rubber band.
