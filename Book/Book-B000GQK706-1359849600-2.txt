review/summary: One of my top 5review/text: I have read the LOTR every few years or so and it never gets old. I loved the movies but the books are so much better. What a vision Tolkien had and what a brain to come up with not only an awesome tale but languages and mythology and geography. This should be required reading for every student. Don't miss it!
