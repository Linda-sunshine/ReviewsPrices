review/summary: First time in a long timereview/text: I have been sick for three years and one thing that has suffered is my reading. It used to be when I got a new Ludlum or Clancy book that I would stay up as late as it took to finish it. I haven't done that for a while but I did with this book. I had seen the movie and wanted to read the book. (Books are always better!) They are different and that's fine. Sometimes what works in a movie wouldn't work in a book and vice versa. I will definitely be reading other Jack Reacher books.
