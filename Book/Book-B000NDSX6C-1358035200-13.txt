review/summary: A great classic talereview/text: Who can go wrong with the great and esteemed author that is Tolkien. This book sparked and served as the forerunner to many other authors fine works. I love how the story moves quickly without lingering on about a person's inner thoughts for pages and pages (I.e. Robert Jordon). If you want to truly know the fantasy genre then you have to start here.
