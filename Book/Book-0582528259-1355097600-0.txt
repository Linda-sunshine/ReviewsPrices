review/summary: Of Interest to Preteen Girlsreview/text: Oh, how Jane Eyre was such a boring read! But, of course, I've never been a little girl, the target audience for this story. It reads like a diary, without the "Dear diary, ..." part a nd covers Jane's life - as imagined by young Charlotte. I only read it for a literature class.
