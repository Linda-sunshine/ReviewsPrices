review/summary: Always a favoritereview/text: We have always had at least 1 version of &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; every year. It is a time honored story. If it isn't reading it yourself, we can watch it on dvd, or listen to it on an audio book. We look forward to it every year. It is our favorite Christmas story. I recommend it to everyone.
