review/summary: Amazing!review/text: This book is amazing. My copy has highlights and notes throughout. Lewis has greatly helped me to come to a fuller understanding of basic Christian thought through this. This is a definate recommend for someone who is Christian or wanting to know about Christian thought. Wow, I can't get over how fantastic this was. This is what the joy of reading is all about. Final Grade - A+
