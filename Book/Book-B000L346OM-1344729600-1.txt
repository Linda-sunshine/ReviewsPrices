review/summary: One of the Most Profound Reads EVER!review/text: My most recent purchase of "Man Search for Meaning" by Viktor F. Frankl was so that I might gift my first copy to our church library. From cradle to grave man searches for meaning in life. Viktor Frankl was already a distinguished psychiatrist when the Second World War broke out and he and his family where brutally torn from their lives and thrown into concentration camps. Frankl's account of his experiences there and observations of human behavior in most extreme situations is riveting.In the reading of it, you will be forever changed.
