review/summary: A Forever Favoritereview/text: The Great Gatsby. The novel I was assigned to read in high school, then came back years later to my young adult self. Only then did I realize the true brilliance of this book.At the heart of the story, lies the deep infatuation of Jay Gatsby for Daisy Fay Buchanan. But more importantly is the setting and the idea of the American dream in the 1920's.Five years before the tale began, the lovers had moved in different directions. Daisy had married Tom Buchanan to accommodate her life of luxury, while Gatsby earned a mysterious fortune. Nick Carraway then begins to narrate the tale and is responsible for bringing the two lovers together.All these characters are thrown together in a story of hypocracy, parties, bantering dialogue, and the idea that money conquers all.The Great Gatsby is a classic that has earned it's place on my favorites list and will be read over and over again.
