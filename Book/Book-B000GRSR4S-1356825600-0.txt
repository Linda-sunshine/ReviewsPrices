review/summary: Well Worth Giving a Tryreview/text: Slaughterhouse 5 is supposedly an antiwar book. Instead it is a creative tale juxtaposing the war experiences of the main character, Billy Pilgrim, with other events in his life, most notably his kidnapping by space aliens. Pilgrim is weak character who drifts though life, moving back and forth in time and space, sometimes on Earth, sometimes on an alien planet. Time didn't flow in one direction for Billy Pilgrim. As the book progresses, Pilgrim sometimes lives in his future, at others goes back to his past.I thought Slaughterhouse 5 was an engrossing read and enjoyed it quite a bit. This is not the kind of book I would normally pick up, and I'm glad I didn't read it in high school, because I would have hated it then. It's a bit more profane and graphic than I prefer, but that didn't take away from the story. This is a good science fiction story and worth giving a try.
