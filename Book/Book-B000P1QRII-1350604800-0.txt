review/summary: Mehreview/text: I had to read this book as part of a Young Adult literature class, and the attend a lecture by Lois Lowery. I can honestly say, that I wasn't that thrilled with the book. I felt like I'd read it before. I hadn't, but I read a book that had similar ideas that was written in 1938 by Ayn Rand entitled Anthem. Anthem takes place in the future, in a world where individuals have no name, no independence, and no values. All decisions are made by committees and individualism doesn't exist. Giver is essentially about a society that has eliminated pain and strife by converting to "Sameness," a plan that has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives.
