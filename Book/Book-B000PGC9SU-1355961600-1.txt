review/summary: Interesting Readingreview/text: Actually, I am only 50% through the book, but I can say I have thoroughly enjoyed it thus far. Franklin's description of his upbringing and split away from the family to pursue his own career is enlightening. One morning, as I was laying in bed waking up, I thought, &#34;What was that movie I was watching last night in that Colonial setting?&#34; It was of course that the images I immagined from the book were vivid. I personally found the philosophy sections that followed a little less interesting, but for some, this the meat of the book. Regardless, it offers real insight into life in Boston, Philly and London during the Colonial era. Anyone interested in printing and the printing business will like this. Now, I have to finish the book!
