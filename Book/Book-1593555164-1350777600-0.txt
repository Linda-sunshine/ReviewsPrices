review/summary: Jack Reacher: One Shot: A Novelreview/text: Gripping...and has fair amount of twists to keep one guessing.I read this book as a precursor to the movie that will be out in December and i can say that now i await the movie with more anticipation.The book has all the elements of a thriller in the right doses and does not bore you in any way..
