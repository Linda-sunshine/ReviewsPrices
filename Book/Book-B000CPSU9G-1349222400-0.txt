review/summary: The end is worth itreview/text: The middle of the story is very boring. But if you can get past that, the end of the book is worth it. We rented Dorian Gray with Ben Barnes and Colin Firth. It is loosely based on the book. I like the book better. There are several movies out about the book. I am going to watch all of them and see how closely they parallel the book. That's how intriguing I find this book.
