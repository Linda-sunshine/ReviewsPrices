review/summary: The Best Books Ever!review/text: The Lord of the Rings are my favorite books of all time. I've read them at least every five years since I was fifteen. There are few adequate words to express what these books mean to me except that the writings of Tolkien have greatly influenced me to give writing a try for myself.Lucifer's Pocket. The level of detail and depth of plot is beyond belief to the extent that I am inclined to say that Tolkien didn't create the Middle Earth, he saw it in a vision and wrote what he saw.The Kindle editions of The Lord of the Rings are pretty well done. My only objection is that you can't zoom in on the maps.
