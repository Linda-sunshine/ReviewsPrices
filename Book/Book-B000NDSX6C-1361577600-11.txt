review/summary: Have to read this once in your lifetime!review/text: Honestly I knew nothing about middle earth or hobbits until I saw The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring in the theatre. When I got home I went and bought the trilogy novels because the movie was magnificent. Along with it came the book The Hobbit which I read first since it was said to be a prequel. It was amazing&#8230;I&#8217;d have to say it&#8217;s a choice for the tween population mostly because at times it seemed a little childish for an adult, but at others I wouldn&#8217;t allow my six year old cousin to read it. If you are going to read this with your child you should know there are pitch-black scenes with goblins and trolls in scary caves, the dwarves and Bilbo get captured a couple times which included being whipped once, strung upside-down and almost cooked at one point, and even Gollum has a conversation with himself and decides whether or not he should eat Bilbo! Along with that there is a war that happens which can get gory at times, and a fight with some huge spiders and evil wolves.The ring in this book has such wild powers and to see a hobbit, a simple and small creature, show as much courage and bravery, along with all the action-packed scenes, fascinating imagery, magic and a bit of underlying comedy makes this a classic that anyone will enjoy. I give The Hobbit a four star rating for allowing my imagination to go wild!~For more reviews go to [...]
