review/summary: Best of the bestreview/text: I love this book. I really wanted it in hardcover. I had to have it. We are losing everything to electronics. I love my library full of real books that can be held. Love to cuddle in a comfortable chair, reading a book under my tiffany lamps on a rainy day.I wish it came leather bound.
