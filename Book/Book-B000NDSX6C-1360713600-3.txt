review/summary: I bought this before Lord of the Rings movie released and loved it.review/text: I was always a Tolkien fan and still am. I haven't seen the new Hobbit movie yet and will more than likely wait for it to come out on blu ray before I purchase that and watch. I am a really big fan having different characters acted out by a complete set of performers. Having read the book I liked how closely it followed the story-line. I purchased this one from amazon to replace a broken disc I had and didn't rip it to my computer.
