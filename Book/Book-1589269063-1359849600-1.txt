review/summary: 5 Languages of Lovereview/text: Gary Chapman has always been very intuative when it comes to bridging the communication gap between men and woman. His research and its findings are dead on as always. I only wish that more people would know to read his books or attend on of his seminars. Our countries divorce rate would drop significantly. Five stars for amazon for making this well written book available.
