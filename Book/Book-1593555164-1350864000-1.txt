review/summary: Definitely one of the best!review/text: It starts with a psycho shooter blasting away at a crowded square, but it's an open and shut case - an ex-Army sniper named James Barr must have done it. But, when Jack Reacher arrives in town, people start to get nervous. It turns out that there is more to the shooting than meets the eye, and someone does not want the truth known. Now it's all on Reacher to get to the bottom of things...if he can keep himself alive!This is the ninth Jack Reacher novel, and the best that I have read so far. The story is quite excellent, with a great mystery and lots of action. They say that they are going to make a movie based on this book - well, all I can say is that they made a great choice!If you like a good thriller, then you will like this book - it's definitely one of the best!
