review/summary: Read It Againreview/text: This is the Oscar Wilde classic you might have read in college or even before that. It might have been on the curriculum when you were into other things. I know this was the case with me in my nineteenth century lit class in college. It's different now and I found myself ready to check it out again. I found Wilde to be at his wittiest and most urbane, at the top of his form. Thanks to this ebook this terrific classic is an enjoyable reading experience all over again.
