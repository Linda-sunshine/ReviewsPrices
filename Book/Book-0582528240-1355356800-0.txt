review/summary: Huckleberry Finnreview/text: I highly recommend to read this novel Huckleberry Finn. The original text and word choice remain intact; Twain's masterpiece hasn't been altered in this version. The layout is also excellent, you won't find the strange spacing or distortion of alignment that you find in some of the Kindle versions of classics. The price is perfect and the product is fantastic.As for the book, I find the novel to be extremely well written, but also a little dated. Twain is most definitely hilarious, and his characterization is top notch. His control of local dialect, and his ability to portray this effectively on the page, is without any peers. Huck's examination of his surroundings and his own thoughts on everything that happens to him is interesting and heartwarming. However, I feel that a lot of the satire is no longer as powerful as it was when the novel was written. Satire works best when the general population is "in the moment" of whatever the subject matter may be. Huck's struggle to follow his heart, while his understanding of morality in his pre-Civil War society tells him it would be immoral, is a little harder to relate to in this day and age. Twain was a master, but I feel that a novel like "Catcher in the Rye" holds up a little better. At least to me
