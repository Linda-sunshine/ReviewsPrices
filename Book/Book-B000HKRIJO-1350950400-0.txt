review/summary: Logical Argument for Christianityreview/text: This was an incredible book. Lewis argued for why he believed in Christianity in a way that could make a person on the brink of believing or not, believe. The reason is he used logic, rather than emotion, and therefore the person sees concrete reasons. Another thing that worked in his favor is he never says, "Christianity believes this thing is wrong, therefore it must be illegal." While I did disagree on some things, for example, that women should submit to their husbands, that doesn't deter my opinion of this book.
