review/summary: Transformativereview/text: After reading this book in college many years ago, I was transformed by the prose of Herman Melville. Not only does he delve into the human soul and all of its variables, but he deals with nature at its most primeval. It will always be my favorite book due to the intricacies of the characters and the fabulous writing style. I have been an avid reader ever since, daring authors to match the brilliance of Moby Dick: or, the White Whale.
