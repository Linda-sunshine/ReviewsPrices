review/summary: Very meaningful readreview/text: This was a very compelling book to read. I couldnt keep it down till I finished the whole book. The reader will definitely be able to relate himself or herself to the real life examples mentioned in this book. This book gives one the revelation that the difficulties or challenges one faces in life are definitely far more better than the concentration camp experiences of the author and it gives one the confidence to face and overcome any situation successfully in life provided one has found the true meaning of his life. A must read book for all!
