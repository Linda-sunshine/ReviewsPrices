review/summary: Slaughter House Fivereview/text: An unusual but effective way the author has adopted to get the anti war message across. I found the story interesting and educational concerning the bombing of Dresden. I thought the author was very successful in highlighting the fact that mass killings can be achieved by bombing without the use of a nuclear bomb.This book is a very good read.
