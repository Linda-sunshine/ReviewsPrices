review/summary: Read, Think, Applyreview/text: Reading Allen feels very similar to reading passages of certain religious texts. You can tell that he speaks Truth and does so in a poetic yet succinct style. The wisdom here is worth reading and re-reading until the lessons sink in and can be applied to life. Great stuff!
