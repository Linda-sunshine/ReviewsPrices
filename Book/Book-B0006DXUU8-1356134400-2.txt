review/summary: Now I know why it is such a favorite.review/text: I was an English Lit. major, and never a big fan of Dickens. He is too long winded. But this book seemed too short. It's not that I felt that it was incomplete. I just enjoyed it so much that I wanted more.Do yourself a favor, and read it at christmas time. I did.
