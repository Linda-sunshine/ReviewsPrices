review/summary: Dickens Christmas Carolreview/text: I downloaded the kindle version for my Microsoft Surface. This book is a classic and is a must read for anyone who likes this story. I had seen several versions of A Christmas Carol and/or Scrooge but I had never read the book until now. It was well worth the time and I couldn't argue with the price for the download. Get it. You won't be disappointed.
