review/summary: Gods & Kingsreview/text: One of the most interesting books I have read for ages. Couldn't wait to read the rest of the series. Suddenly the bible and message of the Old Testament came alive and made me realise the importance of what a relationship with God was all about. It also reminded me of the awesome nature and greatness of our God and how by disregarding Him can have dire consequences. So relevant for our country today. Everyone should read this book. Once the first page is read, it is very difficult to put it down. Incredible author.
