review/summary: Even better the third timereview/text: This book is better every time I read it. It was great to finally enjoy the electronic version on my new Kindle fire. Rowling is a genius with the exclusive Potter store. I guess that's how millionaires stay millionaires. I had forgotten about some of the differences between the book and the movie.
