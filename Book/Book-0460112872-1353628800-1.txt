review/summary: As good as everreview/text: I am concurrently reading &#34;The Brontes: Wild Genius on the Moors. The story of three sisters&#34; and took a &#34;time out&#34; from the biography to re-read all of Jane Eyre. I loved it as much as I ever have but this time I knew what parts were autobiographical and where the basic concept for the story came from. Interestingly, I had always thought the part between the time she leaves Thornfield and returns was rather less vivid than the rest. Turns out most contemporary reviewers thought so as well. Still, knowing that the marriage proposal from St. John Rivers has a basis in Charlotte Bronte's life made it more interesting this time around. I highly recommend both books.
