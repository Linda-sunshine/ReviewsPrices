review/summary: Absolutely sublime.review/text: Of the book:It's one of those insideous books which makes you think and think until you want to dash your head against a wall. It makes you empty and quiet for a few days after you read it. It's one of those unassuming masterpieces which makes you want to do something, write something, run just to feel your heart race. When you put it down, you want to turn to someone, take their shoulders and shake them and say, "You have to read this, you have to understand."10/10Of the audiobook:It's one of the smoothest I've ever heard. Christopher Hurt's voice is fitting and easy to listen to. I can find no fault in pronunciation or timing--everything is perfect.10/10
