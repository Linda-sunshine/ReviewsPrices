review/summary: The Hiding Place - amazing!review/text: Corrie Ten Boom has shared her life and touched the lives of very person who picks up her book. Her courage, selflessness and obedience to her God are such inspiration and encouragement for her readers. One of the best books I have had the pleasure if owning and reading. I purchased this book for my kindle but will most likely purchase the hard cover edition for my bookshelf.
