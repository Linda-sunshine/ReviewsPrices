review/summary: Excellent Readreview/text: I thoroughly enjoyed this book. And the dictionary on the Kindle was a godsend for all the archaic or foreign terms used in the book. It would have been nice to have a description of the various characters, without giving away the secrets of those with another identity. Sometimes I had to go back to verify who a character was. But other than that, it was a great story.
