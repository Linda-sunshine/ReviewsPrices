review/summary: I gave it as a giftreview/text: first off, my adults children introduced me to this book and it was &#34;required&#34; reading before I started my Grandmother duties. the pointers and practices of the 5 S's works wonders. I was so pleased by the results of practicing the recommendations that I purchased this particular book for another set of new parents.
