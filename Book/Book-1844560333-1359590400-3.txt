review/summary: Tiffanyreview/text: Well I'll tell you that at first I could not understand what they were saying but I got the hang of it. This is my new favorite book. I Love Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett, or shall I say Elizabeth Darcy. I recommend this to people who like a good romance blindness and you got to be able to understand the language in which the book is written in. Then after or before you should watch the movie or/and the short tv show of pride and prejudice.
