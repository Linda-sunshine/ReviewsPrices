review/summary: Uncle Tom's Cabinreview/text: I never read this book until now. Having recently visited the home of Harriet Beecher Stowe, I became interested in why she wrote such a book, and the more I read, the more I understood the terrible conditions of slavery that our country allowed in the years leading up to the Civil War. I can see why this book incensed so many people to rebel against the practice of slavery and why they fought so hard to rid this country of it. According to something I read in her home, it is said that President Lincoln, upon meeting her, said: "so you're the little lady that caused this great war..." After reading this book, I can agree - it surely upset and angered many people to fight for the abolition of slavery.
