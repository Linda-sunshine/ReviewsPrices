review/summary: Overall goodreview/text: Once again I stepped outside my normal suspense genre to sample another style of writing. I still like my lead characters to be strong. This character was week...always on the verge of a nervous breakdown. She consistently made bad choices. However, her mother was feisty and I liked that character. Faith went through a lot to finally catch a glimpse of the type of mother she wanted and needed. The author gives a decent view of a woman finding herself and a daughter finally getting a mom.
