review/summary: Good bookreview/text: This book kept me fixed on something to do & it also kept me from boredom on the plane to Miami. I was reading for 5 hours when I fell asleep. I still don't understand why Tolkien didn't make Thorins death more ceremonial. All in all it was a really good book to read. I would definitely recommend this book.
