review/summary: More than great...review/text: I came into `The Great Gatsby' knowing it was a classic (and highly regarded as one of the greatest pieces of literature) and that I should read it bit also knowing that the 1974 film adaptation (which I did see) was awful and tainted my interest in the novel. Knowing that rabid fans of the book also hated the film helped convince me to take it off the shelf (I've owned it for a few years) and read it.So glad that I did.Having previously read Fitzgerald's short story collection which contained `The Curious Case of Benjamin Button', I was familiar with his writing style (detailed yet easy on the intake) and immediately took to this novel. The way that Fitzgerald paints these characters and their situations and the `Jazz Age' itself is so wonderfully astute and captivating at every turn. This is a short yet very rich story, filling nearly 200 pages with beautifully delicate character development (enough mystery to make these people intoxicating as opposed to merely fascinating) and an engaging plot that completes itself in the most unexpected and yet tragically beautiful way imaginable (yes, I knew the ending thanks to the film, but it feels so much more `complete' here).The meaning behind the pursuit at play here is remarkable, and the way that the story's conclusion truly embeds itself in relevance, even today, is unexpected yet welcome.The story told is that of Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire who moves nearby his sweetheart of yesteryear, Daisy, who is now a mother and married to a wealthy man with a downtrodden mistress on the side. Daisy and Gatsby were torn apart by social circles and the war, and while he was fighting for his country she was being swept off her feet by Tom Buchanan. The novel is narrated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's neighbor and trusted confidant. Through his friendship, both Gatsby and Daisy reunite and Nick is torn between his friendship with Gatsby and his knowledge of not only Daisy's love for him but also of her husband Tom's indiscretions.Beautifully fleshed out and `whole', this classic earns that title with every word. Creating characters that are unforgettable (Tom being one of my favorite literary creations) and a story that is so inspired and poignant, `The Great Gatsby' is just that; great!
