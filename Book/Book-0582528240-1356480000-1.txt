review/summary: Huckleberry Finnreview/text: There are certain books that everybody should read in his/her early life. Nevertheless, this is not exactly the case with this one. It could be read throughout without getting bored at all. Even if seen to be a bit quaint nowadays, the adventures of this little hero are so adorable and thrilling.Furthermore, I welcome the idea of publishing the great book bit by bit, thus making it more digestible. Why not indeed, bearing in mind today's prevalent trend of scanning and skim reading due to the chrnic lack of time.This enjoyable read could even grant some relaxation and peace of mind to all modern people that are so stressed out lately.
