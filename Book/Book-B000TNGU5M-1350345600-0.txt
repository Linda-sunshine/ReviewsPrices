review/summary: Had to read this in class it was so goodreview/text: I loved this book. I had to read it for class and thought it was another one of those boring books you're forced to read. I was wrong and could not put it down. Great read. I didn't download it because I recieved a print copy, but TOTALLY worth the money.
