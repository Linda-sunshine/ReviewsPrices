review/summary: Why did I wait so long?review/text: This book appeared on an optional eighth grade reading list for me -- 45 years ago. And, I'm very sorry I waited so long to become acquainted with Betty Smith's masterpiece. If nothing else, Francie Nolan is a contemporary of my grandparents, and it would have been a great way to start conversations that might have let me learn more about what it was like to grow up in poor immigrant families in small-town Wisconsin.Beyond that, though, this is a truly compelling story of a girl's coming of age under less-than-ideal circumstances, buoyed mainly by her own strength of character. Smith's sparse writing style took a bit for me to get used to, and it helped reading her biography and learning that she was primarily a dramatist; she prefers to show her readers what's going on and leave them to their own interpretations, rather than simply telling them.The latter chapters weren't quite as rewarding, even though it's comforting to see that Francie's hard work is finally going to pay off. The real meat of the story occurs in her formative years ending with her own eighth grade graduation. Even so, these were not characters I was prepared to leave when the book ends. And, while I believe I understood the adults better for having waited 45 years to tackle this book. I'd heartily recommend it to anyone 12 and up who wants to read a wonderful story of a girl's growing up.
