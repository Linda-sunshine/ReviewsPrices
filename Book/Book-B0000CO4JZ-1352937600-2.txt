review/summary: Review of The Great Gatsbyreview/text: This novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald is one of my favorite novels that I have ever read. I had to read it in high school and i have probably read it 10 times since then. I love the contrast between the morality of all the characters where Nick is moral almost to a fault while Gatsby and Daisy are both almost too immoral to function. This timely story contains action, scandal, love, and betrayal and it captures the escence of great American literature.
