review/summary: One of the best books I've ever readreview/text: That was an incredible encouraging book sayin not to give up. It was an awesome book, but did any of you notice that there wasn't water in the survival pack, what if he was stranded in a desert. That is just something little I realized, no biggie Mr. Paulsen
