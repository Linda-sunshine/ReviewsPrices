review/summary: How could you NOT love this book!review/text: At the age of 15, he was sent from his home in Hungary to a multitude of work camps and concentration camps. He remembered EVERYTHING! And I mean EVERYTHING!! The way things looked, smelled, felt and seen. It was as if he knew that he would survive this trial of his life to write about it and inspire others to live. So many concentration camp refugees had survivor's remorse for many years after 1945. Between 1945 and today, many museums, monuments and statues have been created in order that we not forget what has happened to 6 million Jewish people and a multitude of mentally stunted, homosexual, ill, or otherwise unwanted disappeared as well. Those who are of that generation, must make sure that those who are younger understand this time in world history, so that it will not be repeated again!This book was a challenge book to help celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the American Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC. I chose to read this book. I am so glad I did. I have read, &#34;The Diary of Anne Frank&#34; so much I needed a new copy recently! I wore the old one out! But this was from the teenage boy prospective who already lived in the camps and didn't have time to hide like the Franks did. Shalom Mr Wiesel, Shalom.
