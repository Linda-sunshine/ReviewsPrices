review/summary: Good, but better with whisper syncreview/text: I found myself getting too busy to read but involved in the story. Paired with Alan Cummings read where I left off, I was able to continue while driving to work. Even though I knew the story (I was my own spoiler...), it was still engaging, and I enjoyed going back to a chill that didn't rely on gore to frighten.
