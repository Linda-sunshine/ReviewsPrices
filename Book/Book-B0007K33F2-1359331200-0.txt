review/summary: A Classic Page-burnerreview/text: This enormous book took quite a while to read, but I was certainly happy because I could not put it down. I felt that no part of it dragged along and felt insignificant compared to the genius of the author.The only problem I had was that the Kindle version says the book is about 600 pages, which was certainly not nearly correct. Maybe they will fix in an update.
