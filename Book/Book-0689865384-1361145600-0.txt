review/summary: Ugliesreview/text: I thought this book was good. It had a great premise. I had a problem with how the author named things, though. It felt like he always just added -ies to the end of every group of people. Rusties. Smokies. Uglies. Pretties. Even Littlies? Its a good book, maybe a little predictable, once you get past the names.
