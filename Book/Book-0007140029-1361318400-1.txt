review/summary: LOVE ITreview/text: My daughter absolutely loves these books. She is going through about 2 each month. She is 8, and i think this is probably above her 'normal' reading level. There are lots of big words, and she manages through it because she is obsessed with the story. Her (male) friend Aidan is almost as obsessed.
