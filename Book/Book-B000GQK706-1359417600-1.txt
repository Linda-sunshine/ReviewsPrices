review/summary: The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition) Leather w/slip coverreview/text: This is a beautiful book. If I had to grasp at straws to find a negative, as you read the book it expands slightly, making it harder to fit into the slip cover, and unfolding the maps can be a little tricky because there's not a whole lot of room for them to move. I will be keeping my paperbacks for loaning or travel, but sitting in bed or my easy chair with this book is great.
