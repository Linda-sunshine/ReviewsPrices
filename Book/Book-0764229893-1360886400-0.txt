review/summary: LOVE LOVE LOVE!review/text: I am in love with this series! I bought book 1 because it was free and looked interesting. I forgot about it and started reading another book... I got tired of that one but finished it anyway and when I finally got to this book I was instantly captured! The characters are great and it's not too preachy or overly romantic. It's a great behind-the-scenes book of the bible and I love Lynn's view of the stories the bible has given us! I've read all four but don't have money for the fifth... I know, I know it's not too much but I just don't have it :'(I highly recommend this book to any one!&#9829; &lt;>&lt; &#9829;
