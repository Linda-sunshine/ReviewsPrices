review/summary: Isn't written for a person of strong faithreview/text: Or at least I didn't find it so. After reading more than 50%, I am stopping. I had not read any reviews prior to downloading....this book was offered as a special, and since it is so very well known and supposedly beloved, what could go wrong? I am greatly relieved to discover a number of low ratings, one 4-page written much better than I could hope to produce. Let me just say that I found the book empty and somewhat vain but for the life of me (no pun intended) I cannot articulate why. I strongly feared that if I continued reading, I might never find the peace to go to sleep tonight, so very depressing it seemed. Please, God, don't let this be heaven. Aren't the trials on this earth quite enough?
