review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: I read The Hobbit when I was ten years old and as a result found myself ensnared in to a world of fiction that transcended all of the books I had read before. The Hobbit's fastidious and succulent detail overwhelmed my juvenile psyche and truly pulled back the veil of what was to me at the time a world of brilliant literature, ensconced within the lugubrious arcane words upon the pages of tomes I feared to open. This book is the perfect initiation for a young reader into the imaginative majesty that is literature and I cannot recommend this book enough. I just purchased the e-book and have read it to my 8 year old daughter and she has read it back to me with the fire of illumination smoldering within her voice and scintillating from her eyes. So, yeah I like the book.
