review/summary: Interesting readreview/text: "Keeping Faith" was written in 1999 and one of the few books of hersthat I haven't read. It is about faith in a higher power and alsoabout Faith, a child, who knows nothing of God or religion but seemsto have an inside track. A very provocative book. I wouldrecommend it. Surely, it's food for thought along with being a good story.
