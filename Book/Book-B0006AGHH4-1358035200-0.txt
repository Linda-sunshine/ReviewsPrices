review/summary: Uncle Tom's Cabinreview/text: I felt as if I were living during that era. Ms. Stowe helped me understand the actions of the master, by looking into each slave master's background. The masters financial situation determined the life of the slave.I would recommend this book to every African American over 12. We have such a negative image of the uncle Tom character.
