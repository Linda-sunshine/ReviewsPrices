review/summary: Really Long Classicreview/text: Ayn Rand had about 450 pages worth of brilliant things to say which she crammed into 1188 pages of wordy prose. Ms. Rand's objectivist philosophy tenet of pride as the highest virtue rendered her unable to recognize and remedy her own weaknesses. It takes humility to &#34;murder one's darlings.&#34; Alas, this is something Ms. Rand was unable to do. &#34;Atlas Shrugged&#34; is indeed a classic; however, I would recommend the Reader's Digest version.
