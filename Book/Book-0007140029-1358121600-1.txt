review/summary: Purrfect!review/text: Warriors. What if your housecat turned into a warrior? Outside that is. No longer under the control of humans the cats have created their own society. Sorta of like Lod of the Flies. LOL no anyways the cats make their own society and clans, as Warriors versus the kittypets that are house cats. See and Read the Warriors cat series with tons of books, or kindle e-books, or the Warriors comic manga which is not on kindle but should be. Both Children love it as they want to know what the kitties do without us right? Different clans of cats in the series and some kids like other cats more than others. Books have great graffics and stroyline. Keeps the kids reading as there are lots of books in the series. Please by all because they are Purrfect!!!
