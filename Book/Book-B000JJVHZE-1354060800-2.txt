review/summary: I love this book &#60;3review/text: I read this for the first time in English class, & I always hated having to put it down at the end of class, 'cause the books stayed there. Well, I finally finished the book, but now that I've graduated a couple years ago, it's nice to have my own copy to read cover to cover anytime I want. :) It's wonderful.
