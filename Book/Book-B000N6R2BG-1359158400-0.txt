review/summary: Jodi does it againreview/text: Once again, I opened a Jodi Picoult book and lost myself. Keeping Faith was engrossing and moving and exactly what you would expect from Ms. Picoult. She has the ability to draw her readers in, making them emotionally invested in the characters and their story. Keeping Faith does not disappoint and was a joy to read!
