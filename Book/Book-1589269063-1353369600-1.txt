review/summary: Glad if some people feel this book helped them...butreview/text: This book is a sugar pill. Takes a few valid premises and draws fanciful conclusions; takes its metaphors so seriously that you start to wonder if the author believes in the literal existence of a "love tank" that causes teenagers to misbehave if their parents fail to fill it up. It's absolutely true that people have different ways of communicating love and receiving love. Doing the laundry can be a supremely romantic overture and characterizing particular behaviors/activities as ones love language is a great way for partners to increase the level of satisfaction in their relationship if their "languages" are adequately compatible to start with. Clearly written for a specific audience (i.e. Christian and heterosexual)--and Lord knows this type of marriage needs plenty of help, what with the institution being under attack and all--but there are much better, comprehensive, science-based approaches to couples therapy and what creates healthy and strong marriage and family relationships out there; one therapist's perceived 'success' rate even over a period of 30 years, especially if his clientele are mostly from the same demographic, is not something I would trust to protect my greatest treasure. That said, the placebo effect can be extremely powerful and if it makes you feel better, who cares if it's a sugar pill?
