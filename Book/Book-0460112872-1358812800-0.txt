review/summary: Review of Jane Eyrereview/text: Jane Eyre was orphaned at an age where she didn't remember her parents and was raised by a real she-wolf of a mean aunt. She is sent away to a very strict school which sad to say, was an improvement on her aunt's residence. Read this book while dieting, you will appreciate the small portions you have consumed when Jane is grateful for having a whole slice of bread to herself.Jane does not lead an easy life, yet grows to be a charming, well educated, unassuming woman. Karma repays her for her lack of privilege growing up. This drama is incredibly entertaining, easy to read, a little predictable ... but not entirely. I would definitely recommend it.
