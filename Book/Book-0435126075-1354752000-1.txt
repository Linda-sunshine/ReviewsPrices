review/summary: A must-read for everyone who enjoys a poignant love story!review/text: I know most teens whine & complain when assigned classics to read for school, but this book is so much more than required reading. I first read it in 5th grade (my reading level was advanced for my age #humblebrag lol) and I read it over and over, never tiring of the crisp, Victorian language or heart-rending love story. Read with an open mind!
