review/summary: Wanted More of a Hardcoverreview/text: I wanted to start collecting the Penguin Classics hardcover editions, and I needed this book for a class so I bought it, and I guess I'm glad I hadn't bought a couple other novels to round out my purchase! The cover was rubbing off by the time it arrived to me, in a padded box. However the print on the cover is made, it is done very shoddily and couldn't handle being on a shelf, much less being read. I am very unhappy indeed. Phooey on whoever came up with this.
