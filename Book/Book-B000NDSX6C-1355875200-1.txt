review/summary: A great Adventurereview/text: A delightful book and a great edition where you can hear Tolkien read a passage or sing one of the many songs. It also includes his maps and wonderful drawings that were in the original edition. I had read the book shortly after it came out many years ago and wanted to refresh my memory before seeing the movie. It was well worth the read.
