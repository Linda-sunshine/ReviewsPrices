review/summary: Something to keep and re-readreview/text: 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' is a wonderful, involving work, though the some of the characters are a little exaggerated. It is melodramatic, and though I knew Ms. Stowe had written it to open up the eyes of the world to how wrong slavery was, it is sometimes more like a propaganda piece than I even expected, with some characters "preaching" in ordinary conversation, but overall the book is something to be reread; many of the characters are lovable (as far as a fictional person can) and have unique personalities, and ms. Stowe is good at conveying emotions; this book is fast paced and does not bog down often. Definitely worth at least one read.
