review/summary: Why this book will be the only thing in your bed at nightreview/text: Let's go ahead and acknowledge that the author may have had a few solid points about being independent and standing your ground and so forth. Now we can move on to the inexcusable other 90% of the material.I read this book in a fit of desperation one evening, emotionally weakened by lack of sleep and in need of the same mindless entertainment and self-affirmation that conducting a late night Google search of your own problem can provide. A friend told me it was a "good" book.No! No, no. This book has the worst advice I've ever heard and completely contradicts the idea that two people can communicate effectively, ever. I've tried to scrub my mind of the residue from all of the author's horrible advice but one nasty piece comes to mind -- pretend you can't do anything physical around the house, then "ooo and ahh" over how strong your husband is for something like hammering in a nail? Ladies, s*** like this is condescending and completely insincere. If you value your husband or know him at all, surely you can dig out a real compliment on a quality he's actually proud of.Another theme to ignore if you want a decent guy in your life is the idea that you'd better just clam up when you're angry --to teach him a lesson. There is a term for this, it's called passive-aggressive behavior, and it's a psychological problem that couples go to therapy to try to STOP doing.The author wrote this book for profit, which often requires sensationalism, and against that I have no complaint. However, I was too embarrassed to have this title staring me down from my iPad every time I opened the Kindle app, so I deleted it from my account. If you MUST read advice on relationships rather than talking to your loved one, just use the internet. At least you won't have to pay for it (although figuratively, you might).
