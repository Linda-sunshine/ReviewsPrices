review/summary: Uncle Tom's Cabin is just amazing!!review/text: This is such an amazing story!! It was hard to put down, and while thankfully there is no more slavery in the US, still the lessons in this story do apply in many different ways today, and I think that every person 10th grade and up she read this book. (It would be fine for younger readers, but I think it would make a deeper impact on someone a little older.)While slavery was still alive and well in the US, the author used her story to provid insightful perspectives and arguments to the people of her time, north and south, regarding the various issues surrounding slavery. She makes an amazing, logical, unbiased and indisputable case for why slavery was wrong and had to stop, as well as effectively showing that people of color were no different or less human than white people.Through stories of triumph and beauty, horror and tragedy, she brings to life all the facets of slavery and through these stories, based on real life experiences of people she knew, she is able to confront and address views, attitudes, ideologies and practices regarding slavery in a very fair and pointed way. In her story not all slave owners were cruel, and not all Northerner's who proclaimed to be against slavery did anything to help them, in fact she points out that many didn't want to be around people of color at all. She shows that Christian's themselves were also divided among those who believed it was God's will for them to own slaves, and those who believed Christianity forbade slavery, and shows the different beliefs among white people as to whether or not people of color were animals or humans just like them. This story does a beautiful job of showing just how human the slaves were and how wrong slavery was, she does a wonderful job of bringing her characters to life so that you laugh and cry with them and you don't want the story to end.
