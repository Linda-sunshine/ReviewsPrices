review/summary: Great Classicreview/text: Pride and Prejudice is an awesome book. You can not help but fall in love with Mr. Darcy and admire Elizabeth, she is a strong and smart woman, he is sexy and handsome. It is obvious they are meant to be together and the fact the it is him that realizes he is in love with her sooner than she does, it makes it even better. :-)
