review/summary: Gets me every timereview/text: I did things a bit backwards. I saw the first two movies then finished the series as audio books and caught the new films as they came out. All except for the last book which I actually read before seeing the movies in theater. I own all the DVDs and watch more than any grown woman should. I just now started reading the books and I'm shocked to say I laughed and cried as often while reading (knowing good well what was going to happen) as I did when I watch the films. I love these stories. If I ever have kids, these will be their bedtime stories.
