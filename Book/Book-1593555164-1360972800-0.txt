review/summary: Got Better After First Few Pagesreview/text: This was my first Jack Reacher book and I almost put it down after the first few pages. It started so passive I could hardly get through the first few pages. I counted 8 "was's" on the first page alone. However, I decided to keep going and am glad I did. When the story finally kicked in, it moved.It was hard not to picture Jack as the drastically shorter Tom Cruise, even though I haven't seen the movie yet, but I went with the flow and really enjoyed the story. There were plenty of twists and turns and the writing kept me interested right to the end. Outside of the annoying tendency of the author to use passive phrasing, sometimes in massive blocks, things went well. For the most part, he also kept the point of view solid and only strayed into head-hopping a few times but, not enough to drag the story down.Overall, this was a great read, I'll be looking for others in the series and I highly recommend it.
