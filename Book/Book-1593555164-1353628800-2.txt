review/summary: It is what it isreview/text: A couple thoughts: I give it five stars in terms of Jack Reacher books. If you like the series, you will like the book. Suspend reality for a bit and it is a fun read. However, and this is big, Tom Cruise?!?!? Did I misread the books thus far or isn't Jack Reached 6'5"? It hurts to say it, but that will probably be the end of my reading Jack Reacher books.
