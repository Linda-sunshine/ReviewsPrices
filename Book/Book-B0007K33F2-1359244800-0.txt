review/summary: No words of mine sufficereview/text: No words of mine can properly express the immense poetry and wisdom of this saga. It fully captures all of the human condition and experience but in a way that is gentle and respectable. If only more of today's art would take a similar approach, humankind would benefit and be better for its' influence. Need to read something that can excite you in thought and feel deeply for the characters? This is a must. Truly timeless written art.
