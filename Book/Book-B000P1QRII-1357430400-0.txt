review/summary: A favorite of mine for the last 20 yearsreview/text: I first read this book in elementary school. I liked it then. I read it a few more times in high school and liked it even more. I read it a few weeks ago on the heels of a Hunger Games-fueled young adult novel spree and The Giver is now officially in my Top Ten. Lowry paints a powerful picture of a society that seeks to control everything from the weather to feelings of attraction. No matter how many times I read it, I find myself holding my breath for Jonas as he unpacks the truth about his &#34;perfect&#34; society known as Sameness.
