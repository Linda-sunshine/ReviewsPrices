review/summary: favorite novelreview/text: This is my favorite Austen work. it's a bit more mature than her other works. Love lost and regained. This also shows how a young woman can mature into a self-confident and very responsible young woman in the face of a daunting and selfish family. Mrs. Smith who is Miss anne Eliot's close friend and the description of her character in the book is much more enjoyable than any of the movie versions can portray.
