review/summary: Awesome Tipsreview/text: First off, I want to say that I love how Dale Carnegie gives so much examples relating to each principle.I do noticed he uses some of the historic figures quite often such as Abraham Lincoln and Charles Schwab. He applies these principles to Family and Business purposes.One thing I don't like about this book (didn't effect my rating of 5 stars) is that the book cover has big title saying &#34;HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS & INFLUENCE PEOPLE&#34;. I read this during my commute to work and I had some people kinda laughed because they automatically assume something. I wish they had it in a book cover that is pretty plain.Overall, definitely a good read and will be reading it over and over to master all the principles.
