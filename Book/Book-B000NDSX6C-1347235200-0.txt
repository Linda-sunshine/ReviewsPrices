"The Hobbit" is a book I've always had in the back of my mind, never bothering to read it. Once I got to reading it, I just couldn't stop. It was full of adventure and action. Whenever you thought something was going to happen, the author put in something different than you would expect. The book starts out with a great beggining, making you asking for more of the story. Then you'll fall right in to it, wanting to gobble it all up. If you love action and adventure, this is the perfect read for you!
