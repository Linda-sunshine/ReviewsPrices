review/summary: How am I 23 and this is the first time reading Tolkien?review/text: I really enjoyed this book. I watched all of the Lord Of The Rings when I was 11-13 but never really thought of actually reading the series. I missed out for sure. For those who want to see The Hobbit in theaters, or perhaps are inspired to read it after seeing part 1, I highly recommend you do so. A few differences from the book and movie but overall it stayed pretty true to the book (thus far).
