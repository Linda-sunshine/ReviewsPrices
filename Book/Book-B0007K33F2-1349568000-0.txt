review/summary: Buy the Buss...review/text: Lots of people try the Count of Monte Cristo and give up... it is very long, very complicated and in the original English translation, very hard to read and enjoy. Robin Buss's (1996) translation for Penguin Classics is fantastic - delivering the complete and unabridged (1316 page) original story translated into smoothly flowing idiomatically correct English. Sure, you can pick up the 1850s version for free on Project Gutenburg, but if you're going to commit to a novel of this quality and length, why not spend the $5 and experience the best it has to offer?
