review/summary: A masterpiecereview/text: Not everyone's cup of tea, I know but Fitzgerald paints a picture of a world of selfishness and opulence - a world we hate to love and love to hate - before brining it all crashing down in a way that leaves you uncertain about you future, your past and the obsessions that bind the two. Absolutely worth the read.
