review/summary: The Classic Tale Doesn't Dissappoint!review/text: The Hobbit was one of those books I was always going to "get around" to reading. I took the upcoming movie release as an excuse to do just that and bought the Kindle version of this book.I'll not write a long review, as most of what I would say would be redundant.I will simply say that Tolkien was a wonderful storyteller and this is a marvelous tale. It takes it's righteous place amongst the best books I have read. I am glad I decided to read it before the movie came out and now with I would have done the same for the Lord of the Rings. I WILL be purchasing LotR very soon, however, and vary much look forward to reading that classic!I highly recommend this book.
