review/summary: Review for Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & through the Looking Glass Collectors Libraryreview/text: Cute book but very small. Not mini finger book but smaller than your average hard cover. It is really just the right size for my 4 year old to hold and handle but the words are smaller do to smaller size so I find it a little annoying on the eyes to read. My daughter loves the gold gilded edged pages. She loves the bookmark ribbon and the illustrations. It feels like a very special keepsake book to her. the pages are thinner so get this for a child who can be gentle with it and not rip the pages too easily. I think this would be perfect if it were larger. even just an inch taller and wider. My daughter loves it though and maybe down the road I will find another edition that is similar but larger. This was just perfect otherwise.
