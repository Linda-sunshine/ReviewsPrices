review/summary: Great book and interesting plot, but not LoTRreview/text: After reading this book several times in Finnish in my youth, I just now revisited it in English after seeing the Hobbit in the movies. The book is definitely good (and way better than the OK movie), but does not survive as many re-reads as Lord of the Rings (which I've read about 8 times) due to simpler plot and lighter mood.If you haven't yet read it three times or more, I can definitely recommend picking it up!
