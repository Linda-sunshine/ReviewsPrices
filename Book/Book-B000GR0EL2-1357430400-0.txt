review/summary: Forgiveness and Faithreview/text: This is a book I would recommend to all, including teenagers. We must not forget what happened in the past and must learn from it. If Corrie could overcome her past and forgive, we all must learn to love one another and our differences which includes our different faiths and nationalities.
