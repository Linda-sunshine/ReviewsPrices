review/summary: Much better when read as an adult...review/text: I remember being force fed this as a h.s. student, and it went soaring overhead, for the most part. I really enjoyed this much more when I needed to read it to tutor a student now. The story of adultery, trying to recapture the past, remaking your past to suit your desires, all of that - resonates much more when read in my middle to late middle years. Give it another try!
