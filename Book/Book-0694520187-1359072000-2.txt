review/summary: Great story line, so-so novelreview/text: I know, people are forever saying that Moby Dick is one of the greatest novels ever written, well it isn't. The story is fantastic but the book itself can be so boring that you end up skimming through chapters. Give me a break, how many chapters should be devoted to the differences between the types of whales? It is an old classic though and prior to Hemmingway many writers, not all, devoted a multitude of pages describing minutia but Melville goes beyond that. He is like Dickens. I'm really happy that I saw the movie which is devoted to the story line and not the book. If you are considering Moby Dick I suggest you put the book on your shelf to impress your friend and buy the movie for your enjoyment.
