review/summary: Jack Reacher novel coming to theatres near you!review/text: I started reading the Jack reacher novels a couple of years ago. My father-in-law lent me a copy of Gone Tomorrow, then 61 Hours and then I was hooked. Like some junkie needing a fix, I trawled second hand book fairs for my next hit. These novels are virulently addictive and should come with a health warning. My wife accuses me of having a bromance with Jack Reacher, naturally I deny it, but its true.I had heard that One Shot was being made into a movie, sadly starring Tom Cruise. However, I had never managed to find a copy. Fortunately Amazon.com obliged. One Shot is classic Jack Reacher, so all the other Jack Reacher junkies know what I mean, but for those who don't this is how it goes. Jack Reacher is an ex Military Police officer, but after leaving the army he slipped off the radar and he liked being a man of no fixed address. All he carries with him are the clothes on his back and toothbrush. No assets, mean no attachments. He's a bear of a man, standing six foot five and a couple of feet wide (at the shoulders). Normally he's passing through and gets caught up in local shenanigan's but this time, a man from Reacher's past ios arrested for allegedly shooting five people dead in a crowded square with a sniper rifle. When captured he refuses to talk except to say 'Get Jack Reacher for me'.From here Lee Child weaves an intricate plot filling in some more of Reacher's past. Its a good read and a good introduction to Jack reacher, which is perhaps why Hollywood is making a movie out of it instead of earlier Jack Reacher novels like Killing Floor.
