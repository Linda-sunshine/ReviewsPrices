review/summary: Enjoyable look into 19th century Englandreview/text: I read this book in high school and enjoyed is somewhat. Recently I read it again and was far more impressed. It gives a great description of the period (19th century) and Austen's character development is wonderful. There are many lines often quoted today and many miss out because they never read the book. Her humor is subtle but witty. It's doesn't have the action of many books today but it is relaxing reading.The Kindle version of the book is good. It is clear and easy to read with good navigation (for a Kindle).
