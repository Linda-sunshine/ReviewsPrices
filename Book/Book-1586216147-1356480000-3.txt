review/summary: Okay for the pricereview/text: This was a used book so I didn't expect perfection, but the packaging was extremely flimsy and beat up when I received it and the front and back covers had some bends and tears in it which I didn't expect based on the description when I got it. But, for the price I can't complain to much.
