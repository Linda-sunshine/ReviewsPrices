review/summary: For the sensitive, adventurous, and imaginativereview/text: This is a great book for people of all ages! It has the perfect balance of adventure, war, and sensitivity. I especially liked their trip through mirkwood with the vivid descriptions and encounters of creatures. I hope anyone who reads this book will enjoy it as much as I did! :)
