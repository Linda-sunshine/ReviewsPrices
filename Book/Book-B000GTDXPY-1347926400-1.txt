review/summary: ok read that holds your interestreview/text: This book was okay, the storyline was good, I was not really a fan of Jayne herself, it was one of those things as your reading along and she is just so dumb talking in the book that your thinking in your head OMG DUH just say it already, be clear. There was alot of that in this book. Still not really sure if she is just dumb or just plays dumb. How can you reason out a murder investigation but accidentally get in the wrong car and not notice? Thats why I don't care for the main character all that much, if she's smart enough to reason through a murder, she can damn well realize its not her car shes driving, among other REALLY dumb things in the book. There were some really funny parts, thats what held my interest, and the mystery plot. the four stars are for the comedy of it, it was funny.
