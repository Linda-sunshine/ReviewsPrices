review/summary: An enchanting readreview/text: i remember reading this for literature in school, I enjoyed it then and I enjoyed it again. The star crossed love story and Gatsby's unyielding belief that he would have Daisy is touching. I would encourage anyone who has a love of literature to read this book.
