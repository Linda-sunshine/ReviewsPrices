review/summary: Deserved classicreview/text: &#34;Dracula&#34; is a phenomenal story with terrific atmosphere. Although we're largely inured to the vampire mythos (if anything, we're possibly sick of it from overexposure), I can definitely see how Stoker's novel would have been pants-crappingly terrifying to readers of his day. The pacing is great, plot twists are dramatic and chaotic, and the battle of wits with Count Dracula is legendary. This book deserves all the applause it has garnered over time.
