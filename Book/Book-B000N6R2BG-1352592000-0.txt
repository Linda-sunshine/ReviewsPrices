review/summary: Great Read!review/text: I loved this book, couldn't stop reading it. It was a wonderful story about a mother's love and the length's she would go to protect her child in spite of what the world view her as. It also threw curveballs in there about religion, adultery, tragedy, and finding new love. Highly recommend this read!
