review/summary: Inspired book a nation listened to, then ignoredreview/text: I read this book for the first time just after I turned 60 years old. I could understand how publishing this book hardened the battle lines regarding slavery in this country. Stowe carefully outlined the circumstances of slave families torn apart, and how the practice hurt the owners as well as their "property." But once the war was over, and the slaves were freed, what happened? Stowe brought a wonderful proposal to the table, in the novel itself and in its epilog: educate the freed blacks, but not in their home South, where the white population had grown so lazy due to the institution of slavery, but in towns of the North, where churches Christian families could sponsor individuals so that they could be educated, learn to read and write, learn how to develop a civilized, free character, and then learn a trade. Yet Stowe was totally ignored, apparently, and the alternate, leaving the freed blacks to their own devices and protected by Northern soldiers, could not last forever. President Grant was the last president that kept Union soldiers in the South. When Rutherford Hayes became president, the Union soldiers were withdrawn and the blacks were "kept in their place" by new, repressive state legislation. What a different history we would have had if the country had put Stowe's advice into practice!
