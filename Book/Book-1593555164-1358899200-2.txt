review/summary: Empty and hollowreview/text: I read the book because I was intrigued by the film. Well, it is nothing but an empty and hollow, cardboard-made model of the film. Jack Reacher (this is my first book) is a boring character, relying on others many times; otherwise, he is relying on his supernatural awareness of his surroundings (creating ridicolous situations). The good actors in the film, and the wonderful cinematography made this story alive, which is otherwise hardly worth reading.
