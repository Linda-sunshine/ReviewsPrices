review/summary: Racial Controversyreview/text: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is arguably one of the most significant pieces in American Literature. Twain, in this masterpiece, highlights sensitive issues through the eyes of Huch Finn and Jim who is a run away slave. This controversy has caused many schools to ban this piece from its curriculum and has been reviewed by many as one of the most racist books of its time.Mark Twain cleverly takes us on a run-away adventure and in doing so helps us understand the exceptence of slavery in Missouri in the 1830's. Ironically, Twain depicts American Society through the scope of Hucks care giver Mrs. Watson. Mrs. Watson is religious God seeking lady who illustrates lack of sympathy for the colored race. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an important piece of literature which should be read with an open mind.
