review/summary: There's Morereview/text: If you really enjoyed, The Great Gatsby, read it again. Then check out &#34;Trimalchio: An Early Version of The Great Gatsby.&#34; There are a some tidbits in there that are not in the final book. Plus, you'll notice some of the edits that are interesting. But you sort of need &#34;an ear&#34; to catch them, which you'll get on a second or third read.
