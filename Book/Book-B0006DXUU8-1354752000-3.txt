review/summary: It deserves to be a classicreview/text: This book is excelent for those of you that are kids or that enjoy thinking as a kid. Its written in a way that makes you feel like a kid and of course tries to teach you the real meaning of christmas.I would recommend it even to non christian readers because in some chapters makes you wonder about why we speak the way we do and you can extrapolate his lesson to be that every action has its consequences in others.
