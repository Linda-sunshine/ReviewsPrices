review/summary: The Dickens Classic!review/text: Our family goes to the local stage production of &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; every year. This year I realized that I had not previously read the actual book. This was solid edition, worked very well, and the story... well, if you don't know about this one you should read it now!
