review/summary: O'Hara Not Gonereview/text: What can i say? The book is better than the movie, but even though one cannot on screen (seeing the movie in any other media except the large movie theater screen will never be the same. For instance, the burning of Atlanta, does not and will never have the feeling and movement, and the right reaction on any other medium. Anyone who has seen this cannot disagree, I hope!Otherwise, I believe all has already been said on this, and I would not think Miss Mitchell would appreciate a review as long as her work which is set apart from all other literature. It IS in a class by itself! Thank you very much, WilesWales
