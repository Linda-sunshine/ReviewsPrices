review/summary: calamity jane is a fun bookreview/text: her missteps are fun and entertaining next to the more competent male character. the character that surround her are fun too and play her up well. it was a fun and easy read. after reading this book, i went to see if it was a series and it is. it looks to be a little like evonovich and she has an off and on again thing going between two men. i dont want to play that game again, so i am going to pass on the series, but reading the discription of the other books, if i wanted to play the back and forth, this looks to be a good series.
