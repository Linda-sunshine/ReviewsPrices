review/summary: Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stonereview/text: I liked that it was about wizards and that there was a school that taught wizards how to be wizards. I like the book so much that I couldn't stop reading it because I had never read a book so good in my life. I liked the characters, they were pretty fun and you could get to know them easily. I especially liked Professor McGonagall and Snape because I like that Snape's sort evil, which makes him funny. I like Professor McGonagall because she's very good at teaching. I also like Fluffy because he's Cerberus, but he has a cuter name. I also like Harry, Ron and Hermione because one, Ron is really, really, really funny; 2, because Hermione is very smart, but not a goody-goody entirely. I like Harry because he can be funny sometimes, but sometimes he's really irritating.
