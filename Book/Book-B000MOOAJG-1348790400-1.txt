review/summary: Very relevant to 2012review/text: Ayn Rand's writing is a picture into what we are facing in 2012. I'm not sure if she was a visionary or if in relative terms things back in 1957 where much the same (and screwed up) as they are today. If you work hard and believe you earned your way (and your money) you need to read this book. The writing is complex and it can be a slow read but stay with it to the end. Your reward is in the journey.
