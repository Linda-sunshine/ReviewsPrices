review/summary: A good book, full of excitement!review/text: This is a great book, especially for older children. It left me, an adult in my thirties, entertained & captivated. I had to stop myself at times from glancing ahead to see what would happen next. I am an outdoor enthusiast & enjoy books about survival. Although some of the book's premise seemed highly unlikely, I was left curious to whether or not it was a true story by the end.
