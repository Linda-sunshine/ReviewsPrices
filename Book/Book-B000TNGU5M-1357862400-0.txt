review/summary: I Know This Story All Too Well!review/text: I know this story because my mother, Janka Festinger, was from Sighet and went to Auschwitz along with Wiesel and all the other Jews from Transylvania and she told us (my brother and I) about Auschwitz as we were growing up. We were horrified and confused...how does this happen? Well it did and we've lived with the knowledge of the Holocaust, as told by our mother, all those years growing up and as adults and then we find out, 5 years after our mother died (1994), that she had written, in 1945, a 60-page letter, 4 months after she was liberated. Yes, she told us her stories, but the letter blew us away with its unbelievable pain, raw emotion and immediacy. It was like someone talking to us from beyond the grave about the unspeakable horrors that happened just a few months before! I urge everyone to read Night, but I implore you to read, as a companion book to Night, Janka Festinger's Moments of Happiness (Amazon). As powerful as Night is, Janka's story is haunting in its raw power, an eyewitness account of those tragic times. If you read Night, you must read Janka Festinger's Moments of Happiness. This is the book I published that contains our mother's 60-page Holocaust letter!David D. Speace
