review/summary: Ultimate Hero Thrillersreview/text: To all on the fence, these books are all really good and near impossible to put down. As soon as you finish one, you find yourself craving more Jack Reacher. So naturally you start the next one. This character is fantastic and the epitome of a hero. Lee Child does a great job of illustrating everything going on and puts you smack dab in the middle of the story. One hundred pages go by in the blink of an eye. This particular Jack Reacher novel is a good choice as the movie will soon be released. I recommend this author to everybody. Try one, you won't be disappointed.
