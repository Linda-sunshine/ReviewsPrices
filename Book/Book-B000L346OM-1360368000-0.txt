review/summary: Wonderful Book!review/text: My boss gave me this book in the 1960'5 and I remember loving it then. When I saw it for the Kindle I couldn't resist buying it to see if it survived a 50 year span between readings. It did! It is as fresh and relevant as it was then. Despite the fact that half the book is about the Nazi deathcamps, it is a most uplifting book and an enjoyable read.
