review/summary: One of the best novels in a fabulous editionreview/text: Who doesn't know about the Lord of the Rings? This is one of the best novels of all times, telling a story about magic, love, courage, ethics and there is that makes as humans and some times super-humans (or should i say super-hobbits?)This is a great leather bound edition of all 3 books of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy that any Tolkien fan should have on their library. Don't think about it. Just buy it!
