review/summary: A Must Readreview/text: I can't believe I made it to the ripe old age of 38 without reading this book. This book has impacted me like no other that I can recall. My faith has been strengthened through the story of Corrie and Betsie ten Boom. I don't even think I can put into word the way I have been personally challenged by the lives of these extraordinary women. I couldn't put it down. It has shown me that a life of a complacency is not what we are called to. I think this book will speak to different people in different ways. If you're going through a hard time, I guarantee hope will spring anew after reading this. &#34;There is no pit that is so deep, that God's love is not deeper still.&#34;
