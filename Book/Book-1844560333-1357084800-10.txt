review/summary: Not a good Kindle version ~ The story however is EXCELLENT.review/text: *This is not a good Kindle version. It doesn't load well and is difficult to read as parts are cut off or wrap oddly.Even though it's free, it's not worth it. It's too frustrating trying to navigate and read.I'd spend a bit of money and get a better version, or better yet, buy the actual book, or even better, buy both. This has got to be one of the most romantic stories of all time.If you're not a Jane Austin fan, you will be within a few moments of entering into her world.For those of you unfamiliar with the story ~ (Do people like that even exist?) ~ Here is a brief summaryThe story takes place in Victorian England. We meet the Bennett family, the mother's sole intent is to marry her daughters off to successful men, ensuring they will be cared for properly since only males can inherit property. The story focuses on Elizabeth Bennett, the second daughter, who is attractive, but not as attractive as her older sister ~ She is also witty, smart, well-read and confident. Now we meet the wonderful Mr. Darcy. He is handsome and rich, but quite prideful and arrogant and rude. He is intrigued by Miss Elizabeth Bennett although he can't really figure out why. She mocks and teases him, and doesn't seem at all impressed with him, like every other female who has crossed his path.Throw in some other characters that help carry the story and you now have in your hands the most wonderful and romantic story ever written.Hmmm ~ perhaps I'm a bit biased. Get it, buy it, borrow it. However you get your hands on this book, read it and fall in love.
