review/summary: I know this is classic literacy and what not, but I wiill never read this book again.review/text: This book would only be good for a marine biologist or a latin translator because they are the only people who can translate it. The book might say something like, "The Nautilus was attacked by a group of spodulini auarius." You then are confused. A few chapters later, it might say how the Nautilus was attacked by some giant squid. Then everything clicks. The story was long and winding, and seemed like it would never end. I couldn't finish the book as it had begun them to seem torturous. Don't read it.
