review/summary: The Worst of the Series So Far, Worth Skippingreview/text: The great thing about Jack Reacher novels is that they aren't really cumulative. Yes, there are some details about his personal life that carry over from one to the next, but for the most part, each novel's plot and characters are separate and each book can be enjoyed on its own, without the preceding novels in the series. For that reason, you should seriously consider skipping this one and moving on to the next.It starts promisingly. Such mysterious murders! The perfect crime! Why are the victims willingly participating in a bizarre, sadistic procedure before death? What is the actual cause of death? And, of course, whodunit?But the murderer will be apparent early on to any seasoned reader of murder mysteries. As for the other two questions -- the death ritual and the cause of death -- both are based on fallacious psychology and medicine and are so absurd you may throw the book or even a brand new Kindle at the wall. Until now, I had thought that Lee Child was a meticulous researcher, so I'm wondering why he thought he could use a murder technique that is beyond implausible. Apart from the hilariously bad psychology, the most essential physical element in these murders is, literally, medically impossible. You don't need to be a scientist to know this. Anyone with common sense will Google it and realize that Child has tried to pull a fast one on them. Now I'm wondering if his seemingly expert descriptions of firearms and other technical subjects are also nonsense.Some may want to read the novel just to find out what the ridiculous ending is. If that's your purpose, and you go into it with low expectations, at least you won't be disappointed or infuriated by it. But if you want a solid, logical, satisfying ending, look elsewhere.
