review/summary: This book is helpful, but exaggeratedreview/text: The author ascribes the success of his students very heavily on the personality principles he teaches. These are invaluable skills to have, but they do not build character, courage or fortitude. Abraham Lincoln was not the hallmark of leadership solely because he could apply these principles.
