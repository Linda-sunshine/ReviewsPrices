review/summary: perfect read for the holiday seasonreview/text: I have watched the Christmas Carol on TV many times but never read the book. I finally sat down to read it and it was wonderful and the illustrations were perfect. It is worth reading especially during the holiday season. I thoroughly enjoyed it!!
