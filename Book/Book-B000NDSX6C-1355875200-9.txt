review/summary: Nice electronic versionreview/text: (Note: this review refers to the Kindle version of the &#34;movie tie-in&#34; edition) This is a well-crafted electronic version of the classic book. It even contains several of Tolkien's original black and white illustrations. It would be even better if you could zoom in further on those illustrations (limit is for them to fill the screen), but that's a minor quibble.
