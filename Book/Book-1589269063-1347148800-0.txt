review/summary: I "Love" this book!review/text: Get it? I "Love" it? Hahaha!Seriously, though, my husband and I went through this book together and learned a lot about ourselves and each other. Not only is it about how we all express love, but it's also about how we want to receive it. And that's an important part of the story, because if someone is trying to tell you they love you and it's not being "spoken" in your "love language," then you may miss the point entirely and feel unloved!I highly recommend this book for couples. It will hopefully start a lot of intimate, insightful conversations!
