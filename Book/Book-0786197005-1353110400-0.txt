review/summary: Classicreview/text: This is Classic Edgar Rice Burroughs! Very good book that keeps you captivated throughout. It is especially great because it doesn't follow the movie; it is the original classic work and is thus unspoiled by Hollywood. To get the true value of Burroughs' work, you have to start here. Even my son (who hates to read) was interested in the creatures and the story. Perfect! Classic! Wonderful! My suggestion is to read all of the Edgar Rice Burroughs' Martian tales!
