review/summary: A timeless tale of friendship and adventurereview/text: I'm on my second reading of this fantastic book. It's not the easiest read with the pirate jargon sometimes. It's just a wonderful tale that is more of a guy thing for sure. Not to say anyone would not appreciate it. I hope both my daughters will read it when they are old enough. It's one of my favorites.
