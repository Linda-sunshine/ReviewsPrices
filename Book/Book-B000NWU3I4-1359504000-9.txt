review/summary: If you're a real fan, this is a must havereview/text: It's great to finally have an unabridged version of this book. The narrator does all the voices, and even sings the songs. Some characters sound a little more pompous that I would have liked, but there you go. I have loaded the Nicol Williamson version of this onto iTunes, but it is heavily abridged, only 4 hours long. This one is 11 plus hours. If you (like me) are going to load these onto iTunes, get ready for many hours of work. The book is 16 disks long. And it seems that the data for each disk was written by a different person, so you will have to make many alterations. But it's all worth it in the end.
