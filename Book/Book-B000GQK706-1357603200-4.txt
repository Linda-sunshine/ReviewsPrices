review/summary: Beautifully bound and exquisitely craftedreview/text: How do you celebrate the 50th anniversary of the book that started the love affair? The book most likely single &#34;handedly&#34; giving us Dungeons and Dragons?You give it a release fit for a returned king!According to the preface, many, many instances of misspellings (according to what Tolkien had intended, not necessarily actual misspellings), grammatical changes (again, Tolkien didn't always use things in a grammatically correct fashion, which is what his original intent was) and general restoration work took place to make this THE definitive edition of the book.And they did an amazing job of it. This will be the version of the book by which all future editions will, and should be, judged.If you're looking for a reader edition, one that you can carry around and not worry about damaging, then this isn't for you. You can get much less expensive editions. If you are looking for an edition with the most &#34;correct&#34; text, is presented as a piece of art and looks amazing on your shelf, this one is for you.The page edges are golden lined. All of the runes, and various languages, are beautifully represented in text. You also receive two high quality, frame worthy, maps. And to make it easier to remember where you are, a ribbon book mark embedded in the spine. You also receive a hard slip cover with Tolkien original artwork to store this on your shelf.If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings, or any of Tolkien's work, this edition is positively the most beautiful presentation to date, and worthy of purchase.Highly recommended.
