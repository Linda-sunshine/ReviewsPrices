review/summary: Don't get the hypereview/text: Being a pretty avid reader, I thought my classic repertoire should include Wuthering Heights. I had to basically force myself to read to the end. I have no problem with despicable, morally corrupt characters. The Fountainhead is one of my favorite novels. The problem is that the treatment of them by Bronte just lacks depth. I found the book to be tediously slow, dry, and repetitive. Maybe I just didn't get it, but I really hated this book.
