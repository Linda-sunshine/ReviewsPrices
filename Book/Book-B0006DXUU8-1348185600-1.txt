review/summary: An Excellent Classic!review/text: Everyone knows the story of this book as it's been portrayed through various different movies, but nothing can compare to this fine, literary work. Every part of this short tale draws you in, and although the wording is certainly from a different era, it is easily understood. My only problem was that I kept envisioning Bill Murray as Scrooge, lol.
