review/summary: Great book.review/text: I was leery of the lack of scripture in the book... as it feels more like a secular self-help book, but it did open up some conversations with my wife and I. Observations were made, actions were tried and sometimes forgotten. Try... try again, I say.I was able to share this book with a friend who isn't Christian, and she really enjoyed it...
