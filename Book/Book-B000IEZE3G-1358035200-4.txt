review/summary: How Much I Want To Be A Wizard Like Harry Potterreview/text: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (a.k.a. Philosopher's Stone) is a great book. I've had countless times when I would try to compare myself with Harry. It never worked out. The book full of mystery, magic, and thrills. My brother and I keep maing up our own spells. One of them is &#34;Accio Fire!&#34; wich makes fireballs come out of your wand. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is truly a great book and I had a fantastic time reading it.
