review/summary: This One's A Winnerreview/text: Jack Reacher is in big trouble, but as usual he knows how to respond to it. His adventure takes you to FBI headquarters, and the ride gets rocky. I was just a bit disappointed that he claimed true love with Jodie, but is drawn to another woman, but I suppose it keeps it real. That's why I didn't give it five stars. (Personal Choice)The story is fast paced and I think it is one of the best in the series thus far.
