review/summary: Nice productreview/text: Good version of this classic, my niece has been called &#34;Ayn Rand&#34; by some in her sr. lit class, but had never read her. So now she can . . . because this one belongs in any thinker's library, not matter what your personal beliefs are. Classic paperback size, with pretty tiny print. . . for all those kids who made it through all the Harry Potters.
