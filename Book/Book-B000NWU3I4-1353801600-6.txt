review/summary: There and Back again, Hollywood Peoplereview/text: No, this book isn't "better" or "worse" than any of the volumes in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It's just different. Less serious, for sure. And for me, that meant a much more enjoyable experience. This is a book that reads like an extended fairytale, with all the associated delights, while the LOTR books read like a chronicle of war. Both good, but you have to pick your poison. Humor plays a huge part in this story, where it plays only an ocassional part in the later Tolkien volumes ... As for the story, it's engaging from the beginning, and because it's earlier Tolkien, it is not burdened by any undue pressure of having to produce something better soon: in fact, a lot of it was just notes Tolkien read out loud to his kid before bed. When he went to compile it, he had to think back to how the tale went. Bedtime stories, in other words, which I think adds to its charm.The chapters are mostly fun, and wholly unpredictable; I loved finding out what happened next, and rarely saw it coming.Some negative points involve the "songs"; just as in the LOTR volumes, personally, I could have done without. Tolkien is no poet.Some unforgettable scenes here, and most will linger in your memory, like the image of the group of adventurers lingering for weeks (months? years?) near the dragon's lair, unable to figure a way inside. Or the "Invisible Bilbo" chapter. Haunting stuff.Then there are the precursors: the introduction of Gollum, the Ring of Invisibility (which was not the One Ring at first), and Gandalf, among other things.All in all, not only one of the best books-for-children I've read, but one of the best books period.And the title of the new movie should be "The Hobbit, or, There and Back Again," stupid Hollywood people. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?
