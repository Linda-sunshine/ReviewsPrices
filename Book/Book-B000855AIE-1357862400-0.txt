review/summary: great concepts but more of an attempt of an author to make moneyreview/text: it says on the back of the book that james allen never really accomplished anything special. not that the man cannot be a guru on happiness and such but it makes me doubt the legitimacy. he speaks with vague generalities and doesnt really cover anything extensively. there are multiple blank pages, misspelled words, and the font is big and separated like a 2nd grade novel. (59 pages long/ finished reading in about an hour) the purpuse of the book is to make you feel good basically, kind of like watching &#34;the secret&#34;. if you plan on making an impact on your life this book alone wont be enough
