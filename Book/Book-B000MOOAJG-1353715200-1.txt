review/summary: timelyreview/text: Old novel with renewed popularity due to changing political, social issues. Ayn Rand's book is strikingly appropriate in todays' Progressive political scene. The views to point to a frightening completion of big governments' "over-regulation" of business and the loss of individual freedoms as depicted in George Orwells "1984". Although sometimes tedious and wordy, well worth reading and should be recommended for all high school literature courses and included in civic discussions.
