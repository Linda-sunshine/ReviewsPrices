review/summary: Tedious and pure torture!review/text: THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE FULL UNABRIDGED EDITION:If I could get by with giving this zero stars, I would. OMG, this is tedious and torture to read. I don't care how many times people say this is a "classic" and a "must read", that doesn't make it so. The book was based on two real accounts, both of which are much more interesting and easier to read than Melville's overly verbose tome. I slogged through this and forced myself to finish it and even the last three chapters, which is the only part of the 135 chapters (yes, I said 135) that even concerns itself with actual encounter with Moby Dick, are not that great. I actually could not stay awake through most of it and it took me a lot longer to read it because of that. If you want the true story, read the account of Mocha Dick and/or the Shipwreck of the Essex. Those are what Melville based his book on. I have read plenty of classics, including Robinson Crusoe, most of Dickens, Dracula, etc. These are all written either earlier or about the same time as Moby Dick, but they were interesting and readable. Not so with this book.
