review/summary: Superb Writingreview/text: Atlas Shrugged is one of the most structurally aligned books I have read in the past 20 years. The book is long, but it is apparent that Ayn deliberately selected her words. You do not have to agree with her philosophy, but her writing is profoundly sound. The quality of this piece is what makes it popular among book lovers. Wow!
