review/summary: Not just for menreview/text: I really enjoyed this novel. Burroughs really does a nice job with his story. I wasn't totally convinced that I would enjoy a science fiction novel from so many years ago, but he pulledit off and even had a bit of romance in it. I'm on to read the next book.
