review/summary: Dracu-blahreview/text: There is a stretch of the PCH just South of Point Mugu and a bit North of Malibu, that has been in so many car commercials that you can't help but have a sense of deja vu when you drive it even if you've never been there. That is how this book went for me. I felt like I was reading a very, very, very long winded treatment for every movie from "Nosferatu" to "Love Bites". Unless you are a glutton for this type of work or a die hard vampire-phile, give it a pass.
