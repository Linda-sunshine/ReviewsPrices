review/summary: Great book!review/text: I'm 11 and I read this book because it was free. Funny reason, yes, but it's true. I have never read this book before now, having only watched the cartoon movie. It's an interesting story, since it is supposed to be dream like, and so fun to read, out loud or silently. I think this is a great book for young people and young-at-heart people. If you've never read it, it's a must-read!
