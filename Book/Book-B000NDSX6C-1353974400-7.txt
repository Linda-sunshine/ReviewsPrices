review/summary: Love it!review/text: Read the Tolkien books 30 years ago and 3 times since! I have also lost and replaced them several times. I was thrilled when they became available for Kindle. If you love the LOTR movies and have been waiting as I have for the Hobbit film, you should definitely read the books! They are just as incredible! Store them in the cloud because you too will want to read them again and again! Enjoy! :)
