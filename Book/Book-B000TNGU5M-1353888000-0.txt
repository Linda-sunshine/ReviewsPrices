review/summary: agareview/text: I wanted to know more about atrocities on Jews, so I picked up this book. The story is narrated by a young Jew boy, who along with his family is taken to German concentration camps. The story gives insight of the concentration camps in which Jews were kept. Jews were not even given adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical attention. Several Jews died because they did not have adequate clothing to protect themselves from severe cold. Physically weak such as babies, old and sick were burned alive, because they could not contribute in the camps harsh physical work. It is unbelievable that all this inhumanity occurred in the twentieth century. I was touched by the writer's message at the end of the book:"We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented".Overall "Night" is a quick read. I recommend this book and give it four stars.Happy reading !!!
