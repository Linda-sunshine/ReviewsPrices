review/summary: Classic Adventurereview/text: The Hobbit is a great adventure story, full of action, and interesting characters. Tolkien is master storyteller who drawls you into the story. While people of any age will be engaged by Bilbo's and his companions, it is a great book for younger teens who are look for a more substantial book.It was not mean to be as dark and suspenseful; as Lord of the Rings, so enjoy it for what it is a great adventure.
