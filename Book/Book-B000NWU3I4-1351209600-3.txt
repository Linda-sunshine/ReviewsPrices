review/summary: Classicreview/text: I've read this book atleast 25 times in my life, along with LOTR and all other J.R.R. Tolkien books. It is a must read. Bilbo's transformation is a journey worth taking and of course there's a dragon. I own a copy of the Hardcover collector's edition but afraid to mess it up our let my son read so got the Kindle edition and only gripe is Amazon makes an enhanced edition that doesn't work? Thought it would on my new Fire HD yet, no.....kind of stupid. Yet, I've gone without audio forever so no biggie... but would be nice to hear Tolkien recite songs and passages.
