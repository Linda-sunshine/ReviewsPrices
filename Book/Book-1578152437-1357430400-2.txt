review/summary: Oliver Twistreview/text: Classic! It was a pleasure re-reading this book!I am again a Dickens fan. The history he describesas he tells this tale is amazing! I was too young atthe first reading to understand this. With this readingI am more aware of the historic descriptions Dickenspasses on to the reader.This will be relevant in the future.
