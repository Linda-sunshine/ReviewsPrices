review/summary: Great Escapereview/text: I wish I had not passed this up on my high school summer reading list so long ago. Better late than never though. I love the way Tolkien tells this story. It's so matter of fact and gripping at the same time. Such a great tone for a good tale and great escape. You really feel as though you are on the journey with the characters. I gave it four stars because I am not quite finished with it but so far I am really enjoying it. Endings are big with me so I can't really say for sure how I'll feel about The Hobbit until the end.
