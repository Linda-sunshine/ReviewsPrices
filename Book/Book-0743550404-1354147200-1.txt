review/summary: Interesting, Somewhat. Meh.review/text: I, as other reviewers, read this because of its much-touted connection to the SyFy show, "Haven"; I am not sorry I read it, but it is definitely NOT gripping, hard-crime fiction. I am not a big horror fan so have not read much Stephen King; I have little basis for comparison to his other works. Without the connection to the television show, I would not have read this at all. I read the "Afterward" FIRST, which prevented my total disgust by the end of the actual story! Without the prior knowledge, I would have probably burned the book. More questions about the titular character were raised than answered. I was able to enjoy the interplay between the characters, because that's all the book was. I am not polarized about the story, just "meh".
