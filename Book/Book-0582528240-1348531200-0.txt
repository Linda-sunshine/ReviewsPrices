review/summary: Good but not Greatreview/text: First off, anybody else find it amusing that we had to pick a pen name to write a review on a Mark Twain novel. I just felt that was a little ironic. As far as the story goes, Twain did a good job of crafting a well written, well researched novel, but it was missing key elements that kept it from being great. The first part of the book up to the steamboat randomly crashing into the raft was pretty good. The characters were beginning to develop nicely and we started to understand why this book was being written, as in an allegorical sense. Of course, why didn't Jim skip and a jump to Illinois from Jackson island to get his freedom, for one Twain couldn't write about the river he was attached to. After the raft everything seems rushed and doesn't fit together very well. It begins to look more like a bad night for Homer as he is reciting the Odyssey instead of an American classic. The ending with Jim in captivity and Tom acting out things is probably one of the worst endings this book could have had. Overall it was a good book, but I don't feel like it captivated me like a real classic should.
