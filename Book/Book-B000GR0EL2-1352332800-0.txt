review/summary: Not about the hiding place that muchreview/text: you feel like a jerk for not giving such a heavy concentration camp book 5 stars, but let's strip away all the obligation and tell what this book is. I had never heard of it. It's called the hiding place and its supposed to be about a dutch family sheltering jews during the war. I am not disappointed that I read this book at all. So, I would not want to turn anyone away from reading it. However, I felt it was very unfocused in its approach. It wanted to be three different books. Really, the 'hiding place' has such a small appearance in this book that I was surprised they gave it this title. This book lacks direction. It is a glowing family book in the beginning, then the meat of it is the sheltering of jews and working with the dutch underground. The concentration camp part is intriguing, but it goes overboard preachy on the religious front. For anyone who has read it, the part with the eye dropper was a bit overboard. Nothing is wrong with any of those storylines, but crammed altogether in one book doesn't work. There is way too much author intrusion and preaching. That being said, I am not disappointed I read it. There are a lot of great nuggets to this book, and it IS an astonishing story. It is not a 5 star story though and I really don't feel guilty saying that. Go read "Night," by Elie Weisel; he did it better in half as many pages. Or, to go the other route, read "Every Man Dies Alone," By Hans Fallada; he did it twice as well in twice as many pages as Hiding Place.
