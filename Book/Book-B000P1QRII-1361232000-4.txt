review/summary: Interestingreview/text: "The life where nothing was ever unexpected. Or inconvenient. Or unusual. The life without color, pain, or past."The author gives a view into a differnt world and how a young boy feels once he knows the truth.There are some interesting ideas presented in this book. I found many to be thought provoking and I had to imagine what it would be like if my world were to be so,radically different.The young boy is very likeable. His bravery is inspirational. But I wasn't interested enough to continue the series.
