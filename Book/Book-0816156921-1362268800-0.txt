review/summary: A classic, what can you say.review/text: I read the books a few years ago and wanted to have a digital copy. As the subject stated, it is the classic. Just as Tolkien can be thought of as the base of all fantasy novels and role-playing games, this book is the basis of all stories involving vampires. Dracula is a complex, non-soap opera, but evil, as a vampire should be. The resent flood of teenage friendly blood suckers is just sad. This is the way that they should be presented. A must read for any one who likes horror or fantasy.
