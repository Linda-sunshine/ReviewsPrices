review/summary: His best yet!review/text: This book is not exactly the movie, though you will see elements in it. I saw the movie first and Reacher was played like he was Reacher, good job by Cruse. I bought the book after seeing the movie and once you realize the book does not follow the movie exactly you are good to read. I enjoyed both very much, buy the book just to read Lee Child and you will be a happy Jack Reacher fan.
