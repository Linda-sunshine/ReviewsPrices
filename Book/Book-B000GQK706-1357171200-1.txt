review/summary: Lord of the Ringsreview/text: Classic Tolkien with abundant adventure, villains, heroes, heroines, and good versus evil. Excellent classic literature in the fantasy genre at its proven best as compared to some of the fantasy options written in recent years. This is solid writing. Children age twelve and above should put down their electronics for a stint and enjoy this epic adventure.
