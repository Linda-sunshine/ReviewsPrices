review/summary: A great book about the American experiencereview/text: Deep in the heart of Alabama in 1935, a white man's word stood against a black man's word. It's not hard to see that this unwritten rule, a byproduct of segregation, opens the door for any ignorant psychopath to take advantage of those who cannot defend themselves. Indeed, a whole underclass of white trash made use of this situation in one way of another. It is a bit ironic that in 1935 the Supreme Court building opened with the inscription in stone of "Equal Justice under Law". At least, a strong current of idealism was being kept alive, and was not totally lost in the law so that it could not be reclaimed. A few people in a place like Monroeville, Alabama, had the courage to resist convention. But the status quo was so fiercely upheld, and emotions of a drunken mob so hard to control.As other reviewers have pointed out, the strength of this book comes from the point of view of a child, the narrator, who doesn't have an established adult position to defend, and has a father who instills in her a sense of equal justice. She and her brother try and come to terms with their world. In the course of their education -thanks to what they learn more at home than at school - they meet many quirky characters in the town, and learn about some of their secrets and their unexpected courage and good will.It is clear that this novel closely parallels Harper Lee's actual childhood in a number of ways. For one thing, she was a close friend of Truman Capote, who is the model of Dill Harris. Together they attended legal proceedings at the county courthouse where her father as a lawyer apparently had a very similar role as Atticus Finch in the book. Truman Capote also verified that some of the events actually happened.
