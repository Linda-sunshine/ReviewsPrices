review/summary: Perfect for required readingreview/text: When my son came home from school with exhaustive reading assignments from this book, I knew I had better follow it along with him in order to be ready with an answer when he asked. I had read it in the past, but the questions that the teacher asked required detailed reading. As usual, the quality of the ebook was excellent, but as was expected, his reading was based on page numbers that don't exist in the Kindle format. However, the fact that it was portable and I could read ahead when waiting in line or had a few down minutes made it worth the purchase.
