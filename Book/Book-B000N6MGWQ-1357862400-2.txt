review/summary: Good bookreview/text: I read this book based on the recommendation of my mom, and I thanked her for it once I'd read it. It was very touching and a quick but pleasant read. I would highly recommend it to anyone but particularly to someone who might be experiencing tough times in life, as I think this book could help to make someone feel better in that instance.
