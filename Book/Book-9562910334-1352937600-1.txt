review/summary: A book that challenges thoughts of utopiasreview/text: This book is absolutely phenomenal, George Orwell was very sick when he was writing this novel in the 1940s. The Soviet Union was flooding fear into the world, this book gave a conception to the possibility of communism taking over. And it did this in the most conventional way possible, the book gives the perspective of a normal man in a world that he fears completely. Constantly retaliating in his mind but to scared to actually revolt. I highly recommend this book to everyone, its one of my favorites and definitely worth your time.
