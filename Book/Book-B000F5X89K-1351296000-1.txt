review/summary: A true classic!review/text: Frankenstein is a fantastic work of classic literature. I think few people realize just how different the novel is from the archetype version of the story most people are familiar with. You know, the cheesy green monster with the bolts in the neck, flat head and elevator shoes with the moral not to play God. Oh, yes, and the creature in that idea usually only grunts or says things like "Fiiire Bad!"That is NOT what Frankenstein, the novel, is. In the novel the creature has yellow eyes, tightly drawn skin, long black hair, is very agile, and is highly intelligent. The creature is hyper intelligent. Within minutes of his creation he figured out how to dress himself and only months after that he could speak, read and write, more articulately than his own creator. He was even quoting Milton. Many people remember the moral not to play God but few remember that there is a secondary moral. The creature had to forgive his creator for how he treated him, for abandoning him, and for not preparing him for the cruelties of the world. He had to learn that revenge would bring him no peace but only perpetuate a cycle of anger and revenge.There is also the message of responsibility to one's child and the importance of keeping one's promises (which Victor breaks several times in the course of the story and only causes more trouble for everyone invovled).The creature is tragic. This is a brilliant work of literature by a impressively creative woman. What she created was a story that will last through the ages, a combination of science, alchemy and parent / child metaphors that reaches us on a very basic level. Read the classic novel if you have not yet done so already.
