review/summary: loved it!review/text: As usual, this writer pulls you in gradually with all the players and then begins our real story of dramatic heartbreak, deceit, lies, family issues, husbands, lovers, mothers, and God, and innocence. We have a small little girl who becomes an innocent bystander in her parents tumultuous relationship. Your heart breaks watching the story unfold in layers as everyone is pitted against one another as to whom to believe about Faith's miracles. A wonderful story that gave me a smile when done. If a writer can do that, they have accomplished their goal.
