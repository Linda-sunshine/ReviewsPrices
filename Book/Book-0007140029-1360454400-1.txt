review/summary: Wonderful Warriorsreview/text: This is a story about a domestic cat, Rusty, who wants nothing more than to eat a live mouse. Having plucked up the courage to venture beyond his (human) home and into the forest, he encounters a young feral apprentice warrior. The two fight and then become friends. The Thunderclan, the `family' of the young apprentice, desperate to replenish their numbers with new stock, recruit Rusty into the clan and rename him Firepaw. In all, four Clans of the forest battle against each other for survival, each protecting its own territory and competing for food, and the Thunderclan need all the help they can get.The story is told from the cat's point of view. It is a tale of talking and warring cats with their own structured society based loosely on that of our own. A sweet added touch from the author is the naming of the cats. The ordinary warriors all have `paw' in their names, and the leaders all have `star' in their names, allowing for easy identification, which I thought was rather clever.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is well-written with some very descriptive scenes, though some may be a bit upsetting for children. However, it has plenty of action and adventure and an assortment of good and bad, and some clever twists here and there. In fact, there is always something to route for.
