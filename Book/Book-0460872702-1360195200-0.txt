review/summary: Still A Favoritereview/text: I've re-read the Great Gatsby...was just as in awe of it the second time around. However, it was easier to perceive the not happy ending, although I was once again hoping for it. Loved it...again! Timeless, still a must read; if you've missed it, it's not too late.
