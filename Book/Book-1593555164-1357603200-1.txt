review/summary: A book to read before seeing the moviereview/text: This is the second Jack Reacher novel for me. They are fun mysteries, solved by this contemporary Amercian Lone Ranger, sans Tonto and the silver bullets. What's not to like about that? Penetrating one-liners. Total mastery of impossible situations. And no soap to inhibit or motivate the hero. I wanted to read this before seeing the current Jack Reacher movie. Now I may wait for the movie to come out on DVD.
