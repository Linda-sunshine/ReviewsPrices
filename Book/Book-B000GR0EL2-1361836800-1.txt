review/summary: Deeply humblingreview/text: This book has changed my life's perspective. It has jarred open a faith and trust in The Lord I never had before. I felt as if I lived through this ordeal with her. At times I laughed and at times I sobbed. I am truly blessed to have the privilege of reading the Ten Boom life story.
