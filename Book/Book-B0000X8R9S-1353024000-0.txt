review/summary: My son loved it!review/text: My son and I have been reading together since he was a baby. We've been through all the Harry Potter books, all the LOTR books, and all of my favorite "classics" from childhood. Neither of us had heard of this book before but it was on the top of the "The Art of Manliness" website for 12 year old boys. It didn't disappoint. It was short and an easy read...easier than we were used to. But a great story that really captured my son's imagination. We had great discussions each night about what we would do if we were stranded. Good stuff! Highly recommended!
