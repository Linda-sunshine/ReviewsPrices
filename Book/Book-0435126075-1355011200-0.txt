review/summary: A classic... what can I say?review/text: Pride... and prejudice... just like it says... Allows us to spy on a world and in a time we'll never know, where pride rules at the expense of others, and prejudice is at its best... If you see yourself in the pages, it's a good thing to step back and think about how to change... or read just for the enjoyment.
