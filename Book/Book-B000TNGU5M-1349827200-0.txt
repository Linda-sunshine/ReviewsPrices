review/summary: Night by E.W.review/text: I loved this book. It was such a personal account of what happened to many during the holocaust, and was so graphic I felt like I was there with Elie the whole time. I'm already interested a lot with the holocaust (although not a pleasant event), and this just pulled me in even further!
