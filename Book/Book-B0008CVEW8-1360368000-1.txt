review/summary: Treasure Islandreview/text: This is a classic, no doubt, but it doesn't stand the test of time so well as others. The language is not always easy to understand and some of the sailing references are lost on me, though I get the gist of it. A good enough story for anyone willing to give it a try, but you might be better off watching the movies if you're not much into history or don't have an understanding of the era in which it was written.
