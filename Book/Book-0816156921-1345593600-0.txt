review/summary: Just Finishedreview/text: Dracula has become a classic since its publication in 1897. Being drawn to the classics, I'm rather surprised this one slipped through without my perusing it until now. While I did like this book and can learn from it, there were things I found that irritated me. Like Lucy. There was just something about her that I couldn't stand. Whether it was that she was without flaws, or that she was *always* in distress, I'm not exactly sure, but I do know I couldn't wait for them to pierce her heart with that stake and cut off her head. She just bugged me. The other thing that bothered me, was the lapse in the Professor's speech. On more than one occasion, he spoke like he was a foreigner, while at others, his dialogue was no different than the others. While this didn't exactly pull me out of the story, it was noticeable. Other than those things, I pretty much liked the book. It was enjoyable and did hold my attention, and I did like the majority of the characters. I think one of my favorite characters was Renfield, as he was so well drawn out and put together that I couldn't wait to read more about him.
