review/summary: No longer Science Fiction nor Fiction for that matterreview/text: This is a powerful book that I first read in high-school and like with most everything in school you don't fully appreciate until you are much much older. With that in mind I recently re-read this classic and was shocked and appalled how much of George Orwells dark and dreary vision has become a reality in our lives since my high school days.Winston the protagonist in this book is a low level party grunt working at the Ministry of Truth in a fictional London dedicated to scrub history books and records of inconvenient facts, such as who we are at war with and why to streamline history into lockstep with the ever changing party line. Orwell foresees technology that for his day was in its infancy and describes how this technology can be used to oppress people and that whoever controls the past will control the future (and present).Orwell Imagines a world in which every home has a two way 'television', that is used inbound to disseminate propaganda while at the same time allowing the thought police to check up on its citizens. Virtually every inch of his imaginary world is covered in listening and spying devices and even small deviations from the norm carry the death penalty. Winston's crime is to keep a journal to record his own version of history, this will ultimately bring down the thought police on him, who (SPOILER) captures, tortures and kills him, but not before breaking his spirit and making him love big brother and his henchman.The most striking thing about this book is that we can see almost all of Orwells more imaginative concepts come to life in our modern day society, not necessarily exactly the way the author envisioned them, but in a more subtle but no less disturbing way. One can't help to draw parallels between Orwells concept of thought crime and the political correctness movement that is doing its best - and succeeding in - making certain words unspeakable and by extension certain thoughts unthinkable. It's chilling to read a news article on how interest groups trying to change Mark Twains classic to strike a specific word from the book for school versions where it is appropriate in both the text as the context of the time it was written. The ministry of truth resides not as a specific location it rather resides with special interest groups fighting to revise history.The Internet - obviously unimaginable at the time - serves as a close and even more powerful parallel to the ever present surveillance in Orwells world, but instead of a government forcing us to be available (and surveillable) we willingly surrender our deepest emotions, private thoughts and actions to social media sites like Facebook and twitter where they are for sale to the highest bidder including our government.9/11 as global watershed moment has served as justification for more and more snooping and warrant less searches while our airports serve as testing ground on how much more privacy intrusion we are willing to take at one point. In the name of 'homeland security' we are living in fear of the boogie man, not Goldstein, but Osama Bin Laden and his band of Islamic terrorist serving as the external threat on which more and more intrusions on our personal freedoms are being justified with.If you ever wonder how a prequel to 1984 would look or how Orwells world got to where it is, turn on your TV and browse the Internet and you will find that you are living it. It is not 5 minutes till noon, it may be 5 mi uses past noon and we haven't realized it yet...
