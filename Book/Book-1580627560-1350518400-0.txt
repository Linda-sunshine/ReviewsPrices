review/summary: A true and funny perspectivereview/text: The content of this book is no laughing matter. Nevertheless, I laughed my way through it! The content was delivered with a very fresh and humorous perspective.I can say that what it says is absolutely true. This is not about playing a game or leading the man on. For me, the book is about a woman loving herself and placing high value on herself, so much so that she will not allow any man, or woman, to make her feel insignificant. After all, people can love you only as much as you love yourself (except for our parents :))
