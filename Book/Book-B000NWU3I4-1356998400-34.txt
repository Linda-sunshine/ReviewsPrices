review/summary: The Hobbit Rereadreview/text: I read the book in my youth and have just finnsihed reading it on my kindle.It is beautifully written conjuring up a world of magic because of the wonderful imagary the writing creates. It was worth the reread.I then made the mistake of going off to see the film, and it was most diappointing in comparison because of the inability to explore the feelings and reaction and interreactions of the characters..Yes!!! A good read.
