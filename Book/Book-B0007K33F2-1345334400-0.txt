review/summary: A timeless classicreview/text: This is one of my favorite books of all times. Definitely read the unabridged version if you have the time (I couldn't imagine what they would have taken out!). A classic filled with adventure, justice, and romance. The author's clarity really places you back in time with a front row seat. Many of the books lessons show that, despite technological advances, humanity's vices and virtues are timeless. Also it's very hard to beat the e-book prices!
