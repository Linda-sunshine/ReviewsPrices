review/summary: World Of Fishreview/text: I would call "20,000 Leagues Under The Sea" by Jules Verne is a classic, albeit a minor one. The story is generally gripping and the character of Captain Nemo is an interesting and nuanced one - neither truly villainous nor heroic - but Verne gets bogged down in some of the details. Yes, I know the main character and narrator is an ichthyologist, but do I really need all of the "World of Fish" moments where he describes - in excruciating detail - ALL of the fish and other marine life that the crew of the Nautilus encounter whilst journeying around the underwater world on their anti-colonial crusade? I signed up for an adventure novel, not a Jacques Cousteau special. Oh well, when it works it works well and Verne will have you interested to the very end. The translation from the French in this edition reads well and the paperback quality is good enough. Recommended, but prepare to skip large portions of "World of Fish."
