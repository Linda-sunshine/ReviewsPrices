review/summary: Mobt Dick - Still the Bestreview/text: I have been re-reading some of the classics recently, and decided to read Mellville's masterpiece again. I last read it when I was seventeen, and it's even more wonderful than I remembered. This is action-adventure at its best. I think every fiction reader and writer should take a trip with Captain Ahab and his crew. I hope at least some of us writer wanna-be's can reach his level.
