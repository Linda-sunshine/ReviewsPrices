review/summary: One Shot Moviereview/text: I am a big fan of Jack Reacher series and have read all the books, but Lee Child has sold us all out, to make a favorite character into a caricature. Even if you have dyslexia you cannot possibly see (5' 6") Tom Cruise as a big bruising 6' 5", 250 pound heavily muscled Jack Reacher. Nobody in right mind is going to associate puny cruise as a former military police captain.
