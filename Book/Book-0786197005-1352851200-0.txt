review/summary: Pulp Classicreview/text: This is a classic example of the pulp literature genre. The author knows his audience and gives them what they want. It is sci-fi fantasy with a superhuman hero, gorgeous heroine, and cliff hanger action. This book doesn't try to be great literature, but it is a great example of this type of literature. It is basically a modern graphic novel without the graphic part.
