review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: This is a classic tale of an unexpected hero. This is the basis for the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings by the same author. I highly recommend you read these exceptional books with well thought out characters and story plot. Even though this is a classic- type book it is not difficult to read in the least. I read this book aloud to my children who found it wonderful and amazing and completely different than the movie.It is a spring board into The Lord of the Rings for sure! After reading The Hobbit I instantly bought the trilogy. I must say if you have seen all the movies- they are not accurate and the book(s) are far better in every way.
