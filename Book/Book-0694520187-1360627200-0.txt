review/summary: Re-read this book!review/text: This is a great book, which can only be appreciated well after you are out of high school. The descriptions are wonderful and the humor sly, constant, and understated. I kept wishing there was a really good movie out to capture these folks as contemporaries. The obsessions and characters are complex and deeply-drawn, and the story itself timeless.
