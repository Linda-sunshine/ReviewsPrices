review/summary: A literary masterpiecereview/text: This book is a children's fairy tale, but it is not just for children. There are so many different ways you can read this book. Take note of how Bilbo's character changes over the course of the book. Enjoy some witty pieces of dialogue.You can read the book in an isolated, pre-LOTR way, taking into account only what is found in this book. Or you can read it with the Lord of the RIngs in mind. If you've read more of Tolkien's material (the appendices to LOTR, the SIlmarillion, and The Quest of Erebor in Unfinished Tales) you can find even more to enjoy in this book.
