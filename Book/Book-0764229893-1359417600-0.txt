review/summary: Excellent!review/text: This series will not disappoint you! I'm on the 5th book now and I have immensely enjoyed reading all of the books in the series so far. I will be very sad to finish the series because I just love how the author makes you feel as if you are right there with the ancient Kings who served God so diligently and were greatly rewarded and those who opposed God and lost everything. Our government leaders and our entire nation could learn something from this series if they would just open up their hearts to the truth of the word of God and reject the sinfulness that they have been promoting.
