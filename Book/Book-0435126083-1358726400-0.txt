review/summary: Spiteful Romancereview/text: A look back into another time and thus another world, but with sentiments that are still relevant in the world of love. The style of writing in this book flows wonderfully to make you feel as though you were being told the story first hand. The representation of love and the spitefulness it can create is powerful an romantic.
