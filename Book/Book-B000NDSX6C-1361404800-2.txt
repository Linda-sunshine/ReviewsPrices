review/summary: My Third Book - Kindle versionreview/text: I really hesitated and debated buying the Kindle version. I have a Hardback copy of the Hobbit, I also own the illustrated version. The illustrated was my favorite as I would read this version to my children & they could enjoy the pictures, too. (my youngest fell in love with Tolkien and elves and Hobbits - the goblins not so much!)With Kindle books, I'm fearful that sometimes, there are hyphens inserted randomly within the text or other strange characters randomly placed within the text. Although I find it occurring less and less as advancements are occurring.Also, this version (the 75th Anniversary Edition) has location numbers as well as page numbers. Excellent! I can follow along with Book Club friends. The drawings are very nice and large and within the story, not at the end of the book.Also I find it easy to "go to" a specific page or chapter. I am very pleased to have my favorite childhood book with me at all times in my Kindle library!
