review/summary: The Notebookreview/text: I loved this book. I saw the movie years ago and enjoyed the book even more. Nicholas Sparks is a flowing writer, it is so easy to be drawn deep within his stories and characters. I have read several of his books and am always sad to reach the end of the book and I miss his characters after I am done reading. I LOVE HIS WRITING.
