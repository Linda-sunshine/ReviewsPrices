review/summary: Mind blowing.review/text: I read this book during my sophomore year in High school, and just like any high school student I thought it was boring just from looking at it. However my teacher give stressed the idea of reading this book during the marking period. So I did after the first chapter I was mind blown. Fitzgerald did an phenomenal job building the characters of Daisy and Gatsby. The tragic death of Gatsby at the end was epic. By epic I mean I didn't expect it.Truly after this book I was hooked on and recommend it to any. I do agree with my High school teacher, this book should be mandatory. That academic year we read several other books such as Of mice and men, A race car named desired, Romeo and Juliet, Julius Cesar.
