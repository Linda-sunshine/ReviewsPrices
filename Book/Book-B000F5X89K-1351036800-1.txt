review/summary: Lives up to the hypereview/text: Another book assigned for my pre-1900 novels class that I came away absolutely loving. This book is nothing like what you've likely conjured in your mind from various sources over the years. This isn't horror in the sense that it's scary; it's horror in the classic idea that the events described are horrifying.It begins in epistolary form, with a ship's captain writing home to family before he stumbles upon Victor Frankenstein amongst the arctic ice. The captain eventually convinces the doctor to share his story, which becomes the novel. The monster is beautifully written, truly heartbreaking. In the interest of full disclosure, I was immediately drawn into the myriad Paradise Lost references, since that is one of my all-time favorites.I recommend this for fans of Gothic horror novels or those just curious to check out the first one. No language or sexuality, and the violence/gruesome elements are mostly glossed over.
