review/summary: I LOVE this book!review/text: Wuthering Heights is a beautiful tale of love and hate. It's a powerful novel, full of emotion and thought. It is a true insight to the human mind and soul. The story begins with Mr. Lockwood, a tenant for Heathcliff to live in Thrushcross Grange. Mr. Lockwood sees Heathcliff and goes home, only to ask one of the servants, Nelly, about Heathcliff's past. The story then is told from her narrative until she decides to end the story to allow Mr. Lockwood to sleep. The story continues in this manner, with Mr. Lockwood going back to Wuthering Heights to see Heathcliff, getting stuck there, etc, etc.
