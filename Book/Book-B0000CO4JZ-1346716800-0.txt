review/summary: Artful Story, Beautiful Prose, Lovereview/text: This is one of my favorites because the prose is beautiful and the twists of the story are natural. So often authors kill off characters in an attempt to make the story more compelling and dramatic, but it comes across as unfitting and trite. Fitzgerald's seamless storytelling makes the climatic ending realistic and meaningful. He wastes no words even though he gives you a full visual image of everyone in the story. Truly a masterpiece that deserves to be read and studied for centuries.-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman
