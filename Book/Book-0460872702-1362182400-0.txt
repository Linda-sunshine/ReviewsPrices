review/summary: Cinematographic storyreview/text: I had never read this giant of American literature and I understood what all the fuss was about. Excellent writing and style. You feel immediately immersed in a different time and place and the strength of the characters take the story to another level. I can&#8217;t wait to see the new movie adaptation coming out this May because I feel it has a very &#8220;cinematographic&#8221; feel. Short, visual, clear scenario and an intensity to be carried out by the characters. 8/10
