review/summary: Stoker over Joyce anyday!review/text: Being of Irish descent, it was destined I'd read this book, even after watching the movie with Gary Oldman. There's a vivid depiction with Stoker's words, a verbal panorama that makes this novel so much better than the film. Not as well known an Irish author as James Joyce, but certainly just as talented.
