review/summary: Dickens is Dickens!review/text: What can be said of Dickens, that hadn't been said before. Any tale by the master can always be read, read and re read again no matter your age. Now I can take the books (I say books) anywhere with my Kindle with delight. Thank you Amazon for making this a reality.
