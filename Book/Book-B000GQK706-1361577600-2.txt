review/summary: The Book that Started it Allreview/text: Better, bigger, deeper than the movie could ever be. The first four books are great adventure; the reward is some of the most beautiful romance. Faramir, necessarily perhaps, gets short shrift in the movie, and his courting and romance of Eowyn virtually none; only the books can do justice to that.The author may adamantly deny any allegory, but the peril to home and hearth is no less, no matter which enemy. And if tummy wins, the blow will be deeply felt at home.In the end, we need to be prepared to do what we can and must in the time we are given, and we need to be prepared to put complacency aside.
