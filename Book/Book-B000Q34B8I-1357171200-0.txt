review/summary: Glorious Storyreview/text: Such an amazing play! The dry, Victorian-era humor left me laughing almost every page. I love the coincidences and love-triangles, and the plot line confusion was absolutely brilliant. Completely rife with quotes about life and marriage, I bet I'll be repeating lines for weeks. Absolutely fabulous.
