review/summary: Decent Kindle versionreview/text: This version does not include any drawings, but I am not entirely positive the original Alice had illustrations. I know 'Through the Looking Glass' did though. (Please comment if you know so I can edit review).The four star rating is for the actual story itself. It is timeless in a way, but it is short and somewhat bittersweet. I do believe that it is the better story than 'Through the Looking Glass'. In this fantastic story we follow Alice through some interesting adventures in Wonderland. We are introduced to an amazing cast of characters including the Knave of Hearts, the Queen of Hearts, the Duchess, the white rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the march hare, and several other wacky animals and other beings.I guess the bittersweet impression is because I enjoyed the characters, but they are typically brief. The Mad Hatter is a little more prominent in the story, as is the Duchess, the Knave, and the Queen; but I would have enjoyed more time with the Cheshire Cat and a few others. Also, Alice is quite petulant, and it does get a little old that she continually goes into her little asides and interrupts the stories. Still, some of her comments are quite funny.It's very good, a true and timeless classic. This is a great example of literary nonsense. It's not quite as silly as something like Candide, but more imaginative and fantastic in every way. The Kindle version is very good, and free. Win Win.
