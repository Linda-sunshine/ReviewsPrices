review/summary: goes on and onreview/text: This book is occasionally creepy enough to be interesting- but at about page 300 I thought to myself "is this book going to end anytime soon?" The characters aren't tremendously memorable, and the book is often pretty slow going. Having said that, Stoker is occasionally horrifying enough to be interesting, and this book is certainly an interesting time capsule into Victorian social mores. Mina Harker (the female lead) is a strong, smart character, but puts up with the overprotectiveness of her husband and his friends, and goes out of her way to say she is not a feminist "New Woman."
