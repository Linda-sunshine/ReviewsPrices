review/summary: Read 1984 instead!review/text: Having read '1984' and 'Brave New World', I was expecting this novel to be of the same quality, especially as it features on umpteen Books You Should Read lists.It's moderately interesting, but lack of character development means you don't really care what happens to Guy Montag as he breaks away from authority. Will the Mechanical Hound get him? Or not? Whatever...And as the far-fetched ending occurs - a bomb that flattens the city but appears to leave the free-thinking hobos, just a few miles away, untouched, I found myself curiously unmoved.Despite its feeling at times like a book written for a teen audience, Bradbury DOES give us something to think about. Although inspired by the 1950s world of McCarthyism and restriction of books, it has become relevant in a new way to 21st century readers: our society too is in danger of 'dumbing down' with endless entertainment and meaningless chat (witness everyone texting or tuned in to an IPod as they walk along, paying no attention to the world around them); angry young people kill for kicks just like Mildred Montag:'I always like to drive fast when I feel that way...It's fun out in the country. You hit rabbits, sometimes you hit dogs.'Interesting message but not a great book.
