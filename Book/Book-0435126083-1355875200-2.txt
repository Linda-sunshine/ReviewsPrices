review/summary: Lovvvereview/text: Honestly, I read this because it was mentioned so much in the Twilight Saga. It kept nagging at me until I read it and I am so glad I did. It's a classic for a reason. I haven't read a whole lot of books from past centuries, just enough to fully appreciate Wuthering Heights. Love love love it.
