review/summary: One Of The Very Bestreview/text: This book is one of the best books i have read in the last few years.The detail given to each event makes you feel you are actually there experiencing the same yourself. The suspense buildup is tremendous and finally leads to a surprising conclusion.I could not put the book down and finished it all too soon.My next move will be to read the rest of the author &#34;Lee Childs &#34; works.starting with&#34; A Wanted Man&#34;
