review/summary: This was the book that cause me to fall in love with readingreview/text: I first read the Hobbit when I was a teenager. Throughout the years I've reread it again and again. It is a wonderfull story. I just read it again before going to see the movie. The movie is very good but many things were changed (slightly).
