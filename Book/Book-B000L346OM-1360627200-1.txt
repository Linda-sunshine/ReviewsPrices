review/summary: One of 10 Most Influential Books of the 20th Centuryreview/text: This little volume not quite literally fell off a library shelf in the 1970s and hit me in the head. I'd never heard of it, but borrowed it and was highly moved. By the 90s, some prominent source labelled it one of the 10 most influential books. I have since purchased it several times--and given all of them away. Now have it on my Kindle. It's well worth your reading time. Can't speak to the quality of the digital version as I haven't reread it yet.
