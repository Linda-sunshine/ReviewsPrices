review/summary: Classicreview/text: The last time I read this book was 1980 and a required piece for a class. The story always gave me reasons to think about were values originated. All faiths have a system and justification. Puritan outlook is still threaded in our American culture but diluted. I can't escape the mindful link to politics and the human condition. Politicians call for values and virtue in the name of handed down value systems that are humanly flawed and unsustainable. This classic piece will never fail to give one pause to reflect on the human condition ever present in individual values that can't be overlooked in a judgement process. Two sides that clash and beg for acceptance. The style of this piece is excellent.
