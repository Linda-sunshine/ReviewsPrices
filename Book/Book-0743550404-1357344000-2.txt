review/summary: Not usually a Stephen King Fanreview/text: But I REALLY wanted this one to go on longer. I am a fan of the SyFy show Haven and wanted to see what the backstory was. It wasn't a real backstory, but I can see where they went with it. The best part was just enjoying the setting and the characters.
