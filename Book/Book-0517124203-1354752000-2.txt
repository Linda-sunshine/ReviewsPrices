review/summary: It just makes you love nonesensereview/text: Lewis Carroll is a master of the nonesense. Through the book he asks questions that you probably have asked yourself tons of times and his answers are just nonesense though logically true. This leaves you with a very extrange feeling that is fantastic. Totally recommended
