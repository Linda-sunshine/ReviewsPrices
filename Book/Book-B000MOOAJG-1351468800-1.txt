review/summary: All Time Classicreview/text: Somehow, I missed reading this until now--in my late 50s. It is frighteningly similar to our present situation in this country and the world. 'Fair Share' talk will scare anyone who reads this book. The clarity with which Ayn Rand sees moral issues is stunning. Make no mistake, the way we run our country is a moral issue and redistribution of wealth will be carried to the full extreme if 'good men do nothing'. If you haven't had a chance to read this, do so NOW. Then vote.
