review/summary: Castles in the Airreview/text: First, this is not a review of any abridged version of the book. That book is garbage, and you should not buy it, regardless of the illustrations.Second, why is this book good? It's not particularly well written, for example. And there aren't a lot of deeper layers. Yet somehow it is good; but not just good. It's great. One of the great early American novels. So I guess it is the story itself, that of the timeless March sisters. Applicable to every family, every girl, and maybe every childhood. First fantasies, first loves, and first disappointments.One of the things I like most about this book is the unpleasant turns it takes regardless of the reader's wishes -- thus reflecting life itself. We want Beth to recover, but she does not. We want Jo and Laurie to marry, but that doesn't happen. Or at least for neither to be complete without the other. But again, no. Life does not cohere like that, and neither does this story. The dead remain stark dead and the "true loves" find other loves that they ultimately find truer. And that is striking; very realistic, very wonderful. Also probably why this story works better than Little Men, which was not based as much on reality.Some postscript notes: the earlier parts of the book are best, before we become depressed by the dual disappointments. It peaks when it tells about Beth's final days, that poor, gentle soul. I'm pretty hardened, but that got to even me -- well, a little, anyway.
