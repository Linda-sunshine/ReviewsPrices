review/summary: Awesome story.review/text: I've read this book a long time ago (as soon as it was published). Then I decided to introduce it to my 6th grader. He could not put the book down. He's read all 6 out of 8 books. Now we are awaiting the delivery of the "Angel". When my husband found out about this series, he also started reading it. Now it's the matter of "who grabs the book first" :) I guess I'm going to be the next one reading all the books once again, when there is no fight over them.
