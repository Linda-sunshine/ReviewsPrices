review/summary: Favorite!review/text: Imagine you lived in a world without any pain and fear. Everything occurred like clockwork and everyone seemed happy and that you knew no different, this seems like a perfect society. Welcome to the world of The Giver. I have loved this book since I was first exposed to it in college and it has been my favorite ever since. Why? I guess it is the innocence of the parties involved and the way they come to terms with new knowledge as their eyes are opened to their world around them. I also like the fact as I read the book over and over again; I always find something new or find deeper meaning in the book.Every year, the children in this utopian society get awarded a special gift until their 12th birthday. On their 12th birthday, the children receive their Assignments. These Assignments are their jobs which the Elders have decided for them and which the children will be trained in and will do for the rest of their lives. Jonas has been elected to be The Giver and this highly prized job is not something Jonas planned on being and he does not know what is all involved in this occupation as this job is not highly talked about. Jonas has some advantages to being The Giver but struggles with some of the other issues of being in this position. Why was Jonas chosen for such a tasking assignment? The current Giver must pass onto Jonas all these memories as he is aging and these memories must be transferred to someone within the society. These memories include wonderful times but they also include pain and suffering which take a toll on Jonas. What Jonas does with the memories is unprecedented and what Jonas learns in his new position, has Jonas thinking about his life in hometown differently.I can't say enough about this book. The characters are so real and the story moves so quickly, it is never a dull moment. This book is for readers in 5th grade or higher because of some of its subject matter
