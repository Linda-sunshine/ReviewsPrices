review/summary: Life's helpful hints!!!!review/text: I read the book and found it to be most useful in relationships with people. I was pleasantly surprised.I am service oriented.. I thought it was quality of time. That did come in a close second. I nowunderstand and am relaxing my expectations. I understand my husband"s language.Knowing both ofours, takes away a lot of stress and unfulfilled expectations. I have come to better appreciate ourrelationship with out unnecessary demands. I do know that I do respond to all 5 languages.There s is one I am some what uncomfortable with and now that I know what it is , I am working onmy responses . It will take time, but will be worth the effort. I believe this would work for everyone. Ithank my Pastoral Associate for recommending the book. I highly recommend it to everyone interestedin having a great relationships with others.
