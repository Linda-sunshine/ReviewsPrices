review/summary: Excellentreview/text: Not enough good reviews are written about this excellent book, you'll see more written for newer books and that's a shame. This book stands the test of time. You've probably read this in high school, but if that was a long time ago, you should read it again. Not under any pressure to write a book report, you can enjoy this for what it is.I can imaging Mark Twain writing this book in long hand at his desk--the words flowing off his fountain pen. He mastered the southern dialects in which the book is written because he lived with them--he didn't pick them up from TV, movies or radio because there were none of those. He witnessed slavery too and if you read between the lines he has something to say about that.
