review/summary: Most beautiful love story I have ever read *spoilers*review/text: This is the quickest book I have ever read. It was THAT addicting and hard to put down.I surprisingly enjoyed the time lapse in the book. After completing it, I thought "wow, it only took them two days to fall in love again," but I did not realize it had been such a short amount of time while reading. Allie and Noah really do love each other, and Noah's love for her especially is what broke my heart by the end of the book. He never once gave up on her.I find it painfully beautiful that he reads "their story" to her everyday day or so. If I were to become ill like Allie, I would want the same thing. I completely broke down when she said his name on the last page, when she remembered him. That gave me hope that love can truly find a way through time.
