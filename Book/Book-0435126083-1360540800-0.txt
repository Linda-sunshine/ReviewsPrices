review/summary: Classicreview/text: The book took me forever to read it seems. I usually can read a short story like this in a day or two but it took me nearly two weeks to finish this one. I did enjoy the story and I will definitely recommend to other readers. Everyone should have the pleasure of reading Wuthering Heights.
