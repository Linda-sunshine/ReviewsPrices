review/summary: Great book from start to finishreview/text: The book keeps you engaged from beginning to end. There are great characters throughout the book that Bilbo meets. The most notorious being his meeting with Gollum. There are trolls, elves, dragons, and a man who takes the shape of a bear. This is a fun adventure book with much meaning.
