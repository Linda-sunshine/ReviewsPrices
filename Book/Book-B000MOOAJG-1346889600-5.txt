review/summary: More relevant than anything else being published about society todayreview/text: First, for the book condition, shipper, etc., all great. I Think it came before the estimated ship time and was in perfect condition.This review is really about the quality of material contained inside the covers of Atlas Shrugged. Page by page, my astonishment snowballed for how prophetic and relevant a book written 60 years ago can be to my life and today's societal position.No one ever reads really long reviews so I won't write one, I will just say a few things that I hope convince you to find a way to read this book:1. This book has literally changed the lens with which I view society2. Yes, it is like 1100 pages; don't be scared; when you finish you will wish it would have been twice as long3. The attention to detail for small things like facial expressions, thought processes, etc is reminiscent of John Updike; at times it feels like a little much, but when you look back, it is what really makes the story unique4. The story it just amazing. There is no other way to describe itWord of advice: Do not spoil the experience of reading this by seeing the low budget movie or reading any summaries; buy it and get going knowing nothing more than it is a true work of art
