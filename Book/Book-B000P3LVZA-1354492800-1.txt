review/summary: Certainly worth a readreview/text: Aldous Huxley's Brave New World challenges the current image of future success and details consequences of following status quo. Set in London in A.F. 632 (After Ford), this novel portrays the danger of the idealism of a future utopian society. At first readers are met with the extremes of this world: mass reproductive breeding occurs on an assembly line instead of natural human reproduction, the idealism of open sex without the present security of monogamous relationship even so that children are having sex, discrimination through brainwashing of young minds. Huxley successful describes each of these characteristics as he takes readers into the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Center.Huxley's writing style remains descriptive throughout the book and it is easy for readers to imagine what life is like in this futuristic world. Although sometimes disturbing, these descriptions are necessary for readers to grasp the significance of actions in this particular setting. Without details of the setting, readers will not understand the danger of going against the norm.Even so, Huxley challenges the effectiveness of the norm he presents through a character known as John the Savage. John came to London after living in New Mexico with the traditional ways of today. Upon arriving, he notices that citizens aren't genuinely happy; they have just believed what they've been told. He sees the injustice of drugging individuals with "soma" a drug providing euphoria and suppressing reality.Although a bit extreme at times, Huxley's presentation challenges society's desire for instant gratification, unending happiness and superficiality. The novel is certainly worth a read. Beyond its literary merit it provides a window into the fate of the population of these desires don't curb and allows for some soul searching on the reader's part.
