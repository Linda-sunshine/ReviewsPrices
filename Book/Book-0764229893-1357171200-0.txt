review/summary: Makes you want to read your Biblereview/text: I really enjoyed this book. It was exciting and interesting. I'm fairly familiar with my Bible, but this book had me wanting to check and double check things. I'd find myself reading my Bible to see how the story was going to go! My teenage daughter read it first and said she thought I'd like it. She was right! I recommended it to my teenage son and he was on book 2 within a couple days. You just don't want to put it down!I like it when a book can bring a Bible story to life without contradicting the Bible itself. I'm on the 3rd book so far and still loving it!
