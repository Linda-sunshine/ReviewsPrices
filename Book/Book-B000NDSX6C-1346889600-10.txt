review/summary: Timeless classic...review/text: I first read the hobbit back in school and it opened up my mind and imagination to whole new worlds and sparked a love of reading that carries forward to this very day. There are so many great themes in this book - but my favorite thing is that it is a great story that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike. If you haven't ever read it, then go for it. If you are looking for something great for your kids to read, then you can't do much better than the hobbit.
