review/summary: The Hiding Place uncovers hidden sections of my souldreview/text: Wow! Is all I can truly think of this book. This book is an inspiring story about the boldness and loyal faith to God in the midst of great trajedy. It was amazing to see the work of God through these people. Corrie reminds me of myself so much, and her sister Betsie is a true example of God here on earth. Even Nollie proved that God still works his miracles when she boldly had to go against even her family to not lie. I think this book will be reread over and over again in my home! Enjoy this read.
