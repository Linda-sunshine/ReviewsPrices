review/summary: Comparativereview/text: I watched the movie before reading the book and I noticed certain things in the book we're elaborated on more so than the motion picture. That obviously holds true for most books. What I didn't like we're the things that weren't elaborated on in the book that were extensively shown in the movie. Over all it was a good balance between the two. The Harry Potter Saga is definitely a fun, magical, educational story that everyone should read.
