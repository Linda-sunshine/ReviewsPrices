review/summary: Must Readreview/text: When it comes to classic horror stories, this one tops them all. Even the most superficial reader could enjoy the thrill that swarms throughout this book, but it also contains many interesting ideas about what it means to be a monster, the pain and responsibility that comes with knowledge, and the emotional effects being an outcast can have on one. It makes you contemplate the power of love. I enjoyed this from start to finish.
