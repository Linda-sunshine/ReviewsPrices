review/summary: Wonderful, insightful book!review/text: This book's explaination on the 5 love languages we "speak" especially in a marriage was so insightful, I had to send my daughter and new husband a copy, in the hopes of their new marriage would benefit from learning each other's "love language." I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to save their marriage and who are just starting a new life together.
