review/summary: Better than I rememberreview/text: I'm not sure I ever read "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". I saw the Disney cartoon and as much fun as that was, the actual story is much better.The story has so many levels. It's not just for children - I'm enjoying it more as an adult.I kept hearing Jefferson Airplane's Grace Slick singing - in my head - as I enjoyed Alice's adventures.Although it's a fairy tale it connects to a lot of memories.
