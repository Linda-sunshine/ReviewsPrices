review/summary: a classicreview/text: This classic book got my daughters attention when we saw a trailer for it when we saw the movie Lincoln, I put it in her stocking and she's already dug in. I remember reading this in high school, well worth reading again when she's done with it. Came very quickly and packaged well.
