review/summary: Good and Badreview/text: Overall, I liked this book, which I got on my Kindle. But, it had parts that were pretty boring, like when it would get off of the story line about the whale and go into how the rope was made, etc. I wasn't so interested in rope and wanted to get back to the story. But, I stayed with it due to the book being a classic.
