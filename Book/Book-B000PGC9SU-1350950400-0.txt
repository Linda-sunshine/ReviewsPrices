review/summary: Boringreview/text: I muddled through the old world language of his early adult years and enjoyed reading about how different colonial America was and how people just freely moved wherever life took them but then we hit the big gap where he didn't write and after that all he covered was his philosophy of life. I quit reading half way through the book.
