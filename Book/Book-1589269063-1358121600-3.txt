review/summary: Best marriage / relationship book I have ever readreview/text: I have been married for quite a few years, and this book was recommended to me by my pastor. There is no more clear and simple way to communicate this information than the author has done. I knew some of these things, and it gave me some self-realization when reading this book. I was completely in-sync with his writing and his examples. I have lived some of these things and the book really felt like it was written for me. There is no way this book was actually written for me, thus my only conclusion is Dr. Gary Chapman is a very smart man and a knows how to communicate better than most.If you feel like your spouse doesn't love you like you think they should, read this book and suggest they do the same.
