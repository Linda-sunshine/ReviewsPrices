review/summary: Surprising Delightreview/text: Never being a fan of the classics, I was delightfully shocked at how much I enjoyed this book. Jane Austen has converted me and I now find myself in possession of all of her wonderful books now. What I thought would be a dreadful endurance has turned into a new favorite of mine and opened my eyes to the wonders that this amazing author has to offer. This is a great book for everyone willing to read it!
