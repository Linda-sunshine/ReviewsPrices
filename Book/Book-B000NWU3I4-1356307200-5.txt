review/summary: Great storyreview/text: I read this for the first time at the age of 36 in preparation for the movie. I loved the Lord of the Rings movies and can see why the books have such a fan base.I read on a 7&#34; android tablet and liked that I was able to zoom in closely to the various maps and drawing images.It was a fun book to read and I enjoyed it.
