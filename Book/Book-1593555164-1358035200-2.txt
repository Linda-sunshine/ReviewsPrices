review/summary: Just as good the second (third?) time aroundreview/text: I'm a long time Lee Child fan, having read all of the Jack Reacher novels at least once. The movie (much better than I expected) convinced me to re-read One Shot. I wasn't disappointed. Not great literature, but a great novel.... more fun when you are familiar with the history... or future,.,, of the character.
