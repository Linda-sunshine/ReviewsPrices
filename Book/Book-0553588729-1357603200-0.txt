review/summary: Book vs. DVDreview/text: I've seen this method in action and it seems to work, so no issues there. The book is very repetitive. But it didn't take long as it was an easy read. He could probably cut out half the pages if he didn't review what he already said over and over again. The DVD is much more to the point and the visual is good, which is why I rented it from the library for my hubby to watch. It was much easier to watch the 40 minute DVD than to get my hubby to read through the book. Same message. The book only gives a little more background information on debunking the &#34;causes&#34; of colic - going through each one and discussing, where in the DVD he gets straight to his methods. While I like the book, I think it would have been better to take out of the library and return. Once you know the info, there's no reason to refer back to it.
