review/summary: One of the greatest books ever writtenreview/text: Apart from all the smut that Rand has laced through this novel, it's actually a decent book. If you are a welfare abusing commie centralist, then you should turn away now. This book is capitalism to the &#34;T&#34;. Rand lived through communism, saw the abuse of power, so no matter what you may be thinking, she's extremely qualified to write this book
