review/summary: Dracula: the horror I had to read....review/text: Having been a lover of classic horror stories & movies as a kid & having read Shelley's Frankenstein in print some time ago, I felt compelled to take advantage of Stoker's Dracula on audio. I wanted to know what was behind all the movies. At times I found it heavy going because of the style, but I am glad that I persevered. I recommend it, but prospective readers should be prepared for the diary/letter style as well as the language of the day. Take your time & I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
