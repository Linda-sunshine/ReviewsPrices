review/summary: Good adventurous readreview/text: I haven't read the Lord of the Rings series and wouldn't consider myself an avid fan, but I thought The Hobbit was very entertaining once it picked up its pace. Although I thought the beginning was a bit slow, the book is full of great adventures and rich imagery. There were times I didn't want to put the book down. I only wish I had the hard cover to enjoy the books and illustrations a bit more (but that's not what you buy a book for anyway). Tolkien is always a genius, so I didn't expect any less.
