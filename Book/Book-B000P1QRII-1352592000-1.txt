review/summary: great readreview/text: This is a great read for all ages. I reread this book every time a new one came out in this series and I was excited to see "Son" come out that tied into this first of the series. I came across 'The Giver' in a middle school reading program - I always wondered what happened after the end of the book and was excited when the series continued. I'm in my 70's now and this book has been one I've passed down to my children and grandchildren as a must read.
