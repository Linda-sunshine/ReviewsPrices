review/summary: Finally read itreview/text: I never watched the lord of the ring movies and never cared much about fantasy novels. With the new movie coming out recently this book shot back up to the top of the charts and when looking for something new to read there it was. I figured what the heck and gave it a try. This book was an easy read, the characters where non complicated and the writing was simple but entertaining.I then went to see the movie assuming it would be no where as good as the book but I was completely wrong. They did such a good job and added in so much extra fantasy that the book paled in comparison! Go figure.
