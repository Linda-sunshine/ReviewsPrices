review/summary: Unexpectedly Delightfulreview/text: I had put off reading this for several decades, imagining it to be overly-girly and saccharine. Finally coming across it on list after list of must-reads I decided to give it a chance, and I must say I'm glad I did. I found the storyline pleasant, the characters relateable even so many years after its writing, and the entire book incredibly charming and delightful.
