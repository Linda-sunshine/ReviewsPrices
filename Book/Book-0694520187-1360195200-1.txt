review/summary: Not an easy readreview/text: I picked up Melville's classic tome with the idea of finishing it after having lived for more than 70 years on the planet. At first, I was up to the challenge, but the part of his book where he discusses the color 'white' put me over the edge of sanity and interest. Maybe in my next life, I'll have more patience and time...
