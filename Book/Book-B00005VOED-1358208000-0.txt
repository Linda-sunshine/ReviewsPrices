review/summary: More like "A Conspiracy of Dunces" Read "Catch 22" insteadreview/text: I spent the whole of 2012 reading non-fiction strictly and for 2013, this was one of the fiction books I was eagerly looking forward to tackling. Turning to the forward I was even more enthused when I read about how this book was published post-humously and won the Pulitzer. I was pretty disappointed with the results. The story is just dull and long-winded stuffed with characters that are outright unlikable. Ignatius is somebody whom you completely despise and by the time you creep to the last pages, hopes will suffer a terrible fate. Even reading the blurbs on the back cover you read much about "laugh out loud" statements. Never happened. A single page from "Catch 22" elicited more genuine laughs than this entire story. I don't know if I ever loathed a main character more. He's a fat, lazy and unhygienic slob that seems to sidestep trouble with equal parts intelligence and the unrealistic gullibility of his adversaries. I'll at least concede that as you're rambling through 400 pages of a rather boring story, Toole does do a competent job of wrapping the story up and tying together the mesh of characters involved. It's just not worth the journey.
