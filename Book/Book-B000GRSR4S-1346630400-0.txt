review/summary: Thought-provoking...review/text: Stumbling around for something good to read, I asked my 20-something daughter for her suggestions. Slaughter House-5 was among them. I'm glad I read it. I won't go into a detailed review; there are plenty of others who do. I will say, though, that this book gives a stark look at the damage war does to its participants. Clearly Billy Pilgrim was affected by what he'd endured, although he was a bit spacy from birth, I'd venture, and perhaps the war isn't the only reason for his strangeness. The Tralfamadore's outlook on time--that past, present, and future exist at one time and events are not linear--is thought-provoking in an "imagine the effects of this" sort of way. (It may also appear "spiritual" to those readers who believe in a God who simultaneously sees the beginning and the end of time.) Other Tralfamadorian beliefs left me pondering(which is a good thing for a book to do)and many have a hint of "wisdom." I found the twist at the end of the book startling, another thing good books have. Because SH-5 has stayed with me in some way, I give it 5 stars.
