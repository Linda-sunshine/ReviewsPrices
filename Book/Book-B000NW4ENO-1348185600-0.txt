review/summary: MEGASTORYreview/text: Just finished this story. Took a while. Glad I didn't live in that period. Now I know what all that dreadful war was about. I didn't know anything about it but now I am full up to the top! I have not read anything quite like this novel which took me weeks to read, and I thank my lucky stars I am me, living in a tiny country where people don't go mad. The sheer volume of words describing conflict, emotions, deprivation and loss was unbelievable. If you want to tuck up on a rainy day (or days) and learn what it was like to live in that century then this is the book for you. Scarlett needed a good smack, Rhett needed a good hug, Pittypat needed a box of tissues, Ashley needed a ramrod for his spine and Melly needed a sainthood. Yes, I understood what was written about the war, and loathed it, but isn't that what a story is supposed to do? Wring out your feelings? And I certainly am wrung out. This book gives you more buck for your dollar than many I have read, so go on - put your feet up and get stuck in to Gone with the Wind. Makes you feel grateful for what you have.
