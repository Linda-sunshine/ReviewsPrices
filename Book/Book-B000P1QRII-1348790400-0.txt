review/summary: Why do teachers keep assigning this book?review/text: With all the great literature that is available for middle schoolers, it is mind boggling that The Giver, a mediocre yet sensationalist book, keeps getting assigned for fifth graders. Suppression of puberty, commercialized breeding and other features of the story are, I hope, beyond the realm of understanding for 10 year olds. There are plenty of great dystopian novels out there to read for older students, but this is certainly not one of them. To all you teachers who are simply following the pack on this front, look into some other options and teach Orwell, Swift and the like when students are ready.
