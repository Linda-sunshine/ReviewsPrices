review/summary: I have read four or five &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; stories.review/text: First person in Killing Floor was a nice touch, I liked the dark character when we the reader could get inside of his head. Now I could be wrong about that, but the connection seemed closer. The second and third person narative in the resulting books is dryer, less visceral, less involving. Lee Child crafts a believable mystery with but a few stumbling points. His television series background makes for a visual style that moves along and shows the story rather than telling it. Childs's plots are good, well laid out and surprising.Reacher is a loner with a dark and dangerous nearly conscience free mode of action. Damn the consequences! Reacher blunders forward in a bigger is better method of intimidating action. I'll read another.
