review/summary: Pretty good, with excellent writing stylereview/text: I picked up this audiobook from my library's shelf because Ethan Hawke is narrating it. I loved Ethan Hawke ever since Great Expectations, so I was really curious. The name "Slaughterhouse 5" vaguely reminded me of a book that I might have had to read in high school, or maybe not. It was very vague. But I also knew the book was famous, and no reason why.So...what did I think?Well, most people will say they didn't like the book because of the jumpy timeline. Actually, I didn't mind it. I wasn't IN LOVE with it either. But the author did a REALLY good job of making sure WE KNEW when Billy (the main character) was "getting unstuck in time." So even though it was constantly moving forward and backward all over the place, it really wasn't too bad. It did have a "Main" timeline of Billy suffering through WW2 and the bombing of Dresden.Style-wise, Vonnegut is really a good writer. There was a part where he described Dresden as "If angels could build a city, which all its curves and heavenly sky, Dresden would be that city." And you know what? I could totally picture the curves, and colors, and sky, and sun of that heavenly city, even though I've never seen old pictures of Dresen before WW2, if there even are any.I will say this, it's not an easy book to read. Between the story lines and the subject matter, it really does need to be read by a more adult audience to be able to keep up and capture it all. But that's not to say a smart high schooler can read it.And so, I liked this book. I didn't like the war, and suffering, and bombing, and death. But it certainly was a different way of writing about the same subject. I recommend it to others.
