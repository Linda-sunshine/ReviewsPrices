review/summary: A Realistic Adventurereview/text: This book was a wonderful, well written novel. This adventure of Jane Eyre is all the more enjoyable because it is plausible. Despite the very Christian views of the characters, and my stance of being unaffiliated there are few books I have enjoyed as much as this, and few fictional characters I respect more.
