review/summary: truly a masterpiece, but mostly written as a childrens bookreview/text: This is not a review specifically of The Hobbit, but more of what this book is compared to Tolkien's other writings. Tolkien's true masterpiece is The Silmarillion, which he wrote in WW1, believe it or not. The Silmarillion is a very deep and complex book, to much so for children. Thus he wrote this book for children taking some bits and pieces from The Silmarillion. You can think of the difference as comparing reading the bible to a bible story for kids. After the success of the Hobbit, Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Rings which continues from the Hobbit and is somewhat more of a young adult type of work, more complex than the Hobbit but still nothing like the Silmarillion.Does one need to read The Hobbit before the Lord of the Rings? Not necessarily, but I strongly recommend it. There are some parts in the hobbit that some people may find mundane or silly, such as the songs the dwarves sing. But it gives a very good world of what is a Hobbit and if you like that, you'll probably like the Lord of the Rings too. Keep in mind the LOTR is a long series and it seems a character just walking across a field can take 30 pages.On a whole though The Hobbit is certainly one of the best books of all time and can be enjoyed by young and old alike. Obviously now is a great time to read it as the movies are being made of it (finally!). One good thing about reading it is there are some characters not in the movie and of course there are some things in the movie that aren't quite like the book. And you'll have a better idea of what things are going on. But some people may even rather read the book after the movie. I think its more enjoyable to read the book first though, then reread it again later. I also think the book gives you a much better insight into Bilbo than the movie can. And Bilbo isn't the same guy as Frodo in LOTR either.
