review/summary: READ THIS BOOK. Touching,inspiring witness to God's faithfulness in tragedy.review/text: Highly recommend. Should be on any readers "bucket list".Heartbreaking & yet inspiring true book. God's hands were all over their lives. The heroism, courage and faith in this book was very touching. Great witness to God's love & faithfulness in spite of horrendous circumstances. It sticks with me - haunting yet redemptive. Loved the suitcase analogy. Gratefulness for fleas. Forgiveness shown.One of the best books I've ever read, not for the literary writing, but for the story told.
