review/summary: A must read for pirate fansreview/text: Before Capt. Jack Sparrow there was Long John Silver. If you love adventure stories with pirates and buried treasure you will love this book. RLS provides a riveting tale told from the perspective of a young boy. I had never read anything from Stevenson before, but from the start of this book I was hooked.
