review/summary: Beautiful and Original Editionreview/text: Not going to review the story, here. If you want an opinion on that, look elsewhere. This edition is really beautiful. The binding is really elegant, with speckled page edges and gold/red embossing on the cover. Comes with a matching slip case also, which is also very nice.I like to pay particular attention to the page layouts and typesetting, and it's really beautiful. They don't make 'em like this these days. Pages have absolutely massive margins which is so nice to look at. There are a number of colour plates, and also many illustration pages which have a lovely pale green/yellow ink tint behind them. This same coloured ink is used on the chapter title pages which adds a real feel of quality and attention to detail.One of the prized possessions in my bookcase.
