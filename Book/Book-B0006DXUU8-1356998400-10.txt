review/summary: The Christmas Carol, Kindle editionreview/text: &#34;The Christmas Carol&#34; , kindle edition.First of all you have to understand that the Christmas Holiday is my favorite time of year. Whether this influenced my enjoyment of the book, who can say. Also I enjoy books where love triumphs. It is a &#34;feel good&#34; book and it put me in the &#34;spirit&#34; of the season, not that I needed a big push in that direction. It is a short read, enjoyable and you will feel better for having read it!
