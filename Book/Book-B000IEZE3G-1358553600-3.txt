review/summary: Fantastic! Reads quickly. Worth every momentreview/text: Honestly these books are amazing. The sheer volume of each book is a scary sight to see but the joy in reading surpass any page number. Rowling did a fantastic thing. I'm in college and still read the Harry Potter series, you sure can.
