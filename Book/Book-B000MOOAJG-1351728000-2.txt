review/summary: Like trudging through a 2-foot snow driftreview/text: I read this book during presidential election season to see what all the "fuss" was about. I've read some ofAyn Rand's writings and am familiar with her philosophy but I've not read one of her novels.After wading through 1,000 pages I have to say I'm amazed that this novel is so popular and enduring. OK, I get it that Rand is a materialist, but she's sucked all the life out of this novel by making it such a relentless polemic. Quite ironically it occurred to me while reading "Atlas" that it has all the esthetic appeal of socialist realist art from the Soviet era.There's NO nuance or subtlety here. The characters lack the complex motivations and emotions of real life. The individualist heroes are flat prototypes and all other characters are weak, conformists totally lacking character and virtue.I just can't take this tome seriously as philosophy or literature.
