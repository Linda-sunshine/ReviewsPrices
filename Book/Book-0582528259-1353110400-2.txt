review/summary: If you haven't read it since you were a kid, get busy!review/text: I read this when I was in middle school and thought I &#34;got&#34; it, but reading it again as an adult revealed so much more than I remembered! Jane Eyre is the greatest hero of post-ancient literature. Probably only surpassed by Ulysses.
