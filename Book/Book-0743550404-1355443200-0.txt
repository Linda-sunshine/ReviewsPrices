review/summary: The Colorado Kidreview/text: I don't know if this book is a good read or not. It is written in German!!! And the necessity for rating is 0 stars for that reason, although it is marked with one star. I enjoy the television series "Haven," so was interested to see what the book was like. However, I speak mitt English.
