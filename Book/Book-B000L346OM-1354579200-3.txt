review/summary: Fascinating bookreview/text: Viktor Frankl wrote this book after having survived a concentration camp in Nazi Germany. He realized that while we may not be able to control the circumstances we find ourselves in, we are able to control how we deal with our circumstances. Most problems pale in comparison to what he went through, so if meaning can be found in the worst of places, meaning can be found in every situation.
