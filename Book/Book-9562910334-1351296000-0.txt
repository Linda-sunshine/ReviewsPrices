review/summary: My personal impactreview/text: I want to give you all a heads-up about what reading this book did for me. The more objective things are well documented and I don't want to go into that. Reading this book really got to me, gave me creepy feelings about my own hard childhood in the family gulag and made it hard to sleep for a few nights. I guess my comment is that a prospective reader might think about this kind of affect and mull things over before getting into it. The book is well written, for sure, and Orwell keeps the action going...but that action literally goes straight to hell. Not an easy read--at least for me it wasn't.
