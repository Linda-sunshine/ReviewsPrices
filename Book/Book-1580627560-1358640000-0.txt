review/summary: Not so good advicereview/text: I read this book last summer and used it with the man I was dating, and he almost dumped me!There are some good points in here, about not compromising your value, and being confident in yourself.But then the parts about not showing emotion and showing your true self is just bad advice. Showing your emotions sometimes shows authenticity.To be combative, manipulative and treat a relationship like a game of chess is selfish and unloving. I believe these tactics work great on men with low self esteem, but not on confident, successful, quality men.Read at your own risk!
