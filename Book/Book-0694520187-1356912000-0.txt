review/summary: Well worth readingreview/text: 'Call me Ishmael'. I suppose everyone has heard of this book until they are almost sick of it. But it is worth reading. Thin on character insights but full of information on whaling/whales and the technology and lifestyles of the period. A curious book, readable and worth the effort.
