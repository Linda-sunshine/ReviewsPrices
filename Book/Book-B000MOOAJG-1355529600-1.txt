review/summary: EXCELLENT!!!review/text: Ayn Rand could see the train coming well before most could....her book is an accurate predictive analysis of things to come, some which are happening right now. Her writing is descriptive and allows the reader (or listener) to picture the scenes with clarity and a vividness that is hard to find with a lot of contemporay writers. Scott Brick does a marvolous job reading her work, he understands the content and importance of each character giving appropriate inflection and reactions in this reading.
