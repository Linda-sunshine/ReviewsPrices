review/summary: Treasure Island Kindle version.review/text: Exciting in parts. Rather too much sailing detail especially when Jim sailed the Hispaniola by himself (highly unlikely). No information on what happened to Jum when he got home with his ill gotten gains!! Pirates and Jim's crew were after the treasure for themselves and they killed to get there first. There seems to be a moral question there!!
