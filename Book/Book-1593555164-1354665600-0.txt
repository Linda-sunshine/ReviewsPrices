review/summary: Another great page-turner !!review/text: I really enjoyed this book. Jack Reacher is his usual self, highly intelligent, scared of no-one and with a touch of barely restrained aggression. The story gets you in from the first page and although you think you are unravelling the mysteries yourself along the way, Mr Child has full control of where your mind takes you. A brilliant story-teller. My one complaint about Reacher is how he wears his clothes for far too long before replacing them (not washing even his undies), and doesn't possess deodorant/toiletries, and yet the ladies still find him attractive.To me it seems that he would look dirty and be a bit smelly as well.
