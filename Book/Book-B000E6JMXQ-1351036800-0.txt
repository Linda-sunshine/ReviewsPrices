review/summary: datedreview/text: The descriptions and names of animals are dated. The ideas expressed are as well. It was interesting to see how some of the technical details held up.Overall a bit dull at times with rather long descriptions typical of books written during this period. Would do better with a bit of editing for content and updating of language.
