review/summary: Pride and Prejudicereview/text: I've seen several movie versions of the book, and decided to read it again since the first time that I read it was in high school in 1964. I loved reading it again and to see how much the movies were condensed. Reading the book also clarified some questions that I had about the movies. It's such a wonderful story and so well written.
