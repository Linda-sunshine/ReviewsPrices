review/summary: Great companion read!review/text: I decided to get more perspective on the Abolitionist movement. This book had been on my &#34;to read list&#34; for years but I never got around to it. As a &#34;free&#34; choice on Prime, I had no excuse. What a timeless read! Stowe draws the reader in, convincing them of their rightiousness, then juxtaposes a convincing argument to humble the most arrogant. No wonder it was such a runaway best seller! I read this as a companion to Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northrup and Team of Rivals by Doris Goodwin Kearns. Loved all three!
