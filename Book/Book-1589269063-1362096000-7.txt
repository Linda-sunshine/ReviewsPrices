review/summary: Hmmmm....review/text: Rated it a four because spouse hasn't read it, but it did open my eyes.While reading book I tried a few things with spouse (without telling them) for a week and they asked, "you've been going out of your comfort zone, haven't you?" Book obviously rooted in some truth.Now it's my spouse's turn to read. Stay tuned.
