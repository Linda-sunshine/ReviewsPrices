review/summary: Hatchet is a wonderful read for young and oldreview/text: Had a fifth grade teacher who said this was one of his favorite books for his kids.It is story to the young that they can do anything if they use what they have been giving in their short lived lives. It is a book that you can't put down until done. My grandson who is in the third grade loves it.
