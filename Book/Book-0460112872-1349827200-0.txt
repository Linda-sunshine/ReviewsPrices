review/summary: Jane Eyrereview/text: Still a classic! I enjoyed the English of the 1840's. Some of the chapters, however, were a little long and became a bit tedious. Did the really talk like that? With the Kindle dictionary, I had to look up at least three unknown words per page to find out the old-style language.
