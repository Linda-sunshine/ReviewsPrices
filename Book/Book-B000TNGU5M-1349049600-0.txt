review/summary: Nightreview/text: This book was recommended by George Otis Jr of the Sentinal group and shows the absolute resolve of the Jewish people. An inside view of the conditions not only physical but emotional and the dismanteling of the human spirit by Hitler. And yet, they prevailed and he failed.The thought that this part of our history could be removed or ignored by "revisionist" history is not to be tolerated. This small book will open the eyes of the world to the necessity of praying for the nation of Israel as the same evil is brewing against them once again.
