review/summary: Never too oldreview/text: It was with considerable grumbling that I received word that my Sunday School class was going to include the first Harry Potter book in their study this fall and winter......I am elderly....what would I gain from reading that!!!!Actually, after it arrived in the mail (very promptly), I was absolutely enchanted with the story and read the book very quickly....I am now so glad that Harry Potter and I are more than just a nodding acquaintance.
