review/summary: A Good Starting Pointreview/text: The writing style is obviously dated, but if you want to read about our Founding Fathers you might as well start with the autobiographies. But, I think you'll still have to seek out other books to get a complete understanding of Mr. Franklin, a very interesting person.
