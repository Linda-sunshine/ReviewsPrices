review/summary: A Bit Soft For My Tastereview/text: This was NOT A bad book. However, I am afraid that I have grown accustomed to the very structural formatting that Sir Robert Greene, author of my favorite instructional book "The 48 Laws of Power", uses to write his books. This one just didn't have that cutthroat element that I am used to enjoying when it comes to books like this. As a result, in my opinion it was a bit slow in delivery and it seemed as thought the writer was trying to hold my hand as he *politely suggested ways to promote positive human interactions... Spare me! Though there is some possibility that I may recommend this book to someone, (if they ask about it specifically) I wouldn't swear by it at all - just wasn't my speed. I figured a Three star was appropriate.
