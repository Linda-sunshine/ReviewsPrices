review/summary: Mere Christianityreview/text: This books is easier to read than some of his other ones on theology because it was a series of broadcast talks on the BBC during the dark days of WWII. He explains Christian beliefs for the benefit of unbelievers. Very good. Makes me want to read more Lewis.
