review/summary: The Visitorreview/text: I also fell for it and ordered The Visitor, and started reading it right after I finished Running Blind. I thought I picked up the wrong book. Yes, it's a dirty trick, and I was a victim. Shame on you Lee Child. Maybe next they'll retitle "The Diary of Anne Frank" as "She's Upstairs" and everyone will buy it.
