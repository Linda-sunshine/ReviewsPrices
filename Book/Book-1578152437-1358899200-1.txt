review/summary: Classicreview/text: I don't really feel equipped to rate a true classic based on it's literary value, so I'll just rate my personal reading experience.I really liked it. Some of the classics are can be dry, or overly verbose, or just confusing. Oliver Twist is enjoyable and thought provoking. I had to read it in high school, and I even remember enjoying it then, when it was an assignment!
