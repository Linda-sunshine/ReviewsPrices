review/summary: Good readreview/text: Funny at times and gut-wrenching at others, this book kept me hooked. Lord Henry, an influence on Doria, said the most oxymoronic stuff, sometimes funny and awful at the same time. I had read that in reading Oscar Wilde, this book was a great place to start. I wound up reading the importance of being earnest and I can tell you this was a much better starting point. This books heavier in subject matter but much better overall.
