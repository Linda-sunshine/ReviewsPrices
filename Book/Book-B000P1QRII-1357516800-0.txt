review/summary: Nice Bookreview/text: Very fast delivery like always with Amazon. My 10 year old had to read it for school and I wanted to read it too. Very nice book, but a little hard (difficult) to read for a 10 year old (therefore it needed a little adult supervision and explanation), otherwise a very good book!
