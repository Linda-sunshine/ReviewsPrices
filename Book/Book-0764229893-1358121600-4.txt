review/summary: A look at the kindle book Gods and Kings.review/text: I have read the ebook Gods and Kings twice, and have studied the Bible since 1974, reading the entire bible once a year from 1974-2005 twice in 2006, three times 2007-9 and 2011-12 four times 2010. Except for three historical errors, I find Gods and Kings quite true to the Bible and history. The first error is when Hezekiah was taken to watch the Moloch sacrifice of his older brother. that couldn't happen. Children sacrificed to Moloch as well as Baal, Chemosh and Dagon were sacrificed when they were between three and five years old. Hezekiah would have been between two and four years old. Children were not weaned until they were three and didn't go to worship services until they were five. Hezekiah may have seen half-brothers sacrificed but not his older brother. The second error is, Hezekiah couldn;t be sacrificed to Moloch. Moloch, Baal, Chemosh, and Dagon required the first born child. The third error is children didn't wear clothes until they were five in Biblical times.
