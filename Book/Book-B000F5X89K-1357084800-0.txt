review/summary: School Readingreview/text: I was thoroughly surprised at the outcome of this book. When I was younger, people told me about how boring the book was and I definitely trusted their judgement of the novel. I couldn't get into it at the beginning so I read the synopsis. I'd only ever seen "Young Frankenstein" with my mother so I was thrown off by the story line which proved to be interesting at some (not all) points. I was impressed even though diction was extremely "posh" and flowery.
