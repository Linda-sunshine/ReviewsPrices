review/summary: It really is as great as the hype!review/text: I'm an adult and I usually read mystery/thrillers. However, these books have become so ingrained in our culture, that I wanted to know what they were all about. I thought about just watching the movies, but I always prefer to read first so I can form my own impressions, before the movie forms them for me.I won't say much - a lot has already been said about these books. I will just say that J.K.Rowling is a true artist with words, who creates a magical world that you wish you could visit. We all owe her a debt of gratitude for getting young folks interested in reading entire books in this age of twitter, blogs, youtube and sound bites.The other thing I will say is that these books are for kids of all ages, and I'm very glad I read this one. I will definitely read the other six, and then watch the movies. Such enchantment!
