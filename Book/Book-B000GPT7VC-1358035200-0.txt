review/summary: Required Readingreview/text: &#34;Uncle Tom's Cabin&#34;, the top selling book of the 19th century after the Bible, should be required reading for every American schoolchild. Written as a response to the fugitive slave law, the book brought the institution of slavery into the parlors of the Northern reading public. The book is critical not only of the Southern institution of slavery but also, surprisingly, of Northern racism. Only the Quakers are treated favorably due to their commitment to help their fellow man when he is in need, regardless of laws to the contrary. The strong Christian orientation of the book will seem strange to many today, but it is important to understanding the reality of American culture in the 19th century.
