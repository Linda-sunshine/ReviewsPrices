review/summary: Gave it a Chancereview/text: I tried reading this book, but I couldn't stay hooked on it. I couldn't tell if the plot lagged or if it sped up as I could not figure out when or if the adventure was going to start. The characters were hardly relatable. An easy read for kids, but I just couldn't keep with the story.
