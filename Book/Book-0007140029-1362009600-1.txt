review/summary: Best book Ever!review/text: When I first picked up this book, I had some doubts about it. I'm not a type of person who likes much fighting in books. but when I started reading this book, i could not set it down. I quickly read the next book, and the next... until I had bought all the books in the first series.The warrior series are about cats who live in the wild. And the main charterer is a house cat(or kitty-pet), named Rusty, who dreams of hunting in the forest. After he has the dreams, he decides to go into the forest to explore.There he meets the Warrior cats, who invite him to join their clan, ThunderClan. There he finds his dreams were from StarClan, the Clans' warrior Ancestors. When he enters, he is given the name Firepaw, because the ThunderClan leader, Bluestar, was given a prophecy, that 'Fire, will save the Clan. Erins, keep up the good work.
