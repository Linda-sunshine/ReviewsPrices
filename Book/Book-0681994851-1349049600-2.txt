review/summary: Facts of Lifereview/text: I enjoyed picking up Jane Eyre to pass the time while traveling. Charlotte was very detailed in her description of Jane's life. It is a slowly evolving saga which reminds me of the kinds of things that still go on in life today. It was good and am glad to be able to move on to another!
