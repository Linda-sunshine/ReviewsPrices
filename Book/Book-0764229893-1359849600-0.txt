review/summary: Hallelujah!review/text: This was the first in the series, and i was &#34;hooked&#34; until I finished book#5. Amazing Bible based fiction. I was so encouraged when I saw the characters &#34;come to life&#34; with Ms. Autens' literary skills. Recommend all five as a very good read and study.
