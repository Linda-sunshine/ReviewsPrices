review/summary: Get to the point.review/text: It was nice learning the 5 S's. even though many already know these, seeing them put into an order was nice. However, I expected to learn something I didn't already know or couldn't google for free. This book didn't offer that. Besides the fact I had to skip a bunch of pages to get to the 'how to' and came to find out there's only one main 'how to' and no other options for different styles or personalities. At least it keeps me from investing in a three hour $75 class on the same subject. I do appreciate it being on Kindle so that I can grab my iPad easily if I need to reshare with husband or caregivers.
