review/summary: The Most Dangerous Book in the Worldreview/text: Narratively speaking, it's no more than an average story. In fact, there are many plot gaps and false steps. But the implications itself are staggering. Somewhere along the way, this book becomes less science fiction and more science fact. Orwell accurately predicts the advent of things like "perpetual wars" -- not for the sake of winning, but for the sake of warring for profit, and "doublespeak," or, as we refer to it now, political euphemisms, or "political correctness." When our politicians sidestep an uncomfortable question by answering one that was not asked instead? that is Orwellian. Even the questioner, apparently, has forgotten what he or she just asked. And when the motive behind a question becomes the question itself, supplanting the original, that too is Orwellian. The removal of certain words from the english language to cover up crimes? It's Orwellian, and comes straight out of 1984 -- as when torture suddenly becomes "harsh interrogation techniques." And it is happening more and more; more, perhaps than we'd like to admit. For the good of more, the less are squashed, and the president mangles his principles. There are many people today who believe wholly in a past which in fact never actually existed -- unless it was on shows life Leave it to Beaver and Father knows Best.
