review/summary: Blah Blah Gossip, Blah Blah Dancingreview/text: The Bennet sisters Elizabeth and Jane are of age to court and find a spouse. Elizabeth find one person in particular that she will never court, Fitzwilliam Darcy, or will his charming ways find their way into her heart.This book is suppose to be humorous. I did not find anything funny or remotely interesting, well until Darcy came along. In all truthness I can not see how this book has gotten so many other books based on the characters of Darcy and Elizabeth. I don't get it. I wish I did. I wanted to like this so much more than I did. All I could see the book is about is dancing and gossip. It reminds me of a older version of Seinfeld because it was about nothing. I did not give diddly squat about anybody in this book. Yes it is written pretty and well done but I had no connection to the people.You are probably wondering why I would give any stars if I dislike it so much but the truth is certain moments caught my attention and as I said it is written pretty. I only thought it to be okay maybe a little less than that.
