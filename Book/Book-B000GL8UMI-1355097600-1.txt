review/summary: Very Hotreview/text: This is a futuristic novel in which history of the past as contained in books is forbidden. Into this scene develops a convert from a man who was part of the team that burned discovered hoards of books to one who wanted to protect them for their beauty of ideas and important lessons contained within them. It is a story about an inner struggle and an outward struggle to survive.The ending is weak but in it there is some optimism.
