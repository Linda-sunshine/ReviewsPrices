review/summary: The times and trials of Huck Finn.review/text: This book has been reviewed to death: I will only echo Hemingway's criticism that the final few chapters of the story are a bit disappointing. Other than this, it is a wonderful depiction of life in the 1830's Mississippi. A great read!
