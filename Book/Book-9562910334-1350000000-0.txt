review/summary: One of Those Books Everyone Should Readreview/text: There are undoubtedly a lot of great books out there but there's a selective few that I would consider a must read, and 1984 is one of them. Is it really that good? My personal opinion is that there are better books out there in its genre, but none have had the impact 1984 has had. 1984 is a reminder of the things that we take for granted everyday, It's about one mans struggle to keep what he values most, his free thought.I've read this book once, looking to give it a second read. It's hard for me to pick it up again because the feeling you get from reading 1984 is not exactly a great one, it's depressing. Which is why I prefer reading Vonnegut.Regardless, 1984 is one of those books we should all read at least once.
