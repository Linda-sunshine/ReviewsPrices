review/summary: Great Story Behind the Storyreview/text: I first read this book almost forty years ago and was truly entertained but a lot has happened since then and on my second reading I found it just ok. Don't ask me what changed my mind. Life has a way of taking the shine off of most of everything. One of the most interesting parts of the book is its history. The author's mother found the manuscript after he had died and she began a relentless search until she found a publisher. Mother's love.
