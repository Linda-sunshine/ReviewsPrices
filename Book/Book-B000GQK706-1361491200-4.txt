review/summary: The Gold Standard of Fantasy Booksreview/text: I've read Lord of the Rings about 7-8 times in the past, but now read it in English the first time. It's still as good as ever, and can be read again and again - it's like meeting an old friend after a couple of years. The background invented by Tolkien for this book really shows in all the small details, and it feels like you're actually reading a true story from alternate reality, not just fairy tales. Several fantasy authors have tried to match Tolkien, but in my opinion most fall short of LoTR. Great story, excellent writing, and wonderful world makes it one of my all time favorites in all literature.
