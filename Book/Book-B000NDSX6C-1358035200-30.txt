review/summary: Kindle edition has very poor mapsreview/text: Plenty of other people have commented on the comforting joy that is The Hobbit. Reading this book was like a cherished homecoming to me. I saw the movie Monday, downloaded the book on Tuesday and I've finished it on Sunday.My comments are about the Kindle edition. All in all it is not bad - it contains the line-drawing illustrations through the book, which is lovely. But the maps are disappointing. The map of the Wilderlands is at the back (fine in a paper book but awkward in a Kindle) and I completely missed Thror's map at the front - for some reason when I downloaded this book it started me out in the Author's Notes section, so I didn't see the cover, table of contents, or map until after I finished and went looking for it. Maybe this was just a glitch on my Kindle but watch out for it.Both maps, sadly, are almost impossible to read on a small Kindle (can't comment on how they'd look on a Kindle Fire etc). You can't see any of the detail and you can hardly read most of the words. It's not like you can't follow the story without the maps, but part of the joy of Tolkien is poring of his maps.I would give the book itself 5 stars, but the Kindle edition gets 4. It is one of those classic books that you really must own in good old-fashioned paper form, and I have a copy of my own at home. Only buy the Kindle edition if, like me, you're on the road when you have a hankering to read it again.
