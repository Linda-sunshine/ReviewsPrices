review/summary: An Auschwitz Fantasyreview/text: With a decades-long legacy of being used to torture schoolchildren, Night is indeed a pillar of modern establishment culture. It remains to determine what kind of a pillar it is.The official holocaust story claims that Jews were exterminated in gas chambers, but according to Night the Germans used giant flaming pits to exterminate the Jews, who willingly marched into said pits when the Germans told them to. Wiesel does not mention gas chambers at all. In reality, giant flaming pits wouldn't work as a method of extermination. A fire hot enough to cremate people is much too hot to approach. The Germans would have needed a catapult to throw people onto the fire, which isn't part of Wiesel's story. The coup de grace is the collection of aerial photos of Auschwitz taken by allied planes in 1944. These photos show little or no smoke, and in particular no giant flaming pits for exterminating thousands of people.Wiesel has a history of fabrication. For instance, he famously told a story about reading the Critique of Pure Reason in Yiddish just after being liberated - but the Critique of Pure Reason had not been translated into Yiddish. The only reason Night is famous is that it is presumed to be true, or at least closely based on a true story. In fact, it is only a sea of fabrications. As pure literature it is embarrassingly bad. Avoid.
