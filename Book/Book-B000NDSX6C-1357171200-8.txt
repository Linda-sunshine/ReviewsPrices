review/summary: Worth a rereadreview/text: I read The Hobbit many years ago and this was my third or fourth reread. Before seeing the new Hobbit films, I wanted to read it again. The book is always better than the movie and I had forgotten a lot. It is a great story with a lot of moral content -- though not in-your-face.
