review/summary: The Hobbit electronic versionreview/text: I liked the story and I am sorry that I had not read this book prior to my reading of The Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is the "prequel" to The Lord of the Rings and surely fills in a lot of background information that is missed in the Lord of the Rings.My only concern about the electronic version of The Hobbit is relative to the illustrations that were dutifully included. When I looked at some of the illustrations, they were originally printed in the hard copy so that they could be viewed from the side instead of up and down. Try looking at the illustrations from the side while using the Kindle or another similar device that always keeps the page right side up. On the plus side, the electronic version is very quick to read. I bought the book one day and finished it the next.Thank you, I enjoyed the book.
