review/summary: classicreview/text: I've known the title for a while and with the recent death of the author decided to finally read the book; very glad I did. "Fahrenheit 451" explores a society without books - hard for me to imagine so I'm grateful that Bradbury did. On display is a war torn society where massive wall sized televisions take the place of reading and in-depth human engagement. A society populated with a disempowered citizenry, some unwilling to think for themselves, others unable not to. For me, the book is, at its core, a tale of resistance; demonstrated by Montag's instinctive urges to find out more about the history of book burning and the subsequent actions he undertakes to change things. If resistance is at the core, a collective unconsciousness and apathy are the rings that contain it. Throughout the novel Bradbury contends that the state of affairs is not something that was forced upon the people by a Big Brother apparatus; the people simply allowed it happen. They didn't put up much of a fight at all, being too distracted by the pursuit of happiness to realize the erosion of freedom. Collective memory and its importance in sustaining a viable future plays a large role in the novel and reinforces the notion that what we don't remember we're bound to repeat."Fahrenheit 451" is a superb read; its classic status solid. I'm not sure if it remains on many high schools' reading lists but this is one that stands the test of time. Engaging, well written and aptly imagined; highly recommended!
