review/summary: More relevant today then ever.review/text: Ayn Rand might well have been writing about the political climate of today. The notion that the wealthy &#34;owes&#34; something to the under achievers of society. That the ultimate objective is that no one person should have more than any other and laws should be in place to reach those goals. Even to the destruction of the machinery that keeps society functioning. It is the same message we hear today. It is an eye opener and shocking when you realize it was written in 1957Some of the passages are long winded and I could not imagine anyone speaking as such but it is a work of fiction....or was...On page 262 one of the industrial elites who is tormented at the lack of humility by one of the giants of the steel industries, shouts, &#34;he didn't invent smelting and chemistry!...He couldn't have invented his metal but for the thousands of other people......everybody uses the work of everybody else....He didn't do it for any noble purpose, he did it just for his own profit!...Sounds a lot like our leader's rant to the business about &#34;You didn't build that&#34;.Still sounds foolish.This work is unnerving in the current political climate. I think it is a must read. There is a pretty good poke at spiritual beliefs toward the end of the book. If you read the book you will be moved. At least I was.
