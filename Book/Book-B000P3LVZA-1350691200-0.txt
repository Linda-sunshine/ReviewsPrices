review/summary: Brave New World: Stuck In My Mindreview/text: I read this book when I was in high school. My cousin advised me not to read it cause it was odd and so I went in the quest to find the book. Back then, I still think what I think now, and what many critics have said, "It's ahead of its time".I admit, the book does start a little bit boring and it isn't everyone's type of read either, but I love the book. As I find myself from time to time relating daily events to the book. How people are starting to move/act more by the demands of the system can only remind me more of this story. Huxley wrote a tale that has locked itself in my mind.
