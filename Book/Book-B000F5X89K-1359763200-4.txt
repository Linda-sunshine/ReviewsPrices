review/summary: It was a Kindle Fire lesson...review/text: When my daughter gave me a Kindle Fire, she spent the day helping me learn how to use it. Since this was a free book, we got it and practised on it.I'm sure I would have liked it, had I not already read the book years ago, seen the movie, another version of the movie and on and on.
