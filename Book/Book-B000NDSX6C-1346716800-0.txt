review/summary: Surprisingly Completereview/text: The most impressive thing about this graphic novel version of The Hobbit is how true to the original source material it is. A person finishing this book will have a very strong understanding of exactly what happened in the novel. I agree with other people that this would be a great way for a 7 year old to be introduced to the story.The only thing I would want to change about it is its size. It feels just a tad too small to comfortably fit all the text and panels that it crams into each of its pages. I also feel like the color palette is a bit too bright and cheery throughout. I think the whole thing would have felt more true to the spirit of the book if the saturation levels were pulled back a bit. It might even benefit from being printed on matte paper stock. As it is, the glossy paper and bright colors just don't feel quite right.
