review/summary: Disappointing Waste of Ink.review/text: Save yourself some time: skip to the last sentence of this review. There were always problems with the Reacher stories. I thought this one was new, and wanted to see if there had been some sort of improvement in Child's basic writing skills set, but no. Same old same old. Or that's what I thought till I realized I had already read it, long ago. Given that recognition, the clumsiness of the characterizations, the fantastic contrivance of plots, and the slavish devotion to vigilante themes were like former friends that we outgrew as adolescents. If there was some slightest shred of plausibility I missed it. Initially (when I finished reading it on Kindle) I gave it two starts because one way or another I did finish it. Then I realized that I finished it because I just couldn't believe there was any rational explanation for the plots, and it turns out there wasn't. I wouldn't have expected the depiction of the FBI to bear much relationship to reality (although anybody could do 5 minutes' research and do a better job) but Child's depiction of the Army, and of military matters, is so far removed from reality that it is a joke. These are vigilante fantasy stories that will appeal to the few who can suspend enough disbelief. I cannot recommend this book, and if I had paid for it (I got it through a library loan) I would be asking for a refund.
