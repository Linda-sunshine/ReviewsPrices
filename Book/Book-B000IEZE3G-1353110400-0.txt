review/summary: Give me a break with pottermorereview/text: I guess that the 20 minutes it takes and the separate pottermore account that needs to be created would only be tolerated because it is Harry Potter after all. One cannot really blame Amazon though since it seems to be some type of Torture inspired by Sony.
