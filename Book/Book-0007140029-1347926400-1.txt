review/summary: Warriors are the best books for middle schoolersreview/text: In my opinion, warrior series are a must read fot the middle school age. I love them as well as my sister does. We started this little trend at school. Everyone reading them! Erin, the details are so amazing that I melted into the story. Now I do warrior cat roleplay on this site called catspawislnd. I love thees books so much I made my own book (Using my own characters of course). Anyway, if you havnt rea theese books, Please do! You have no idea how much fun and suspense your missing! What are you witing for? Start reading!
