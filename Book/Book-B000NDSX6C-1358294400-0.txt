review/summary: Fine, but... (may contain a slight spoiler)review/text: I bought this book following my watching the similar named movie.The story line itself is quite interesting with lots of twists and turns and gives a good overall adventure to read. However at the end of certain chapters it refers to the ending of the next chapter, spoiling as it is the story a bit and you already know what is going to happen. Also I found the reading of the story quite tiresome. I can't really put it into words but I couldn&#8217;t read for long at a time before I had to stop for a pause.However if anyone wants to know what happens (more or less) instead of waiting for the next movies to come out&#8230; buy and read ahead.To summarise:Good:- Interesting story- Nice twists- Keeps the main characters centralBad:- Spoils the next chapter before it even begins (for ex &#8220;well you know that he found the way out, but that is for the next chapter)- Tiresome to read
