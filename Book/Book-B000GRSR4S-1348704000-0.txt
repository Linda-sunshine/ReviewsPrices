review/summary: Superbreview/text: On the service/product: This worked out great, no spelling errors or any such mishaps. The product was delivered to my kindle shortly after me ordering it and it worked out beautifully.On the story: This book was marvelous. It was comparable to Hitchhiker's Guide in style, but it had a much more mature message. Intended for mature, intelligent, and active readers, as its got some very confusing structural bits that can be tricky to understand if you aren't very savvy with such things. It might help to read it with a friend or two. I had a teacher and classmates that helped me understand some parts. It was a very sad book about Billy Pilgrim's adventures through time in the WWII bombing of Dresden and his intermittent adventures to Tralfamadore. Enjoy the read, not often do you get a book full to the brim with medicine that tastes this sweet.
