review/summary: The Five Love Languages by Gary Chapmanreview/text: My wife and I use this material for a marriage class at our church. It is such a simple concept that can make a huge difference in understanding other people and why they react like they do. And also why you do what you do and feel so let down sometimes when your spouse has done something nice but you don't receive it as love. A must for every couple, no matter the length of marriage!
