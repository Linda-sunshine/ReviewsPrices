review/summary: A timeless storyreview/text: This story was made even more real when I visited the East Tenement Museum in Manhattan. To go through the rooms, to see how closely people lived, to have a picture in my mind where the baby slept so she could have fresh air......all the descriptions in the book came alive. What a wonderful story of the human spirit, the strength of character and the tenacity and grit to persevere through extremely physical and emotional times. How would we measure up today? Worth a discussion!
