review/summary: Boys like to play with boys; men like womenreview/text: So what are you getting? A man who has to be handled and manipulated, just so you can be treated decently. The author of the Bitches book derides women who give too much, but then spends the entire book telling women what they have to do, how they have to talk, how they have to think, and who they have to become in order to hook their so-called man. In the end, the woman is jumping through as many hoops as before, plus she has to wear the pants because otherwise he'll get bored and won't have any respect for her.I prefer men who are attracted to real women, not pseudo-men. If I have to think like a man, talk like a man, act like a man, and be the man, what do I need him for? I have a vibrator for that. And while we're on the subject, what does he need ME for? Shouldn't he just admit that he'd be happier with a man?I won't wear the pants for any man. If he can't appreciate a feminine woman so that I have to protect myself from his immaturity and ineptitude, he'll find I'll wear the pants one time--in order to throw his sorry butt out the door so he can go back to playing with the other little boys.
