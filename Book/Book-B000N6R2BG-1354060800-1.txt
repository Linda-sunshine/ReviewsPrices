review/summary: Great characters, fast moving, couldn't put it down. Intrigued by the whole idea of stigmata, especially experienced by a childreview/text: Five stars because I couldn't put it down. Appreciated the character's religious beliefs thrown into the plot. Also appreciated the character's flaws and the way these flaws were woven into the plot. Good questions about faith and organized religion.
