review/summary: Didn't exactly live up to the hype - unfortunatelyreview/text: I really loved the writer's style and his wry sense of humor- and it was an enjoyable story. I just felt it was a little too vague and disjointed and left me feeling just mildly irritated that there was no cohesive explanation or ending - and yet ashamed to admit it because this book is a &#34;Classic&#34; and my admittance that I didn't really care for it will just be viewed as my admiitance to being too dense or not sensitive enough to the subtle nuances of blah blah blah. It didn't really move me. I just spent the entire book trying to determine whether Billy Pilgrim was actually time traveling or insane.
