review/summary: Repetitive Text and Tips Didn't Pan Outreview/text: This book probably could have been much shorter (a pamphlet even) as it states a theory and then repeats it every few pages throughout the duration. Further it provides details on cultural myths and either debunks or supports them if they align with Karp's theory. To a parent looking for tips this delve into anthropology is unnecessary.Fast forward to the wee hours of the morning. I employ all of Karp's methods - swaddle, jiggle, hold sideways, shush, and suck. They don't work. I was stuck with a screaming banshee for hours off and on while I kept trying to employ the methods. According to Karp, if they don't work you aren't doing them correctly. Ok. Whatever.1) Swaddle - I regularly swaddled baby before reading this book. Nothing new.2) Jiggle - Did that too and I think most people instinctively do.3) Hold sideways - This seems to set my baby off. She quiets for a millisecond and then howls louder. I've tried different angles and end up just sticking with her back which she clearly prefers.4) Shush - Again no dice. Baby is not a fan and it certainly doesn't put her to sleep.5) Suck - Until I read this book we had not introduced baby to a pacifier but we had received a few as gifts. After reading the book I used a pacifier for the first time and baby promptly spit it out that time and each time I gave it back.Given that my experiences basically reduce this book to fiction, it's ok.
