review/summary: Better than everreview/text: I am rereading the series for the fourth or fifth time. This time is a bit different though as I am reading the books to determine if they are suitable for my daughter who will be six next month. This first book is so well written and the scary parts are not as scary as I remembered. Meeting Harry, Ron and Hermione again was like stumbling upon far-flung friends. I can't wait to introduce my daughter to them soon.
