review/summary: The Complete Lord of the Rings Trilogyreview/text: Overall I like this presentation. I wasn't expecting a condensed radio version however its not bad. What I didn't like was how some of the names were pronounced i.e. Gloin was said as Glow -in. Really? Seriously? Where did anyone get that pronunciation from? Also didn't need to know all the voice actor names after every disc (since I have no idea who they are anyway). However overall its not bad for those wanting a speedy version to listen to.
