review/summary: The Count of Monte Cristoreview/text: The translated version of the Alexander Dumas classic, The Count of Monte Cristo is an engrossing novel of love, hate, revenge, and ultimate triumph. It is a surprisingly readable book, notwithstanding its length (some 1200 pages). The story weaves its characters masterfully, skillfully exposing their personalities and ambitions, creating a scenario which culminates in unexpected ways, only peripherally resembling the Hollywood movies made in its name. A very good read.
