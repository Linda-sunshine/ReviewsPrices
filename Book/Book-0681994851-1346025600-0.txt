review/summary: Girl's growth from traumareview/text: Though a classic novel, this is interesting.I like Jane's life. Though she is short, she is tough and has strong spirit. I have learned something to live from this novel and her.I want to recommend for students, especially girls under high school, to read this because all girls will grow while being strong, positive, and optimistic.
