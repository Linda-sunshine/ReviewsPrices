review/summary: The Great Little Hobbitreview/text: Though it took a bit to get into this book, once you do you are hooked. Then you can not put it down. I enjoyed this book a great deal. Well written of course. You are off on adventure and must know the end. To the very last page I loved the little Hobbit. Savoring each page of his adventures. A nice easy read.
