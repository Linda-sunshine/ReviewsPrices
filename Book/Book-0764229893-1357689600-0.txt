review/summary: Review of God's and Kingsreview/text: This is a 5 star book because the writing is excellent,very descriptive and exciting. I really was drawn to it because it is based on Biblical history. I have read about the kings but this made book it all real. I highly recommend this book to all readers but especially those who love ready the Bible and Biblical history.
