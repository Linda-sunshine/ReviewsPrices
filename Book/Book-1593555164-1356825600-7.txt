review/summary: One Shot .... and hopefully the last by Tom Cruisereview/text: I enjoyed the novel, although the plot was a little too obvious.I am also appalled by the casting of Tom Cruise as Jack in the new movie, because he does not suit the role, in either stature or character. 6'6&#34; and 250 pounds would not be my description of Tom Cruise.I believe that Hugh Jackman would have been a more appropriate choice becaue of his size and his ability to accurately portray the character who has been created and described so well by Lee Child.
