review/summary: I'm reviewing the Tim Curry Signature Audio Book. These reviews jumble the book, the audio, the everything!review/text: Be aware that these reviews all seem to be for different products. Yes, they're all A Christmas Carol, but some of them are from people who tried to read the book, and didn't like it, or got a badly formatted Kindle version, etc...What I bought, and what I want to review is the Signature Performance audio book read by Tim Curry. I already loved his work, but even if you're not familiar with him, his reading of this classic is wonderful.I admit I had a hard time for a few moments, not picturing him in a French maid's costume, or a concierge uniform, but that's my problem, not yours.This is a fantastic reading; Curry inflects every character perfectly. Thoroughly enjoyed this, and plan to listen to it every Christmas. Love it!
