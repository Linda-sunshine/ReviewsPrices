review/summary: The Notebook Reviewreview/text: All in all, The Notebook was a great love story and I would recommend it to any romantic. It's a perfect combination of love, suspense, and the will to work for what you want. It shows that true love really does exist and there is that perfect person waiting for you somewhere out there.
