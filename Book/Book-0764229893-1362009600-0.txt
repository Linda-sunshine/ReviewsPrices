review/summary: This is not a Christian book, King Hezekiah is Jewish!!!!!!!!!!!review/text: Thought this book was great. Well written, I could not stop reading.My only issue is with a lot of the other reviews that say this is a Christian book. It is not, Google King Hezekiah and learn that he is of the House of David and Jewish. For those reading that he is of the genealogy of Jesus and assuming he is Christian is forgetting that Jesus himself was Jewish.Sorry for my little rant but please know what you are reading.
