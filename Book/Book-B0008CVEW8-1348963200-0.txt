review/summary: What's not to like?review/text: This is a classic, to which all other pretenders are compared. It's all there: pirates, hidden treasure, good guys, bad guys, guys you're just not sure about. Great book for middle schoolers with strong reading skills through adults. The Kindle edition is sure handy!
