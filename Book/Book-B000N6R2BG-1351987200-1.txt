review/summary: Topics relevant for our timesreview/text: I can always count on the author,Judith Picoult,to challenge me with a thought provoking topic,incorporated into a work of fiction, relevant for our times. This book was not my favorite of Judith Picoult's many books, but it was an enjoyable read and made me think more deeply about faith vs.reason, the possibility of miracles, and how life experiences influence our relationship with a higher power(God).
