review/summary: rereading LOTR with new eyesreview/text: I had read LOTR as a child and had not reread it over the intervening decades. As children, we bring a different way of appreciating the written word because we have fewer prejudices and experiences with which to overanalyse. However, in rereading this book, I found that I was suddenly thrust back over time to my own childhood, appreciating the story as I once did, yet adding now an understanding and love of the way it is written, thrilling to the beauty of the story, and wealth of imagination and effort it took for Tolkien to write this incredible book.If you have not read the story, read it because it is such a wonderful and engrossing tale of bravery. If you have not read the book for a long time, read it again. Or better yet, read it to someone else and enjoy together the story of the brave, honourable and heroic Frodo, and the fellowship of the disparate group of heroes who battle evil with a thrilling heroism that defies the test of time.
