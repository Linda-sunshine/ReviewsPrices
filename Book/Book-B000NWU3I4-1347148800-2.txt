review/summary: A short fan's review on the ISBN: 978-0-618-96863-3 edition.review/text: The Hobbit is indeed a great book and there's no need to write a review of the author's work. However, you may find useful short (subjective) list of information on the edition with ISBN: 978-0-618-96863-3.- The paper wrapping looks perfect to me, the wrapping designed by the author is definitely something a fan must have. The picture is printed in color and a short history of its previous appearances is included in the book. What makes me little anxious is relatively fragile paper - if you want it to stay so nice, you should handle it very carefully.- Book contains two maps printed in black+blue, their paper is semi-glossy and looks resistant.- The paper of the book is appropriate, neither too thick nor too thin, it has smooth surface so it is a pleasure to read and turn the pages. The color of the paper is yellowish.- The book contains all author's illustrations that ever belonged to the title (according to the book's preface). Some of them are printed in black and white on the regular paper, some of them are included in color on the glossy white paper.I find this book to exactly match the expectations of a Tolkien fan - all in all, The Hobbit was meant to be children's book and that is how it looks and feels like.
