review/summary: This book is just plain not goodreview/text: I don't feel this is really a book but more of a manifesto. First the story is way too long. We get it capitalism is good communism is bad, you couldn't wrap it up a couple of hundred pages ago? A perfect example of this is the speech John Gault gives about three-quarters of the way through the book. He drones on and on but what he's saying doesn't add to the story at all. Also along those lines the book is so straight forward it could have ridden on the rails of Taggart Transcontinental. This company failed, this train line broke, and this person ran away. Where are the twists and turns? Where is something I couldn't roll my eyes at? Finally the characters are SO absolute that they're not realistic. On the bad guy side there are the law makers who have no idea what they are doing but are never opposed. Are there no elections in this new America? The "good" guys remind me of Scrooge. They show no charity or emotion to man and I fully expected them to say that people should hurry up and die to decrease the excess population.
