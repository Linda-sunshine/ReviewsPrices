review/summary: James A.review/text: After 40 pages, I stopped the misery of reading the works of an idiot. C.S. Lewis has never read the Bible. Jesus said in John 14:12 "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father."The words of Jesus are falsifiable. He said if you believed in him, you could do greater works than he did. Well, Jesus allegedly walked on water; multiplied loaves and fishes; cured leprosy and blindness,and raised people from the dead. Now, can you believers do those things and do even greater things as Jesus said in John? No you can't. Therefore, the Bible and the words of Jesus can be tested, and Jesus was either a lunatic or a liar. Prove it to yourself. Remember, without the Bible, there is no Christianity. The Bible is fraught with errors, contradictions, impossibilities, misquotes and lies.Jesus lied when he said he would return while some of his audience were still alive. Another lie!Additionally, C.S. Lewis writes 700-800 word paragraphs. The guy is no Shakespeare, but he couldn't pass high School English.Fortunately, I didn't buy the book. It was given to me by a friend who is grasping for something that lies only in the imagination of religious hucksters, pimps and sky-jockeys. Don't buy this book, give your money to help the disabled, poor and sick.
