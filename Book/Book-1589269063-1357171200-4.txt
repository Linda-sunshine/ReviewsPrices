review/summary: Would have been helpful when marriedreview/text: This was a very informative read. I was married 21 years and then experienced an unwanted divorce from infidelity. I realize it takes two to make a marriage work and two to breakdown a marriage. If I had had this information while being married it certainly would have helped in understanding the dynamics of what a positive marriage comes from. In that way maybe I could have saved myself and children the pain of a broken home. This would be a wonderful book to give as a wedding gift. I think I will make a mental note to remember to wrap one up with upcoming wedding invitations in my future!!!
