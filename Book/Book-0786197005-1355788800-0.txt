review/summary: Prelude to Disney's John Carterreview/text: If you were a fan of the Disney movie John Carter, then you will love this book, since it is the book the movie was based on. I have no idea why Disney changed the name.... probably because their version is only a pale shadow. As in most cases the book is a million times better and I highly recommend it.
