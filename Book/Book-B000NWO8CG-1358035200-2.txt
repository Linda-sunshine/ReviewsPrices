review/summary: FRANCIE IS REALreview/text: FRANCIE IS REALI first read this book when I was ten. I didn't understand a lot of it but I liked it even then. Reading the book again, I'm now 75, was so comforting. I now understood everything. A &#34;Tree&#34; is historical,and socially revealing. It reads like real life. It didn't seem like a novel, but a young girl's diary--Not unlike Anne Frank.
