review/summary: Another classic I needed to read!review/text: Having seen several versions of this story done in film, I wanted to know the original by the author, Jane Austen, so purchased this for my Kindle. I was pleased to see that most of the films did follow this book but also to read the details that are often left out of time-constrained movie productions. I've done this with several films that I liked and knew were based on books. As much as people seem to be in a digital world of films, books are still the best way to fully know a story.
