review/summary: Great book, just not before a flight...review/text: My fianc&eacute; wanted to get into reading again and I have always remembered this book from school. I bought this book and convinced her to take it with her on a trip out of state. After I dropped her off at the airport she called me and told me I was a jerk for giving her the book before she got on a plane. Then it dawned on me that if you read the book description the whole story is based around a plane crash..Bottom line, this is a great book and easy to read. I just really don't recommend giving this to a loved one before a long flight...
