review/summary: Still a great bookreview/text: I first read this book about 25 years ago, it was great then and still great now. The excesses of the 20's have greater resonance now than they did in the 1980's. Back then the lives portrayed seemed fantastical but it seems that history has just repeated itself, exuberance followed by bust.
