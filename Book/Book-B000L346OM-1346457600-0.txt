review/summary: Existential Philosophy From a Concentration Camp Survivorreview/text: I had to read the first half of this book for a college class ("Great Human Questions"), but I continued the book to its end because I was amazed by Frankl's life, thoughts, and insights. Although a psychiatrist, much of his method of helping patients came from existential philosophy rather than abstract psychological theories.The first half of the book details how he came to write the book through witnessing events in various Nazi concentration camps, and how he felt he survived when others didn't because he had found a reason for living while others had given up. The second half of the book discusses and tries to explain his theory of logotherapy, which I am still not sure I understand.Man's Search for Meaning is probably a book I will read over and over again throughout my life.
