review/summary: Alice in Wonderland Reviewreview/text: I gave this book a 3/5 rating strictly on the story alone--the STORY was magical, funny, childlike, and familiar. The writing, however, was dreadful, and Alice was perfectly idiotic! I put my book down at least three times a chapter simply to shake me head in embarrassment for poor, stupid Alice! I enjoyed reading the STORY, as it is a classic, though I cannot fathom how it got that title! If I had simply heard the story, this would be a 5/5 rating--but, no, I had to go through hearing about how Alice is somebody else, while, the entire time, she is simply Alice!
