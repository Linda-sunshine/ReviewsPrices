review/summary: A classic well worth readingreview/text: This is a great story well told. I often hear people say that this is the greatest novel ever written. Although I like the book, I think that is taking it a bit far. My suspicion is that it was quite unique when it was first published, and that the style has been copied so many times it now seems more ordinary. The only thing I don't like is that the language in parts is so &#34;flowery&#34; that it risks distracting from the story itself, but surely this is a matter of taste. Probably, it now finds its most enthusiastic audience among aspiring writers who want to learn how to spin a great story, and people with general literary interests, but I think most people will find it capturing.
