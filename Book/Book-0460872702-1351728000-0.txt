review/summary: Winston Wolff (Gitwin)review/text: May I throw a pebble into the pool? The Great Gatsby is widely regarded as a great novel and has been widely acclaimed as such, but having read through it twice I cannot agree. I am merely a well read person and lay no claims as to literary erudition but this book did not live up to my expectations. I found the writing very adjectival with constant use of metaphors, some of which seemed trite and effeminate. In addition the story moves at a slow pace, particularly in the first half of the book where there is much description and virtually no action. Obviously Fitzgerald depicts the period of the early twenties with prohibition allowing quick acquisition of wealth, but the fact that Gatsby returned from military service penniless and alone makes his construction of such a huge fortune in a few years seem unbelievable, even in that era. Gatsby is the least believable character in this whole novel. For much of the time he is a shadowy figure moping around in his infatuation with a woman he was parted from for five years. His behaviour verges on that of a love-sick teenager rather than a war hero. Of course the book depicts the decadence of the wealthy during that period superbly and at times the prose is beautifully descriptive, but the "Great American Novel" ???
