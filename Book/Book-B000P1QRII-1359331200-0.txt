review/summary: LOVE IT!!!review/text: This is my absolute favorite book of all time. Jonas lives in a "Perfect" Society where the government controls every minute of the people's lives. They are so removed from reality that the people do not even see in Color. Each member of Society is given a job title at the age of 12. Jonas is chosen to be the new keeper of memories. He begins studying under the current keeper of memories but soon reality becomes too much for him and he has to decide if he is going to stay and receive his training, enduring the true pains of the world, or run a way to someplace real so that he does not have to endure societal structures. Such a great book, since i was 9 ive probably read this book over 50 times. Cannot wait to introduce this book to my children and my students
