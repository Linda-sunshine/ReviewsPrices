review/summary: Well written, interesting, thought-provokingreview/text: This is an unusual book, and very nicely written. It lingers long after reading, prompting much introspection. It probably merits 5 stars, but for me it wasn't quite perfect enough.The main character is an elderly, decent man that has lived a long, fairly grim, life. It is an interesting life, but, for me, his life didn't parallel real life.Generally speaking, in my experience, lives are filled with peaks and valleys, good and bad, easy and difficult, fun and not so much. This character's life is so grim, and largely depressing, that I just couldn't identify with him. I felt sorry for him, but could not really empathize.And, it was very surprising that of the 5 people in his heaven, he only knew 2 of them during his life.Still, I strongly recommend this book. It is unforgettable.
