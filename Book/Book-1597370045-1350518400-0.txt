review/summary: Great Editionreview/text: There is really no point in my leaving an extensive review about the content of the book; I will address the edition itself. The text was a little small, but very readable. The binding was tight. However, the pages are the type to yellow after a while (the paper isn't the best quality). It's still a very sturdy and well-made edition (Dover).
