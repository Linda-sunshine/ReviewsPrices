review/summary: Touching, cute Y.A. bookreview/text: The thing about Harry Potter is that kids understand him. There's no kid on the planet who, at one time or another, didn't feel like he shouldn't belong to his family, or wish that there was something special about him and that someone someday would take him away and show him a whole new world. And that's exactly what happens to Harry Potter.In addition to kids being able to identify with Harry Potter, the book's full of great, believable characters and wonderful adventures. Some of them reminded me a lot of some older Ronald Dahl books I've read. Both Rowling and Dahl are masters of explaining strange new worlds, and making us believe that they really could exist. For those of us who love weirdness, this is great.I have to say, my favorite part of this book was the end. Without giving anything away, I will say that Rowling manages to slip in some great lessons and some touching, tear-jerking moments. Not sure I would have cried over the same parts when I was young, but now that I'm old, I understand why some of those touching moments are so poignant.Not just for kids, and a great read all around.
