review/summary: A very nice hardcover set.review/text: It might be one of the cheapest hardcover sets, but the books look great and I'd definitely recommend this set to anyone who doesn't yet have this trilogy. The books themselves have a nice brown hardcover with gold foil on the binding and on the cover. Also each book has it's own fold out map.
