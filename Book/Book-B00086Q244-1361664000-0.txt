review/summary: The Last Book You Will Need to Changereview/text: I am a Cadet in the United States Air Force Academy and I purchased this book because it was recommended to me by a fellow Cadet who also is aspiring to commission as the best leader possible. At first I was skeptical but once I read Carnegie's thoughts and advice, I truly believe I changed as a person. I'm not saying that the change is instantaneous or will happen in a week but this gradual process helped me understand what I could do to improve my character through effective communication.
