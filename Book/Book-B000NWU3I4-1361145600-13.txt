review/summary: Best story ever!`review/text: This is one of my favorite books. The story is an epic journey, an adventure, which Hobbits notoriously abhor. But Bilbo is a very special Hobbit who proves his worth to his Dwarf companions, by rescuing them several times over. A classic tales with wizards, goblins, dwarfs, elves, and dragons. This is the book that put fantasy on the map, against which all fantasy books are measured. And most of them don't measure up.
