review/summary: really good informationreview/text: This book really made sense to me and I enjoyed reading about each love language and figuring out which one I was and which one my husband was. It is great information to have, but it doesn't mean it is magically easy to apply to your life- but a great start! I think everyone- married or not- should read this! Why don't they teach THIS stuff in school?!?
