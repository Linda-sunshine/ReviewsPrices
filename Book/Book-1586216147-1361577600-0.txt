review/summary: Beautiful love storyreview/text: This story touches my heart. My Grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and it is very painful for the person as well as loved ones to go through. A nurse now myself, I see people's own version of this story play out everyday. Husbands sitting at the bedside of the love of their life, who has no idea who they even are. The patience these men have is amazing and I can only hope that one day,if Alzheimer's or dementia hits me I have my husband at my side. For better or worse
