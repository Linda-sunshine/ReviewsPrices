review/summary: Better now than everreview/text: I have always enjoyed this book ... I read it when I was younger ... but now that I own a business with 35 employees and am rereading the book, it means a lot more to me than ever before. I find myself nodding my head in agreement almost every paragraph even on small, subtle details. I read 2 - 3 pages everyday I am at work!
