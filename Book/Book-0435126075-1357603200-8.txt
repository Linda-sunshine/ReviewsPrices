review/summary: Classic for All Ages!review/text: I've read this story in hard cover a couple of times, so when I got my Kindle and saw that there was a free version for download, I downloaded it. I downloaded it so that my daughter could read it. My family has the DVD set of Pride and Prejudice Istarring Colin Firth) and they love it, so I wanted my daughter to enjoy the written version. She did! As I said, this is a classic tale for all ages and I highly recommend it.
