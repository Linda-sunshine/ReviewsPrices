review/summary: My childhood in shortreview/text: Get it. Just get it. I picked this book up for an English literature project in Middle School, and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Tolkien superbly writes this novel, weaving a fantasy universe that have wasted countless hours of my time on wikipedia. Although it was written in a more lighthearted manner than the Lord of the Ring Series, also by Tolkien, it does not lessen at all the fantastic storytelling of the book.In short, a hobbit (an imaginary creature that resembles people, just half their size), named Bilbo Baggins, is whisked away on an adventure, along with a band of courageous dwarves, and a wizard, in order to reclaim the dwarves lost treasure that was stolen by a dragon named Smaug. It sounds like a story to start your typical Dungeons and Dragons encounter, but trust me that it will be much more than that. I couldn't put the book down after I picked it up, I think that I had finished it in about two days. If you've already seen the movie, don't worry, there is much storyline that the movie didn't recount. Besides, you can boast to your friends after reading this that you know how the Hobbit movies will end.
