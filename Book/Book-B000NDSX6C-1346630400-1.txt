review/summary: Excellent Fantasy Book adept for both the veteran and the novice reader.review/text: This excellent pillar of the fantasy genre is compelling to the bone. The adventure Bilbo embarks is one to envy. The most outstanding detail about Tolkien's "The Hobbit" is the books natural flow, as it simply carries you along as you slowly and cheerfully deepen into the quest. One of my favorite characters is by far, Beorn. Sadly, if you haven't read Tolkien's "The Hobbit", I shan't be able to tell you more about him than he is a fascinating character. Enjoy.
