review/summary: Wuthering Heightsreview/text: I realize this is a classic. I just didn't enjoy reading it. The basic story was good, the characters complex but most were not likeable. The moors where it took place were so isolated, there wasn't much interaction with any others except at W. H. and at the Grange. I felt everyone was mentally afflicted in one way or another. The ending was suppose to be a happy marriage but it didn't seem joyful, just thank goodness the story ended. This was over many years proclaimed as the greatest romantic novel, the love was too painful for me to be appreciated.
