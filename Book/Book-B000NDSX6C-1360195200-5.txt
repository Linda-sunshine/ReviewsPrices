review/summary: This is one of my favoritesreview/text: This book is one of my absolutely favorite books ever written! Bilbo is a fantastic character and Thorin is a great one to. I love this book so much, I've read it and the rest of the lord of the rings series three or four times! In this book you'll find adventure, danger, wisdom, some laughs, and a great and enjoyable read that I am sure not only you, but you're kids as well will love! And I will give one small hint about another favorite character of mine. Gandalf is not what Bilbo thinks he is at first ;) Enjoy this marvelous book and I hope you read the ones following after it.
