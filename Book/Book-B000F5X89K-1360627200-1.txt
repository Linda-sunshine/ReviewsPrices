review/summary: A classicreview/text: Once I used to the stilted language (apparently typical for the time - &#34;Dracula&#34; was written almost identically) this became a gripping tale. If the author had reduced the narrative about the characters' feelings about the natural features around them near the end of the book, by which time I'd more than enough, I would rate it five stars.
