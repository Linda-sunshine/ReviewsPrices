review/summary: Imaginativereview/text: I was intrigued by the movie &#34;John Carter&#34; and decided to read all these books, since they were free on my Kindle. I found the first 2 -3 very imaginative and adventurous but then they kind of lost their edge after that. Also got tired because there is very little &#34;down time&#34; and mostly action.... not that action is bad, its just nice to get more background and culture and description in there as well. But if you are into Sci-Fi its a must read!
