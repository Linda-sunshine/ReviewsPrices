review/summary: Great bookreview/text: Overall, this was a great book, I would most definitely recommend this if you are a fan of classic books and fairy tales. Not only is this book great but it was free! I would have given this five stars just the thing that puts me down on this is that you have to pay for narration on the whole book. I am a good reader but i really enjoy when somebody else is reading it to me:)
