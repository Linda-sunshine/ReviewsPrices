review/summary: Very interesting first half of the bookreview/text: I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the book. The stories within the concentration camp held my interest....to the point of not wanting to put the book down. Then, the second half of the book related to pscyhology and left me a little flat. Seemed a bit repetativie and didn't hold my interest as much as the first half of the book. I would still recommend the book...as the first half was written very well and was enlightning.
