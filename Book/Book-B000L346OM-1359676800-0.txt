review/summary: Amazing and Thoughtprovokingreview/text: Frankl was a well respected scientist making great strides in psychology and neurology when, in 1942 he was taken to Auschwitz. He spent the next three years being moved around four concentration camps. During that time he studied himself and his fellow prisoners, looking at the factors that helped people survive such brutal conditions. He was already advocating a practice of logotherapy; people need to feel a purpose to their lives in order to overcome grief, guilt, and death. Through this lens he writes about his imprisonment and the importance of finding meaning to get through the experience.Frankl asserts that people can find meaning in three places; through some great work or achievement, in the love they hold for another person, and through suffering for a purpose. The first half of his book narrates his experiences in the concentration camps, while the second half details his his work and advocation of logotherapy as a &#34;humanized psychotherapy.&#34; I found both parts of the book to be intriguing.
