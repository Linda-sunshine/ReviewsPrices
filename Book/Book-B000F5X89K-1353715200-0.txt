review/summary: Fast delivery, inexpensivereview/text: I love the Dover Thrift editions for any book!! This was no exception. Great value, great book in print. THe pages, like all Dover books, are thin and of poor quality- kind of like the SAT books, but you get what you pay for, and all you want is the actual text itself anyway.
