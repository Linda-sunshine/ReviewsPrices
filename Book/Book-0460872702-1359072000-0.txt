review/summary: A perfect novelreview/text: I have read reviews in which people said they didn't care enough about the story. I, however, found it enthralling from start to finish. Fitzgerald has a gift for writing. He really does. Nick Carraway, the first person narrator, describes his surroundings so well that you immediately have a picture of what's going on. The story builds up and develops characters, and keeps the strong characterization completely through the novel. There are a number of quotes from this classic that are very well-known, but reading the entire novel is better than that. This novel is magnificently written.
