review/summary: As good as I remember.review/text: Thank goodness the book (still better than the movie) is as good as I remeber, The only reason I gave it 4 was shipping by the seller was slow.I just wish they had followed the book when they made the movie. I had the first edition when it came to USA but after reading and rereading it fell apart. Need I say more
