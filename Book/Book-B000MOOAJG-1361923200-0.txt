review/summary: MUST READreview/text: I Cannot believe how quickly I read this book. I hated to put it down. At times it was jarring as the book seemed to be relating to what actually was happening in the US. And then I read the words saying people did not own or build their businesses, just as Obama said. That stopped me in my tracks fora bitPeople need to read this book and also We The Living. So very relevant to today.
