review/summary: A Reformed manreview/text: This is a really fun self help book. It explores the 5 types of needs we all have. It showed me some great ways to really connect better with my wife. I have also started using the 5 languages to see how I can improve my everyday relationships as well.I would recommend this to anyone wanting or in need of a new perspective on how people work, interact, and react to situations.
