review/summary: The Best Book I've ever Readreview/text: This book is by far THE most well written, action packed, most developed plot and character developed book EVER. And I've easily read over 100 books in the past 2 years. Trust me when i tell you, it was a relief to find a book that did not have spelling errors or typos or the wrong &#34;there/their/they're&#34;s or &#34;here/hears&#34;. This book is so enjoyable, i find myself smiling as i read the book! This book makes me feel young again. Like im listening to stories of adventures long ago around a bonfire. This book speaks to every individual reader and grabs their attention for every page of the book. I higly reccommed this book to all age groups. Young ones will like the adventures, the old will like to feel young again with the tale of Bilbo Baggins, &#34;the burglar&#34;. With an undercurrent of modest humor, the book get you to laugh at the silly things the Dwarves, and other characters do. I was also surprised to find illustrations in the book! How cool is that?! Please read this book! it is worth your time!
