review/summary: Excellent Book!review/text: Personally, I like to see the movies before I read the book. The movie and the book followed each other so closely hand in hand, that I'm glad I saw the movie first! It helped me visualize better! All I all, great read. Couldn't put this book downloading the next one as we speak! ;)
