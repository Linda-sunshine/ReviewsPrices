review/summary: The Hobbit comes to lifereview/text: I enjoyed listening to &#34;The Hobbit&#34;. It felt like I was listening to J.R.R. himself. The only objection I had was that the narrator sang the songs! I would have preferred him to read them as poetry rather than sing them. Unless Tolkien had provided the music to go with the words, I think it's better to let the reader/listener imagine the tune. Other than that, I recommend the book whole-heartedly.
