review/summary: One of my favorite booksreview/text: I own this book in paperback. I had to read it in college. I still remember the first time I read it. I sat in a chair and read it cover-to-cover. That's how good it is. It's amazing. This is one of those books you have to read in your lifetime. I'm writing this review because I saw it's a Kindle deal today for $1.99. That's awesome. Get it. Read it. It'll knock your socks off.
