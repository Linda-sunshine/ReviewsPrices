review/summary: Amazingreview/text: This is a great read very fascinating indeed. I feel that this would be a rather difficult read for the younger folk and quite possibly really confuse them because it switches for talking in first person to an all knowing third person without warning. Also jumps between characters without stating the change. But it is a great adventure and I would suggest it to all.
