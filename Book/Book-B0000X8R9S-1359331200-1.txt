review/summary: my 10 year old wants to read all the time nowreview/text: My 10-year-old is a straight A student, but he got really burned out from reading all the time. He is more of a math and science whiz. This year in 5th grade his language arts teacher had the class read this book. My son has been talking about it nonstop ever since and asked me to buy it for him so that we can read it together. I was thrilled and obliged to get it for him.
