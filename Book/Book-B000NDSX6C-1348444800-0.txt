review/summary: Poor edition for Amazon's own Kindle Fire HDreview/text: I do wish I could review the book separately from the edition. But you cannot so let it be known this is about the edition. For whatever reason Amazon has decided to provide this book in its' most complete form only on the iphone/ipad. The book on the iOS platform has the audio available within it. However, on Amazon's very own Kindle Fire HD that feature is not available. Kudo's to Amazon for telling you that up front but I find it really sad that Amazon does not fully support its' own platform.
