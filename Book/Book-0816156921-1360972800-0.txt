review/summary: A hard read for younger readers, but worth the effort.review/text: This is the original Dracula responsible for the whole modern-day genre. The flowery archaic language and the often tedious pace of the story may be a bit much for the younger reader interested in the contemporary vampire craze. However, Stoker's tale of the undead provides the contextual and historical background for today's vampire sagas. And its style reveals the civility of nineteenth century culture even under dire circumstances, which is lost in many of today's vampire stories. It is a classic. I have only given it three stars for the reasons I have just mentioned. But at the time it was written I'm sure it was received as a five-star thriller.
