review/summary: Couldn't finish it~review/text: The fist few chapters didn't hold my interest so I never finished the book. I'm probably what many insecure men would consider a &#34;bitch&#34; because I say what I mean and mean what I say, so it didn't &#34;divulge&#34; anything new to me. Maybe for the timid and shy, but not for us &#34;strong women&#34;! :)
