review/summary: Very human. Great book.review/text: * spoiler alert ** I am so glad that I read this book. For years the verbatim dialect intimidated me. My husband has cherished the tale for years and has always recommended it to me. I finally undertook it and was bettered by it. And, interestingly, the accents Twain put to the page added to the experience.To think that this story was banned from a number of high school reading lists is frustrating. Those who made said decisions clearly strained at a gnat and choked on twelve camels.A favorite quote of mine comes from dear Huck:"And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me, all the time, in the day, and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a floating along, talking, and singing, and laughing. But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of hisn, stead of calling me -- so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me, and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he's got now; and then I happened to look around, and see that paper.It was a close place. I took [the letter:] up, and held it in my hand. I was a trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to my self:'All right, then, I'll go to hell' -- and tore it up.It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming."
