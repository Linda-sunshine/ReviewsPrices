review/summary: Gods and Kings:Chronicles of the Kings #1review/text: This is the first book I have read from this author and I was locked in the book and could hardly wait to finish up work and get home and read. It also helped me to understand the "behind the scenes" workings of the scripture references found throughout the Old Testament in regards to King Hezekiah.I will be reading the whole series with great fever and anticipation!
