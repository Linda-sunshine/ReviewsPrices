review/summary: The compromisereview/text: I'm not one who would read these kind of books but after going through hell and high water with the man I love, I decided I wouldn't give up so easily. After reading this book, it made me realise that a man's way of communicating is so different from that of a woman's, as well as how one was brought up has an effect in it too. By reading, it has made me realise that what's said is not to hurt me but their way of pushing us to do better. It really does hurt sometimes. The book has brought a much deeper understanding in ways to communicate with ones spouse and not making them feel unappreciated. Some scenarios brought forward were like knocking on the doors to my arguments...heheAll in all, I think it is a good counselling and communication therapy read. It makes you look and try to do better and helps you to put your best forward.
