review/summary: Gripping and thought provokingreview/text: A classic noir fiction novel were the worship of material values related to physical beauty and immortality drive the ego of a young man belonging to the upper classes of the English society of the XIX century to a tragic fate after circumstances force him to confront his real self. His life takes a swift turn for the worse when he sees the awful expression of his rotten soul expressed on his own face painted in a portrait. Oscar Wilde wrote an essay intended to decry certain paramount values acclaimed by western societies. It features rich pieces of wisdom and underlying messages. Great ending
