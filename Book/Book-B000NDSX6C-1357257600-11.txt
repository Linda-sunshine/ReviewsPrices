review/summary: As wonderful on Kindle as 'book' formreview/text: I haven't read The Hobbit since 1975-ish, but I was planning to read it again before seeing the movie. This turned out otherwise, but I was happy, happy, happy to rediscover the youthfulness and positive humor that is not present in the film! The whole Hobbit-y series is wonderful for 10 year olds (or earlier) to 100 year olds (or later). They are not books to be trifled with - my first reading long ago sent me to read the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda, Icelandic sagas that formed a strong base for Tolkien.
