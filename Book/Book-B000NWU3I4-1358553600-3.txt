review/summary: Love the hardcover and the box.review/text: I wanted my daughter's introduction to The Hobbit to be by book, not the movie adaptation, so I certainly did not want a book featuring still pics from the movie on the cover. I also hoped the book we would become a cherished possession so I opted for the embossed hardcover with classic illustrations.So far it has been a big hit - she has been thoroughly engrossed in it for the last two weeks. She also picked up that this book is one of the &#34;keepers&#34; not to be hauled off to Goodwill when she outgrows it.Hopefully when she is older we can share the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
