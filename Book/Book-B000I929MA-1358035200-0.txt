review/summary: If you like Orwell's 1984...review/text: This is a dystopian view of what i have to assume would be America after some cataclysmic event occurred which caused the government to disintegrate, and a new version of &#34;society&#34; was developed following very regimented roles for all people living in this undefinded region. The viewpoint of the story is based on a women who has been put in the role of Handmaiden, who's role is a broodmare for her Commander. She is the 1st generation, so there are many flashbacks to society prior to this change in the world. This is not an uplifting tale, but a very scary &#34;what could be&#34; story of a society where all liberties are removed, and as long as you follow your prescribed job, you will survive. Everyone though is aware that once you no longer do your job or deviate from societal &#34;norms&#34;, there will be a black van showing up to take you away. Very interesting read, maybe reading in the winter is not the best time for such a caustic tale. Does make one appreciate what we have now, and the liberties available to us.
