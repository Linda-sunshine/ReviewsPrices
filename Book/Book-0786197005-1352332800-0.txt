review/summary: A Classic Treasurereview/text: Edgar Rice Burroughs will always be best known as the creator of Tarzan. Though not as well known, another of his creations, John Carter of Mars, is probably as compelling a character. A Princess of Mars (1912) is the first of eleven books in Burroughs Martian series. At under two hundred pages, it's a tight, quick read with action on nearly every page. John Carter is a civil war soldier transported to Mars where he immediately finds more than a handful of trouble and action (not to mention, a beautiful princess in need of rescue). The writing is straightforward pulp at its best. Carter isn't a deeply flawed character as we might see today. He's more of the classic hero. I'm not sure if even Kryptonite could harm him, but due to the lesser gravity of Mars, he is able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Aside from this, I find it exciting how well a century-old science fiction novel can hold up, given the unprecedented technological and societal changes which have taken place in the time since its conception. That the story doesn't feel so dated as to be dismissed outright says a lot about Burroughs' skill as a writer. The Martian culture painted here is rich and true. The characters breathe. The history of the civilization is believable and well thought out. Very rarely did I find myself pulled from the reality of the tale by elements that seemed dated or unreal to a twenty-first century reader. Burroughs even envisioned a GPS (Global Positioning System) with direction-finding capabilities. He called the thing a compass, but hey, we still call those contraptions we carry around phones, even though they do three times as much as a Star Trek tricorder. This is an excellent read and if you're looking for a good old-fashioned sci-fi romp, well worth the time.
