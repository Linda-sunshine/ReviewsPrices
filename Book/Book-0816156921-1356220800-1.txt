review/summary: Horror, as it should bereview/text: This isn't a book about epic battles between legions of the undead, or shiny vampires falling in love with mortals and killing each other in gruesome fights.This is a much more chilling and genuinely fear-inspiring tale of a monster who stalks his victims and brings them down to his level, manipulating the lives of all involved. Stoker introduces us to one of the world's greatest villains, as well as the regular people who are drawn from their everyday lives and forced to take on Death itself with only the resources that they themselves can muster.A true classic that will have you biting your nails as you turn the pages in the wee hours of the morning.
