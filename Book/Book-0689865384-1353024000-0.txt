review/summary: More Dytopian pleasereview/text: I'm hooked on the whole dystopian genre. I wasn't sure about this book but ended up really liking it. Some of the wording (like littlies) annoyed me at times but I got passed it. If you're looking for your next dystopian fix after the Hunger Games and Divergent series this is a good way to go.
