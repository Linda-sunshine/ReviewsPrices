review/summary: A Big hearted bookreview/text: Such a slim book, Such an array of fanastic adventures for such a slim book. However, I dont know how the director Peter Jackson can make three movies out of it unless he lengthens the battle scenes as he did in The Triology of the Rings. I loved the language of the book and I couldn't put it down - loved the imagery.
