review/summary: Still the Finest Book I've Ever Readreview/text: All of Jane Austen's writings are exceptional but Pride and Prejudice has always been my favorite. It is so well written; full of such amazing, well-developed characters you either love or hate. The plot is so enjoyable and the humor is so well done it's fascinating! Everyone who loves to read should read this book.
