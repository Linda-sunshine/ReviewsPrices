review/summary: Incredible Seriesreview/text: In my adult years, I mainly stuck to books on self-development in my quest to improve in various aspects of my life. The Harry Potter series lured me back into reading for the pure fun of it. As I read each book in the series, I marvel at the way the evolving story-line draws so cleverly on aspects of previous books. Everything comes together like an intricate tapestry. The glue holding it all together are the realistic yet likable characters and their compelling relationships. I may start reading the HP series again!
