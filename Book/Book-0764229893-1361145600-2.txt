review/summary: great free bookreview/text: I was not expecting much from a free kindle book, but I was wrong. The book was great and I could not keep from reading it till it was done. I loved it so much that I bought the second book in this series and I'm enjoying it now. Lynn Austin does a really good job with these books.
