review/summary: A Great Reread!!!review/text: As a child, I read this book and loved it....as an adult I am rereading it and have absolutely fallen in love with it again, only this time I have a greater understanding of the true messages, of this great book. It should be required reading, not only for the young, but the more mature, lessons very applicable , even to todays fast pace .... I am a senior citizen!!!
