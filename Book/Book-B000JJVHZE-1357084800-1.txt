review/summary: Classic Readreview/text: This was a required reading when I was in school. Teenagers need to be taught about morality,'gray areas' and compassion at home.This book deals with a single Dad raising his two children( advanced subject matter for its time,even though a single parent household is run of the mill today)This book teaches about judging someone based off of no knowledge at all ( Boo) and judging someone based off of their skin color( Atticus's client)This book is insightful and well written and does not lag anywhere.Harper Lee does a wonderful job bringing an era and experience to the reader.Another book I would recommend as a ' read together book'for you and your teen.
