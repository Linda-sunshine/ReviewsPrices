review/summary: Happy Babyreview/text: Fortunately," The Happiest Baby on the Block" was exactly as described and was just what I wanted for my daughter-in-law. However, I was a bit puzzled by the purchase process because my understanding was that I was simply looking and deciding if i wanted to buy and once I'd come off the site and later checked my emails I discovered it was already bought!!Good job it was actually something I wanted and not too expensive. I don't know how it happened because I certainly did not go through what I understood to be a purchasing process as you do on eBay.I think I'd previously entered my details on Amazon for something else some time ago so I will have to be careful in future or I could end up with all sorts of stuff!!!
