review/summary: P&P = Painful for non-romance loversreview/text: Wow is this book boring. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen was PAINFUL to read.PAINFUL!!!!!The book is filled with rich people being super proper. Oh my goodness it was bad.Although a little more than halfway through the book, I did start to enjoy it. Mainly because they stopped being so stuffy and started being a little more real.There were a bunch of funny, underhanded proper comments, similar to something like "Why, doesn't she look pretty today?" but really meaning that she's super ugly and happens to have made herself look good for this moment.The overall story line: Daughters find people to become their husbands.Done.I just couldn't handle it.But it's a classic and I already know some of you are going to agree with me while others are like shouting at the screen in frustration at my review.So tell me your thoughts on Pride and Prejudice!Thanks for reading,Rebecca @ Love at First Book
