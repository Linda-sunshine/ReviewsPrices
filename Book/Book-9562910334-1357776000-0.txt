review/summary: A must readreview/text: This novel is an obvious source of inspiration for many modern authors. A chilling look at true nature of society, Orwell captivates the reader long after this book is finished. The theme and messages of the story transcends through the ages, though the quality of writing of is stuck in a time where it constantly has to validate itself.
