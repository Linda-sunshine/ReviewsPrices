review/summary: Pick up this American classic!review/text: Saw this one on a sale shelf at a store a few weeks back, but it wasn't untilsomeone recommended it to me that I took the plunge and bought it. I've beenlooking to complete my classic lit reading list and given how long this story has beenaround, I'm surprised and sad I never got to it before now! Following the slaveshiding, running, struggling to survive was difficult to read and put their situationin an incredibly sympathetic and horrifying light. I can't imagine living life in thewoods, but now I have a much better understanding of their awful plight.For this price, you really can't go wrong in buying this--sure there are afew problems with the writing and storytelling, but it'll keep you riveted fordays!
