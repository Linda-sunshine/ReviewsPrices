review/summary: AMAZINGreview/text: My friends had been telling me about this book for a while now. Even with the movies and all the fuss, I was a little skeptical about how good the book was. However, once I began to ride, I could hardly stop. It may seem lame to some (I was part of that group), but once you start reading, you'll love it.
