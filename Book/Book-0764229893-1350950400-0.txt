review/summary: absolutely enjoyed reading every word of it!review/text: Just finished reading Part 1 of the "Chronicles of the Kings". Wow, what an emotionally-charged book and convicting read that was! The author did an excellent job in bringing to life the events of biblical history in such a dramatic and compelling fashion. It is amazing how similar in a way we are with the people way back then.. It is both sobering and refreshing at the same time. Sobering because of seeing the extent and pain of what sin does and knowing that God is a righteous and just God. Refreshing because God is merciful and His love unfailing and has many ways of redeeming His people back to Him. Truly God is the same yesterday and forever! I am thoroughly enjoying this and am looking forward to completing the book series :-)
