review/summary: Another beautifully illustrated edition of an old favourite.review/text: 'The Night Before Christmas' is an old favourite. I read it to my children when they were growing up, and they are now adults.The illustrations are magic, although the (colour) Kindle edition is a bit disappointing in that it displays two pages at a time. I can understand why, because the illustrations either go across the two pages, or the illustration and that part of the story are shown together. However, I would have liked the ability to expand the page so I could get a better look at the illustrations.Still, that's a minor quibble - but if it ever gets fixed, I'll buy another one.This book, perhaps more so in a hard copy, would be perfect to children (and adults I guess) who love beautiful illustrations. Maybe one day I'll find a hard covered copy to put on my real bookshelf as well as having one on my virtual bookshelf.
