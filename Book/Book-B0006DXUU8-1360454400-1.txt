review/summary: It's Dickens!review/text: One of the greatest writers of all time, it's not like you can be disappointed in a classic! The Kindle edition is tough to read on my little Droid phone, but it was good to have it to use for a research paper I was writing. Once I transferred it to my PC it was easy to quote passages, search for info, etc.
