review/summary: A Must Read Book!review/text: I simply could not put this book down. I love historical fiction books, but this one is so much more. It opened my eyes to the real historical events in the bible. This story is taken right from the book of 2 Chronicles, 2 Kings and the prophecies of Isaiah and Micah. It is the story of King Ahaz of Judah and his son and heir to his throne Hezekiah. When I finished reading it I read the whole book of 2 Chronicles. I had a hunger to know more. I have since read the 2nd and 3rd books in the Chronicles of the Kings series and am getting ready to download the 4th of the series. I hope in reading this series you too turn to the books of Kings, Isaiah, Micah, Chronicles, Ezra, Jeremiah and read them for yourselves. These books have helped me to understand the old testament much better. Thank you Lynn Austin!
