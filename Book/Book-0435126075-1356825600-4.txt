review/summary: By far my favorite book.review/text: I love this book, and it's really my favorite story of all time. Mr. Darcy is just about as dreamy as they come. I've read this book at least 6 times since I was 10, and that's not including all the film adaptations and mangas I watched and read on this. It's well worth the read. The Notebook has nothing on this!
