review/summary: Good story but many murders.review/text: I had first heard that this was a book for teens. I think it has too many murders for children but it is a good story and very easy reading. It is a classic and I was interested in reading it myself. Much action. If you like an adventure story this is a good one but a little old fashioned with no sex, only many characters are shot.
