review/summary: Review of the Centennial Edition, Not the Bookreview/text: I purchased this print Centennial Edition of Atlas Shrugged because I wanted to reread the book. I had read it in my youth and was shocked by the selfishness of the main characters. I had never read such a book. So, in my old age, I decided to try it again and see if I would have the same reaction. When the book came, I was shocked again, but this time by the length of the book. I'm sure it was the same length before, but then I had no trouble with long books. I just didn't remember. But the size of the print in this edition made me wrap it up and send it right back to Amazon. The print was tiny! (And I am still reading without glasses so it wasn't my eyes.) I now have the Kindle Edition and am slowly making my way through the book. I'm not shocked by anything yet!THIS REVIEW BELONGS WITH THE BOXED PRINT EDITION, NOT THE KINDLE EDITION!
