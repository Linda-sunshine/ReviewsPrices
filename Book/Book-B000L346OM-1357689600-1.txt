review/summary: Good Readreview/text: Overall, the personal memoir of Victor Frankl was very good. Even though Frankl was not telling all of the many horrors of concentration camp life, the few details he shares are enough to make one cringe. Human depravity has led to many horrific events, such as the concentration camps. The overall message of this book was that of finding meaning in life. As a Christian, this fits very well with a biblical worldview. Even though Frankl falls a bit short of what the Bible teaches on the issue, he nevertheless brings out many valid points about life in general. The second half of the book, which seeks to summarize logotherapy, was not as good as the first half of the book. Going from personal reflection on his time in the concentration camps, Frankl provides the overall framework for his therapy of, finding meaning in life. I would definitely recommend this book and enjoyed reading it.
