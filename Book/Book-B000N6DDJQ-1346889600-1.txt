review/summary: Classics never go far awayreview/text: I once again re live the story first read in college so many years ago. Man's in humanity to others is so well stated. I empathize with the lady and am driven to aggressive feelings towards those who have intolerence and towards unfortunate situations. Holier than thou attitudes again are so manifest in our unforgiving society.
