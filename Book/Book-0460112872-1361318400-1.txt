review/summary: A classic that stays modernreview/text: This is written as a biography by Jane.It is an unusual format and makes the read an even better one.The author tells of the constant hardship of one young women - from childhood, on till the age of 19. Instead of collapsing and not carrying on - as was the want of young women in that era - she ALWAYS picks up and tries to find the good in a situation. Even though this was written so long ago - you can see how Jane is an equal match for modern women, who do not think that they need others to take care of them. The prose are beautifully written and even though I have seen three of the films, many times, the book is even better. The story takes you through Mr Rochester and on to her finding herself. The ending is beautifully written and there is enough of her religious beliefs in it, to make a current day religious person feal comforted. A beautiful ending that made me shed tears in the last paragraph. Don't cheat and look - All good things come to those who wait.
