review/summary: Delivers on multiple comedic fronts.review/text: Hysterical, I've never read anything like it. Your insult lexicon will explode after this read. I'd have to admitthat I caught myself laughing hysterically while reading it. Absolute intellectual absurdity and hilarity. You will not be disappointed.
