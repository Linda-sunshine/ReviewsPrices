review/summary: Beautifully crafted, and well written.review/text: Maximum Ride is a story of a teenage girl named Maximum Ride and her friends, who have mysterious magical powers and are being hunted down by the very people who made them.When I bought this book, I was a little skeptical, but the people that had read it all told me the same thing: "It's great!" So I found my self reading it, and I couldn't stop. It was very action packed, and full of adventure. It seemed like their was a twist or turn on every page, and I truly felt like I was in the book.I really recommend this book to everyone, and I hope they take the time to stop, and really read this book, and enjoy all of it's wonderful features.-KK
