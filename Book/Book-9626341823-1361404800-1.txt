review/summary: Timeless Classicreview/text: I've seen probably all the versions of "A Christmas Carol" on TV, be it a cartoon or yet another remake movie, and though I've yet to see a bad one, I'd read this book over watching any of them on TV any day. Oddly enough, I personally feel that the newest animated movie version of this book staring Jim Carry is the closest one to the book that I've seen. It truly is a timeless classic I will share with my son each holiday season.
