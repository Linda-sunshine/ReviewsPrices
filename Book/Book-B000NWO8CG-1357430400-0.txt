review/summary: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn Reviewreview/text: Although this book was intriguing and interesting, there were a few things I didn't like about it. For me, it didn't get that interesting until half way through the book. Also, there seemed to be many irrelevant details and characters. I still enjoyed reading it as it had a unique plot and kept me interested.
