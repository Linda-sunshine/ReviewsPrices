review/summary: Half way through and so far I shruggreview/text: I have only read about 50% of the book. So far I am not impressed. Her vision of the business world seems far fetched. Her writing is not great. Her characters are given to long soliloquies (I am talking 20 or 30 pages)that are intended to present a deep thought but fail to deliver. Hopefully the second half of the book will somehow bring it all together.
