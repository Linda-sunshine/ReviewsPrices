review/summary: Conquering the Camps!review/text: Viktor Frankl has done the what no other book about the Holocaust has accomplished. Rather than dwelling on the atrocities of the guards and the evils of Nazism, he has shown us what the strength of the human spirit can accomplish.He describes a new way of looking at human interaction called Logotherapy, which explains why some people survived the camps with their spirits intact, while other who were even in better condition gave up and died.I loved the way he explains a difficult concept, and found myself re-reading several passages. He is a great philosopher and writer who understands humanity at a level few of us ever appreciate.
