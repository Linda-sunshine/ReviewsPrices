review/summary: classic book at a great pricereview/text: Bought this for daughter in high school for a class reading assignment. There are two ways of looking at these classics--either for mere consumption, or, collecting them for your shelf to read and reread again. Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn were both books I would just not buy in cheapest form. The original reproduction prints, at around $12, are SO worth it. Books are more than just printed words. The bindings, the artwork, the way they heft and feel, and even smell, is important too. I still have an ancient copy of Treasure Island which is one of the coolest BOOKS I have. Digital versions on Kindle and Ipad are fine for informational research and homework, but READING for pleasure, books still win out for me.
