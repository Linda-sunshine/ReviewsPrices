review/summary: Is re-reading old favourites a good thing?review/text: I am not sure re-reading old favourites is such a good thing. Kurt Vonnegut & Lawrence Durrell were sources of wonder & delight during my 20-something years. Now at 60-something The Alexandrian Quartet seems over-wrought, like too many raisins in the cake, while Slaughterhouse Five, a sure five-star read then, now for me hovers between three & four stars. (In deference to my younger self I have opted for four.)Vonnegut did shake up the conventional novel structure with his mix of memoir, space travel & war-story all told in his signature, deceptively easy style. Optometrist Billy Pilgrim is a deliberately nondescript hero who lives through the horror of Dresden bombings, time-jumps & occasionally lands on the planet of Tralfamadore where he is a zoo exhibit, mating with a porn star.Vonnegut deals with time, fate & war without being remotely ponderous. So what's not to like? It is a book of semi-expressed ideas, sometimes too much in love with its own iconoclasm. Or perhaps this 60-something has lost some of that joie de vivre that first attracted me to Vonnegut.
