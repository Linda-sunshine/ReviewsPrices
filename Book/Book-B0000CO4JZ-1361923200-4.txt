review/summary: The Great Gatsbyreview/text: Reading this book for the first time in more than 50 years,I did not experience a "visit to an old friend" that I had expected. I tried to read it casually which did not work. I intend to immediately begin to reread this book with more care, and will review it again when I have paid better attention to it. This is a book I have long wanted to discuss with an old friend who really is into the American Classics, and she has even taken college classes on F Scott Fitzgerald I don't know that I could get that deep, but I must have some understanding of it beyond characters I would think.
