review/summary: "Let him chase you until you catch him"review/text: "Let him chase you until you catch him" is a very nice sound bite but I wish Sherri would have elaborated more on that point in her book. If we succeed at getting guys to chase us, at what point do we stop running and surrender? In my opinion, Sherri doesn't give much guidance on how to discern the nice guys from the jerks; the implication is to treat them all like jerks until they prove they are worthy. Sherri tells us our best defense against getting played is to withhold sex. Guys that really like us, according to Sherri, will wait to have sex with us. I know from experience, ladies, it's just not that simple; the players and fakers can play the waiting game too. A better book to learn about how to read men is "Manslations." This book tells you what clues to look for in a man that indicate he's worth your time and states that if you don't see these things coming from a man, you just pass on the frogs until you find the prince. The prince is out there! His book was easier to follow and made better sense to me.
