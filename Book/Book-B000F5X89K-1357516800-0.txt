review/summary: Terrible story and millions of holesreview/text: I gave this book a one star because it is incredibly boring. The characters have the most unrealistic reactions to things and act ridiculously. There are also a gigantic amount of holes in this book. So many things are wrong with this book. I recommend it to nobody.
