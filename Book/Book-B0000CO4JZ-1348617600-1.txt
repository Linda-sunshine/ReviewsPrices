review/summary: What's so great about the great gatsby?review/text: For sure, if i hadn't been told that THE GREAT GATSBY is a great american novel and that it has deep symbolism and profound meaning, i don't know if i could haue gotten through it. In fact, if i hadn't seen the movie (which i liked) i don't know if i could have gotten through it twice more (just to see if there was any there there), because the movie made the book come alive for me.The character of gatsby is dry, flat and incnmprehensible--i have never been able to relate him to any living, breathing person i have ever known. As a matter of fact, the only almost three-dimensional character is nick carraway (or is that sam waterston?)
