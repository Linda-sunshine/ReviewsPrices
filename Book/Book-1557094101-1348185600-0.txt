review/summary: Traditionreview/text: We bought this edition of The Night Before Christmas the year after our son was born. He'll be 4 on Christmas Eve. It has become a tradition for my husband to read this to me and our son just before we put him to bed on Christmas Eve. It is a beautiful book with beautiful illustrations. I just absolutely love it :)
