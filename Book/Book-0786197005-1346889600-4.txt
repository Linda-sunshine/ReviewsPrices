review/summary: A Classic Mars Talereview/text: A Princess of Mars is a classic adventure story set on Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Burroughs wrote several novels in the planetary romance style, which this book is one of, where the hero meets a woman, falls in love, subsequently become separated and the hero must fight his back to the woman he loves.The tales are called "planetary" because the adventures take place on another planet, like Mars, or some realm, such as the center of the earth, and not in the ordinary world we know. Burroughs was quite successful with this type of novel and A Princess of Mars, follows the formula. Although the genre was labelled romance, it is romance in the Victorian sense. The novels are adventure, pure and simple.A Princess of Mars takes place on a Mars imagined by scientists in the 1800's. It is a Mars of lower gravity, breathable atmosphere, canals and aliens. In this Mars there are warring factions, grand deadly games and plenty of sword fighting. The book is easy to read, and Burroughs does an excellent job of bringing his version of Mars to life for the reader. If only Mars had turned out how the Victorians had imagined!If you like classic adventure, you'll like A Princess of Mars.
