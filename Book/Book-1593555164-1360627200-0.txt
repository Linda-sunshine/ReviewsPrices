review/summary: Better than the Movie!review/text: Whether you have watched the movie based on this book or not, the book is a GREAT read. It is very different from the movie in many ways. For one, the book is set in Indiana, the movie in Pittsburgh. Also, there are characters in the book absent in the movie. I read the book after seeing the movie thinking I would know how everything turned out and I was in suspense til the last page! Read it!
