review/summary: An Amzing Story Even for Todayreview/text: Someone chose this in one of my book clubs. I wasn't that excited about the choice but now I've changed my mind. &#34; Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&#34; has all of the elements of a great adventure story with a mix of science fiction, adventure on the high seas, mystery and human frailties. It is a long book but worth the read. The &#34;inventions&#34; in 1886 will astound you. How did the author, Jules Verne, forsee these thing? It has my recommendation.
