review/summary: Why is this a classic?review/text: I don't understand. I don't understand, why this has so many great reviews. I have read Frankenstein, I have read Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Hardy. Some of the best Victorian writers and I don't find this book to be that well written. I honestly have to say, I find it so excrutiatingly boring, dull, poorly written that I can't get past forty pages. Frankestein is great! I will die happy knowing that I have never read this hideously boring book!!!
