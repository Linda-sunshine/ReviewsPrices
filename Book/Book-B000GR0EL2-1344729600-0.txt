review/summary: The Hiding Placereview/text: I had never heard of this woman before a friend mentioned this book. It's sad to think that a remarkable story like this might disappear in the annals of history. What stood out for me was the spiritual journey of this woman who was a believer, read her Bible every day, did good works, but that her relationship with the Lord was going to get so much deeper and the journey is breathtaking. And that it is at a time when most people would think that not much more can happen in the winter of their lives (after 40). Cannot wait to read more of her books. You will not regret taking the time to absorb this story. Be blessed!
