review/summary: These books are so entertaining!review/text: I really bought this book just to see what my granddaughter was reading (shes 13). I thought they would be too childish to be interesting to an adult. Boy was I wrong. If you are an animal lover, you will love these books. Buy them in order! Each cat has its own personality and there is something going on all the time to keep you interested and wanting to read more. It also has life lessons that you can relate to human beings. I had no intentions of reading any of the other books, but that has all changed. Im on my fourth one now and still loving them. Excellent read, for children or adults.
