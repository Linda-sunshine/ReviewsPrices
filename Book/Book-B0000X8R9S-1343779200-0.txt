review/summary: English teacher gives this book a C+review/text: When I first read this book with my Freshman English class, I thought it was a bit simplistic. Funny thing, though: the class really liked it. Over the years (I've been teaching 13 years now), it remains a hit with my students. For many of them, it is the first book they have finished from cover to cover.The novel is basically a survival story. Thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson's plane crash lands in the middle of the Canadian wilderness, and much of the plot revolves around his attempts to keep alive until he can be rescued. Other reviewers have mentioned some themes (suicide, marital infidelity) that might trouble younger readers, but no students as of yet have ever voiced any discomfort with reading about these topics. (The sad fact is that many are already too familiar with these in their own lives.)Great literature it is not, but the kids really enjoyed it. Over time, the novel has grown on me because of the kids' reaction. If some students really enjoyed this first installment, Paulsen has a series of books centering around Brian. The sequel, "The River", is more action and less character driven than "Hatchet". I haven't read "Brian's Return" or "Brian's Winter" (which is an alternate ending to "Hatchet"), but again, kids might like them.
