review/summary: True classicreview/text: I'd read this back in high school, but the flood of silly vampire books, movies and television lately caused my to brush up on the &#34;facts&#34; of the matter again. While the writing and language is, of course, a bit out of date Kindle's dictionary and Wikipedia help keep everything straight. The format, sections of the narrative being told through the journal entries of various characters, causes frequent and convenient breaks in the action for those of us who can only read in spurts or want to squeeze in a bit here and there amid other activities. The story itself is well told and the book highly recommended.
