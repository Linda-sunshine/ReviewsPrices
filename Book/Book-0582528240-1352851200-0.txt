review/summary: Huckleberry Finreview/text: I received this book on my kindle for my son for school. Personally we couldn't actually use the book because it was important to reference book pages and different passages in the book and on the kindle it was virtually impossible to find this information. It's great if you just want to read the book but using it for school makes it too difficult to use.
