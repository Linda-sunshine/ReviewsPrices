review/summary: Great read, especially for "too nice" girlsreview/text: Almost every woman I know has been a "doormat" for a man at some point...sometimes, you need some good, sound, "tough love" type of advice and this book delivers. It's more about maintaining emotional control, dignity, and respect. It won't tell you how to dress or how to wear your hair....but it will help you see that the only way to earn a man's respect is to first respect yourself! I say give it a read, have a few laughs, and use your experiences as a "doormat" to help firmly plant your feet onthe path to "dream girl".
