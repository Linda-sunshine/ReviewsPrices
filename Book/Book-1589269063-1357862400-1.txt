review/summary: Handbook for successful lovereview/text: As soon as I picked up this book the &#34;Duh!&#34; light went on. As you read it (and it is such an easy read) you think- wow, this is so clear and so simple, and so true. Why didn't I know this before?! It's great, because you can digest the information quickly and implementing the tools it teaches you is simple. You feel like you can begin making positive changes in your relationship immediately, because, the only person we can change is ourselves- but by changing ourselves, we can make huge changes in how our partners relate to us. This book really spoke to me, I love it, and would recommend it to anyone and everyone. As I finished reading it, I had the urge to buy and send one to every couple I know :-) It should come with your marriage certificate!
