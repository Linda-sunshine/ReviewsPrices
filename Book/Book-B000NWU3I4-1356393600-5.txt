review/summary: Completely satisfiedreview/text: This was my first Kindle purchase and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy, quick and user-friendly the experience was. I read this on my Android smartphone using the free Kindle app. Quite a pleasant experience which I would be glad to repeat, and will!Regarding the book itself, if you haven't already read The Hobbit, I highly recommend it. Read and re-read it and even read it to your children as applicable and when they are ready.
