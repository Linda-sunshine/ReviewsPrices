review/summary: Bought this book to read for the second timereview/text: This book is excellent. It's very long so be sure you take that into account. I have it on an iPad and iPhone so it's great to read a little at a time while I wait for something. Ayn Rand writes beautifully, draws her characters with words so you can see them, and I was struck by how timely the subject of the book is today!
