review/summary: A Classicreview/text: I've always loved 1984 (it's a total classic, and so well written for it's time), so it was an easy choice for me to spend the $1 (yes, ONE DOLLAR) on the e-book edition when my book club re-read this novel. I did have the paperback version, but I just love reading on my Kindle, so I went for the e-book version as well :)
