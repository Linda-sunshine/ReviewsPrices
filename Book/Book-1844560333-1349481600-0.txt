review/summary: Pride and Prejudicereview/text: This is a wonderful classic, I have renewed my acquaintance with the Bennet family and friends. One irritating factor in the text was the use of -- instead of the county names, which was somewhat annoying. I presume this was due to a lack of precise editing. I would thoroughly recommend the novel to anyone who likes a timeless good read.
