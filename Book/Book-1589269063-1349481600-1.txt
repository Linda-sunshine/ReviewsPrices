review/summary: Quick Read, Great Informationreview/text: Very insightful and well written book. I recommend this for anyone looking to improve their relationship with their significant other. You don't have to be on the verge of divorce to find some good take-aways for this relatively short read. My wife mentions on several occasions that I am incredibly hard to shop for and buy presents for. Turns out that of the 5 love languages, "Receiving Gifts" is the language I speak the least-as long as I can remember I've never really cared if some got me a present or not.Some aspects of the book seem like common sense...after the fact, that is. I feel a little bad that I had to read a book to figure some of these things out, after which I was like "well duh, stupid". This book is a good guide in that it points out things to look for in your relationship that you may not notice on your own, or have learned to ignore/tolerate, and using you partner's love language to improve on things. I will definately come back to this from time to time for a refresher.
