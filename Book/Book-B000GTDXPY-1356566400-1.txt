review/summary: Loved every wordreview/text: This is without a doubt one of the most engaging novels I've ever read - yep, I mean it. The sense of fun that pervades this work can't help but lighten your heart, and the mystery is well developed and delivers plenty of surprises. Yes, Jayne's ditsy, but loveable. Suspend your world weary cynicism and just immerse yourself in fun - you won't regret it.
