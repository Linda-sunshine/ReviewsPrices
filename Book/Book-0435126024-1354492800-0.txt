review/summary: Great classic!review/text: I saw a version of &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; on TV one day, and knew that I would understand it better if I read the book. Books tell you so much more than movies or TV shows can. I wasn't disappointed. The plot became clear, and the lessons taught in this story were timeless. How does a person come to have faith, when his past has been anything but perfect? How can we endure, when we have bad experience after bad experience? When &#34;bad&#34; things happen, that is when our character is developed, and this story shows that over and over.
