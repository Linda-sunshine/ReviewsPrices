review/summary: Classic heroic fantasyreview/text: Like the novels of H. Rider Haggard, Burroughs generates a world that is richly appointed and fully realized. Of course it is fantastic and runs counter to our experiences, but it is also wholly consistent, beautiful,and exciting. It's very unreality draws us into the heart of the unfolding heroic narrative. This is what fantasy should always do - allow us to experience a new world in all it's depth and vibrancy, sharing the joyful excitement of it's creator.
