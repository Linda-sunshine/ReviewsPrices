review/summary: Curious?review/text: Unfortunately, this book was poorly written. So poorly written I could only read a couple of pages at a time before putting it down and coming back to it another day. Sure, I initially picked up the book understanding it is a young adult novel - probably not a literary novel - I can give it some forgiveness. But the writting was so immensely juvenile I felt I was reading a book meant for 8 year old children. My forgiveness can only extend so far. I am curious why this book is so popular. Sure, I can give it 2 stars for originality.
