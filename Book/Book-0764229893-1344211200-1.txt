review/summary: Historical fiction of a Biblical story0review/text: This really brought to life a part of the Bible that is important but only scantily covered. I often wondered how the faith of Judah's kings changed so drastically from one to the next: I now have an idea of how it could have happened. I enjoyed it so much, I read all five in the series.
