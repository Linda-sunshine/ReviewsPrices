review/summary: Insightful and Action orientedreview/text: This book has helped me understand why both me and my spouse are unhappy in our marriage. I have always had a critical nature and it has had a negative impact over time. I now realize that some of my negative responses towards my husband were because he was not providing what I need to el e loved. Low and behold, turns out I an not providing the love he needs. We are not speaking each other's love language. This book had provided concrete approaches to learn both you and your spouse's love language.
