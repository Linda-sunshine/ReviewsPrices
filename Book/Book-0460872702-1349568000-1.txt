review/summary: Not As Timeless As People Sayreview/text: The Great Gatsby is one of those books you're forced to read in school and remember hating. I decided to give it another try as an adult.The Great Gatsby is the story of a mysterious man who throws great parties in old Long Island.I found the book very hard to read because of the writing style. It may be a classic but it's not timeless. The writing is very dated and you find your mind wandering rather then being sucked into the book.I didn't love it and I didn't hate it as much as when I was in school.3 out of 5 stars.
