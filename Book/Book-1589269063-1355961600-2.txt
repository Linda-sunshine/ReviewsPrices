review/summary: WoWreview/text: This book is wonderful. I cannot speak highly enough about it. It really opens your eyes to the reason why people get divorced. I truly believe if your partner does not fulfill your love languages it is a primary reason you will or did get a divorce. I bought the book to help with my relationship and it takes two people to understand what you are doing and how to fix things. Ive tried counseling with dismal results and found this book to be a much better DIY counseling service. I have recommended to several people, and i don't recommend things unless i really believe in them. It saved our relationship. If your relationship is already long over, this is still a great book for you to read, you may realize what it takes to make a long lasting relationship in your future relationships and set you up for success!
