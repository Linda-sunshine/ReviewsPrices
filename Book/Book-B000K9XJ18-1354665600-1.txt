review/summary: Jack Reacher. What else needs to be said?review/text: I liked that JR came to gripes with himself. I didn't like how, a little too unrealistically, he is able to bend and break the law right in front of the police. Its one thing when he does it in other novels when there are no authorities around to do something about it, but in this novel, they are RIGHT THERE. Too much for me. Otherwise a good story.
