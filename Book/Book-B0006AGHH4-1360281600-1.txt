review/summary: Required readingreview/text: Uncle Tom's Cabin is a groundbreaking work that humanizes the institution of slavery and reveals truths behind the slave traders and slaveholders. It's a little plodding in parts, which is common to 19th century writing, but Stowe pulls no punches in showing the evils of slavery. I found the characters and their personal stories riveting. If you read UTC in high school, like I did, read it again as an adult. It's an engrossing, eye-opening indictment of slavery, written at the right time but still important reading today to understand a part of our history.
