review/summary: Not just a book for the office; this is a book for life.review/text: The fashioning of better people: this is the stuff a better society is made of. The frames of mind Carnegie describes in his book have the power to transform the world. Read this book, relate to it, relish it. Every situation he describes is one that everyone of us may someday encounter... the question is, how are you going to handle it when you do?
