review/summary: A Thoughtful yet bizarre readreview/text: As always Jodi Picoult writes a book that follows an interesting premise and keeps the reader involved in the story. She is such an artful author and I enjoy the way she pulls the reader into the events which unfold. Although I did not think this was one of her best books it does create some challenging questions about stigmata and atheism.
