review/summary: Greatreview/text: I tried to read this book in Middle school 10 years ago and I couldn't do it. Now with my friends all psyched for the Hobbit movie and needing something to read during lunch at work I decided to give it another try. And boy the book is great. I read through it very quickly and all I could think about while not reading it is finishing the read. Still not sure how they are gonna make the book last 3 movies but that is besides the point. If you are a fan of the LOTR movies and never could read the books I would definitely suggest picking up the Hobbit and giving it a read. You won't regret it.
