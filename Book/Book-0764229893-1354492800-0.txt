review/summary: Great story but be aware this is fiction based on Biblereview/text: I really enjoyed reading this book especially the historical descriptions of daily life in biblical times. The writing was excellent. I enjoy books that make me want to go and read the Bible to check out the story for myself. I realize this is historical fiction and want to make sure I get the story straight as author's sometimes use literary license and change the story around a bit. But well written books like this make characters and history come to life for me. I plan to read other books by this author.
