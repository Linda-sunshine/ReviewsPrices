review/summary: A Fantasy Classicreview/text: When J.R.R. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit, he likely had no idea that it would become the first book in a lengthy series which today serves as the archetypal example of high fantasy. Still further from his mind would have been the idea that his story could find its way into the theaters of the the next century as a blockbuster production.Taken solely on its own merits, however, The Hobbit is still an exceptional book. Tolkien weaves together bits of European mythology, stringing it into a tapestry with threads of his own prodigious creativity, to write a book with appeal to all ages. The poetry can be a bit corny by modern standards, but the overall style of writing and the narrator's tone make the story come alive for the reader.The Kindle edition of The Hobbit has an issue with images in text, causing many of them to appear "sideways" regardless of the angle of the Kindle. While this won't be an issue for the majority of readers, for some (particularly younger children), it could be frustrating. Still, this is too minor a concern to justify a lower star rating.
