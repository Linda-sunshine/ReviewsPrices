review/summary: Simply my favorite LOTR Edition I own.review/text: I love one volume editions of series, and this did not dissapoint. Very well made and I love the type setting and font chosen for this particular book. The appendices maps, charts, etc have super clear printing, and honestly I like not having the old fold out maps. Make sure you buy a dust jacket protector as the paper for the jacket is brittle, and might tear. Other than that great printing. No need to critique the book...
