review/summary: So much to do!review/text: I love how much stuff there is to do in Hogwarts. Something new and exciting is always going on, whether it's finding a mirror that shows what you most desire, playing a game of Quidditch above hundreds of cheering students, or solving magical riddles to stop a dark wizard.And Rowling's storytelling skills are amazing.
