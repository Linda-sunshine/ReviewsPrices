review/summary: Great book for any agereview/text: It's a nice, big book with a lot of beautifully painted illustrations inside. One thing I didn't expect was that the cover shown is actually the cover protector (I don't know if it said that in the description I read) and the real cover is very plain, green and with gold writing. All the same, I'm thrilled to have it and would recommend it to just about anyone.
