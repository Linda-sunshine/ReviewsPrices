review/summary: Even though I only gave it a 3 I would certainly recommend it if the premise sounds interesting.review/text: 1) Rating: 3 out of 5 stars2) Genre: Young Adult3) Synopsis: At 16 you become a Pretty. You stop becoming an Ugly and become a Pretty. Who wouldn't want that? There are a few and Tally's best friend is one of them. She must decide between friendship and becoming pretty.4) Feelings: I have heard people mention this book quite a bit and wanted to try it out. I feel a little bad giving it a 3 because it certainly wasn't a bad book. Just didn't grip me. Has plenty of story and some action. It is one of those books that ends making you want to read the next one.5) Final recommendation: Even though I only gave it a 3 I would certainly recommend it if the premise sounds interesting. The story moves along and the characters are appealing.Ryan James BurtHusband, Father, and Writer[...]
