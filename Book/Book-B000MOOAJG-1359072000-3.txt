review/summary: Font size makes practically unreadablereview/text: Shrugged is a big book and should not reduced to a paperback of this size. It is ~ 2&#34; thick with ~ a #6 font size. I have 20/20 vision and even with reading glasses it was virtually unreadable. Bought a Kindle Edition and highly recommend the novel as a &#34;must read!&#34;. Shades of what's going on in the USA and the world today. If you are a touchy feely liberal, don't buy it. You'll burn it after the first couple hundred pages.
