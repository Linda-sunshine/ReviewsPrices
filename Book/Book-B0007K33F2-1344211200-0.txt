review/summary: Not At All Like the Moviereview/text: In short, after reading this book, I have to rate the movie at one star because there was a minimal amount of similarity between the it and the book. The book was brilliant and caused many late night readings when I should be sleeping. I suggest it to everyone that saw the movie first because you will like the book much, much more.
