review/summary: My review on Pride and Prejudicereview/text: Classicly a period piece, thus slower to read due to the verbiage, but, certainly worth the read! I enjoyed her characters and though the places were not as richly described as I would have liked, it was enough. Several new (actually &#34;olde&#34;) words have been added to my vocabulary!
