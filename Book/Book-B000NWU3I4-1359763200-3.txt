review/summary: Great tale of fantastic deed and heroismreview/text: A re-read after a long span of time was a great deal New again. The struggle of the adventurous Took and the comfortable safe hobbits day to day life raise a question for all of us. Stay with the comfortable path or venture onto the unknown in good company. Wonderful tale.
