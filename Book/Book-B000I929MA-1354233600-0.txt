review/summary: I had already read it, years agoreview/text: The book arrived in perfect condition, and I loaned it to a friend before re-reading it myself, which I plan to do. I loved it the first time I read it, and now that I'm older, I want to read it again with fresh eyes. It is a very engrossing tale.
