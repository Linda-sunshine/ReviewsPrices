review/summary: Do you believe in magic?review/text: These books are amazing! They fit all ages and genres whether you are looking for action and adventure or mythical fairytale creatures. You WON'T be disappointed! The books correspond well with the movies, but provide more detail. J. K. Rowling has really outdone herself! So join Harry on his magical journey in defeating You- Know- Who (Voldemort), concurring the qudditch world and becoming a young wizard.
