review/summary: A Holocaust Memoir Beyond Critisismreview/text: This book is basically beyond criticism; it is so utterly terrible and horrifying to read of the things that happened during the Holocaust, and the book itself is at times extremely painful to read. Although the writing style is a bit choppy, Wiesel's account of the Holocaust is so powerful, emotional, and thought provoking that it should not be turned down simply on account of it being uncomfortable. Wiesel's narrative takes you right into the heads of the suffering Jews, depicting their losses of hope, faith, humanity, and in some cases, sanity. It is a harrowing personal account of what it was like to be a Jew living in a concentration camp. I think that we owe it to the people that had to live through this evil episode in human history to read their story and experience their anguish with them. It is required reading in most High Schools, and though it is horrific, I think it should remain required reading, if not just to make certain an atrocity like this never happens again. It will definitely raise big questions. Again, this is an extremely, terrifyingly powerful novel, so be sure you are ready for such subjects before you pick up this book.
