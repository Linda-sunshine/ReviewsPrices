review/summary: Quite the Little Dog-and-Pony Showreview/text: I am left with questions: Why does Ian need to keep his brother a secret? Why can Faith resurrect the dead but gives Michael just a few moments of lucidity? Why is the ending so obscure? (Ambiguity would be thought-provoking, but this ending backs away as if it is too afraid it might offend someone.) Why didn't the author research Cathloic dogma & doctrine more carefully? (I can only assume her treatments of Judaism, medicine & law are equally slapdash.) And finally - Must Picoult use so many cliches? ('Dog & Pony Show' appears 3 times in this narrative. Once would be too much.)
