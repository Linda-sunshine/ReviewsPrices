review/summary: Fascinating Readreview/text: Compelling presentation by using his experience in the concentration camps to illustrate his principles of psychology i.e.how man can see suffering from a different point of view. A man cannot find peace in happiness unless they have a meaning or purpose in life. I thought it was fascinating and thought provoking. There is no one answer to a meaning in life but he certainly gives you ways to find insight into your own. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because some people may find it a bit difficult to grab all the concepts. I was told by someone in the field that it is required reading. Aside from that I believe that anyone who reads it will benefit even if they don't &#34;get&#34; all of it.
