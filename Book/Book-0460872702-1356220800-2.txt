review/summary: Old Made Newreview/text: To me, one of the most depressing things about grad school was reading through great works of literature, finding one that I really loved, digging up criticism and scholarship about it so I could write my double-spaced ode to The Sound and the Fury or War and Peace or whatever... and discovering that the book was all used up.There was nothing I could possibly say about it that would be new. Every possible thought and conclusion had long since been had by dozens of other, more qualified people. Every minor character and allusion was already the subject of half a dozen moldering dissertations. Sure, I went ahead and wrote my little paper, but it didn't add anything to Timeless Academia's conversation on the subject.The Great Gatsby is one of those books. I can't say anything about it that hasn't been said hundreds of times before, and neither can you.But lately, I've been having the most fun with these old books when I can arrange to read them with relatively new people. It's kind of wonderful to read alongside someone who's not had "Great American novel" tattooed under their eyelids, who isn't swallowing bile at the thought of churning out a five-paragraph essay at the end of it all - who still has room for virginal surprise and wonder and disgust as they turn the pages.I'm finding this mix of old book, new reader especially satisfying with Gatsby. You get that sense from the city itself: in the summer of 1922, everything is so new and extravagant and full of spectacle that a person could forget just how old and worn-down the world really is.So there it is, my one halfway original thought: if it's been awhile since 11th-grade English and you'd like to try this book again, see if you can get a fresh companion to take you to one of Gatsby's parties. They are really quite something.
