review/summary: Best book I've ever readreview/text: I don't even know where to begin to describe this book. It is certainly long, and can be hard to get through at times, but it is nevertheless the best book I have ever read. Even though it was written several decades ago, I believe it is still highly relevant to today's society.I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
