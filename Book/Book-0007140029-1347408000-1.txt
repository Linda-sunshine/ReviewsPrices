review/summary: My 7-Year-Old Loves These Booksreview/text: My wife and I have been working on our seven year old girl to get her to a point of reading without firm encouragement. She has consumed this book and the next two with enthusiasm. Now she doesn't need to be told to go read her book. She does it on her own. Tonight she and my wife came home from the grocery store with a "kitty mask" and a tiara. I've been informed that I am to call her "Diamond-Heart" until further notice.
