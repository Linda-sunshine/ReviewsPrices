review/summary: Movingreview/text: I can't remember the last time I was so moved by a book. I did not expect this from something written over 150 years ago.There's definitely a hardcore Christian slant to the book, which makes it all the more surprising that, as a non-Christian, I would find this book so moving. Some of the characters are rather one-dimensional, but that doesn't detract from the emotional power of this book. It is easy to see how this book brought so much sympathy to plight of slaves in the pre-Civil War era.
