review/summary: Jack Reacher: One shotreview/text: Oh boy! Lee child is SOME novelist! I've read several of his Reacher tales and have thoroughly enjoyed each and every one. This one has enough interesting quirks--ala Lee Child--to keep you turning each page with eager anticipation. Charles Reap &#34;ReadAReap.Com.&#34;
