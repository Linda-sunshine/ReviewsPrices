review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: This is a no brainer. I am a Tolkien fan from the beginning of time. Was sooooo excited that I could get it downloaded on my kindle. My two originals are very old and very worn. Now I can read to my hearts content and don't have to worry about the wear and tear on the pages and bindings of my books
