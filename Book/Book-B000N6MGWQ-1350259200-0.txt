review/summary: Review of The Five People You Meet in Heavenreview/text: I had first read Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom because it came highly recommended from friends and family. After finishing Tuesdays with Morrie, I had realized why this book had such great reviews. It was written beautifully and had lessons in it that I wanted to keep with me forever. Because of this book, I was excited to read The Five People You Meet in Heaven.The Five People You Meet in Heaven met my high expectations that I set from reading his first book. This book was creative, thoughtful and stuck with me afterwards like any good book should do. This book is about an amusement park maintenance man named Eddie. The book begins on his 83rd birthday while he is at work. He dies that day trying to save a young girl from a freak accident when something goes wrong with a ride. When Eddie dies, he arrives in heaven and meets a series of people who were connected to him in some way. Each person helps Eddie figure out some unanswered questions from his life and teach him a life lesson. His first person that he meets mentions, "Each of us was in your life for a reason. You may not have known the reason at the time, and that is what heaven is for. For understanding your life on earth."I feel that we all have unanswered questions and uncertainties, but Mitch Albom gives the reader something to hold onto while thinking about heaven. Everyone also has different views of the afterlife. I am a Christian, but I like that Albom represents his belief of the afterlife in a creative and non "traditional" or "common" manner.My favorite part about this book was that it changed my outlook on life. It made me want to forgive more, love more, experience more, and live more. I think that any books that can make you want to life more fully, or change for the better, are great books. I would highly suggest that everyone reads this book.
