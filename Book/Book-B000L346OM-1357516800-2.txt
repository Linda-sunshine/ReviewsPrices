review/summary: This book was recommended by a very good friend.review/text: After the glowing recommendation I received on this book I was expecting more. Maybe I should have read this 20 years ago and I would have had a different slant, but I have grown weary of listening to victims believing that by surviving the ordeal and then telling the story that they are somehow making up for the less than human behavior they exhibited. The holocaust was inexcusable. I just didn't feel like I learned anything new from this book.
