review/summary: The Vampire Story to Beat All Others!review/text: Now THIS is a vampire book that has it all....suspense, drama, and downright creepiness. There are charming characters who you fall in love with (Van Helsing, Quincy Morris) and all the vampire lore you could wish for....all set in a creepy historical fiction setting. Don't misunderstand, I loved the original Twilight books, but Dracula sets the all time standard. If you haven't read it yet, do so!
