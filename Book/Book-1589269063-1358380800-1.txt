review/summary: Great Truth!review/text: I believe every big concept regardless of difficulty can be made easy to understand by making it simplier. Find the truth of the matter and drive it home. Books that inspire by long winded chapters that at the time seem very inspirational are often forgotten because it is to hard to hold onto the concept that is so thought provoking. The 5 love languages gives you something that covers the whole truth of how people want to be loved, but it is also something that I don't think you will ever forget because it's made so simple. It is easy to remember, understand and not hard to practice improving in one of the 5. It's also not hard to figure out which one of the love languages your signifigant other is. I think this would have really helped my second marriage. I was always a good husband in the since that I always treated my wife with kind words. But I think she needed another love language. Now I have a great insight to my 3rd! What a lucky lady she will be! lol.
