review/summary: thought provokingreview/text: This book is changing my life. It's scary how Ayn could see the way things were heading 50yrs ago. My husband and I are both reading it and we want are young children to read it when they get older. We want them to be producers, and not go through life saying "It's not fair." Or "No one gave me a chance." America is all about chances. Read this book, change your thought process.
