review/summary: Classic adventurereview/text: Treasure Island is one of the best adventure tales ever written. The dialogue is wonderful and vibrant. "Long John Silver" is one of the first complex characters in literature, being a both murderous pirate and a father figure to young "Jim Hawkins". I loved the book and was impressed how a story written over 100 years ago has stood the test of time.
