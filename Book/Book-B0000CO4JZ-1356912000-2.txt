review/summary: Made me a better personreview/text: Whenever this book is discussed, the american dream and the jazz age are the first things to be mentioned. I never understood this because, for me, the emotional core of the novel is understanding the extent to which men are willing to fabricate and chase illusions. This slim beast of a novel allows us to walk in the shoes of a man determined to recreate the past and shape reality to his wishes. Everything Jay Gatsby does is designed to win back his love, but time, social status, and reality stand between him and his dreams. By empathizing with Jay Gatsby, we understand our own desires to recapture the past and our own tendencies to objectify the people we cared about. It is for this reason that this is a great piece of literature worthy of reading and rereading.For those out there who find the characters unsympathetic, please note that the same negative traits found in the characters are the same traits we all have. Gatsby, Daisy, etc... are not supposed to be role models, they're supposed to highlight our own desires and flaws. While we might not find them euphoric to be around, we certainly learn more about ourselves by being with them. And besides, I actually like Gatsby.Also, Fitzgerald writes with abundant wit and sarcasm that is truly charming.
