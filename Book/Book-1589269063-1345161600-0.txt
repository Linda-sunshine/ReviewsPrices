review/summary: Great advicereview/text: The 5 Love Languages is helpful to anyone interested in a committed relationship. This book will teach you how to communicate effectively with your partner. In most relationships what we consider loving or as being considerate may not be seen the same way for the other person. What we consider as important may not mean as much to our spouse. We have to learn what's important to them and capatalize on those things.The 5 languages are words of affirmation, acts of service, receiving gifts, quality time and physical touch. Each person has their own preference of things that are important to them. Words of affirmation is basically complimenting your spouse and letting them know what they mean to you. Taking the time to tell your spouse what they mean to your life. Acts of service refers to being available to your spouse and helping them through random acts. Receiving gifts does not have to be a big expensive gift but instead a small gesture that says you were thinking about them. Quality time is making opportunities to spend with your spouse. Physical touch can be hugging, kissing, or hand holding.Learning which one of these is important to your spouse will help your relationship tremendously. I have tried implementing this information and I must say it really helped.
