review/summary: Engagementreview/text: This book is a must read for all young men. I read this book probably six years ago and it still is fresh in my mind today. It kept me coming back for more everyday, I couldn't put it down. For that young man to go through all that alone must be so tough but at the same time your thinking that you would love to be in that position. You imagine yourself in that situation and you think about what that would be like. Gary Paulsen does a great job with the detail and being realistic about what might actually happen. He isn't making the boy out to be some super survival man, he is just a regular guy like any of us. When reading the book you really feel for the guy and I know I found myself so deep into the book that I saw myself in the story. I would like to sit down and chat with Mr. Paulsen about the inspiration behind Hatchet, one of my favorite books. It would be great to pick his brain a little bit. He is an outdoorsman and I am an Eagle scout and an avid hunter so I'm sure it would be a great talk.Be sure to read this book, its a classic in my book.
