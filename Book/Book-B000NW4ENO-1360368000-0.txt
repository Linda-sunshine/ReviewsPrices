review/summary: Unsurpassedreview/text: As powerful today as when it came out more than 70 years ago. Criticisms that it glorifies the Confederacy are misguided. While still honoring those who survived incredible hardship and loss, Margaret Mitchell skewers the pretensions of those who blindly believed in "The Cause." Her portrayal of how blacks were treated manages to convey her obvious belief that in many respects some slaves were better people than their masters. A great love story set in the midst of a war that is fought mostly offstage. Her prose is magnificent, creating characters and a world that are unique in American literature. An aside: Hollywood did a magnificent job making a classic movie from such a huge book.
