review/summary: Thought Provoking!review/text: A must-read for everyone. Frankl's observations and theories apply to today's society so accurately it's almost scary. Each person's search for meaning in his/her life is a different journey and Frankl has a deep understanding of our human fears and desires. This book will make you think and maybe even change your life. I'm going to read it again as there's a lot to absorb. I got hung up on some of the technical/psychological jargon but it wasn't that hard to grasp the basic meanings.
