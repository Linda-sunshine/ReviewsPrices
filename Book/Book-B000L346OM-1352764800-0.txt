review/summary: A must read...review/text: I read this book many years ago for my high school English class. I was looking for something small to take on a trip recently, and saw it on the bestseller list, so I bought myself a new copy. It was as relevent to me today as it was back then, and I hope to apply some of Dr. Frankl's concepts in my own life, and use them as I advise others in crisis. I gave a copy to a friend going through great and long term suffering, and she absolutely loved it. She was very inspired, and although her suffering continues, I have noticed a great improvement in her health already.This is a book which draws on universal truths celebrated and taught by all major religions. It would make excellent interfaith reading material, and is also useful in combination with sacred texts to teach and bring context to religious practice and belief in modern time.
