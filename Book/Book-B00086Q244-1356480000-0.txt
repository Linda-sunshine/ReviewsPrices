review/summary: good , common sense read...review/text: An enjoyable classic about "people skills." Much of what it says is common sense, but it does organize and remind the reader of the importance of key approaches to relating to and persuading other people.The author uses a solid framework and builds specific points around it. He then uses examples from famous people like Lincoln, Socrates, Napoleon, and Theodore Roosevelt as well as from ordinary folks who shared their experiences in his classes.Overall, a good read.
