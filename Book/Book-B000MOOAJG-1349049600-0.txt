review/summary: Atlas Shruggedreview/text: I heard of this book a long time ago and finally decided to make the plunge. It is long and wordy but extremely well done. Though published over 50 years ago, it is very telling as to what this country, and the world faces today brought on by massive government intrusion into our everyday lives. Ayn Rand, originally from Russia saw the fall and collapse of her country due to communism, socialism and liberal attitudes. She tried to warn us. Alas, no one apparently listened.This novel should be on everyone's "Bucket List".
