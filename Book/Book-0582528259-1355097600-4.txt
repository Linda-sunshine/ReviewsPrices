review/summary: Some lovely passages in between rather dreary writing.review/text: I particularly like Miss Bronte's use of words to describe natural scenes. I refer to her descriptions of out door scenes. However I did become bored with her lengthy and imaginary conversations with her admirers which accounts for the low rating.I have seen this book described as an auto biography. That cannot be so. Perhaps the early part was written from her actual experiences but this book was finished long before she was married to the curate, not Rochester.I am beginning to realize that this was in fact the Victorian style of writing.
