review/summary: The Scarlet Letterreview/text: This a classic of American Literature. I love this story! The characters are tragic and captivating. It is timeless tale of forbidden romance, deceit, and judgement. It is the Salem Witch trials meets Desperate House Wives, sort of. It is one of my favorite books ever. Pearl is my favorite character.
