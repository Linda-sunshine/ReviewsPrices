review/summary: Small enough to go with me wherever I goreview/text: While the pages of this book have gold leafed edges like a bible, the pages aren't quite as thin. The printer did a great job of making smaller print text without any smudges and is actually still easily visible to someone like me who is kind of blind. The inside front cover has a colored map of Thorin's map of the secret entrance into the Lonely Mountain. The back inside cover has a colored map of the Wilderlands. I like that these maps are in color and not black and white, but I don't mind that the illustrations inside are black and white. This book is small, but I doubt it could fit in my pocket. But, it is most certainly small and light weight enough to fit comfortably into my rucksack back pack and go with me wherever I go, which was the whole point of getting this so I'm very pleased with it, especially for the price. This is far superior to any previous paperback print of this book. The imitation leather cover is awesome as well.
