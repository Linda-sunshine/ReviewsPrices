review/summary: Fantastic. Also yay Mr. Darcyreview/text: Enjoyed this more thoroughly than expected. This is a story about the potential damage or fortune derived from preconceived societal notions. This is a story about standing up to social conventions in an age where such a concept was unthinkable, not to mention before its time. Taken slowly, poetically and whimsically, the human drama in this book is deeply touching, and can be appreciated by every culture on the globe.There are 5thousand reviews here, so I won't go into further detail, but rest assured, it's a CLASSIC and it's worth a read.
