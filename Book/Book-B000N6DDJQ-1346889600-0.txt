review/summary: The Scarlet Letterreview/text: Although this book can be challenging to read I find it extremely well done. Nathanial Hawthorne is a brilliant writer and deserves high praise for this story. The manner in which the author presents the characters in this book make you feel part of the story. I am enjoying it tremendously. After a few months go by, I actually am planning to reread the Scarlet Letter.
