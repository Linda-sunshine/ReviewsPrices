review/summary: Great Book for anyonereview/text: This is a great book for anyone married who wants to maintain a great relationship or repair a broken one. This book opens up love in a whole new way. I had heard about this book from my sister, my husband and I have a good relationship but I was looking for something to read so I checked it out. I am so glad I did! This book helps you identify you and your mates "Love language" and speak it to each other to so you can always have a happy marriage and fill each others need for love. I would recommend this to anyone even if they don't have marital problems it is a great way to ensure you never will.
