review/summary: LIKE HOLMES ONLY MORE BRUTALreview/text: Sherlock Holmes sat in his study pondering evidence, sifting through each minute clue over and over. His favorite pipe hard at work wafting smoke from it's bowl tamped full of a blend of Danish Cavendish and Latakia from the Eastern Mediterranian.Dr. John Watson sits directly across from Holmes not saying a word. He knew from experience not to disturb the great detective's thought process at a critical time. He had blurted out his opinion at an inoppertune time in a similar situation years ago. Holmes then spent two hours discussing the concentration required in critical reasoning and use of common sense in deduction."Watson it is of the highest importance in the art of deduction to look at a number of facts and recognize the vital from the incidental. Failing to ascertain this dissipates energy.Like the snow flake no two human minds work the same. It is for the individual to find what it is works that works for them."Reacher knows that he is far smarter than the local people involved in the investigation of the shooting of five people. And after he brutaly disposes of the bad guys through brute force he brilliantly deduces in Holmes style who the top criminal is by reasoning that he himself would not have been smart enough to empty a parking meter of quarters to find one finger print.
