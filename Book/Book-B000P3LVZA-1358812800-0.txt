review/summary: Detailed and Hauntingreview/text: I've never read a futuristic book and gone &#34;Man, that could happen to us&#34; as much as with &#34;Brave New World.&#34;I see the main positive points of &#34;Brave New World&#34; as the following:1. Incredibly detailed. Shows you what the future looks like, what it feels like, what it smells like, desires, technology, buildings, etc. Everything you want in an immersive novel.2. Hauntingly accurate. So many aspects of this future society ring true to an accurate extrapolation of our current lives. From the focus on pleasure, to the communal nature of things, it feels like it could be our future reality.Keep in mind there are some slightly graphic references, but overall it's an incredibly well-written sci-fi novel that I highly recommend.
