review/summary: Eerie foreshadowing of where technology might be taking usreview/text: I bought this book after Ray Bradbury died because the obituaries said that this was his best work. I did not know what to expect.The book is about a future in which [almost] everyone live vicariously through the lives of others delivered via technology. The system prohibits independent thinking or feeling and actually used the fire department to burn up anyone that is a 'problem'.As I see more people (myself included) using their cell phones, social media, and on-line entertainment, I see our society moving in this direction. It is amazing to me that Bradbury created this dystopian vision many years in advance of the current technology that almost makes it possible today.
