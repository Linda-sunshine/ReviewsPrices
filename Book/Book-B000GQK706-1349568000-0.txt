review/summary: I couldn't be more satisfiedreview/text: Since I was a kid I've been a LotR geek. I had only bought the books once, but sadly about four to five years ago, my cousin borrowed the books... I knew what I was getting into, he was never gonna return the books (that is, it would take decades). So, recently, with all the expectation for the new Hobbit movie, I decided I had to reread the books, so I went to look on Amazon and found this. I love that it is the three-in-one version, with all the appendices included. The paper quality is very good and the smell... I love it! ;) A must have
