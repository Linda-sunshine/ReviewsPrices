review/summary: Original Poem In All It's Glory!review/text: When I heard that &#34;certain groups&#34; were looking to rewrite this beautiful classic, I immediately went on Amazon to purchase a non-edited copy for my grandson. I looked through a copy I found at warehouse store, and sure enough they had edited out the part of how St. Nick's pipe was blowing smoke wreaths round his head. I'm sure there are those who will argue with me about the PC of editing this piece out since smoking is bad for you, but I am equally sure that there are those out there who believe that there are certain classics that should be left alone, and that the parenting of children should be left to the parent. So if you are a parent or grand parent who loves this classic &#34;as is&#34;, who believes it's not going to send kids into a smoking frenzy, who believe that the Cookie Monster's love of cookies will not create vegetable-hating-cookie-addicted children, and are tired of being treated like complete idiots who cannot be trusted to raise their children properly, then you will love this age-old version. And, oh yeah, bonus,,,the illustrations are beautiful!
