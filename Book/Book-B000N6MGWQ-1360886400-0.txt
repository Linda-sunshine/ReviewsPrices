review/summary: A deep reading that causes you to reflect on your life.review/text: Mitch Albom is an incredible writer. I had trouble getting into this book at first, but as I read on, I could see how he was relating circumstances in his character's life is no different than the events in our own life which can impact other people's lives, both positive and negative.
