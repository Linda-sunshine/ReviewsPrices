review/summary: A Journey to Walk a Thousand Timesreview/text: I'm not exaggerating, you should read these books multiple times. Not only is the language beautifully orchestrated to give five-sense impressions in the nature of each character and place described, this thrilling, action-packed adventure grips the imagination and inspires the soul to new heights. Tolkien thoroughly immerses readers in cultures and places so believable and yet so unreal that you can't help traveling there again and again. These books aren't just stories, they're the surface of a world full of languages, histories, beliefs, cultures, friends, dangerous, and natures all their own. Appropriate for ages 12+, both boys and girls, and adutls at every age. Because of intense battle scenes and descriptive gore I would avoid for children younger than 12.
