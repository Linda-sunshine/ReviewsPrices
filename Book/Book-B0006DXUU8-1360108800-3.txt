review/summary: My Favorite X-Mas Talereview/text: This is my families favorite Christmas tale. After seeing countless versions and interpretations of the book in movies, plays and musicals I decided to buy the original. Dickens has a reputation of being a hard to read, but I did not feel this book fell in to that category. Overall, the interpretations are close to the book with minimal changes and/or variations. I did enjoy reading it.
