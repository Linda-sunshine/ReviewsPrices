review/summary: A wonderful story of the meaning of Christmasreview/text: I collect dvds of the multitudiness versions of this timeless classic, but always return to the original written story for a quick fix of the true meaning of Christmas (as opposed to, say, The Flintstones Christmas Carol?). A new-found belief in the basic goodness of humanity turns a bitter, lonely miser into a real human being, capable of giving and receiving love. What a theme!
