review/summary: Not my favorite Dickensreview/text: The one word I would use to describe this book is Narm. Yes, I know it's a classic, and yes I know Dickens is a great author, but sometimes his portrayal of things that are supposed to be emotionally affecting are just laughable. The portrayal of all children as perfect little angels becomes irritating, as are his portrayals of the Victorian Ideal Woman. If you want Dickens at his best, read The Tale of Two Cities or Great Expectations.
