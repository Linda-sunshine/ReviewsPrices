review/summary: Idle hands...review/text: A compelling book, creating within a desire - a thirst - for knowledge, and a sense of need - need to be an agent of change. Bradbury uses the illustration of an elder who has passed, and when the elder is passed, the mournfulness isn't for the elder but for the what the elder will never do again; hands that had always been active, creating, crafting, and mending would never again create, would never again craft, would never again mend, would never again influence the lives of those around them. For what will you be remembered; for what will you be mourned - for what will I be mourned.Read it - and be changed."And on either side of the river was there a tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."Rating System* = tripe** = okay read*** = good read**** = excellent read***** = life changing read
