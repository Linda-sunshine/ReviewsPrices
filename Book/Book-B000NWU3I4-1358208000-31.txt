review/summary: I just love the flow of the storyreview/text: It's all been said before. Great book, Great simple little story. I love the way this book flows when you read it. The only complaint I have is the songs they sing in the book. They are really awful and I always just skip them. That said I've read this book multiple times and Read it out loud to my kids when they were younger.
