review/summary: A good action ridereview/text: I like a good classic and this one fits the bill. I had read Edgar Rice Burroughs stories of Tarzan's adventures when I was younger and noticed this on Kindle for &#34;FREE&#34;. So I figured what the heck and added it. I had never seen the Disney movie version. It was a very good story that starts around the time of the civil war and takes you all the way to Mars. It was a great ride. I definantly recommend this one :)
