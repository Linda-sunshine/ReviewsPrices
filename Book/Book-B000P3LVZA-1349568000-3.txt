review/summary: Brave New Worldreview/text: I first read this book back in high school, about '75 and remembered it as being quite "weird", so now I am working in the school for the last ten years that I graduated from and the kids are reading it and really talking about it so I re-read it, still "weird" I can see why it was banned for a while. Strong character going through tough times.
