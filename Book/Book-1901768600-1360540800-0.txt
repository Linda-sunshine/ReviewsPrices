review/summary: Better each timereview/text: Though perhaps less full of quick wit than P&P, Persuasion is a better, more refined book. Anne is a less indulged Lizzie. Having never been her father's favorite she has learned a subtler, more patient way of living. A better role model, though more difficult to follow, her joys are truer for having been harder won.
