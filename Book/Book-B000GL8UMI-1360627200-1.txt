review/summary: Dystopian classicreview/text: I loved teaching this novel, and I love re-reading it. It's a prescient look at the impact of technology on our society and the way we define and view 'knowledge' -- and relationships. This novel rightly belongs on lists of great social treatises like Orwell's, Huxley's, and the like.
