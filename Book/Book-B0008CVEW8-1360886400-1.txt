review/summary: The classic adventurereview/text: Relive the adventure of the past. This is the classic adventure story from days gone by. Long before there was science fiction there was pirates and swashbuckling on the high seas of the Spanish Main. Return to the days of yesteryear and search for buried treasure, try to outwit the likes of Long John Silver as you join Jim Hawkins on Skull Island.
