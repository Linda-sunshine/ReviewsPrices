review/summary: Barbarareview/text: Absolutely loved this book. The members in our book club chose a classic to read. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Uncle Tom's Cabin. There are timeless lessons to be learned in Stowe's writing. What a courageous woman. It is worth your time to take a break from the more current writings and read this classic.
