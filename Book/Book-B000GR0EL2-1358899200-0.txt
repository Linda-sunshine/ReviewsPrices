review/summary: Great Readreview/text: This was an amazing book! So worth the purchase! There are so many nuggets of wisdom that Corrie learned during her time rescuing Jews and being in prison and concentrations camps that couldn't be learned without those experiences. This book also helped me learn about God too, and how powerful and loving he is.
