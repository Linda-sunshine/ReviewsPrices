review/summary: It's Okayreview/text: This is the 1st Jack Reacher book that I have read. It was interesting and was suppose to be a thriller which I usually love. However I felt as though this book fell flat.The book does move along and does unfold little by little but the entire book wraps up and exposes the truth in 2 pages.The one thing I did really like is that the main character didn&#8217;t come in to prove the bad guy didn&#8217;t do it. He was there to prove that he did do it and make sure he paid the price for it, which I found to be original. Kudos (not a spoiler because he states this fact pretty up front)If you like ex-military, gonna save the world all on my own characters then you will love this book.
