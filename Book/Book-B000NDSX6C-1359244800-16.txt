review/summary: Absolutely amazing!review/text: I can't express how truly delighted I was with the book although the loss of the dearly beloved Thorin, Kili, and Fili brought great sorrow and grief to me. In all essence it was spectacular grant it now it is time to worry wether the three heart-warming characters lost in the book will be lost in the movie as well..
