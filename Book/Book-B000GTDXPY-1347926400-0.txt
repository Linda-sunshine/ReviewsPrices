review/summary: Had me laughing out loudreview/text: This book was such a good read. I laughed out loud several times. When questioned by my husband, all I would say was Calamity Jayne and he understood I was enjoying it.This is chick lit that was very entertaining. I never knew what to expect next. I will be looking for more Jayne books.
