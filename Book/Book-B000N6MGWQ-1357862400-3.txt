review/summary: A feel-good story that will make you think about life.review/text: This story gives you a different perspective of looking at the after-life.I love how Mitch Albom wrote this wonderful story. Not only is this a feel-good book, but it will make you think about life; how you've changed or helped a life you may not have a clue about; how certain people are put into your life for a reason, some you know, some you don't, some came before your time but ultimately shaped it for your future.I recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a book to get lost in, make you think, and leave your life a little better because of reading it.
