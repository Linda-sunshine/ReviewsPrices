review/summary: I have the print and ebook versionsreview/text: I really enjoy this book and I am glad to have bought it for Kindle. I also bought the paperback version because my teacher did not allow electronics. While I am not in class I use the Kindle version and the pages correlate to the paperback version so I can always match my progress from the ebook to the paperback. For some reason I read the Kindle version much faster and this helps me with bulky reading assignments so this is great for me.
