review/summary: Strong themes but too verbose.review/text: Obviously, The Hobbit is a classic. This is my second time reading it, and the themes in the book are very strong and enjoyable. However, the language and style of writing used in Tolkien's day can feel clumsy to the modern reader (or at least to me). Sometimes the sheer length of his sentences impedes the fluency you would like to see in a book geared towards children. However, as a coming of age story, it is still worth reading.
