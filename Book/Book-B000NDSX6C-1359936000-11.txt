review/summary: There and Back Again.review/text: This was a delightful book, it had that uncanny ability to suck you in and wouldn't let you back out until your eyes were red and your imagination satisfied. Anyone looking for adventure as well as lessons that only adversity can teach should pick up this book. You won't be disappointed.
