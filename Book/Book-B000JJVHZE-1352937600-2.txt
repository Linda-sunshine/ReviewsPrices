review/summary: Classicreview/text: This is a classic. I read this as a sophomore in high school and it is the only book I have wanted to read twice. The symbolism throughout to the issues of the era is so incredible. I would definitely reccommend this book to everyone above the age of 14. It is such a great read. Scout is such an inspirational character.-Kaycedh
