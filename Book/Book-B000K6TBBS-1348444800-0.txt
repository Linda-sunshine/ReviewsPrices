review/summary: RUNNING BLINDreview/text: This 4th book started good with the killer talking but it went downhill from there. The storyline was slow & boring. The killer & the victims was dumb. It had no action at all. This is the worst book I read in this series so far. THE KILLING FLOOR, DIE TRYING, & TRIPWIRE is worth buying but don't waste your time or money on this one.
