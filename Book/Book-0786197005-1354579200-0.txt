review/summary: Lifelong fanreview/text: I've been a fan of ERB since I was a kid, having read all the Tarzan, John Carter, Carson of Venus... well you get the idea. This was my first &#34;purchase&#34; on my kindle, and it took me straight back to my youth, following along with John, Tars Tarkas, Deja Thoris, and my favorite, Woola. (In my opinion, Woola was the best sidekick / man's best friend in fiction until Harry Dresden's dog Mouse came along!)Thanks Amazon, for making this available for free!
