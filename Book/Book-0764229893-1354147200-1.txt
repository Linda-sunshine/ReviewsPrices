review/summary: Gods and Kings by Lynn Austinreview/text: I am so grateful for this book! I learned so much about the Old Testament from it. Things that I would have passed over when reading before now have meaning for me. For example, vassal, that meant nothing to me before reading this book. The names of the people I learned about have meaning for me now; when I read about them in the Bible I will feel familiar and more interested. I appreciate that she puts the scripture that she took the story from too. If the Old Testament seems boring to you, read this!
