review/summary: First book is better.review/text: Seems like Mr. Chapman copied much of his original book and then changed the pronouns to fit men. Some of the paragraphs were not changed, so it doesn't make much sense compared to the previous paragraphs because he changed from a man's point of view to a woman's. Even some of the stories were the same, which if you had not read the first book is fine, but the first book was much better for both genders. Personally I could have done without the religious justification but perhaps others will like that. The ideas are very good by themselves without religion. I would recommend the original book, but this book...not so much.
