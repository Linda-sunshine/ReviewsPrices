review/summary: I read this book in high school and reread for the author visit to Nashville. Yeah, I'd read it again and again.review/text: Margarent Atwood's writing expands the horizons of anyone's imagination. Her wit and ability to world build are masterful and an excellent and enjoyable way to study the realm of dystopia.
