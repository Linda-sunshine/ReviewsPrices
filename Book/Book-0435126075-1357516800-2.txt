review/summary: amazing bookreview/text: I was worried when I first started reading the book because my friend told me that it was slow paced. the courtship between two people was different back then than it is today so you have to be prepared for it. other than that small detail I completely loved the book. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are a great couple. I enjoyed it so much I read it again. if you are the kind of person to wonder how dating or romance happened then read this book; you will absolutely love the chemistry between the two.
