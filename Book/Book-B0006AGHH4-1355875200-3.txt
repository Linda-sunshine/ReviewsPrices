review/summary: Uncle Tom's Cabinreview/text: Uncle Tom's Cabin has to be one of the most heart wrenching books I've ever read. While I knew slaves were sometimes mistreated, I couldn't have imagined to what extent. Imagine having your husband or child taken from you and sold to the highest bidder. This is a real testament to the human spirit and a must read for all!
