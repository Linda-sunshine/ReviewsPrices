review/summary: This book is EXCELLENTreview/text: I was introduced to this book by a movie on TCM with the same name. The book is different from the movie in some of the character portrayals and chronology. The character portrayals are excellent because the poverty mentality is so real to life - some thrive, some overachieve, and some grow bitter. There is an alcoholic father. The reader gets to see him differently through the eyes of each character. Very well written. No sex or violence. No unpleasant graphic detail. For a real experience of the beauty of this story, read the book AND watch the movie. Can't say enough!!!
