review/summary: should be a required read along with Douglass' Narrativereview/text: I enjoyed this book very much. I know that Ms. Stowe wrote this book as an abolitionist who wished to wake up the nation in her time. I believe the book very much did that to some degree. I read this book immediately after reading Frederick Douglass' Narrative which is also a free Kindle book. I strongly believe that everyone should read both of these books. They should be read by school children and then discussed! Slavery is over but we still see the scars left by this evil institution. We have come a long way but there is room for much improvement.Uncle Tom's Cabin showed that &#34;normal&#34; respectable&#34; people were slave owners. There was a time in my own memory when &#34;respectable &#34; people refused service to others simply due to their color. I think it is important to remember that so that we can never allow it to happen again.
