review/summary: A bit of a surprisereview/text: I tend to purchase ebooks that are on special, aren't expensive and they mount up and by the time I finally read them I forget why I got them in the first place.I liked this book. It took a while to get into it, but once I did I was very interested in what was going to happen next. It has a marriage collapsing, a woman who practically worshipped a husband who didn't deserve it. And a little girl who seems to have an imaginary friend....but ends up being much more.
