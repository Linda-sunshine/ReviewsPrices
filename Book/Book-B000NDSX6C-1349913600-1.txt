review/summary: Movie Tie-In Editionreview/text: I ordered this edition because it is advertised as a movie tie-in edition, thinking it would have pictures from the movie in it. The only tie-in it has to the movie is the cover, everything else is the standard publication. I love this story and was quite disappointed to be misled.
