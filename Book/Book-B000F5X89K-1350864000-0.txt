review/summary: Great characters & relevent issuesreview/text: I enjoyed Frankenstein so much more than I initially expected. It took a little while to get used to her style of writing but once I did I was impressed with her descriptive style. Although the book was written almost two hundred years ago it raises questions that are still relevant. This was my book clubs selection and we had a lengthy and lively discussion!
