review/summary: Read for English Classreview/text: I had to buy this to read for English class, and I just have to say that this is one of the most moving books I have ever read. Wiesel's descriptions of his time in Auschwitz are deeply personal and incredibly insightful. I recommend this for anyone who wants to know the true nature of the Holocaust.
