review/summary: Enjoy a classicreview/text: Realizing I had never read anything by Charles Dickens, I decided to take a crack at this novella after I found it being offered for free on Amazon. If you've seen any of the dozens of adaptations of this classic, you know the story: A cruel miser is visited by ghosts of past, present and future on Christmas Eve and given a glimpse of the misery he has and will continue to cause if he doesn't change his ways.As far as the Dickensian style goes, I can see the reasons why it is both loved and hated. At times the tone is conversational, like Dickens is standing in front of you telling the story, which is something you're either going to love or hate. At times I got a little lost in the text, but I just see that as a byproduct of reading a book that was written in a very different time and place.That said, the themes are very familiar, especially in today's political climate. Scrooge's dialogue in the opening scene could easily be adapted for one of the talking heads of Fox News. I'm not trying to get political here. Scrooge is a worst case scenario cartoon rendering of a heartless rich guy, but then again, I feel like he sees the error of his ways just a little too easily.At the end of the day, what you have in A Christmas Carol is a modern fable, and unlike many cultural myths, the original text is here for your enjoyment and analysis. This book is responsible in large part for how we experience and imagine Christmas today, so the cultural themes are vital. It's also a short read, so you won't lose a lot of time seeing if you like it.
