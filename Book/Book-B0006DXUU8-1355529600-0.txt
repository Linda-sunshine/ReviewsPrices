review/summary: Delicious New Reading of an Absolute Classicreview/text: Nothing need be said about Dickens' prose: he is a master storyteller, with unforgettable characters and priceless descriptions of English life.What is new...and wonderful...is Curry. His acting is delightfully over the top, a fearless reading of the book. His voice breathes new life to the cliched portrayals of Scrooge, Cratchit, and the three Ghosts of Christmas. I listen to this reading each December, and it is an experience I look forward to all year long. This performance is perfect way to prepare your heart for the magic of Christmas.
