review/summary: 100 Words or Lessreview/text: Rand appeals to our basic selfish instinct: The strong succeed, the weak leech.That premise is the bulk of her intellectual prowess and many many years ago I found it interesting and alluring. Yet, with maturity, comes a better sense of how this world works.Regardless of all the political focus Rand seems to be getting lately, as a literary work this novel is mildly entertaining two-thirds of the way through and then falls apart. Then it's not about story or plot, it's about indoctrination. It's about propaganda. Okay, that's fine for the pulpit. But really sucks for a novel.
