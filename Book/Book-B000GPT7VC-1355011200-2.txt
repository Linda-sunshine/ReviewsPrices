review/summary: Please, may I give it SIX stars?review/text: May be my favourite novel of all times!! WOW!! I recommended to others and had comments like, 'I don't want to read anything else for awhile... I just want to hold onto this one... keep it in my heart.' If you don't shed tears and find this hard to put down... you're dead inside. Unbelievably gripping and moving. Challenges us to live better and stand up for what we believe... and maybe to believe what we believe a little deeper...
