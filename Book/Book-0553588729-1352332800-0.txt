review/summary: Just OKreview/text: This book contains a lot of filler...things like background stories that really don't have anything to do with solutions for a crying baby. Luckily, the chapters are labeled well so those parts can be skipped. Basically, you're reading one or two pages of real substance per chapter. This book has been made into DVD and is available on Netflix so I'd go that route before buying this book.
