review/summary: Glad to have been able to read this much talked about classicreview/text: Very well written, but I don't really care for deep philosophical/theological story lines. The ideology was a tad bit tiresome at times. I wanted to say &#34;you made your point already, move on&#34;. The author felt the need to harangue on every minute detail whether it was actually relevant to the purported outcome, or not. But, with that being said, I am glad I finally had a chance to read such a leagendary novel.Thank you.
