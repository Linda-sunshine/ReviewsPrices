review/summary: Elie Wieselreview/text: This book is very moving; having just traveled to Auschwitz and Auschwitz Birkenau where I learned of Elie Wiesel. It is extremely disheartening what atrocities occured but this gave the accounts from his perspective as a victim at Auschwitz & Auschwitz Birkenau.
