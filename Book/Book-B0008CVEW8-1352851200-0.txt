review/summary: Great attention to detail; bit drawn out out at timesreview/text: This is one of those classic books that I don't recall ever having read. There is great attention to detail and the characters are well developed although I did find at times that it was a bit too drawn out. I was grateful for being able to look up many of the old words words easily on the Kindle, and am glad that I finally got around to reading this pirate classic.
