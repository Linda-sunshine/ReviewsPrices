review/summary: Reacher rocksreview/text: Another great Reacher book from Lee Child. I was just told about the Reacher seriesearlier this year and have been hooked ever since. Love the underlying theme that copsand the FEDS are either corrupt, inept or hamstrung by politically motivated bossesand that the military runs circles around them. If we had real citizens like Jack Reacherour country would be a better place!
