review/summary: Still a masterpiece!review/text: I hadn't read Moby Dick since college, many years ago. Sitting on a plane in August, I glanced over at the book in my seat mate's hand. He also was reading Moby Dick! What are the chances of such a thing happening: two individuals, one in his twenties, one in her seventies, each reading for pleasure a book published long ago?Although there are long passages of the book with more detail than I perhaps wanted to plow through, the characters are marvelously drawn, the plot is famously wonderful, and there is even a good bit of humor. Moby Dick is still a great read.
