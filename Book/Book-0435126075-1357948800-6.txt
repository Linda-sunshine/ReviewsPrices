review/summary: Reviewing the version, not the book, I give it five stars.review/text: There are plenty of reviews of Pride and Prejudice, so I'll skip the book review, and just review the format.The move over to Kindle was pretty solid, and this is very readable both on the device and on my phone. Considering lots of free titles have pretty exaggerated formatting errors, or in the case of the play bookstore are direct photo copies of hard copies, this was extremely readable and deserves five stars as a solid port over.
