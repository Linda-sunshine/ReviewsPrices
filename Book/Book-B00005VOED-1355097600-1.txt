review/summary: Great Story about New Orleans and N'arlins' residentsreview/text: The story behind this novel is intriguing. [...] This novel won the Pulitzer Price for Fiction in 1981, and is now being made into a movie (Fall of 2012) with Zack Galafianakis reputed to play the lead character, Ignatius.Published 11 years after the author's suicide, it is considered a major Southern novel for the time period. If you think you know New Orleans from visits to the French Quarter during Mardi Gras, please read this novel.As this is about to become a major motion picture, now is a great time to read this timeless novel. At a minimum it makes for an interesting and fun novel. At its best it is a colorful and many say accurate depiction of New Orleans and many of the the unique personalities living there in the 1960's.
