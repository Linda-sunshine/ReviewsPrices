review/summary: Very happy I was assigned to read this.review/text: I was assigned to read this book for an English class in 7th grade. I am so happy I had an amazing teacher who truly knew a great book when she read one. I owe so many great reads to her. This is such an interesting book. It really takes you into a whole other world. I have to read the othe books too.
