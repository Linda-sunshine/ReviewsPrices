review/summary: Finally I understand what the Dickens-mania is all aboutreview/text: If you're like me, you were forced to read some Dickens in High School and found him to be pedantic and to sound archaic. What a pleasure it is to read him now. GE gives you a terrific story, wonderful use of language and insight into the lifestyle and prejudices of Victorian England. Unlike Jane Austen, this one works for the mature male reader. At this low price, it's a must read. Go for it.
