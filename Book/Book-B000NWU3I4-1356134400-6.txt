review/summary: Specialreview/text: A timeless classic that will transport you to a world full of hobbits, dwarfs, elves, goblins, trolls, wizards and dragons. This is a great book for adults and teens. Let your imagination shape the images of the hero's and villain's, as Bilbo and the dwarves try to complete their quest for their treasue under the mountain. A very special novel that is required reading if you intend to continue with the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
