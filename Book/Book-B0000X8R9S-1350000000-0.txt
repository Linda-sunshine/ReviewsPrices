review/summary: Really exciting book for younger kidsreview/text: Read this out loud to my younger boys, 7 and 10, and they loved it. Paulsen did a great job of connecting with the main character's emotional core, as well as directing the exciting, rollercoaster ride of having crashed in a plane and providing a litmus test for survival. Ordeal driven, the book is a wonderful lesson in perseverance and finding the will to live when seemingly every obstacle stands in your way. Fantastic book for kids.
