review/summary: Classic read, really???review/text: So I know that this is considered a classic book, I just assumed that meant it was supposed to be a good read. I cannot tell you how many times I just wanted to kill the main characters and be done with it. I only finished reading the book just to see if it EVER got any better. Also the writing of the local dialect of one of the characters I could not understand a single word. I hope that his converstions were not pivital to the plot point because I had to keep skipping every part in the book because I had no idea what he was saying. All I can say is Catherine needs to grow up and Heathcliff needs to get a life. Classic, yeah right!
