review/summary: Expectedly fantasticreview/text: There is nothing unexpected about the way Tolkien wrote this adventure. I read it after reading LOTR, and it does not disappoint.The dwarves are my favorite species in Middle-Earth and this book is just amazing from start to finish.I really think that this is a good family book, and I'm kind of sad that my father is not an avid reader. I would really have loved to share this adventure with someone who would be able to enjoy it as much as myself.Read this, the Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion and you will just hunger for more stories from Middle-Earth.
