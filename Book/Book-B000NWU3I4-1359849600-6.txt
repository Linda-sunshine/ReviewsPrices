review/summary: The Hobbit never gets old.review/text: When J.R.R Tolkien wrote the Hobbit little did he know of its future. That it became of favorite of the ages is in itself amazing when you think about books written. That it was the beginning of a larger tale was probably not even thought of. I have read this book at least 10 times in my life starting in High School years and years ago and I will read it again a few times before I die. The story is magnificent as are the characters. This book is highly recommended.
