review/summary: Classicreview/text: Picked this up during the hype of the John Carter movie release. The book is a wonderful classic science fiction story, but one should be aware of the time and society during which it was written. The characters do not have modern sensibilities regarding racism and sexism. Still the work is an enjoyable adventure through a rich world.
