review/summary: One of my favorite booksreview/text: It's been well over 10 years since I've read 'The Hobbit,' but it holds up remarkably well.But on the Kindle (iPad) version, there was a glitch that left the top paragraph smaller than the rest of the page text when I exited and came back to the app.
