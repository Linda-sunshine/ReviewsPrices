review/summary: Lovely narration, unabridged funreview/text: The story is wonderful, of course, and the narrator is fabulous. He uses just enough variation in his reading to identify characters without over-emoting and the singing was really well done. We listened to this the weekend before The Hobbit movie came out and the movie seems like a Silly Putty version of the novel with very small scenes stretched to ridiculous proportions. I prefer this original. Definitely worth buying.
