review/summary: Read It!!!review/text: I swore I wouldn't like this book, and I spent years trying to avoid it. I have a very short attention span and have always had difficulty with the verboseness of 19th century literature. But I was finally required to read this for a class so I was left with no choice.I am incredibly grateful I took that class. Once I got through chapter 1, I could not put this book down. Bront has a way of making your emotions go to war over even the most wicked characters. Wuthering Heights is daring, disturbing, and captivating. The psychology in this book is extraordinary and the plot will have you hooked.It is rare for a book to wrap up so flawlessly that you're left 100% satisfied, but Wuthering Heights was that book for me. Even my most cherished stories left me disappointed in some way or another. I couldn't describe the feeling I had when I finished reading Wuthering Heights. It really will test you, but if you want a story that doesn't play it safe, I say start reading this as soon as you can.
