review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: I read the Lord of the Rings and found that series very interesting so I thought the Hobbit would be a good read. It was on the same basis of Lord of the Rings and there was not as much action and suspence. It would be a good book for a younger child who wanted to read it then go onto the Lord of the rings. Also the Hobbit had many of the same things as in the other series so I found it repeative . It was well written so I would reccomend it to younger chilren.
