review/summary: A valued experiencereview/text: From the very beginning I couldn't put this book down. It was a beautifully written story of love, strength and courage. The characters were so real I could feel their every emotion as if I personally knew them. Although the scenery and technology were clearly those of the 1800s, I felt the story was really no different than a modern day love story.
