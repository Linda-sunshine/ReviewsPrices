review/summary: Nice keepsake copyreview/text: Got this as a gift for a family member and it's definitely a nice gift quality item. The hardcover book is a little larger than a standard hardcover and of nice quality, with heavy, smooth paper for the pages. The illustrations are slightly more sparse than I'd expected (considering it's technically a children's story) but are very well done and similar in style to the cover illustration. The book features large full color, full scene, full page illustrations in some places as well as smaller simpler illustrations more frequently. It's definitely a great version of the book to give as a gift to someone.
