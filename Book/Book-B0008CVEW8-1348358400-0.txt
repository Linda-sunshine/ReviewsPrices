review/summary: A good 'ol classicreview/text: I hadn't read Treasure Island in years but when I saw it on kindle I was successfully tempted. I was entranced all over again. The isolated inn. The dark night. The blind pirate tapping up the road. The BLACK SPOT! Stevenson was certainly a terrific writer and spinner of tales. Then off they go to the island where that parrot-shouldered, peg-legged character Long John Silver weaves his way from one side of the mutiny to the other. And do you remember old Ben, the marooned pirate in rags, dreaming of "cheese?" It was great fun to read Treasure Island again and I highly recommend it. Read it aloud to your kids!
