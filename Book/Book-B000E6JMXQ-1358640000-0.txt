review/summary: Oh yes.review/text: This could have just as well been titled The Incredible Journey. The cast of characters is small and nicely developed, especially Capt. Nemo, the heartless man with a heart. Be prepared for some serious underwater descriptions of flora and fauna which can bog down the story. There is also some incriminating statements of how man was treating the planet in Verne's day that doesn't seem to have changed much.
