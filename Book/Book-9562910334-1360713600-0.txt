review/summary: FIVE for '1984' and NINE for OBAMAreview/text: Previously read the entire book in the mid-60's; now once again, and it speaks so clearly of our current no-party government. Big Brother is to be identified as the collective of multinational corporations and the ultra-wealthy control freaks. The pendulum is beginning to swing the other way!
