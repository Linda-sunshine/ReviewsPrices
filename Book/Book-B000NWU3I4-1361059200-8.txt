review/summary: A classic fantasy, through and throughreview/text: It is refreshing to read a fantasy that is more or less black and white, where the good characters are good and the bad, bad, versus the more modern fantasies where there is little distinction between the good and bad. I look forward to reading this with my kids someday.
