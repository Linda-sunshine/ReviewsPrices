review/summary: Ending is obviousreview/text: I generally have liked the Jack Reacher books, and while totally too violent, at least keep you guessing as to the ending, which is usually fairly plausible. This is the only reason I have given it 2 stars instead of one. The ending is very obvious, as to who the killer is and like all of the other people wrote, it is totally implausible that none of the FBI agents would have noticed what was going on. The whole method of killing was ridiculous and made no sense and then .... now, for those who don't want to know the ending, don't read further........to blame it on hypnosis is ludicrous and a simplistic way to try to tie knots together. Obviously Lee Child doesn't know a thing about hypnosis, because it has been proven that while you can make people do silly tricks on stage, you can't make them do things that go against their character or will and the concept of these post hypnotic suggestions is totally bizarre. Maybe the novel should be called The Stepford Army Girls.
