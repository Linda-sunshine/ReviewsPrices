review/summary: Interesting, but now seems over done.review/text: I decided to re-read this book, since I can't really remember reading it in High School. I'd seen the move years ago, and barely remember it. However, the notion of "1984" and "Big Brother" are such colloquialisms, it feels like this book has been engrained in our culture somehow (which is ironically weird). Anyway, I enjoyed the book to a degree, but it now seems way over done for this day and age. I can see how this book would have helped spurn on 50's era McCarthy-ism anti-socialism. The writing style is excellent, and the main character, Winston, is very well done. He is completely believable, even if the setting and the premise of the book are way out there. Beyond that, everything in the book is just so over the top, it's hard to take seriously. The author does make a good point, which is something I didn't expect from this book. The idea that powerful people would occupy power, and construct a societal system which would allow them to stay in power, strictly for the purpose of power, is very profound. I remember thinking long ago how ridiculous it was that we could have video cameras and microphones all over the world, and some kind of network to allow monitoring of everything. Today we purchase devices from Google, Samsung, Motorola, and Apple with just such a capability, all of which are hooked into a world wide network where Google, Amazon, and others electronically analyze every bit of internet data they can get. I'm not into conspiracy theory, but I find it ironic that private industry seems to be moving in a similar direction that the INSOC government went in 1984.
