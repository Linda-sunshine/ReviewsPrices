review/summary: Good book, poor kindle formatingreview/text: I find the Jack Reacher books to be a quick and enjoyable read. This book is no different. It's not a deep book. Just good ol' fashion adventure and action fun. The story has enough mystery to keep it interesting, but not so convoluted and arcane to tax the mind that might want some relaxation after a tough day at work.Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the Kindle Version is formatted badly. There are no indents at the beginning of each paragraph (it's all left justified), making dialog exchanges and determining where new paragraphs begin a little to tricky at times. Hopefully we'll get a better formated version to "update" the one I just bought
