review/summary: By far the Best!review/text: I started out with the first Jack Reacher book by Lee Child intending to work my way through all of them. When I got to &#34;One Shot&#34;, I thought, &#34;Wow! This is the best one yet!&#34; I can see why they made a movie out of it! And I haven't seen the movie yet! Now I can't wait to see it!
