review/summary: I'm a Straight Male and I Love The Notebook.review/text: Ok I confessed it. I'm a straight male, and I love The Notebook. I'm not overly sensitive. I'm masculine and can sometimes come off as a jerk. Yet this story deeply touched me.I don't know how many times I have heard a girl claim that Nicholas Sparks is a phenomenal writer. Girlfriends, my mom, my sister, and every other woman I know that has read The Notebook have made that claim. Each time I heard that, I would immediately scoff and write it off as women's pornography. Finally, after years battling women over this, I decided to read it. After all, what's the big fuss all about?After the first couple pages I was hooked. I was embarrassed about being hooked, but I was hooked. His words were delectable. It wasn't poetry, but it was poetic. Some lines were such a treat that I had to read them out loud to fully soak them in. The characters were realistic. They wrestled with the topic of what would happen if you were face-to-face with your first love. At the same time, they didn't only romanticize it. There was pain when Allie was wrestling with her past love and her future fianc&eacute;. There was struggle as Noah in his old age tried to remind Alzheimer ridden Allie of their love.It was beautiful, yet tinged with sadness- a true romance tell. At the same time the author also bared his heart. What many people probably don't know is is that like Noah, Nicholas Sparks was crammed into a world that didn't let his art flourish (business). But he always found a way to remain faithful to his art. He actually wrote the notebook on his spare time when he wasn't doing pharmaceutical sales. That whole idea of struggle to define oneself when the world is pulling you in every other direction is clearly seen in this work.All I can say is read it. Male, female alike- read the notebook. It will touch your heart.
