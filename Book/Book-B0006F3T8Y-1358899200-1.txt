review/summary: Not my typical cup of tea but...review/text: I am not usually into this genre of books. I typically stick with murder/mystery books, but since this was a classic and was free, I decided to give it a try. I love it! The way Ms. Alcott developed these characters made me fall in love with them and think about them even when I wasn't actively reading the book. Once finished, I found myself wondering what happend next to the characters and how they lived the rest of their lives. Not something I usually think about after finishing a story. Beautiful book and beautifully written.
