review/summary: Plot and Structurereview/text: Burroughs' story "A Princess of Mars" is a fantastic adventure story that describes the main character John Carter's adventures on Mars. Carter is a civil war era soldier that finds himself unexpectedly thrust into an adventure on the planet Barsoom (Mars). The main conflict of the story is as basic as good versus evil, but Burroughs weaves in a complex set of virtues expected of a hero. He masterfully blends a warrior's virtue of courage, strength, and honor with those of a moral man of compassion, love, and self-sacrifice. These virtues are demonstrated through the obstacles John Carter faces while struggling to survive on an alien planet. To save his princess Dejah Thorris, John Carter must overcome the brutal green hordes, the red army of Zodanga, and find a way to save the dying planet of Barsoom (Mars).Burroughs' "A Princess of Mars" is the first of a twelve book series all of which are enjoyable to read. John Carter's skill in combat, honor and respect of others, and self-sacrificing attitude are displayed time and again through many adventures. Burroughs' surprise ending masterfully sets the stage for the next adventure of John Carter.
