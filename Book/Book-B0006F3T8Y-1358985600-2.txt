review/summary: Now one of my favorite booksreview/text: Where have I been? Or where has this book been all my life? I remembering hearing about it a little when I was younger and thinking it was fluffy boring stuff, but I love this book! It is now one of my favorites, right up there at the top with the Lord of the Rings trilogy and A Tale of Two Cities! Alcott's writing is not stiff or formal, but rather personable and believable. I fell in love with the March sisters and laughed at their idiosyncrasies and cried at their heartaches (I did!). There are even a couple parts in the book, relating to managing anger and nurturing marriage, that spoke deeply to me and have helped me in my personal life. Even the poetry "written" by the March sisters in different parts of the book are amazing.This is a must-read! It is also an easy read. Do not think for a moment of not reading it, because it is such a heart-warming tale of one beautiful family and how we can all triumph no matter our circumstances and achieve happiness. Love, love, love this book!
