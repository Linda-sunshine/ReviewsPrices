review/summary: Cruise is NO Jack Reacher!review/text: Love love LOVE all the Reacher novels. If you are a fan, then you'll understand why Tom Cruise is NO Jack Reacher. Impossible. Doesn't fit the description or who I've seen in my head for all these years. Besides . . . Jack Ryan, Ethan Hunt, etc. Just how many action figures can he play? He's the same guy over and over again. Enough. Is he even 6' tall? NO THANKS! I'll stick with the books.
