review/summary: One of the Best Booksreview/text: I bought this copy as a Christmas gift from my grandparents. They gave me an Amazon.com gift card to use because they wanted me to get a matching set. They were able to get the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the same cover art, but were unable to find The Hobbit with this cover in stores. It's a beautifully made book, and I like the larger print and style. The last copy I had was the small green covered copy, and it was a pain to try and read! So happy I got this book. :)
