review/summary: Wonderful book!review/text: Frankl underwent incredible horrors while living in the Nazi concentration camps of World War 2 Germany; yet he managed to maintain his focus on his own humanity while thoughtfully observing the behaviors of those around him who were also suffering. Frankl's logotherapy approach shows great insight into man's struggle to find purpose while giving hope and enlightenment.
