review/summary: A book to read several times in a lifetimereview/text: Frankl's masterpiece is a must read for anyone who studies the Holocaust. Frankl writes of the need to find meaning and the positive side and strength in the midst of the most dire circumstances. Even though it is relatively short, plan on spending some time with this book because you will constantly be reading, and re-reading each section because it is so meaningful. Perhaps the most powerful sentiment - "...everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."
