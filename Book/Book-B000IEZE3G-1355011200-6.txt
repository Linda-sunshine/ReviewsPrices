review/summary: Excellent, entertaining, and loads of funreview/text: I know I'm late to arrive on the Harry Potter bandwagon, but I couldn't find platform 9 3/4. In all seriousness though, I was hesitant to begin reading this series when it first came out, as I enjoy carrying my books in my purse and the Harry Potter books were too cumbersome to do as such. However, my recent purchase of a Kindle and the availability of the series in e-reader format gave the perfect opportunity. After finishing book one in less than two days, I can see that I will be continuing and finishing the entire series in no time. More than anything, I am excited to watch each film after finishing the book to compare and find similarities. I already see in this first novel where the movie stated relatively true to the text, rather than adding or indulging the author's truth. Can't wait to read more! Book two, here I come.
