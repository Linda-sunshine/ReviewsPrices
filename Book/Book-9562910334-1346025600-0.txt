review/summary: Good endingreview/text: When I decided to read this book, I was a little apprehensive. I was NOT a fan of Animal Farm so I wasn't sure what to expect with this novel. I ended up being pleasantly surprised.I'm sure other readers could see the end coming a mile away, but most of the time I'm so absorbed in what I'm reading I don't look that far ahead I loved the twist, I loved the premise, and I'm quickly deciding I overall love the dystopian genera in general!
