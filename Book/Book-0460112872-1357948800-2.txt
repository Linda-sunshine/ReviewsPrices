review/summary: An Endearing Classicreview/text: Jane Eyre is a wonderful story about love, tragedy, and faith. It invokes both tears of joy and tears of sorrow, and is inspirational in its religious messages. It is suspenseful, mysterious, and will keep you wondering and hoping until the very end.
