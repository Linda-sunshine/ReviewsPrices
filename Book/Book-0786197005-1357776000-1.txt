review/summary: An Old Friend With a Modern Updatereview/text: I haven't read this since high school and, since I can no longer find my old book club edition, it was the first book I obtained for my new Kindle. It's still a remarkably good read, given the age of the language and writing style. Given that everyone in the book is essentially buck naked, it's refreshingly chaste. Were A Princess of Mars to be written today, it would be filled with detailed descriptions of body parts and gratuitous sex. My only complaint centers on the illustrations that should have been there but weren't. But from some of the reviews I've read of versions with illustrations, it's probably better without them. I'm already well into The Gods of Mars....
