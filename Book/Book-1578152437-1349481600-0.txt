review/summary: Better when published the way Dickens meant it to bereview/text: (This is a review of the Kindle Serials edition of Oliver Twist.) I always had trouble plowing through 19th Century literature. Dickens seemed to be a genius story teller but the arc of his novels seemed wrong somehow. Reading Oliver Twist in the same pattern of installments it was written for in the first place makes it into a different reading experience. I hesitate to say this but I felt it was a different book when read this way. Apparently Dickens knew what he was doing but until now we had no way to get the books in the serial format the author wrote them.I hope Amazon will publish the rest of Dickens' works as serials. They really are better this way.
