review/summary: Mehreview/text: Had to read it for a class called American Women Writers. There is a lot of sentimentality in this book, which was effective for Stowe's anti-slavery agenda of the time. However, as an English major, I don't particularly enjoy sentimentality...I do think this is an important book that needs to be read, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed it.
