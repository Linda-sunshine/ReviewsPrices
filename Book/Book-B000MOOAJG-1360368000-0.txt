review/summary: atlas shrugged revisitedreview/text: When I was in my twenties (1973) I have read the books of Ayen Rand, awsome and inspriing. Now I have read atlas shrugged again. It is still inspiring, but it is a bit broad, some peices I skipped.The message is still very clear: do your utmost and be honest and your will win.I loved to read it again and I give 4 stars and not 5 because of the lengthy parts.Meta
