review/summary: Pointlessreview/text: I was forced to read this for english because apparently that's what it takes to be somebody in life. (Sarcasm at its finest.) I would rather stare at a Big Mac than read this book, and I can't stand McDonalds. Obviously, no one will read this book for pleasure, or at least no one I want to know. It's your money. Do what you want with it.
