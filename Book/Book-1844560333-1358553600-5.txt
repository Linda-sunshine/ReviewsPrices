review/summary: A staple in any libraryreview/text: Jane Austen has created a masterpiece that every girl should read at least once in their lifetime. I myself have read it at least twice per year since the age of sixteen. The characters are extremely well developed and the time period well defined. One of the best books of the period to be sure. Mr. Darcy is sure to win the hearts of every girl who reads about him. Emma is the next best book to follow up with, in my opinion.
