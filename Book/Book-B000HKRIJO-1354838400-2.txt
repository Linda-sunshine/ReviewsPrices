review/summary: Still relevant (or perhaps even more) todayreview/text: Of all the philosophy books I have read, Christian or otherwise, this one sticks out in my mind as the most memorable. I was greatly affected by Lewis' style of reasoning. He uses finely-tuned analogies and plain language to get the reader to see things from a point of view they may not have considered before. This book really gets to the fundamentals of Christianity in a common sensical way. It is an especially great read for 3 types of people:- A new believer trying to understand the faith more (which is how I found myself reading the book the first time)- A non-believer who is simply curious and wants to gain some insight into what all these crazy Christians are always harping on about- A mature believer who wants to--indeed, needs to--revisit the fundamentals of his faith (which is how I found myself reading the book the second time)
