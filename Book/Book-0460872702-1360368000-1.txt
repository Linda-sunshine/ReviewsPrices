review/summary: As Important Today As It Was 90 Years Agoreview/text: I remember reading this book a long time ago in high school and, like many books in high school, I detested it, holding any teacher's attempts to explain a book's themes and symbols as a colossal waste of time. Now that I am a little older and wiser, I understand what Fitzgerald was getting at. Many American's have their own green light, their "American Dream" that they are always reaching for, but may never attain or may attain only to be left wondering, like Jay Gatsby, was it worth it? This is a great reflection on the American Dream, as all the great works of American literature are. The tragedy of Gatsby's life and longing are only enhanced because of the fact that every American has their own dream. And Fitzgerald's reflections on the moral wasteland that made up the wealthy's lifestyle in the 1920s has as much resonance today, post-2008 stock market crash, as it did 90 years ago. And while I wouldn't go so far as to call this book "The Great American Novel" as others have, I do believe that a new generation of Americans, traumatized by the Wall Street bailout and the economic disparity between the rich and the poor in this country, will find new meaning in this classic work.
