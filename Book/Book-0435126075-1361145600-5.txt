review/summary: Revisiting a secondary-school borereview/text: Okay, I'll admit that at 14 y o and interested in modern biographies and war stories, Pride & Prejudice bored me stupid.Re-reading it now (from a sense of obligation) I actually can see the humour in it, the easy development of characters and their relationships and interactions.I can now identify characters to loathe (the girls' mother) and which I can like.But I guess it will never be more than a tedious &#34;okay&#34;, I guess.
