review/summary: A Classic from a Wounded Heartreview/text: This is a very strong emotional book. Harriet Beecher Stowe's style of writing is so fluid and enjoyable at the same time. I realy savored reading some passages more than once. This book is a historical treasure and also an educational reading. Harriet herself being a devoted Abolitionist long before the Emancipation Proclamation became the reality, spoke those words right out of her heart.Regards!Al Narani
