review/summary: How to win Frineds and influence people.review/text: I have throughly enjoyed reading this book. The author really explains the way your language to yourself and to others help to create the way people treat you or themselves.I would recommend this to anyone in business or has to deal with people in their day to day affairs. Just a few pages of this book and I realized that I need to have others feel important, because they are important, and when they feel that way, they will go out of their way to help you.In our society today, we all think about "me". This book teaches you to think about them to help the "me" get what they need.
