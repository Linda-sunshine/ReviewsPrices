review/summary: His books are his revenge, and Night is his best revenge.review/text: Although Night was written in 1958, it first came to my attention in 2006, when Oprah chose it for her book club. Earlier this year, I attended The Chicago Humanities Festival presentation of the annual Chicago Tribune Literary Prize. The recipient was Elie Wiesel. The interviewer asked Wiesel many poignant questions, including why he hadn't sought revenge for the horrors he experienced during the Holocaust. Wiesel answered: &#34;My response to the tragedy was my books.&#34; If you only read one book by this author, make it this autobiographical story of a teen-age boy who survived horrific abuse in the Nazi death camps. Although I&#8217;ve read other books by the author since then, this is the most powerful. Night is short, but it&#8217;s more engaging than books four times as long. Wiesel wrote Night so that the world would never forget the Holocaust. His books are his revenge, and in my opinion, Night is his best revenge.
