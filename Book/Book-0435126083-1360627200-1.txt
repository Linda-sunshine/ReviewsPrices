review/summary: Cry in happiness and sorrowreview/text: By sense we all share that of hurt feelings from friends but from those we consider family cut the deepest and sometimes can not be forgotten even though forgiven. We should all learn a thing or two from the characters in this book. A wonderful read and a lesson for all.
