review/summary: Epic Adventurereview/text: I read this book for a Coursera class: Fantasy and Science Fiction. The story is captivating and dynamic. John Carter is a wonderful, romantic hero. Burroughs seamlessly weaves together the history and culture of the Red and Green Martians and the story is jam packed with action. I can't wait to read the next book in the series!
