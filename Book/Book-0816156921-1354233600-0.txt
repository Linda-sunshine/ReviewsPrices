review/summary: Amazing book, must read!review/text: I bought this on Audible the full cast version that is what I am reviewing. I want to give this book as many stars as possible because it was one of the most amazing books I have ever read! I am not sure that I would feel the same if I read it instead of listening to it but I am pretty sure I would have.I have never read this book because I am not a huge fan of Vampires and it usually takes a great story for me to read one but I kept hearing "I am shocked you have never read Dracula before" a lot so when I seen and audio book with a full cast I had to give it a try! :)I don't know that I would say it is a horror book because non of it is super scary but all of it is suspenseful and makes you want to keep reading. Loved the way they talked and described everything it makes you feel like you are teleported back in time.Great classic and now one of my favorite all time books.
