review/summary: very well written but kind of lacks a pointreview/text: This short, depressing and harrowing tale is very well written. The text flows smoothly, thoughts are well addressed and the horror is very well conveyed. My main issue is that once you've read it you're just left in a depressed mood with no real insight or revelation just a bleak reminder of a very horrific tragedy.It's gruesome scene after gruesome scene on every page and by the end you're mentally exhausted from imagining the toll of terror that had taken place but that's it. You just feel bad and that's not a read that I'd recommend.I had been recommended this book by several people and I saw it was very famous of several lists so I was hoping for something a lot more. I was not aware this was a trilogy until after I finished reading this first book so I will finish the series and hope that it gets better along with some more depth and purpose. The excuse I saw one lecturer reply with was `sometimes we need to feel bad for the sake of feeling bad'. I strongly disagree that that statement would apply to this book, yes, feeling bad can be eye opening for certain occasions but this is not one of them
