review/summary: Beautiful! Yet Heartbreaking!review/text: When I was given this book from my English Teacher last year I was scared to even turn the page. My love for reading and learning give me a new perspective everywhere I go but just after reading the first page I knew it was going to be hard to continue.This book made my heart race with tears spewing down my cheeks. I just couldn't continue reading but I had to. I know a book is different than the actual event that occurred in real life but it was the closets I would ever get to know how it felt to be in Elie's position or anyone else's.After being separated from his family and living through near death situations a am thankful that Elie Wiesel made it through during the Holocaust and I prey to the millions of Jews and other people that have died in there innocents.
