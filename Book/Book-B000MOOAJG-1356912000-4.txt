review/summary: More relevant now than perhaps ever before...review/text: An entertaining and eye opening book that brilliantly illustrates the struggle between statism and free markets. In the current environment where global governments are feverishly working to firm up an iron grip on the citizenry and amass new powers to maintain state control over virtually all aspects of life and freedom, there's never been a more interesting time to pick up Atlas Shrugged.
