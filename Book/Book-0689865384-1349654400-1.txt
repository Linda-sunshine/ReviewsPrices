review/summary: I want to be Pretty!review/text: This is a unique take in a dystopian novel. Most people wouldn't have an issue about being turned pretty. Some things are worth staying ugly for...The characters were easy to relate to. Shay is carefree and doesn't think about the ramifications of her actions. She's indecisive, and fun. David is sweet but can be a jerk, not that I blame him. I would have acted like one too. He acts like he carries the weight of the world on his shoulders. Teenagers shouldn't be that stressed. Tally was a refreshing main character. It's nice to see female characters that aren't over-confident. Some of her actions are also completely selfish. I know those aren't great traits, but there's only so many times you can read about a character that's self-sacrificing from the very beginning. It can get monotonous. So it's nice to see a character with weaknesses we all deal with on a mostly daily basis.The story line was slow paced. I didn't mind this because Westerfeld did a great job with the world building. I could picture the rusty ruins easily. Most of the focus is on how Tally deals with the decisions she's made and her growth as a person.This wasn't the best dystopian I've read, but it kept my attention and I'll be reading the sequel, Pretties.
