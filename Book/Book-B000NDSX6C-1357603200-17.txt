review/summary: Good readingreview/text: I bought this book after reading the Lord of the Rings. A good beginning and introduction to meeting Bilbo Baggins. After reading the book I have a new found respect for him. Smart and witty. Very brave in the end. If you have read LotR. A good book to follow.
