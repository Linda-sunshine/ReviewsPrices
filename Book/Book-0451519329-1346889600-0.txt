review/summary: Beyond my expectations!review/text: Our book group decided to read a book by Charles Dickens in this the bicentenary of his birth. I had read some books by Dickens when at school and found them rather dry so chose Great Expectations because it was one I hadn't previously read. To my surprise I really enjoyed it especially the language used and the unusual characters.
