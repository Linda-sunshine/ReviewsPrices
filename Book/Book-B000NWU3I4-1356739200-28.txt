review/summary: The 'Original'review/text: My mother started reading this to us when I was about 5 years old; we all finished it on our own before the year was out. Engaging characters and an entire new world; this story was the basis for most of the grand adventure fantasy that has been written in the last fifty years. I used to re-read it yearly, now it's only about every 4-5 years...Excellent story.
