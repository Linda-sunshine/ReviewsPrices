review/summary: Another Austen gem of love and languagereview/text: This fully satisfying tale of destined romance is sure to please. Austen's tale of true-love's fulfillment impeded by the perceptions of others' views about the appropriateness of the parties involved leaves the reader questioning his or her own pursuits of love.Austen writes of the how the road to one's soul-mate sometimes takes a long and twisted journey, through time, one's self-doubts, and the perception of others. It may take Anne and Capt. Bentwick over eight years, but true love prevails as Austen's fans all know.Also, Austen takes her sharp-witted pen once again to people's views of love, social climbing, societal views on women, and status-bound troglodytes. Austen still inspires today readers to question his or her own motives in love, as well as the motives of others.Finally, Austen wraps this beautiful tale of true love in the exquisiteness of her style--both vividly concrete and syntactically challenging--and her character study of the status-quo breaking heroine.
