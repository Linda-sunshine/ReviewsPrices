review/summary: Slaugterhouse Fivereview/text: I missed this in the 60's...so now I'm reading everything Vonnegut has written. The newspaper compact style is what I love and will emulate where possible. Thought provoking with high impact. Dresden relived with unknown insights from the writter. Billy Pilgrim could be anyone's neighbor...but with a deep and dark past. Thanks
