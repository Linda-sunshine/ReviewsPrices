review/summary: First part of the ringsreview/text: The Hobbit, the first part of the Rings Trilogy, was a fun and entertaining escape novel. But I was surprised that it didn't give us much of the story behind the ring or its evil power. In fact, it seemed in this story to be relatively harmless and actually quite helpful for Mr. Baggins. There was none of the ominous dread of the dark forces finding its bearer. Even Gollum did not play much of a part except at the beginning when Bilbo first finds the ring and finds out its secret power of invisibility.
