review/summary: Mind bending bookreview/text: Alice in wonderland is one of those flights of fantasy which appear to come from an extremely creative imagination.There is some very interesting life metaphors in the language used by Alice and the Caterpillar, as well as between Alice and the Cheshire cat, my favourite parts of the book were the dialogue.
