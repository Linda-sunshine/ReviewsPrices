review/summary: Brilliantreview/text: The hobbit and the lord of the rings have been my two top fantasy novels of all time for as long as I can remember. The characters, creatures and story literally created the fantasy genre and is the setting stone for all the great fantasy novels that exist today.I recommend this book to anyone who is looking forward to December 14th because you must read the book before seeing the movie.
