review/summary: interestingreview/text: i read this book at about 13 years old the first time i felt as though the book captured what it was to be in a dream as a child.Now that i'm older and have learned some interesting things about Mr. Carroll iv picked up some very adult themes and messages that drift across the pages. i love this book in almost every way it can be interpreted. Beautiful&lt;3
