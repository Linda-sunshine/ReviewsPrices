review/summary: LOVE!!review/text: I heard about this book completely randomly (aka the Lord put it in my life for a reason) I have always been asked why I was getting upset at previous boyfriends and I never knew how to put it into words. Come to find out none of them were speaking my love language. This book gives great insight into yourself and also how to love a significant other. I recommend this book to anyone in a relationship no matter it be dating or married for years. It is an easy read!
