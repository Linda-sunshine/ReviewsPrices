review/summary: Simple, lightweight, portable, excellent versionreview/text: This version appears true to the original text. The message is inspirational. Your thoughts shape your destiny. What you think you become. Guide your thoughts, reach your destiny. Raise your thoughts and enjoy the fruits of your efforts. Wallow in self pity, sloth and base desires and your life will reflect those desires. Unlike versions that try to fancy up the text by pulling out selected quotes and adding fancy borders or photos, this version gives you the straight words without distractions.
