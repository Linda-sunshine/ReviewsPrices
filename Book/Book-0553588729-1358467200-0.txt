review/summary: Some good ideas!review/text: While this book had some incredibly helpful ideas, as far as how to calm a newborn and how to get them to sleep, I was offended by some other content in this book. There were many, many references to cavemen and evolution, which I thought very much took away from the truth and beauty of the God-given creation and growth of a baby boy or girl. However, if I am strictly going on the practical ideas contained in the book, they were very good, and I plan on using them as a first time mom. But, as far as other content, and the theories and worldview contained in this book, it was not encouraging.
