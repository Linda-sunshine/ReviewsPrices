review/summary: The Great American Novelreview/text: Great novels are about things. The things they are about are provoking thought or providing illumination on some aspect of the human heart or the human condition. Additionally, a great novel will always evoke an emotional reaction in the reader, whether good or bad. Gatsby was intended by the author from the start to be a serious work of art for adult consumption, Fitzgerald was reaching for greatness. While books like "Harry Potter" or even "Lord of the Rings" may be a fine entertainment, in the end they are just a collection of ingeniously crafted plot points with relateable and entertaining characters. There is nothing wrong with this, people need and enjoy pap, but sometimes it's good to have a book or even a film challenge you to think about things more deeply.For any high schoolers "forced" to read this, let me say this. You will not "get" this book. This is not due to any intellectual or moral deficiency. A 17-year old Steven Hawking or Einstein would fare no better. This is not because the book is even slightly difficult to read, comprehend, or follow. On the contrary, the book is an easy read that does not have difficult language or elaborate plot intricacies. Many of you might still like and enjoy the book highly, I know I did in high school. Many will intellectually understand the themes or symbollism, because they are not complex, in fact they are very simple and straightforward, which is what makes this novel so great. But you won't really feel it in your heart, because when you are younger you don't yet have the tools to fully appreciate this book. Do yourself a favor. Reread this book after the age of 30, and just let your mind soak it in for the pure enjoyment of it.
