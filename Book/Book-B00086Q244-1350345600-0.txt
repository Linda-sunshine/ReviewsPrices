review/summary: Very Goodreview/text: This is still a timely book. Just one caveat: this doesn't work on those with anti-social folks with severe personality issues. This is not therapy! Take great interest in what anyone tells you. True most folks are NOT interested in what you have to say. But, they will if show that you care.
