review/summary: 50th Annv Ed Sgl Vol Boxreview/text: There's no need in reviewing LOTR, so I wanted to clarify this 50th anniversary edition single volume box (Houghton-Mifflin 2004)* Dark grey color made of suede-like material; soft, smooth feel in the hands (not genuine leather/suede)* As in the description, it has gilded edges, red ribbon marker, two large fold out maps, appendices packed with info including family trees, etc.* Nice materials, well constructed; will last for many, many years* Fits snug in it's sturdy matching box* Larger type is easy on the eyes* Size and weight better than I expected. No issues reading in a recliner or bed with a lap pillow to prop up for right viewing angle (as I read most books for hours at a time)I am very pleased with this edition and highly recommend it to anyone wishing to purchase LOTR. All the "extras" in it plus being fully corrected make this edition superior. If I had to purchase LOTR again, I would get this one without hesitation.
