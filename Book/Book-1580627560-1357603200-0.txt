review/summary: Funny and informativereview/text: I read this for fun and think it is very well written. I've read some reviews that say the book is contradicting or teaching women to be bitches. I feel it's teaching independence and to not be an air head. I used to be that woman who would wait on my man hand and foot...which is probably why we are getting divorced. I know now to just be an independent and the right man will just be a positive addition to my life. It was funny to read the stuff I use to do and understand why certain things happened because of it. Anyway, a good read &#128515;
