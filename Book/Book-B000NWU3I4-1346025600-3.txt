review/summary: Literary pleasure at its bestreview/text: I'm not going to try to pretend that I can write something very original on this literary gem. The only way to describe the joy it gives is to give a nice copy to the other party and let her read the book, or rather let her enter the wonderful world created by Tolkien. I'm impatiently waiting for my son to grow up, so that I can read this to him. I don't know who'll enjoy Tolkien's world more, he or I, but I'm sure we'll come across this masterpiece more than once. And who is to complain, anyway?
