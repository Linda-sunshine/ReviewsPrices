review/summary: Great gift!review/text: I gave this as a gift to someone who already owns a copy of The Hobbit and he loved it. He really enjoyed the drawings and pictures that were included in this edition as well as the information provided in the annotations. He said it breathed new life into one of his favorite novels!
