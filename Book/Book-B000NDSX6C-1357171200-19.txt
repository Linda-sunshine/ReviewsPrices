review/summary: Excellent giftreview/text: This was well-received by a 14-year old who had read some of the Lord of the Rings, but is generally more inclined towards electronic devices than books. It is nicely bound, and was fully appreciated by the gift recipient, which was a pleasant surprise. The illustrations are nicely done and the print is sufficiently large, adding to the look of the volume and the value of the purchase.
