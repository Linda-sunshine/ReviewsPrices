review/summary: Amazing:)review/text: I have read this book several times and it seems to get better each time! I love this story! Very different tone than the Lord of the Rings, after learning more about JRR Tolkien it makes total sense. The Hobbit was written to a younger audience who would be adults by the time Lord of the Rings was published. Amazing, talk about attention to detail.Read this book if you haven't yet, it is simply fantastic. There is beautiful imagery, sword fights, dragons and trolls, what's not to love.
