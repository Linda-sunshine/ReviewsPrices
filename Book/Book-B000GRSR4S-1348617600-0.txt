review/summary: Simply Greatreview/text: One of the greatest American novels of all time.This book is funny, serious, makes you think, inventive, and the writing is great.This and Cat's Cradle are my favorite Vonnegut books, and are among my favorite books of all time.I'm not going to go into the plot as many reviewers have done so already. I just wanted to express my appreciation for this wonderful novel.God Bless you, Mr Vonnegut!
