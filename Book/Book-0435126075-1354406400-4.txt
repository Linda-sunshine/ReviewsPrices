review/summary: A classic, and my favereview/text: I've always loved this book, from the moment I had to read in high school, and every subsequent reading thereafter. It's the greatest romance ever written, in my humble opinion. Austen is an excellent writer, sprinkling her work with surprisingly profound assertions, and witty one-liners alike. I would recommend to anyone.
