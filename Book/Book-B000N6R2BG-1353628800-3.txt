review/summary: Great story except for the endingreview/text: I loved the story and all the complicated plots and viewpoints. Very well written and really took me on an emotional and spiritual journey. The last few pages were really disappointing. The ending could have been so much more profound and satisfying. Oh well, still an enjoyable and thought provoking read.
