review/summary: Amazingreview/text: "The Five Love Languages" is the best book on marriage communication I have ever read. The brilliance is in its easy to apply simplicity. Mr Chapman has really discovered a tool for marriage that can and has saved thousands of marriages. It has definitely been a savior to my marriage. Thanks to this book I've rekindled the love and romance in my marriage that I thought might never come back. My wife and I feel truly blessed.
