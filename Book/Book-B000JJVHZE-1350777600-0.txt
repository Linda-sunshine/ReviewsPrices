review/summary: To Kill a Mockingbirdreview/text: This audio version of To Kill a Mockingbird featuring Sissy Spacek reading this classic is a must have. Especially if you drive often, or have a long commute to and from work. Sissy's southern roots give life to this story of a young six-year-old girl living in 1932 small town in Alabama. This was simply how it was back in those days. Even if you have read the book, I recommend getting this audio version; it's a whole deferent view of this classic masterpiece
