review/summary: i want to live in the brave new worldreview/text: maybe im crazy but what is wrong with endless casual sex, drugs with no bad side wffects, no hard labor and so on? they dont torture you like in 1984 if you dont agree theyjust send you away to live with other like minded people so you do have choice. ok so the duplicated endlessly breeded laborers arent so great but thats minor and they can fix that. but seriously book still holds up pretty well except zome of the narration style felt awkward but still good.
