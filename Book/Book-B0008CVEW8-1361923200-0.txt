review/summary: A mustreview/text: It's a classic ! I love RL Stevenson's writting. The use of some nautical words sent me to the dictionary so it was also a learning experience, (in case I'm ever on a Pirate ship I'll know what they are talking about) ! If you've never read it, you must, if it's been quite awhile, do it now. A super read.
