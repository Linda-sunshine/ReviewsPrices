review/summary: not my favorite austenreview/text: i think this is the worst of the austen novels for me,alot of people choose this novel. as their favorite, my favorite,1-emma,2-mansfield park,3-northanger abbey 4-sense amd sensibilty, 5-pride and predjudice 6-perssuation ,. i think this novel is dry,and not alot happens.although i am still an austen fan, this one is my least favorite.so i recommend, if you have never read an austen novel, please do not start with this one, i would start with her best known novels , sense and sensibilty or pride and predjudice and save persuaition for last. also keep in mind her novels are about middle-class or upper middle class girls looking for marriage.
