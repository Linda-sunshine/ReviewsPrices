review/summary: America todayreview/text: I fond this book to be dangerously close to where america is heading. This government currently running the country keeps saying that the wealthy which have been more blessed and fortunate need to pay there fair share.What is fair and who decides?There is a tipping point that can become unfair,and those that are not fortunate but are successful will begin to feel like slaves to the needy that keep needing .The successful eventually will grow tired of it and stop producing.America is $16 trillion in debt and still spending.If the successful stop producing and America keeps spending we will know how things play out in the end.Atlas shrugged lays it all out very well.
