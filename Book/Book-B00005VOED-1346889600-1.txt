review/summary: REVIEW FOR CODreview/text: Very odd book but highly entertaining. Never have met or read a character like Ignatius. I would highly recommended this book, but only if you really like to read. This isn't your average book and therefor needs the reader to have an open mind. It is extremely funny though!
