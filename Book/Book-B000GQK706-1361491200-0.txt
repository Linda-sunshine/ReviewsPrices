review/summary: The Best There Isreview/text: What's better than The Lord of the Rings? The Lord of the Rings in one volume, is what! No need to pause between The Two Towers and The Return of the King: just keep reading! My only problem with this bundled set is that when I got to the end, I wanted to just scroll back to the beginning and start over again. So why didn't I? Because I have so many unread books waiting for me, and I've already read The Rings at least four times. Now I've got it! I'll set it aside and use it for a reward, for having read oh, let's say four more books.
