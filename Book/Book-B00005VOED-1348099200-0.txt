review/summary: Classic American Tragicomedyreview/text: "A Confederacy of Dunces" is as funny as it is sad, and as endearing as it is heartbreaking. It's a skillfully written book, full of bizarre people with outlandish motives doing strange things in a nutty place. Author Toole captures, orchestrates and conveys all that mayhem brilliantly. This book is entertaining, thoughtful, and well worth reading. Enjoy it.
