review/summary: praise for Tolkienreview/text: I first read this book in 1967, I think and it set me up for a lifetime love of fantasy and especially J.R.R; Tolkien. I have reread it many times over the years, and just finished rereading it in preparation to seeing the new movie. I can hardly wait to see Gollum again! Tolkien set the standard for fantasy, and I find it hard to read anything else that lives up to his model.
