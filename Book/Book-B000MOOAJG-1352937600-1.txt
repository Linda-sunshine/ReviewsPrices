review/summary: Ayn Rand nails it.review/text: 50 years later, it's playing out. It's an amazing book and gives a unique perspective on just how far some are willing to go to get to a "utopia".Quite simply, to save one person, they are willing to have the government murder dozens of others.You are not a slave. Don't allow yourself to be treated like one.
