review/summary: Moby Dickreview/text: This is a masterful tale of a man and his obsession with revenge for the loss of his leg. Melville includes much on the science of whales,at the time of writing this novel, and the art of Whale hunting. He is very humorous in his story telling, and very deep in his study of human behavior.This is a very good read.
