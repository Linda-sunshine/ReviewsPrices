review/summary: Extraordinaryreview/text: I have a difficult time with reading and watching things about the Holocaust. Viktor Frankl's accounts are intense and disturbing, but only by description in service of his supporting how finding purpose in the darkest circumstances can for for the human spirit, and ultimately survival. It is not a book about the suffering and the horror. In fact, his writing about his years in the camps offers a perspective that few could ever come to on their own. His conviction that a fulfilled life comes from finding meaning in what one does, day to day, is convincing and I have seen it played out in my life, with my friends, and in my work time and time again. It is not a treatise on finding an overarching meaning for one's life as a whole &#8211; that would be overwhelming &#8211; and he insists not possible until our death. It is a must read if one in interested in looking and moving forward, and not wallowing in the past. Actually, it's a must read for them, too.
