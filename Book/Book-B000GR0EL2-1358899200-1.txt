review/summary: Absolute LIFE in the hardest circumstancesreview/text: *Whatever in Life is hardest to bear, LOVE can transform to Beauty!*What feeds the soul matters as much as what feeds the body.*Happiness is Not determined by our circumstances/surroundings, it is something we make INSIDE ourselves!*And so I discovered that it is not our forgiveness anymore than our goodness the as t the world's healing hinges... but on God's. When He tells us to LOVE your enemies, He gives, along with the command, the LOVE itself!!!My grandparents worked with the Jews for 40 yrs, and met Corrie Ten Boom ... the DESTINY/Legacy Is going to be carried on through me for Millions of souls to Know Jesus Like Never before!!!Such a Blessed Reminder for Enduring Strength!!!
