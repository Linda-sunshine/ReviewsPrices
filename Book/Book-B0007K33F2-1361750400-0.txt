review/summary: Fantastic Classic, Best Versionreview/text: The greatest story of revenge ever told! The un-abridged version is the only way to go with this book. The everyman's library hardcover is a beautiful book with very nice pages. It is a very sleek stylish looking book too when you remove the cover slip.
