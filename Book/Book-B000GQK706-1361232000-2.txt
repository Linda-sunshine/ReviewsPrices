review/summary: Outstanding Quality!review/text: I've owned collector's editions of JRR Tolkien's works for years. My wife was recently inspired to take up the series and we were looking for a set of Lord of the Rings in three books with larger print. Not only does this set meet that criteria, it is also collector quality. It has the heavy paper and sturdy binding along with the glossy art work of Christopher Lee to make it worthy of any collection yet it is presented by volume, print, and size to make reading a real pleasure. I highly recommend at the value pricing of below $60!
