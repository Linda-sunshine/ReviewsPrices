review/summary: So helpful for understanding the life of the under-class in that erareview/text: As a reader outside of the U.S., I am not so familiar with the society and life during that era. This book provides the vivid background information. I find the details of her life and family satisfy my curiosity much more than the plot. I read some paragraphs to my 8-year-old daughter and she loves it!
