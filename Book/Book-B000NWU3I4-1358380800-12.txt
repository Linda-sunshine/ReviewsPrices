review/summary: &#34;The Hobbit&#34;review/text: Foryears, younger readers have told me that I should read &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; books. I put it off for several years. When I received my Kindle, I decided to start on the trilogy by reading &#34;The Hobbit&#34; first. Apparently, &#34;The Hobbit&#34; is the platform for trilogy and introduced the concepts and characters for the other books. However, it is a stand-alone book as well. The accomplishment of the mission was done with interesting word pictures. Thanks for this book, now I will read the rest of Tolkien's books!
