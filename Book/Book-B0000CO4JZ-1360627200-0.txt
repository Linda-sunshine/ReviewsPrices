review/summary: The Great Gatsbyreview/text: The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a fantastic novel of the Jazz age that mostly describes the differences and struggles between various social classes. After reading this book, I can see the fantastic connection between the original cover art and the conflict of emotions within The Great Gatsby. The title itself connects perfectly with the character of Jay Gatsby; he is truly The Great Gatsby.The story within this modernist novel is the story of Nick Carraway, a young man of the midwest. Carraway moves to New York during the summer of 1922. Nick visits his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom. From the visit with them on, Nick's life only becomes more and more chaotic. The layer that covered the infidelity and chaos of those in this book is suddenly peeled back. I really enjoyed the dramatic element of this novel simply because the drama keeps the book riveting. However, the amount of infidelity in this book portrays that perhaps the author could not think of another way to keep things alluring.Fitzgerald is a very eloquent author. His words seem to undulate across the pages as they flow together. I had to read some lines multiple times to truly get the meaning, but I did not mind because in diong that one recieves a deeper connection with the text. All in all, I recommend The Great Gatsby to anyone who enjoys a good dramatic novel.
