review/summary: In spite of myselfreview/text: It has been a long time since I read GWTW and hated Scarlett. I reread it with an adult's perspective of hardships, tough knocks and suffering, and while I still don't like Scarlett, I've come away with a greater appreciation of the hardships of living in an occupied land, 19th century societal expectations of women in the U.S.; and the tumult of changing social norms from one century to the next. It is a fascinating read.
