review/summary: Keeping Faithreview/text: I particularly liked the subject matter of the daughter's unusual circumstances and tying it in the way Picoult did. However, I did not think that this met her usual excellent writing form. At times, it seemed written in a big hurry. Still, I really like Picoult's books as I know they receive good research on the various topics she uses.
