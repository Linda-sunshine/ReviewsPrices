review/summary: Why did I wait so long?review/text: For years I thought the Harry Potter books were just some lame kids' books. I was so wrong. I just finished reading the first HP book (from the Kindle lending library), and now I can hardly wait to read the next volume in the series. If you enjoy fantasy, fun and adventurous stories with some danger thrown in, and the triumph of good over evil, Harry Potter is for you. And even though it's written at the youth level, it's well written and enjoyable for all ages. You won't want to put it down!
