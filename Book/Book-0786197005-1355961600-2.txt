review/summary: A Princess of Marsreview/text: I'll admit it freely- I only bought this book because of how desperately I fell in love with the recent Disney movie &#34;John Carter.&#34; I just had to read the original story, and I'm not disappointed. For the time period it was written in, A Princess of Mars is well beyond its time, and absolutely satisfies my need for good writing. The storyline is altered from the movie, but a good read nonetheless. I thoroughly enjoy this book and am regretful of not reading it sooner.
