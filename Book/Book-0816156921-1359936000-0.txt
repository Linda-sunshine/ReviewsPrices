review/summary: Never a dull momentreview/text: I was looking to start reading the literary classics as a way to treat my brain after reading so much fluff lately. I had started Moby Dick last year (still haven't finished it) and was weary that this was going to fall in the same category. Not so!I have never watched the movie that came out back in the 90's and have never seen any of the vampire movies that are out now. I'm only 31- not like I'm old, I just didn't have an interest. This book was amazing though.It only took me about two days to read because I couldn't put it down.I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to get lost in a fiction book.
