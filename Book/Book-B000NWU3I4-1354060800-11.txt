review/summary: Great reading of a fantastic book!review/text: I first fell in love with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings in 6th grade. That love hasn't faded over the ensuing 40 years. This audiobook - and the companion for LoTR - do the original full justice. Rob Inglis is a master of voice and characterization - and he brings the book fully to life.I do wish that this were available on MP3; transferring the disks to iTunes is a bit cumbersome. But if you're looking for a fantastic listening experience, this is more than worth that minimal effort.
