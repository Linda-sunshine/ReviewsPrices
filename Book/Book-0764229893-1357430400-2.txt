review/summary: Awesome!review/text: Lynn Austin is a great author. She does an excellent job of researching history and weaving it into a fiction that closely follows her research.My first encounter with her books was when I read The Refiner's Fire trilogy. I have had a long time interest in the American Civil War and was pleasantly surprised to see how her carefully crafted stories affected me so deeply.I wholeheartedly recommend Lynn Austin's books!
