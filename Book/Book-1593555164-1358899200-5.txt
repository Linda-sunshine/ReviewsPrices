review/summary: One Shot on targetreview/text: ONE SHOT is the ninth book in. Jack "Reacher" series it is the ninth I've read in six days. I have been LATE to discover Lee Child's work but catching up fast. My family has had six generation's of men and women to serve in Army Navy Air force and. Civilian Police. We have a sixth generation serving as I write...it's a family thing. We have all served with pride. Lee Child's &#8220;Reacher" while fictional can't help but smile at the thought that if the courts can't protect the innocent maybe there is really a soldier that can. Keep them coming Lee Child. Fan forever Catherine
