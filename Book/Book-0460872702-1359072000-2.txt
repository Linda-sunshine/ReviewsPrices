review/summary: Poignantreview/text: The Great Gatsby truly is magical. It takes you on an amazing ride of emotions, from being piqued at the beginning to depressed at the end. Although the story isn't brilliant, the beauty of this book isn't in the story. It's the narrative that wins you over. It's how the author puts his spin on situations that is so awe-inspiring. Fitzgerald is a writer par excellence and this book is a classic.
