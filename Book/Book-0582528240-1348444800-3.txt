review/summary: Reviewreview/text: I completely agree with some of the reviewers postings about the fact that this book has been banned by some schools in the past and banned from communities in general, yes it can be racist but it is literary genius on Mark Twain's part by taking this touchy subject of racism and running with it. This is a story about a troubled boy who gets into all sorts of adventures, even with those of different races. Put aside race and open this book and read between the lines on what Mark Twain was actually trying to achieve. Huckleberry Finn has become a literary hero along with his friends in the story, and it is a well known book that should be read!
