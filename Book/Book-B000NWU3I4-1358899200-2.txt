review/summary: The fantasy classic that spawned countless fantasy classicsreview/text: The fantasy tropes contained in this book and &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; are so pervasive in classic fantasy as to be cliche, yet reading this book stills feels fresh. An adventure from beginning to end, and proves the quiet ones are the ones you need to watch out for.
