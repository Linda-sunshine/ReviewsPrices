review/summary: The Hobbit - a pre-screening rereadreview/text: I read this many years ago and wanted to re-read it before going to see the movie. It was good to revive the huge grey spaces in my memory regarding the tale and to be prepared to know how Peter Jackson and friends re-wove it with other Tolkien lore in the movie.
