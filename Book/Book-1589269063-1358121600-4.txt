review/summary: A Relationship Must-Read!review/text: The Five Love Languages takes an approach to relationships and communication that I never would have considered before reading this book. It definitely applies to all relationships, regardless of whether or not you're married. The author, Gary Chapman, asks the reader to examine the ways people in relationships relate to one another. Expressions of love can come in various forms, and I found it so interesting to learn about the ways we can show our love to one another. Not only was I able to better understand my love language, but I also gained insight into my boyfriend's love language as well as new ways to fill his "love tank." This book has shed light on so many ways we can love, and as a result my relationship is better than ever!If this book appeals to you, I highly recommend a book by Ariel and Shya Kane entitled,How to Have A Match Made in Heaven: A Transformational Approach to Dating, Relating, and Marriage. Like Chapman, the authors present ways of relating, both with your partner and with yourself, that can have a profound impact on your relationship and overall well-being. The principles in How to Have a Match Made in Heaven have really allowed my relationship with my boyfriend to blossom, and The Five Love Languages has invigorated our partnership in many meaningful ways. I highly recommend you read both books!
