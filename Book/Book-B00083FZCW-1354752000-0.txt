review/summary: Awesome bookreview/text: This book is the first in the maximum ride series. This book is amazing and very detailed. This book is five stars and I will read more of the series soon. I just found out that you should have the second book "School's out forever" on hand for when you finish this one because this has a major cliffhanger. I can't tell you what because it's major! Also from just the start of the book you are wondering mainly is Angel going to be okay along with other questions.
