review/summary: Enjoyable and capitivatingreview/text: I read The Great Gatsby years ago and selected it again because I wanted to read it before the movie comes out in 2013 and I wanted to read a well written book. F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing is excellent and after reading so many poorly written books, I really enjoyed this one. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.
