review/summary: Pretty coolreview/text: I have read this book a couple of times, and watch the movie many others, and its always so amazing how you find these little details that you always forget and make the story that more close to you.This Kindle version is really nice, although there is a thing with the page numbers in which they are all around like 2347, then 2589, 2643 and so on; which is not really a problem since they are actually in numerical order, but it makes it a little weird while reading (you could probably change this setting somewhere, but I failes to find where)
