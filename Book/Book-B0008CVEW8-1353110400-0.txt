review/summary: Good as a gift for a youngsterreview/text: I read this classic for book club and although the book club really didn't like it I found it kept my attention and was a nice short read. I thought the dialogue was pretty impressive as compared with what a person would find in modern fiction. Wish I had read it when I was younger since it would have caught more of my imaginations. I wouldn't hesitate to give this to a young reader.
