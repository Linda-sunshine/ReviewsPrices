review/summary: Hobbits Hilariousreview/text: I really liked this book. This was a great start to the Lord of the Rings series, and a book that pulled me in from the start. J.R.R. Tolkien mixed action and adventure perfectly while he also put a little comedy in the book without making it annoying. I suggested this book to anyone who enjoy a good action book with a small comical side. Great book and a must read...
