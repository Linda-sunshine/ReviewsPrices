review/summary: Wuthering Heightsreview/text: WOW! I had a hard time at first adjusting to the difference in 1800 language and todays, but man I am sure glad I stuck with it. What a wonderful book. No surprise that it is in the "classics" catagory. Beautifully written love, hate, passion, and lonely darkness novel. Think I will be reading it again.
