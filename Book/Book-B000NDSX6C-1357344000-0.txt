review/summary: My favorite book for over 4 decadesreview/text: Warning: This review is biased and sappy. Since I first read this book 45 years ago, it has stayed at the very top of &#34;My Favorite Books&#34; list. Every single book I have read since first discovering The Hobbit has been compared to this one. Rather than bore you with all the things I love about this book and it's companions (The Lord of the Rings), I will just note what distinguishes this book for me: the denouement, the &#34;after story.&#34; Every adventure changes us, and Tolkien lets us know exactly how the adventure changes the life and spirit of his characters. Enough said, I have read the book in hardback, and tattered paperback and have listened to it on audiotape, cd and recently MP3 (Rob Ingliss does a fine job bringing Middle Earth alive for me). I ordered this book for Kindle since I was bitten by the eBook bug. I do not know why I resisted switching to eBooks for so long. For a bibliophile, having my favorite volumes with me at all times makes me feel like the richest woman in the world.
