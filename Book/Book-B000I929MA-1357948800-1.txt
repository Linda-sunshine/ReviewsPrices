review/summary: Ominous story of a future worldreview/text: Atwood has masterfully written a tale of future world in which women are enslaved by zealots of a new world order. Her haunting epilogue of anthropologists clinically analyzing the remains of that world gives a somber tone to the end of the volume. I read this book in 1988 and again in 2013. It stands as a classic.
