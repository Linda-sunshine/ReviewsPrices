review/summary: The best book about human relationships ever writtenreview/text: This book is an absolute must lecture for everybody, but especially for those who find themselves in charge of a team, be it a business, group of students, civic association or your own family. In 1996 I was put in charge of conducting a church choir who had inherited a lot of nasty problems from the former director. Reading this book and applying what it says saved my job and brought my team back to peak performances. Since I came to America I am a Toastmaster, and every time I give a speech about leadership and human relations in my club I recommend this book to my fellow members and have given away several hard copies of it.If everyone went by this book we all truly would live in a much better and pleasant business and political environment.
