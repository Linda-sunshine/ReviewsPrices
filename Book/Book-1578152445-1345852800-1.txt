review/summary: IN ITS OWN CLASSreview/text: Dicken's is clearly in a class of his own. Few authors have exhibited and illustrated the breadth and depth of story telling inherent and extant in a Dicken's novel. Dicken's ability to switch tenses and create tension through use of speech and idiom is unparalleled. This is a mature read that requires patience, intellect, and a formidable vocabulary to be fully realized and properly appreciated. Thank you Charles for your formidable and fine effort; well done good and faithful master.
