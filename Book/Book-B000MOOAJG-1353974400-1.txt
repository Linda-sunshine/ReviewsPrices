review/summary: Interesting (but dark) storyreview/text: This is the first novel I have read by Ayn Rand. If you are more conservative politically you will like it, if you're more liberal you probably won't. It is dark and philosophical so it isn't a quick read - I find myself going back and rereading passages to make sure I comprehend all the nuances she has in the novel.
