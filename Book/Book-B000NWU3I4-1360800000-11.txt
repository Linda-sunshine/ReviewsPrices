review/summary: Wonderful bookreview/text: The hobbit is a very good read. It appeals to all age groups except for small children and just about anyone could read it and experience a different form of bliss or joy. The story follows Bilbo the Hobbit throughout his journey in Middle Earth. Bilbo and his friend Gandalf meet many people along the way from elves to a dragon named Smaug. During their entire campaign and travels they encounter much fighting and peril that ends up in an all out war with a surprise ending. Bilbo emerges alive and continues on the same life he lived before. Some individuals would say parts of the story are boring, but in the end they all come together to create a beautiful ending. This is a book that has been cherished for decades. Make sure your kids read it someday because it speaks to everyone. It is featured in much high school curriculum for a reason. It has been translated into many different languages so people all over the world can experience it. Keep two copies so you always have one to share with someone else. Whether you are a seasoned Tolkien fan or this is your first book, you will be impressed.
