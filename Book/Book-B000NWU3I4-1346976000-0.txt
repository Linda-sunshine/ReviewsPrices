review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: I received The Hobbit very promptly and at a great price. It is exactly like the one I read years ago which is what I wanted. It has several of the illustrations and drawings from the original. Amazon is a great place to find all the books you want at good prices. The nearest bookstore is over an hour's drive. I always check Amazon first and am always glad I do.
