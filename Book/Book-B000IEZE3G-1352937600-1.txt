review/summary: The most wonderful story foreverreview/text: This is the first Harry Potter and my first Harry Potter book and it really bring me to a magic world. At first I read it in China, in Chinese translation, now reading it in English helps me to better understanding its culture and its words use are just amazing! Whenever I read it I'll close my eyes and image that I'm also a friend of Harry and experience the adventure in that magic world. This is the most wonderful story book ever, period. Every child will learn about it and enjoy the fun and happiness it brings.
