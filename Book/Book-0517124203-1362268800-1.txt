review/summary: Alicereview/text: I've always loved reading the book over movies. The books always contain scenes that are not in the movies. I love reading the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and especially when I got to read a book called the Wizard goes to Wonderland. It was the Wizard from Oz. If you know both stories, you'll get it. But this one I do recommend. Better than the movie.
