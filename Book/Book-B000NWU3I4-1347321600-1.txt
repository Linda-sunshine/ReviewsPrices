review/summary: Amazing novel, meh on the electronic delivery.review/text: If you're buying this to read The Hobbit, it's most definitely an excellent purchase and you will not regret it. However, the electronic version has some features that are not delivered very well.I have a Kindle Touch and although it supports mp3 playback the audio included with this was not support on my device. Also I have not found a way to export the images and alternate art included in this edition. As much as I love black and white images, I would love to at least view them on another device such as a computer.Overall, and excellent purchase; just wish I could make use of all the features on my device.
