review/summary: Great Bookreview/text: The book was nice to read to my 7 year old son. And, we really enjoyed mulling-over the beautiful illustrations! There is a lot of action and the scenes change fairly quickly. I did have to recap/rephrase some of the paragraphs for a 7 year old to understand, but he followed along fairly well and we had a blast reading it together.
