review/summary: Tom Cruise???review/text: I saw that there was going to a Jack Reacher movie and I was excited as I love this series. Then I heard that Jack was going to be played by Tom Cruise. How can a midget be cast as the the HUGE Jack Reacher? I am so disappointed. I certainly won't be going to see the movie. Oh well. The movie is never as good as the book. Which was great.
