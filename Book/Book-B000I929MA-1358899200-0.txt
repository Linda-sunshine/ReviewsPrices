review/summary: Cautionary Talereview/text: Atwood's classic masterpiece is a dystopic forecast from 1985 into a present time where religion and politics meet, merge, and birth the bastard Tea Party. Complex and complicated characters making their way through the first generation of that time turn her compelling political statement into a compelling story.One need only spend five minutes looking at the policies of the modern Republican Party in the United States to realize that it has taken this book for an instruction manual rather than a cautionary tale, a hand-guide to totalitarian theocracy to be cherished and craved rather than abhorred. This was America's future, before the rise of the 'None' began dragging it back from the brink of religious fervor, and it is not a wholly unrecognizable one.
