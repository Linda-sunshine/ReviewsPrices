review/summary: The Anti-Romantic Novelreview/text: If you were a proper English mother at the time of Jane Austen, what sort of novel would you want your impressionable young daughter to read? You certainly wouldn't want her reading romance novels, for that might result in her eloping with the gamekeeper! No, you would want her to read a sensible novel, about how it is important to marry money, and that upper class men, even if they seem haughty, are really the best husbands. You would want her to read novels that reinforce, rather than undermine, the class-ridden social fabric. You would want her to read novels that show that even less-than-beautiful girls can use their wits to snare husbands far wealthier than themselves. In other words, you would want her to read Pride and Prejudice, the ideal anti-romantic novel.The novel offers a stark contrast between sisters. The younger sister falls in love with a poor army officer, and, by following her heart, brings herself and the family to the brink of disgrace. The heroine, by contrast, by keeping her head, marries the haughty but wealthy man, saves the family, and climbs up a notch or two in social caste. The men in the novel are neatly arranged according to wealth: the best men are Darcy and his rich friends; in the middle is the father, a nice but ineffectual character; at the base is the poor and caddish army officer. Things appear differently early in the novel, when the army man appears dashing and noble, and Darcy seems rude and prejudiced. But by the end, the rightness of the class system is revealed, and the heroine discovers that marrying wealth is the best way after all.This is the perfect instructional tale for cynics of Austen's time, and for ours. Enjoy this masterpiece of anti-romantic fiction.
