review/summary: Loved it!review/text: I thought this was an awesome book. I think that Tolkien 's work is very well written. He uses great detail and I can always easily get a mental image of what's happening. I love the fact that he's so creative with his character's personalities and names. Overall it was a great book and I would recommend it to anyone who can read and understand it.
