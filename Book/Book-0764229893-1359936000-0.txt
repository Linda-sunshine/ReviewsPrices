review/summary: Gods and Kings by Lynn Austenreview/text: This is an exciting book to read. The story of God's protection of Hezikiah from his youth. Full of political intrigue it takes places in a dangerous time for Israel both physically and spiritually. The suspense and horror in the book grabs the reader. I will try other books in this series.
