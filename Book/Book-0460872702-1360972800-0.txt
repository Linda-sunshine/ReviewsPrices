review/summary: Dramatic Romancereview/text: I found this book interesting to read even though it was an assigned reading for school. I like this book becuase there was romance, even just a little, and because I liked the characters, Nick and Gatsby. I like when Daisy and Jay Gatsby's past was describes and how he rubbed in Daisy's husband about their romantic past. In the end, I felt sorry for Jay Gatsby because he was killed for a crime he did not commit and he was blamed for this crime by Daisy's husband. I also felt sorry for Jay Gatsy because he tried so hard to win Daisy back and Daisy ends up staying with her husband, even though she knows that her husband put the blame of the murder on Jay
