review/summary: The Five People You Meet in Heavenreview/text: An excellent read with the style that only Mitch Albom seems to possess anymore. He leads you through the singularity of the main character and divulges various scenarios that develop through out this character's life and the effect that numerous other characters have on him both in life and in death. Other information is provided to the reader that help to explain the main character's reaction to the various scenarios and how it effects the lessons that he learns. But, it all ties together as the reader reaches the conclusion. No loose ends! SMS
