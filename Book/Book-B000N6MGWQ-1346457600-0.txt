review/summary: suprisingly goodreview/text: Unfortunately, I couldn't get this book to download right on my tablet. I was pleased to find out I could return for a full refund within a few minutes after the purchase, which I did. However, after reading the sample, I had to finish it. So the next day I went to my local library....it was great! It really gets you thinking about your life and how it affects others. Would definetely recommend, especially for a summer read!
