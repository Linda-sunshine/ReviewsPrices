review/summary: Beyond this world....review/text: wonderful, thought provoking, massively intellectual (and way too much for me) - it's a constant re-read. Some of his thoughts go way over my head and I am not on his wave length intellectually or iq - but somethings I totally get - and he talks sense (when I get it). I take some, i leave what I don't get, but that is the beauty of the journey of christianity - not just questioning - but realising that it just IS. and knowing that is just AWESOME!
