review/summary: Great 50 Years Ago, Prophetic Todayreview/text: Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is as eye-opening a read today as it was 50 years ago. While the book may seem daunting in its sheer size and weight, once you are engaged in the story, you will wish the book was even longer. What's impressive about the novel is that Ayn Rand successfully paints a portrait of what the world will be like if certain policies are followed. By depicting the results of an attack on capitalism scene by scene, the reader can comprehend the logic and truth of her words and ideas. The parallels to today's world are frightening as the truth rings loud and clear. Atlas Shrugged inspired me to change my life when I read it in my early twenties and its message is just as powerful today. I heartily recommend this book to college students, college graduates, and those wishing to understand why capitalism benefits man and the American dream. Rand debunks the notion that success is evil. You will never think the same about your world or your beliefs. Take a chance and read this book. Persevere past the first 50 to 100 pages which can go slow as Rand creates the necessary backstory for the novel. Once you get caught up in the story, you will not be able to put it down. Rand is a master at characterization and plotting and is a philosopher as well. Get ready to think as she will challenge many beliefs you may hold dear. You might enjoy reading The Fountainhead as well or some of the biographies about Ayn Rand such as the one by Nathaniel Brandon.
