review/summary: A powerful, powerful storyreview/text: All my life I've known of this book, but only now at age 65 invested time to read this wonderful and at times gut- wrenching story. At times tears flowed freely, both for the stories of mans very best in grace and relationships; other times for the horror of man's cruelty and injustices against another people. We are all precious in God's sight and in Christ, we are called to be exemplimary of His compassion and grace to others, regardless of race or station in life. This book is still today one that should be required reading.
