review/summary: Read it. Now.review/text: I read this book for the first time when I was maybe 10 or 11 years old. I came across it in my elementary school library, and was hesitant at first because the title suggested similarity to Crime & Punishment (let's be frank, Dostoevsky simply cannot appeal to a relatively normal 5th grader). I was way off base in this assumption, and have been smitten with P&P ever since that first reading. The story & characters never get old, and although some adaptations & variations are enjoyable to read, nothing can ever be quite like the original. If you haven't done so yet, read it. Please. You won't be sorry.
