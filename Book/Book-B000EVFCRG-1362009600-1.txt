review/summary: Little Womenreview/text: I read this Kindle book after the Secret Garden. Next &#34;Sketches&#34; and just finished &#34;An Old Fashioned Girl&#34; at about 3 a.m. today 28 Feb. I have always had a hard time putting down a good book. I find the Kindle is good if you want to focus on just one book at a time. I appreciate the bookmark feature which helps me to return where I left off. Thank you Amazon.
