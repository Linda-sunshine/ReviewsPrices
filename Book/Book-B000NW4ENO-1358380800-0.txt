review/summary: Best book I've ever read!review/text: If you're like me and Gone with then Wind has ranked as your favorite movie of all time, you won't be disappointed with this read. All 1,037 pages while worth the read. And I was pleasantly surprised how much more detail and different the book was than the movie. As awesome as the movie was, the book is even better! A must read for all true southerns!
