review/summary: Beautiful, adventurous storyreview/text: Such a classic, an epic novel for all ages.The Hobbit tends to skip over a lot of details, but this makes it easier to read and easier to focus on the overall story. I like the inclusion of songs (adds more atmosphere), and the playful tone of this story.
