review/summary: Words cannot describereview/text: This is a rich, breathtaking classic that can (and should) be read over and over again. It is a long, long story spanning twelve eventful years, but it is definitely worth the time it takes to read. The book is like an epic - Margaret Mitchell's voice is powerful, poetic, wise. Characters are the most important element of a book for me, and this book has the most beautiful, complex, unique characters I have ever encountered in a work of fiction. Scarlett never ceases to amaze me - her resourcefulness and ambition are incredible for a woman of her time. It is incredible how tragedy transforms her - from flighty and carefree to a harsh, driven woman whose compelling desire is to return to the security and prosperity before the war. She is also a frustrating protagonist in her narrow-minded stubbornness and inability to understand others and her own heart. Rhett Butler is the other character in this novel that captivates me. Readers will love his subtle sarcasm, sharp wit, and suave mannerisms. It's impossible not to! He is the quintessential "bad boy" that countless authors have tried to recreate. But he runs deep too, especially in his love for Scarlett and sentimentality for the charm of the Old South.The historical fiction aspect of the novel is extraordinary as well. I fell in love with the deep South as Mitchell described it, even though I have no connection to that part of America. I never considered the plight of Southerners during and after the Civil War, but this book revealed its devastating effect on the people and customs of the South. Books about the destruction of a society rarely end happily. But it surprised and disheartened me when the author paralleled Scarlett and Rhett's love story with the downfall of the South.
