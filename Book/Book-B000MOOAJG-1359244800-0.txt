review/summary: have heard a lot about this book, so I wanted to experience it.review/text: This book was interesting from the beginning. Because of the political situation today, it was easy to relate to the story line.I think Ms. Rand had a lot of experience to share with her readers, and though it is fiction, it holds a lot of truth.
