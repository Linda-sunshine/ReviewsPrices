review/summary: While some say it is obvious, sometimes it is the most obvious things we need reminders aboutreview/text: This book has gotten some scathing reviews as being something that could be summarized in a brief article. While that may be true to some degree, it is still a book that holds important reminders to things that of course seem obvious but are so often and easily forgotten and overlooked. People sometimes need reminding about the simplest concepts when it comes to looking at another person with perspective on how they feel and how they interpret our actions. I also thought hearing about the individual situations was touching and inspiring.
