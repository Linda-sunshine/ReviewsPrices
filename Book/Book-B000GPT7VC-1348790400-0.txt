review/summary: Uncle Tom's Cabinreview/text: This was an interesting read. Some of it was challenging for me with some of the wording but I think it was definitely worth my time. It was hard to fathom that events like were explained actually happened but I'm sure they did. I think everyone that is an American should read it to learn from the mistakes our ancestors made.
