review/summary: Finally! A Self-help book about marriage that doesn't cause fights!review/text: As a divorce attorney, I have reviewed numerous books and programs on marriage repair. (I generally encourage clients who I believe can work things out not to divorce.) This book I believe is one of the best, if not the best. It is different from the other programs in that it doesn't dig up a lot of hurt and blame and instead it focuses on the future. It boils the relationship down very simply, which is so important at a time when everything seems so confusing and overwhelming. It really helps the couple get back to basics and helps them understand each other and understand themselves. If you feel loved, the stress and tension lifts, the trust returns, and you can begin to put it all back together again. Other programs and books I believe shake things up too much. They force you to dig up years of pain which leads to blame and more fighting. I think that sometimes they cause more harm than good. Sometimes you just need to get back to basics and get to a place where you can once again feel like your partner loves you. This book in a very easy, simple way, helps you do that. If one or both of you can say you still love the other person (you just can't stand them and can't figure out how to get along!), this book will be a huge help to you. Even if you remember a time when you were once in love, and you would like to get back to that place, this is the book for you.
