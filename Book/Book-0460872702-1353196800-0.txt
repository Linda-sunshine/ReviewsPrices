review/summary: A great book--to be read again and againreview/text: Beautiful language. I can now say I've both read this book and listened to a reading of it, and there's so much complexity in the subtext that each time the tone suggested something slightly different.Regarding the story itself, more of a short story really, it seemed to me somewhat unremarkable. My primary pleasure came from wanting to learn more about this mysterious man Gatsby, who he is and what motivates him.The Great Gatsby is such an idolized staple of American literature that I grant myself several more re-reads to fully appreciate its genius.
