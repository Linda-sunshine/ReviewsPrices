review/summary: Riveting!review/text: It's hard to add anything new to the excellent reviews, but I would like respond to the criticism that the book is slow (and apply my 5 stars). It is not slow! Maybe the first couple of chapters are a little slow, but they are well worth it, as they show us what kind of man Corrie's father was. What a man! What a father! What a Christian! The style of writing is very engaging. It is very easy to read. And the incredible story becomes more and more riveting.
