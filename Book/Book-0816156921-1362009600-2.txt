review/summary: Horrorreview/text: A horror story when horror was horror.Not like today's copy-pasted cliched vampire stories with sexy, hot, glittering vamps, but a real horror, a real story about an unheard monster which shapeshifts into bats and rats, which makes you shiver and gives you goosebums.For me Dracula is the best horror novel, the scariest and the most original.i also love that the story is told via letters and journals.A great book.
