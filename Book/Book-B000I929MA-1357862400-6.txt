review/summary: What is normal?review/text: I read The Handmaid's Tale for AP lit and loved it. While many people acknowledge how subjective &#34;normal is,&#34; this book gives a first hand catharsis of this notion. In Offred&#8217;s retrospections of life before, nostalgia reigns. All of us have experienced nostalgia of different stages, or periods, in our lives. It&#8217;s really true that change is the only constant. &#8220;Ordinary, said Aunt Lydia, is what you are used to. This may not seem ordinary to you now, but after a time it will. It will become ordinary&#8221; (Atwood 34). Change is only startling long after the fact, and it unnerved me how distant yet always present the past can be. Especially with emotions. &#8220;But who can remember pain, once it's over? All that remains of it is a shadow, not in the mind even, in the flesh. Pain marks you, but too deep to see. Out of sight, out of mind.&#8221; Atwood reminds us that memories shape and accompany us in new phases of our life. Which, faster than we realize, become ordinary to us.
