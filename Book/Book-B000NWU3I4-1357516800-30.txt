review/summary: Fantasy Masterreview/text: One of the best fantasy novels ever. Many have already outlined why this is such a masterful story, so I won't replicate that effort.I enjoyed this book as a young grade schooler and plan to re-read it again and again. This is the kind of book you want to read out loud to your grandchild and to the kid in you.
