review/summary: Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment...AWESOMELY AMAZING BOOK!!!!!!!!review/text: What happens when you cross bird DNA with a human's?? You get Maximum Ride of course!! Maximum Ride, or Max as they call her in the books, is a successful DNA hybrid that grew up in a lab with several other mutants like herself. They are recombinant life forms, meaning they are cross-bred with some other DNA. In this case, as I said before, it is bird DNA. 98% human, 2% bird. This has had a huge impact on their lives. That 2% has given them the power of flight. They have wings, along with hollow bird bones. They are constantly in danger of getting caught by Erasers, which are human-wolf recombinants, and taken back to the dreadful lab they grew up in. The lab, A.K.A the School, would do almost anything to get them back. The flock, which is the group of bird-kids that are as the following: Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman, and Angel. That's all I'm telling you.I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK!!! I read it and immediately went for the second one, which is School's Out Forever. (This was the first!) Max is a funny heroine, and I have a friend that is almost exactly like her. The details are great; I almost felt as if I was flying with them during the flying scenes. James Patterson has really outdone himself. With these books, you can't just read one and be done, you have to read all of them, or else you'll be kicking yourself for not reading the rest and finding out what the outcome is.For this book, you could come up with a thousand theme statements. But I think what James Patterson was really getting at was this- Never. Give. Up. Read this book to find out what happens; I highly recommend you become part of the experiment.
