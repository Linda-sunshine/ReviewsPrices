review/summary: Not Typically My Subject Matter, But...?review/text: I wholeheartedly recommend this book. A strange comment for me to say considering that the subject matter would not be one that I would typically select. I was moved to purchase "The Sorcerer's Stone" because the Harry Potter series has been such a huge hit with people of all ages around the world. There must be a reason for that and I was curious to discover what that reason might be. It is, in fact, the writer, who has an amazing gift for keeping the story moving and surprising the audience in unexpected ways throughout the book. I am about to purchase book two in the series and can't wait to begin experiencing more of "Harry Potter."
