review/summary: The Hobbit...Kindle versionreview/text: Love reading on the Kindle...this was a terrific book. My son has wanted me to read it since he was 10 when he read it. I should not have waited so long. Loved the characters..the settings stirred the imagination...now on to The Lord of the Rings...also on Kindle...reading now.
