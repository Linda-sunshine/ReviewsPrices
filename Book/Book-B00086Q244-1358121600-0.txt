review/summary: Easy to read with great suggestionsreview/text: This book is very well written and easy to read. It has many concepts that you can apply to your life both professionally and personally. It is full of great examples and analogies that help you get a better grasp of what is being explained.As a friend said he reads this book every couple of months to refresh what he may have forgotten and I plan to do the same.
