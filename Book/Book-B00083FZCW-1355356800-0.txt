review/summary: Perfectreview/text: Best book I have read. Action filled. Angel is my favorite character. She is sweet and helpful. The Erasers( weird name ) are blood thirsty also greedy. I would give this a five star rank. It is tremendous. You should read this book. I am not kidding. That is more than fifty words right? Yah
