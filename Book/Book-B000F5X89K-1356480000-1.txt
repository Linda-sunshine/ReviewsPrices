review/summary: Good Literature, But Bad Moralreview/text: I was assigned this book for homework. It was an interesting read. Its not one of those "feel-good" books. Mary Shelley portrays the world-view of "The way you act, good or bad, is based on how you are treated by others." According to Shelley, if you are rejected by the world, hated by others, and despised by your own creator, its "ok" to murder innocent people and hate those who are happy and have joy. I disagree with this world-view and wouldn't recommend this book to a friend.
