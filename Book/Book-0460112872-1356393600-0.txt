review/summary: Wonderful story, well ahead of it's time!review/text: Very intriguing tale of l of love and faith in finding love. I'll admit that I was initially scared off by my preconceived notion of what the language would be, but I had no reason to worry! At times chilling, other times romantic, this visionary tale produced a strong feminist heroine who surely inspired the work of female authors since.
