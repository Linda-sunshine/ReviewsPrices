review/summary: Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Randreview/text: This is a dynamic story of an American government going too far in terms of federal power. Although it was written in the mid 1950's, it reflects what can happen when the federal government becomes too powerful, i.e. like a dictatorship. The book can be particularly aimed at the current government which is gaining more and more power at the expense of the States and the people. It is a wake up call for those who read the book and see it as a way to reflect the way the country is going politically on its present path. It will hopefully be an instrument of reversing the current political trend by returning power to the States as the US Constitution was proposed, ratified and amended to date.
