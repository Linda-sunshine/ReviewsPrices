review/summary: Illustrated Version Fun to Readreview/text: It is a pleasure to re-read the HOBBIT on an ereader. There are many versions of HOBBIT out there, but being able to port the book around WITH a number of illustrations is great. If you have an iThing by Apple you get some neat extras too. Well worth it! I like the saturated colors of the images and how I can click on them to see them as large as my e-device allows.
