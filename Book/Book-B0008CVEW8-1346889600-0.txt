review/summary: Revisiting a Classicreview/text: I first read TREASURE ISLAND when I was 10 years old, and have not read it since. Now fifty years on I downloaded the novel on an impulse while on a recent vacation -- and was struck by the novel's narrative velocity, the gripping quality of the tale (even though it's now an oft-told variety of story that has been redone, revamped -- and amped up -- all the way up to and through the recent "Pirates of the Caribbean" film franchise). The novel is artfully structured -- seamless, in fact -- as it moves briskly from one tense plot point to the next while consistently maintaining a very reasonable level of verismilitude. (Once one gets past the somewhat outlandish premise that a couple 18th century English gentlemen with no experience of ships, sailing, or, moreover, piracy and criminality, would abruptly decide to launch an expedition to an uncharted island in search of loot stolen by a thug generally held to be the most savage pirate of them all. But, that aside ... ) It was a pleasure to take a few hours and read this novel again. Definitely fun, and striking to see how contemporary a feel in language and narrative drive that Stevenson maintained in a book published in 1883. Of note is that this novel was originally published as a "story for boys." Indeed -- the only female character of even passing note is Jim Hawkins's mother, and she is left behind early on in the story. These days we would want -- and need -- a female character or two. But, again, looking at pure literary skill exhibited through economic prose and a plot design that delivers the goods, TREASURE ISLAND holds up well.
