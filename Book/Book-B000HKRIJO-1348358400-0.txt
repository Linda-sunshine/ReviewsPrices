review/summary: Mere Christianity Reviewreview/text: Clive Staples Lewis was indeed an intellectual giant. His insight into human nature was amazing. I was surprised that his life span overlapped mine (He lived 1898 to 1963.). I was delighted that he came to the same conclusion at how God can know the future and we can still have free will. (It involves an appreciation of the fact that time is different for God.)There were times when C.S. got close but couldn't quite get there because he didn't have the benefit of the greater light of the restored gospel. But on the whole, he had a good grasp of what Christ taught and how we should live after the manner of happiness.
