review/summary: Understanding the languagesreview/text: I just read this book after years of having friends recommend it to me. So glad I did. Chapman does a great job of explaining the way we relate to each other in relationships. I would highly recommend this read to anyone who is in a marriage, especially for those who are having difficulty or considering divorce.
