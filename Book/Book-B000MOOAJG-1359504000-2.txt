review/summary: Great book, and on the Kindle it's easy to take with!review/text: I've always wondered about this controversial book, and now that it's available on Kindle, I don't have to wonder anymore!! Unfortunately, Ayn Rand saw into what is now the present, and I'm seeing that had others read her book and paid attention, we might not be on the road to the picture she painted with words in &#34;Atlas Shrugged!&#34;
