review/summary: Disappointing, Insincere, and Full of Contradictionsreview/text: I agreed with many points of "Why Men Love Bitches," so I generously gave it a 2-star rating.Helpful points:1) Remember your self-worth.2) Maintain your dignity.3) Never tolerate disrespect from a man.4) Never fake an orgasm.5) Be yourself.6) Do not overcompensate for feelings of inferiority by catering and giving too much to a man, especially in the first stages of non-exclusive dating.7) Do not follow the "sex on the third date" rule, as guys who follow this and pressure a woman for it usually want a hit and run.8) Allow time for personal hobbies, activities, work, etc. Never let the (non-emergency) needs of a man come before your own to the point that you are not physically taking care of yourself.9) Dump a guy who always makes you pay for dates or tries to get you to loan money.10) Allow the guy to make the first move in terms of contact, and don't make yourself too available, waiting for his call.11) Do not nag or smother him.12) Do not over-cater to him for things he is capable of doing himself (e.g. finding silverware).13) Do not "mommy" him by telling him obvious things to remember in regards to things he can do himself.14) Compliment your man and always appreciate the kind gestures he does for you.15) He doesn't need to know personal information about you, such as the exact number of people you slept with before him, so politely refuse to answer.16) Do not give too much until he proves himself as someone who will appreciate you and reciprocate.17) Do not be a doormat.18) Do not tell everything about yourself all at once.19) Use humor to lighten the mood (this book has some humorous lines here and there).However, there were many points of this book that I did not agree with because I felt they sent a negative, unhealthy message. When I first started reading the book, it seemed positive and uplifting: something that could never be flamed by a rational person who believes in equality of value between both sexes and avoiding abuse from the opposite sex. Now I realize why this book has received many negative reviews.Harmful points:1) Do not discuss your feelings and talk to a man like a fellow man, not like a woman.2) Although it is okay to show you are emotionally capable, stable, and self-reliant, do not show you are capable of physical tasks such as fixing up things around the house, or else it will emasculate him and lead to him being lazy.3) Act "dumb" and become aloof/distant when he does something you don't like, instead of having a frank conversation starting with "I feel hurt by this action you did because..."4) Assume every man has a three-year-old inside, and he will "test your boundaries" as to what you, a.k.a. "mommy," will allow, and if you act disinterested and aloof when he misbehaves, he will run back to you.5) Assume all men will have the tendency to be emotionally manipulative/abusive/distant to you BECAUSE THEY CAN, and it is YOUR DUTY to keep it in check by following this book.6) When he does something for you, don't just compliment him, do it in a patronizing, insincere, exaggerated manner.7) When he does something nice and messes it up badly, hire someone to fix it and lie to him about it.8) Lie to him about the maid coming to the house more than once a month to avoid conflict and make him feel "manly," so you don't have to broach the impossible topic of his not helping out with the chores around the house.9) Make him feel like the Grand Poo-Bah, but always "put him in his place" if he is disrespectful.10) Pretend to know how not to cook, because he will never take you out to dinner (voluntarily) otherwise.11) You must keep playing these games to keep him.12) Set up fake "problem" situations for him to fix (so he feels "manly"). For example, turn off the circuit breaker switch and act scared.13) Close your eyes during the scary part of a horror movie, even if that's not your personality.14) Passive-aggressively bring up things that bother you through "humor."It is important to note that a lot of the tips from my "harmful" list contradict her "girl power" and "be yourself" statements. These points were damaging for me, as they advocated insincerity, game-playing, and deceit. As a victim of emotional and physical abuse from a few previous boyfriends, the last thing I need to read from an "expert" is that any man will try to play me, drain me dry, and give me caregiver burnout if he can get away with it. Why would I even want to date men, if that is the case? I would be deeply offended if someone wrote a book like this about women, and I am offended for the decent men out there the author conveniently does not mention. One quote from a man said that he checks out other, not-so-beautiful women just to make his girlfriend insecure. What kind of a decent person does this? Why would this author advocate "catching" a man like this?There are so many better relationship books out there. I'm all for maintaining mystery and spacing out contact so that familiarity does not breed contempt, but this is insane. I would be so miserable trying to cover up my true self with a sneaky, "bitchy" exterior.Do not buy this if you are seriously looking for dating advice.
