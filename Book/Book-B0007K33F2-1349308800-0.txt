review/summary: Still worth todayreview/text: Written more than 160 years ago, this amazing book still retains a freshness typical of immortal books. A great adventure novel that inspired other books dealing with overcoming and revenge. "Tiger, Tiger" aka "The Stars My Destination", a SF novel by Alfred Bester has the same strucutre and plot. A "must read" book.
