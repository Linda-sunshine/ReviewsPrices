review/summary: A QUINTESSENTIAL READ FOR THE HOLIDAYS!review/text: The Christmas Carol by C. Dickens has become a traditional read at Christmas time for me in the past few years. The story really embodies what the Christmas season is all about, and if you're going into the season feeling stressed and &#34;Humbugged&#34;, then this story will elevate your &#34;spirits&#34;, no pun intended. I think it would be a great tradition to start each year with your children or grandchildren. I highly recommend this book.
