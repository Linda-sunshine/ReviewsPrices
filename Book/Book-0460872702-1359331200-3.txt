review/summary: Needs Further Explinationreview/text: This is my first encounter with THE GREAT GATSBY. I read the book because the movie preview intrigued me. And to be honest, someone told me falsities about the plot. But I was surprise and greatly entertained by this short fiction. I only wish we could have been given more insight to the characters and their existence. I feel like I need a follow-up of or character/plot analysis.I own the e-book version and because I did enjoy the story, I purchased a print version as well. I would recommend everyone read this book. There are indeed a lot of 'goings on' I give it four stars because, I feel like I was left wanting more.
