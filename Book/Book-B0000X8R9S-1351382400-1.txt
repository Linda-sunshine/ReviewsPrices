review/summary: About Hatchetreview/text: This novel is about a thirteen year old boy, Brian Robeson, who survives a small plane crash on his way to visit his father in Canada. Brian who was the only passenger on the plane finds himself alone in the wilderness of Canada. Armed with only a hatchet given to him by his mother as a present; Brian manages to survive. Along the way he learns to overcome his fear and apply all his survival skills. This novel is an inspirational survival story with a happy ending. I highly recommend it to other young readers.
