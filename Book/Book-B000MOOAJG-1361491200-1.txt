review/summary: Very misunderstood book originsreview/text: Ayn Rand was a 1920's Stalinist Soviet Union emigre. This book is a diatribe (published in the 1950s) against the Stalinist Soviet Union, despite all the pseudo-political rubbish that people say about it nowadays. That the USA's current government is now doing things that the Soviet Union did a century ago goes to show how ill-educated our population (and politicians in general -- witness George Bush in particular) has become: those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it. I read this book without any preconceived notions (I originally avoided it because of all the claptrap said about it these days) -- but, having read it, it is one of the most insightful works of literature I have ever read. Then again, I am wealthy, powerful, and extremely well-educated (though not in the slightest Republican), not one of those average joes that seem to be everywhere in society today, barely able to read or write. This book is not meant for the masses who seem to only demand bread and circuses in order to be happy.
