review/summary: Unabridged book that really isreview/text: The Count of Monte Cristo is a book so famous that almost everyone has heard of it, and many people have read it - or so they think. Even "unabridged" versions have been abridged - specifically Eugenie's relationship with another woman. This edition is, actually unabridged. Translator commentary and footnotes are interesting, rather than intrusive. It's still a fabulous read.
