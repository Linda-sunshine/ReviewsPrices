review/summary: Janet Eyrereview/text: It was nice to be able to read this classic for free. A very progressive book for its time. The translation, it says, was done by volunteers. That may explain some of the errors, for example, towards the end of the book when they alternated between calling her 'Jane' and 'Janet'
