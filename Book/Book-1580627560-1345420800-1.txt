review/summary: Cover to cover magicreview/text: I just read this book in one day. I have always known deep down that there is an astronomical difference between men and relationships and women and relationships. I have just started dating again and found myself loosing ground again in these dating relationships. It was confusoing as to why I was always on the side of putting forth more effort. Well, now I know!! This book really spells it out. After reading this book, I implemenmted her suggestions and voila! I am in the driver's seat in the relationship. Obviously, these are good for new relationships...after time, I would hope that there is greater communication. I recommend this book to all single women out there!! It is cover to cover magic!!
