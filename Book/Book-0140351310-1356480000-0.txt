review/summary: Witty and Inspiringreview/text: The most favorable aspect of Bronte's Jane Eyre is her humor. There is so much wit hiding in the undertones of Jane's astute observations and conversations. To me this is a fantastic read which I come back to of and over again, for the love story, the humor, and the inspiration Bronte provides in the character of Jane Eyre. She is strong and witty and independent, yet kind and good and humble. This is a rival for one of my favorite books of all time.
