review/summary: A story of a man who dared to live a dream - for a woman who didn'treview/text: The Great Gatsby. A story of a man who dared to live a dream - for a woman who didn't. A story of one great and foolish love that's been squandered by those not capable, those that chose to watch from the outskirts of life, because it's safer that way. Because he, the great Gatsby, lived a dream that threatened to expose their own blank existence by comparison, so they participated in the feast, they tore the juiciest pieces off each dish, only to wipe their greasy fingers on the table cloth, when the party was over, with the words, that "poor son-of-a-bitch."Of course I can only dream to capture what The Great Gatsby is about, but this rang true to me when I closed the book. This voice kept telling me over and over. Don't you dare thinking you can, it said, don't you dare sticking your head out, I will whack you so hard, you'll be sorry. Don't you dare dreaming of style and flair and exuberance, I will yank the carpet from under your feet just so you know where you belong. Don't you dare. But I do. I will read this book many times over, to hear the story anew each time, to learn the beauty of language from those impossibly long sentences that wrapped their ideas around my head in an exquisite silk of thought. The way only Francis Scott Fitzgerald could command them. My hat off to the master.
