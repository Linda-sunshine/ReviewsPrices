review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: First book purchased for Kindle. This is about the fourth or so time I&#34;'ve read the book. I missed being able to flip back and forth to the maps but I think I just need to learn how to navigate the Kindle better. Overall a good experience. Wanted to read again before the movie comes out. Read while working out so it was nice to be able to flip thogh pages without actaully having to hold pages in place or having them get wet from sweaty fingers.
