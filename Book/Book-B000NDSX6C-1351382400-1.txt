review/summary: A Charming Version Of A Classicreview/text: This Pocket Edition of The Hobbit contains the full text of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic story, with the maps and black and white (but no color) illustrations that are to be found in larger editions. The charm of this edition is its smaller (dare I say hobbit-like?) size, which can fit easily within a pocket or handbag. Thus it becomes easily portable or, if one is as consumed by a love of Middle Earth as I am, it is exactly the right size to become a treasured talisman to be kept close to one's side.Inevitably many will consider this Pocket Edition to be suitable for children, and indeed they will find the story as charming in this version as in any other, nevertheless I would question the wisdom of giving this edition to a child as his or her's very first exposure to Tolkien. The larger editions containing color as well as black and white illustrations (preferably Tolkien's own) would better introduce a new reader to the magic of Middle Earth.Nevertheless this charming edition has great appeal and deserves to be part of every Tolkien collector's library.
