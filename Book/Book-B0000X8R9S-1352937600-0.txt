review/summary: Excellent book for an adventurous soulreview/text: This is an great book. I read it when I was in elementary school and got lost it's story. I would notice that I often wondered how I would fare in Brian's situation. It was years later that I watched the movie Castaway and was immediately reminded of Gary Paulsen's series of books that dealt with similar situations. I loved this book and it is one of my fondest memories of childhood reading. Thank you Mr. Paulsen for your time and dedication put into writing such an excellent piece of literature.Randal
