review/summary: Childhood memoriesreview/text: As a small child my parents got me the Golden Books version of The Hobbit. It was my favorite story that I would not go anywhere without. Sad to say that I annoyed everyone in my household and the book "disappeared". This was my first time reading this version and I loved it!
