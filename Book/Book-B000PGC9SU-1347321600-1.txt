review/summary: a fascinating read!review/text: A fascinating read! Even written several centuries ago, it's still fascinating to the modern reader. It's interesting to see how Benjamin Franklin progressed from a boy to the man as we know him today. It is an inspiring book, especially considering all that he accomplished in his short life. It's too bad the bio stops midway through his tireless life... I would've liked to read more! Highly recommended, even for high school readers or earlier.
