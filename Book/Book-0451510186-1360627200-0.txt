review/summary: A Masterpiecereview/text: This is one of the best books I have ever read. The depth and level of realism that Wilde is able to infuse into the characters is almost unbelievable. Addtionally, I am so enamored by this book because of the timelessness of the theme of societal pretense. This is a classic that one should truly make time to read.
