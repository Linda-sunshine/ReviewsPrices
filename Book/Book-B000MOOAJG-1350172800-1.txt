review/summary: A Sign of our timesreview/text: A country where the government is on the rise for power and control. A country where the government wants to make everything " fair and equal." A country where the government attempts to control and keep the best and the brightest from surging ahead even when it is in the beat interest of the greater good.Sound familiar. Ayn Rand predicted this over 60 years ago and lays out what our government is currently involved with in changing our country from a capitalist society into one where "everyone gets a fair slice of the pie."If you read this book, you will never look at the government in the same way again. It will change your life.
