review/summary: Couldn't put it downreview/text: I have heard about this book since high school and finally decided to pick it up. Wow. Every night I couldn't wait to get into bed and read what Catherine and Heathcliff were up to. Now I'm finished and I've started 4 different books, just to be disappointed. None are nearly as good as this one. It will suck you in.
