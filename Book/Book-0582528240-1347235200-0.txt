review/summary: Wonderful!review/text: The look at society's assumptions about colored folk was startling. I, for one, forgot how "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" could be so entertaining: rich with Mark Twain's humor and for us now, educational about how things really were. The end, while a little disappointingly unrealistic, nevertheless wrapped up just what the title proclaims and Twain emphasizes throughout -- a wonderful adventure story.
