review/summary: 3.5 Starsreview/text: I found this to be a really fun book to read. Calamity is such a hoot. Always getting into trouble at every turn. It reminds me of people I know in real life. She has a hard time dealing with how people see her, so she try's to change that fact. Along the way, she find's her-self in deeper water. She does not give up, it makes her even more determined to get to the bottom of it.* If you like fun mystery's that will make you laugh and stay on the edge of your set, this is the one I would recommend to you.
