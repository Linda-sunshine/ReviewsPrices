review/summary: A Marvelous Readreview/text: My daughter recommended this book to me. At 58 and one who reads a lot I don't know how I missed this charming book about Francie Nolan (or is it about Brooklyn?). I loved every word. It was one of those books that I knew did not have an engrossing plot that chilled my nerve ends, I didn't care where it led me because I was living alongside a girl growing up in poverty who was teaching me about life. It is a story that both shamed me for my cavalier approach to material goods and gave me a renewed deep appreciation for the depth of the human spirit. If you have ever read Stegner you will love this book. The development of the characters, the easy flow of the narrative and at times, nodding your head in approval. It reminded me of Stegner's book 'Crossing to Safety'. I thoroughly enjoyed this read.
