review/summary: have 3 copiesreview/text: I read this when it first came out. I read to my chilren who are over 40 now, and i read it 5 times over. This is one of the best books ever and to now have it on my Kindle is a treat for me. I will never give my original book copies, but the convience to have this on the kindle is such a mind boggle
