review/summary: Jack Reacher at his best.review/text: Lee Child is great in this book. Jack Reacher is at his best in solving the &#34;crime&#34; and in defeating his nemises. It has all the elements that Jack Reacher seems to be capable:critical thinking, physical prowess, interpersonal relations and a search for Justice.I highly recommend this book as well as the movie
