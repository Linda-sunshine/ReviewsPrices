review/summary: Not a very maximum ride.review/text: It was interesting, but I want more, so "It's OK."The story has promise, but it just doesn't move far enough. There is some character development, but not enough for the length of the book. There is too much hand-waving when it comes to getting into or out of situations and explaining background: "Oh, so-and-so has powers that can do this" and "... and then we escaped."
