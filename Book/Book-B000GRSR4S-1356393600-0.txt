review/summary: Something I came back to after many yearsreview/text: And the thing with Vonnegut is this. You sometimes feel like editing him; you feel there should be more words and long luxurious sentences that meander along to delight the reader.Don't do it! Short sentences work. It's the order they come in that makes them work. Connecting sentences together to make a story is the trick.
