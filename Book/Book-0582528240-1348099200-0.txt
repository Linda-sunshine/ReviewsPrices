review/summary: Great American Novelreview/text: I've always heard others talk about how groundbreaking "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" was, but I never imagined that it would be such a controversial, yet beautiful novel. It comments on slavery and discrimination while also allowing the reader to watch Huck Finn grow into a mature character. There's a lot of adventure and mischief present in the novel to keep readers enticed; from Tom Sawyer's love for adventure novels to the lies that Huck has to tell in order to keep Jim safe. One of my favorite parts of the novel is when Jim realizes that Huck is his only friend, and then Huck accepts that Jim is a fellow human being, and not at all as horrible as Miss Watson and other characters may have portrayed him and slaves as a whole. Rebellion is prevalent in this novel, and it inspires the readers to not take everything at face value. After reading the novel I felt that it was important to be independent in one's thoughts. The scene with the sheriff made that evident being that when we're in a crowd we are more likely to be influenced by others, but when we're alone we have that moment of sincere reason. The more you read this book, the more you realize how harsh life was for slaves in that time. It really makes you question who you are, just as Huck had to when he decided to "go to hell" instead of turn Jim in. It reminds you that sometimes, a little reevaluation is needed, and that's what I believe makes the book so amazing. It has the power to make you question everything you've ever believed in.
