review/summary: mehreview/text: This book was recommended to me by a professor at a university. I really thought it would get better once I started understanding all the characters. In reality I wanted to meet the main character and punch him in the face. He is not a lovable character or one that learns his lesson in the end. I did enjoy the description of the setting and could actually hear these characters come to life in my head.
