review/summary: Distopia as told by a Womanreview/text: If you have any interest in a feminist's nightmares, distopias, or total social revolution, this will surely hold your interest. The writing is not so complicated that highschool or middle school aged kids could read it, although it does have sexual content that is neither graphic or titillating. It has a lot of Orwellian elements, and also reminds me a bit of the work of Ray Bradbury.
