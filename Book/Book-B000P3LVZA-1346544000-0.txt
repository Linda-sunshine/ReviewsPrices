review/summary: Trippy...review/text: This is a very entertaining book, that I honestly enjoyed reading. It gives a great bit of the author's insight and fears of what the future may hold. I believe it portrays an excellent example of the fear that author had in mind about how certain individuals/organizations can (and may be currently using to) control the masses, by the use of drugs, religion and the chemical alteration of it's citizens. Then an outsider comes into this society, rocks the boat and becomes a celebrity of sorts. But your interpretation may be different. The controlling is a much different matter in the book where instead in this reveiw it sounds crazy, but it all fits. I really liked it, and you might too. Go ahead, give it a read, and if you didn't like it, what did you really lose?
