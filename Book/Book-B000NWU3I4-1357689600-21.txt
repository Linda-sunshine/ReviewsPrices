review/summary: Original Hobbit runs "rings" around the movie(s)review/text: I read this Tolkien book a long time ago and re-read it in preparation to seeing the movie of the same name. The book was fun, Bilbo was an extremely reluctant hero. His adventures just came upon him and he survived in spite of or because of his own bumbling but pure heart. As Bilbo and the dwarves and Gandalf neared their goal of destroying Smaug in his Lonely Mountain lair, there were unintended consequences of their acts to other groups including the community of men down the river. I liked it that things were not so black and white. Certainly this book is a much better read than the movie which I found to be overly somber and incredibly violent with very hard to believe fighting sequences where nobody gets hurt. Read it and compare. You'll see what I'm talking about.
