review/summary: Humbling and miraculousreview/text: What a refreshing re-read (after 40 odd years). Corrie ten Boom's story, as told in 'The Hiding Place', remains one of the most influential and inspirational books in all ways. In her words - "our only safety is to remain in God's will". Her entire book is testimony to this. Her survival through WW2, and the ten Boom helping hand in over 800 lives (and countless more since) remains one of the most remarkable stories of all time. A great read for young and old. Difficult to put down (excuse the cliche!).
