review/summary: One of the very best!review/text: CS Lewis takes a methodological and systematic approach to hit the issues that most people see with or experience in the Christian life dead on. It would not matter if you have been a Christian your entire life or became a Christian yesterday, this book is a must.No doubt that people who wish to be rude and unchained by moral restraint will raise an objection to what they find in this book. The problem is that these people tend to prove what the book is talking about.
