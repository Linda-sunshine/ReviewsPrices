review/summary: A long read, but worth it for the intricate charactersreview/text: This book is considered one of the best works of Dumas and is included in the top 100 novels at [...].... But, it's a very, very long read. Not that the twisted (often convoluted) story isn't intriguing. Most of us are probably aware of the story and most of us have probably seen one (or two) of the hollywood versions of the book. Just like most movie-adaptation/written-word works, the book far exceeds the film(s). Differences are as small as location details and as large as, "That's how it ended?!"One of the things a book can do that a movie can't is give you a depth to its characters. And character development is what really lets us know (and love/hate) the heroes/heroines and villains in a story. I think if you take the time to read this original version, you'll find a new side to Edmond Dantes and many of the other literary mortals described in the pages of this complex classic.
