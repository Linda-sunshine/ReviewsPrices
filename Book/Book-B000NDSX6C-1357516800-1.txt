review/summary: The Hobbit is endless....review/text: When I compare this story to those in the Harry Potter series, the Hobbit fails to impress. The Hobbit seems to be endless (I am still reading it) , but not in a way that holds my interest. I can't imagine reading another book in this series.I am not a kid, I am 78 and started reading Harry Potter when I was 68. I read a great deal and I have gone back and re-read books from my past including Silas Marner and others. I read War and Peace for the first time this past fall - it is a brilliant story.I recently read The Life of PI which was a good tale.Clearly, the Hobbit and other stories by Tolkien have wide appeal - it least the films - , but not for me.
