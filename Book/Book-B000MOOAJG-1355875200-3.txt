review/summary: A life changing bookreview/text: I first read this book when a lot younger and still in graduate school. Of course I skimmed it then, what with all the other books i had to read every week. But now? Definitely a life changer in that a careful reread showed me several things. . .One, i am not crazy! Rand wrote more than fifty years ago about what I am seeing now, and feeling. . .that inner gut sensing that &#34;things&#34; are in decline, that the dreamers, the producers are ever smaller in number while the takers the &#34;looters and moochers&#34; as Rand named them are on the march. There is nothing like being self employed, running your own business, to heighten this awareness. Her portrayal of how such people think, especially when in a group pressed for a rational decision, hide in corners. muttering vague platitudes while at the same time relentlessly press their agenda behind the collective mask, that triggered derisive laughter, that &#34;OMG, someone has seen this too,&#34; or rage that such are the ones that continue to flourish.. I've traveled around the world seveal times, there is nothing like visiting a post communist nation, seeing the wreckage and malaise that still exists in some of those regions. No spoiler here. . .as I read the chapter where Dagny and Rearden search out an abandoned factory for some &#34;evidence,&#34; I flashed back to such a site in Russia, a massive sprawling wasteland, it would take a chapter just to describe all that I saw in terms of the sheer group stupidity to build that facility where they did. . .and in the cavernous ruins, it now houses sheep and goat herders. Or another such complex in Romania, seeing ragged kids crawling ove slag heaps in search of coal, scraps of metal, anything of any value. It connected in an almost frightful way when a few weeks back a flight took me into Detroit, which connected me to what I saw in Russia. .and to Ayn Rand's propehtic work which I literally had been reading on that flight.The book spoke to me on a very personal level as well as to my expectations of self, why I strive to create (author here), what is it that I write about, even some very personal aspects as to ethics and personal expectations. The further into the book, the more notations I was making to refrence back to later.If you are intimidated by the sheer size of the work. Don't be. You'll find that once into the story, ultimately you will start rationing it out, to let the experience stretch out a bit longer. Upon completion I suspect most of us then turn back to all those notations to reread, ponder, and act upon.It is work that will challenge many assumptions, a work that you will find that some greet with rage, but as you listen to their counter arguments you will hear much about &#34;feelings&#34; but little about logic, or as one friend stated, referencing Orwell's &#34;1984&#34; (which I require all my students to read), their responses will sound like &#34;Duckspeak.&#34;There is a bumper sticker on my car now. It is not &#34;Who is John Galt?&#34; Instead it is &#34;Where is John Galt?&#34;
