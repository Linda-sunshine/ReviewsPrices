review/summary: Entertaining bookreview/text: This book is very entertaining. I am not the guy to sit and read for hours but this book was hard to put down. It was very interesting Heartfelt and inspirational. There were some factual errors on the descriptions of Heaven such as nobody is sad or mad in Heaven and there is no sun in Heaven. (see Romans * and Revelation 23). But this is ok since this is fiction. Overall this is a very interesting story and exxtremely heartwarming.
