review/summary: Not a Little Boyreview/text: "A Princess of Mars" reads like a superhero comix. John Carter, a warrior on Earth, becomes a super-warrior on Mars because he weighs less there. He conquers aliens, wins the heart of a princess, and fathers an egg with her. As a fantasy for little boys, it's great. As literature for an adult woman, I'd give it a miss.
