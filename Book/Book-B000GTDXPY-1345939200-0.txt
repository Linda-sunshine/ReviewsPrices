review/summary: Stinkin Funny!review/text: This book was a funny summer read. I found myself multiple times laughing out loud and shaking my head as Jayne tried to solve the mystery of a dead body in her trunk. The author did a wonderful job describing the crazy family and friends. I would recommend this to a friend who wants to laugh and enjoy a light read.
