review/summary: Boringreview/text: I've been reading a lot of classics since they are so accessible now. I found this novel to be pretty boring. So much detail about things that just weren't interesting. He spends so much time detailing the direction and path of travel that its painful. Also page after page of sea vegetation descriptions. If you can get through the non essential details there are some interesting pieces to the story. I wish I had read a different book in its place.
