review/summary: Couldn't put it downreview/text: This was a great book that brings the Bible and it's characters to life. If you want to gain a deeper knowledge of King Hezekiah and his life, you must read this book. The scriptures inspire, the story brings courage and hope of God's love, forgiveness, and restoration that He is true to his Word.
