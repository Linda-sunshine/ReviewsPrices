review/summary: Easy Tolkein read?review/text: I've seen and read Lord of the rings trilogy, while I found all of them enjoyable I felt that at times the books dragged and were difficult at times. The use of his made up elvish language and places were unpronounceable, and often forgotten when they appeared again! However the hobbitt is different!Tolkein at this point has yet to develop much of his literary prose, and deep love for middle earth folklore. Not that those are bad things, but in later writings it becomes too much of a good thing! Character description 's are kept to what is needed, especially for a larger cast as in this book. In fact I would say in lots of ways you were kept wanting more! You are told partial stories, that won't be finished for several decades, weather it's about gollum or the elves.All in all a very good easy read, that while lacks tolkeins rich folklore, does give young readers especially a fun, and enjoyable adventure!
