review/summary: Brilliant Masterpiecereview/text: Brilliant work. Had me on the edge my seat, especially the second half. I like that this was not about: capitalism vs. socialism (as I thought it was), but instead: those who think vs. those who refuse to (and then blame others, or bad luck, for their troubles).
