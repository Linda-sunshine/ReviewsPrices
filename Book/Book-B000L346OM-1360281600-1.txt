review/summary: Heartbreakingly Beautifulreview/text: My therapist recommended this for me to read. I had to keep tissues at hand and even walk away at times just to catch my breath, but the book is amazing. I he can find a meaning in all his suffering to live and go on and be happy...then any one can. Thia book can give hope to the hopeless.
