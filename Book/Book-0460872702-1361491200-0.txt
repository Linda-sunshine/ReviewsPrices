review/summary: Classic readreview/text: I finally read "one of the greatest American novels of all time" as I've heard The Great Gatsby referred to. That statement may be a bit hyped up but it's defiantly a good read. Not a happy ending but some good lessons about wasting today chasing dreams from the past and what happens when we aren't happy with what and who we have now. Plenty of intrigue and drama will keep you reading. Most of the characters display the ugly, selfish side of human nature which contributes to the authenticity of this book.
