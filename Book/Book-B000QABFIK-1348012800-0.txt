review/summary: Francie Nolan is my favorite heroinereview/text: I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith as a teenager many years ago. I went on to read her other novels as well. I got the audiobook for my husband and I to listen to on a trip. I still love it. I think I missed some of the underlying messages when I read it when I was young, and I don't think I really agree with Ms. Smith's world view, her political and theological ideology. But I love her rather poetic writing style, and the way the characters are so REAL! The reader on this audio version is excellent as well. Everyone should read this book!
