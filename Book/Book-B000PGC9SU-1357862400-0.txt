review/summary: The networking Benjamin Franklinreview/text: The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, although self-serving, made some excellent points. He was an excellent networker, and was way ahead of some current gurus on how to get ahead in the business world. However, he proved with his son that he could hold a grudge. He also neglected his wife. He had a fine sense of timing in political matters and knew the value of patience and persistence in his time in France and England.
