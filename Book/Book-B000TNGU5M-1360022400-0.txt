review/summary: Amazementreview/text: This book really made me think about how good my life is. I get mad that I have to do chores and don't get to eat the food I want to eat. But after reading this book I think about they would do anything to just get bread and it made me feel bad knowing that I complained about a meal when I get 3 of then a day.
