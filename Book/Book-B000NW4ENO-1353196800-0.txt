review/summary: One of the best novels I've read, what took so long?review/text: I never really considered reading this book before and I'd never seen the movie. I'd intended to, see the movie that is, but I'd never even thought about reading the book until a friend had it sitting around and wasn't reading it so I said "what the heck, what's the drama all about?".Having the forward done by Pat Conroy certainly helped as he is one of my favorite all time authors, so I dug in. I can't believe I'd never had this book recommend to me before, especially since I'm an outspoken hater of Lincoln (may he and Sherman burn in hell forever). I mean I really hate murderous invaders so hating Lincoln is easy, I never understood how people can make a hero out of both Washington (fighting for self rule) and Lincoln (invading to stop self rule), but I digress.What was really amazing about this book is that Mitchell managed to give a history lesson and wonderful historical flavor without ever actually "telling" the reader, she just "showed" us and it was wonderful and delightful to read.The is so much rewritten history and people really don't understand much of what they believe or even why they believe it so anyone that thinks they know the about the invasion of the South in the War of 61 and they haven't read this, they are not being honest in what they say they know, they can't be. The way the characters show how life was compared to what we are often taught or simply left to believe because we view things through modern lenses is really an amazing feat and the reason why this is such a good novel.Now to the love and the hate and the clash of personalities and the human nature and on and on, I can't say enough about how great this book is. So much popular modern writing is just trash, or fluff, compared to this depth of characterization, and here's a little clue why: modern writers tend to give us hero's with minor flaws, Scarlet is written very sympathetically, one can't help but love her, and love her deeply in fact, yet she's often wicked, she's certainly totally self absorbed and in modern times we'd probably call her a complete narcissist, BUT we the reader simply can't help but love her.The race relationships in the book are very insightful and give the reader understanding into the culture and mores of the time, and read with a view to the future one can see the root of much of today's racial problems in America, the South was destroyed by the North, the slaves may have been freed in one quick stroke, but they were free for what? The economy was destroyed, enormous wealth was destroyed, and the seeds of resentment and hatred were watered, not just in the hearts of the Southern white upper classes, but in the Northern whites, the poor, the blacks and everyone that suffered huge loss by the actions of state in it's conquest for power.I wish I'd read this book sooner, but now that I have I'll continue to recommend it to any one interested in a great novel of American and Confederate history, and of love, love the universal, the love of family, the love of a woman. Love and hatred, two sides of the same coin and separated by slivers of fate.
