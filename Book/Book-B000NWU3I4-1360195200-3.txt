review/summary: Great story, much better than the moviereview/text: I was inspired to reread Tolkien's &#34;the Hobbit&#34; after seeing the 2012 movie that covered the first 100 pages of the book. The book is far superior to the movie. A battle or fight scene lasting 5 to 10 minutes in the movie is better described in only one or two pages. READ the BOOK!
