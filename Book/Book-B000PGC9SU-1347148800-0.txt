review/summary: Essential self-help for our timereview/text: Benjamin Franklin took on a serious self-examination and developed qualities that we can all benefit from. He was a great example of the virtues that the last chapter ofThe Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy - What the Cycles of History Tell Us About America's Next Rendezvous with Destinysuggests we will need in order to survive well. I recommendBenjamin Franklin: Young Printer (Childhood of Famous Americans)if you are looking for hands on activities to introduce his inventions to kids.
