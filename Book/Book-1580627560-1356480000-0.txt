review/summary: Good advicereview/text: this book gave a lot of good advice! After separating from my husband after 12 years together, I have been investing a fair amount of time researching what could have been done better in a relationship. A lot of the stuff in this book were aligned with the other materials I have read elsewhere. I am now in a new relationship and putting the new things I learnt to good use. This book is definitely worth reading. Having said that the one very basic thing any woman should do is to be happy with yourself because that is when you have the will and power to identify bad behaviors from your partner and to set the right tone from the start. always remember, you don't need a man to complete you!
