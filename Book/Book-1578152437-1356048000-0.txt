review/summary: First Time Kindle Fire Userreview/text: This was my first Kindle book. It was free so I saw it as the best way to jump in. I'm surprised by how much I'm enjoying Dickens. Hated it in high school. A lot of the themes and social commentary are applicable today. The language can be a little sticky but that's part of what I'm enjoying.Reading with the Kindle Fire is a great experience. Battery life is great and the text display is easy on the eyes.The updates as a Kindle Serial are a little too slow for the pace at which I'm reading. It would be useful to have an option to download the next installment on demand.
