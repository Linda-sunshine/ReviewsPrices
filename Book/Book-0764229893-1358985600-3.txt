review/summary: Gods and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings #1 by Lynn Austinreview/text: This book caught my interest from the very first pages. Austin takes the events of the Bible and creates a story line that could have described the actual events. This book is very thought provoking and easy to read, hard to put down.
