review/summary: Jack Reacher and Tom Cruisereview/text: Lee Child's Jack Reacher at his best... but I had to see the movie to see how Tom Cruise could possibly pull off the persona in the role as a man who in the novels is 6'5&#34; and 245-50lbs. He did a credible job, but I would have been happier to see an intimidating &#34;giant&#34;, scarred and battle savvy Jack Reacher ... but I don't know who. Lee Child has created an all-time favorite in the Jack Reacher novels.
