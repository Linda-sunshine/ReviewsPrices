review/summary: All talkreview/text: I watched the movie and expected the book to be much the same. The book has way too much talk in it, hardly anything is described in any other way than by someone remarking upon it. But I liked the story overall, and I thought the authors view on pride was interesting. The characters are believable and somewhat relatable. Some parts were hard to understand because the language is outdated, and I wasn't always sure who was speaking. Only that someone always was. But because of the social nature of the novel, I guess that works.
