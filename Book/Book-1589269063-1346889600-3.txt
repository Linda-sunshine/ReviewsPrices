review/summary: Every married couple should read this book!review/text: My husband and I loved this book! It's an easy read. We both read it in a week and had fun doing the test together. We are both being very conscience of each others Love Language and guess what? It really works :) Our marriage has always been strong but this just gives it another layer of goodness! I highly recommend this book!
