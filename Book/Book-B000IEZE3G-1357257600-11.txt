review/summary: Even better the 8th time.review/text: I've read this book countless times. However this was my first time reading it in the context of the entire series. My favorite part was when Fred & George charmed snowballs to repeatedly hit Voldemort in the face. Also, this was my first read on a kindle. A++!!
