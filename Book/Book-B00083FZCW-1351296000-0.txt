review/summary: How to get your kid to read!review/text: This fast paced sci-fi adverture thriller has just about everything thrown in there. And it is thrown in with the expertise, only a professional like James Patterson can master.This book actually raises your heartbeat. Never a dull moment. Constant action with just enough character building to ensure a constant state of anxiety on behalf of our heroes. Short choppy structure and constant crisis keep you chomping on your nails.My only complaint is I felt I was missing something. I felt I was dropped into the story and it was never really explained as the book unfolded At the end of the novel I still felt a little dissatisfied with my grip on exactly what was going on. I understand that this is part of the ongoing mystery - but I have also read a couple of the sequels.Anywhoooo - Maximum ride is a hell of a ride and I would recommend it to anyone with a short attention span or is just way to busy to wait for the author to get the story moving.
