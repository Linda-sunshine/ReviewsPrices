review/summary: Great series, terrible moviereview/text: These books are great if you like sci-fi, especially from early 20th Century when a lot of what we know today is still unproven or unknown.Don't judge this series on the ridiciulous movie Disney made. The books are PG-13 or even R and are much better constructed than the movie was.
