review/summary: Excellent Free Kindle Editionreview/text: Enough has been said about the book itself by others who are far more qualified--I've read it and I like it. I'll speak to the edition itself, because formatting of Kindle books (especially free ones) can be very hit and miss. The illustrated Kindle edition by Top Five Books is easy to navigate, formatted well, free of errors, and contains a variety of illustrations. It is free, and there is nothing about this version that recommends choosing an alternative.
