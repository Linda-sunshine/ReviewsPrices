review/summary: Wispersync rocksreview/text: I got this book along with the audiobook in order to try out the Whispersync and it was way cool. I like to actually read books but don't get a lot of time to do that, so I could listen to the book when I wanted to and then it would sync up to the approximate location in the written version so I could read when I had a chance. Didn't get it to actually sync exactly to the same spots where I stop reading one and opened the other but it was close enough I could find it without problems.I do bristle a little at having to pay twice for the same book, but I guess I do that with VHS and DVD movies if I want different formats so i can't complain.The book itself is classic. Having seen the movie first I will tell you that the movie scared me a lot more than the book. But it was a good read and a good story.
