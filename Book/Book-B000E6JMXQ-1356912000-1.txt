review/summary: A Journey Beneath the Seasreview/text: I first read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea more than 50 years ago. It was, and still is, a first rate adventure tale. Jules Verne combines action, oceanography, biology, and a bit of philosophy in this epic story. I encourage young readers to take the plunge as I did years ago and devour this novel. Older readers should experience it once again. It is a story to be enjoyed over and over again!
