review/summary: Amazing!review/text: Very pleased with this book. Absolutely loved Bilbos adventures; meeting with trolls, dragons, goblins and especially Gollum. The world is all right at the moment because I have discovered how Bilbo acquired the one ring. Now time to see the movie!! I recommend this book to all those who need a break from the real world, slip into another world full of adventure. This read will enlighten and fulfill all your senses. Proving that those thought to be small and useless to be courageous, intelligent and trully heroic!
