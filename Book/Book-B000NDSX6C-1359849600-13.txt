review/summary: Good Bookreview/text: The Hobbit was OK. I wasn't interested in the Lord of the Rings until the hobbit movie came out and it created such a buzz I just had to find out for myself. I really think that the whole make believe world really isn't for me. Great book for someone who is into that type of thing.
