review/summary: Great motivation for success, irrational concept of humanity, love and good willreview/text: This book is a great motivator for anyone who wants to be successful and who believes in hard work. I too have a problem with people who expect to live all their lives for handouts, people who develop a hatred for the success of other's. They become so engulfed in jealousy of the success of others that all their energy is spent being jealous rather than achieving their own goals. I also like the premise that one's help must not be "demanded" from another and people must be willing to help themselves. I have a brother who is older than me and who behaves just like Rearden's brother and who acts as if the world owes him something. He owes me $9000 which I know I will never reclaim. But after reading this book he will never get an ounce of assistance from me. The concepts of love in this book are irrational and laughable. Falling in love with someone you never met? All in all it was a good read. Readers of this book need to remember that there is one absolute in life, that of balance.I believe that it is important for individuals to seek their self interest and not be ashamed of doing so as espoused in this book, but we must never seek our self interest to the detriment of others, just as we do not want their self interest to be to the detriment of us.
