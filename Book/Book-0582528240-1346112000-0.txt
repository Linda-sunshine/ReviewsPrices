review/summary: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. First Edition Reproduction.review/text: This is a review of the reproduction of the first edition of Huckleberry Finn by InteliQuest. Im not going to review the book because you can find tons of reviews online or better yet you can read the book for your self. I love to collect things but being Im on a college budget I dont think I will ever be able to afford a real first edition of any book let alone a first edition of Huckleberry Finn. However upon seeing this book I had to have it. The level of detail went into reproducing this book is incredible. The book comes with a COA that tells about the first edition and mentions several mistakes that were included in the first edition. This book is an exact reprint(including misspelled words and missing page numbers), except for 2 things. First, the outside cover is brown not green(Not a big deal. I like the brownish leather look better anyway). Second, there is one mistake that was not reproduced, someone apparently messed with the printing plate on a few of the first editions and added male sex organs to one of the pictures. Rather obvious why the did not put that mistake back into this edition. Other than that this book is extremely well done for a reproduction or collectible. One of the best Ive ever seen and will be a stand out in my collection.
