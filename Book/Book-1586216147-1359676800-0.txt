review/summary: Sappy Wishful Unrealismreview/text: I love romances. I really do. But this one is really abysmal. The movie is reasonable, but the book is intolerable. If I have to hear the sentence &#34;She was beautiful&#34; just one more time, I'm going punch Nicholas Sparks in the kneecaps. This book is very much a good indication of why Sparks was unknown for so long. The movie works. The book definitely doesn't.
