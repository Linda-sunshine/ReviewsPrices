review/summary: Depressing Bookreview/text: I disliked this book thoroughly--it was completely different from what I thought it would be. I couldn't even find a character that LIVED that I liked and was rooting for. By the end, I really disliked them all. If you are looking for a nice romantic read like Jane Eyre or Emma or Persuasion then DON'T read this book. I am sure it is classical literature and makes a nice commentary on society, but as I was not reading this for an English class, I wouldn't know about any of that. I was not analyzing it, I wanted to read it for fun but didn't enjoy it at all.
