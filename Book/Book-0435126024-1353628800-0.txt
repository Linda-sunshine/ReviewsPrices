review/summary: Jane Eyrereview/text: Now this was a real surprise - a &#34;classic&#34; that was worth reading. Okay so I came to it in a very round about way, having seen the recent film, and then read &#34;The Eyre Affair&#34; by Jasper Fforde (clearly missing out on much of the fun there through my ignorance!) but this was a good read. Compared to the horror and suffering of reading Pride & Prejudice, Jane Eyre was a character who I cared about.
