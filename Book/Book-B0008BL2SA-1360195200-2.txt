review/summary: Touching read, with much relevance to modern times.review/text: This was a special read for me as I grew up watching June Allyson play Jo March in the 2nd movie remake. It was interesting to read all the similarities between the book and all movie versions, but I also enjoyed the stories that were not included in any of the movies. Interestingly, I enjoyed many of the lessons regarding growing up and marriage that I feel still ring true in our current times.
