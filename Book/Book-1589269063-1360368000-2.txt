review/summary: What an eyer opener!review/text: My husband and I have just finished doing this study, and it has helped us tremendously. Finally, we have been able to make some sense of the source of so much friction and misunderstanding between us. Only wish we had discovered it sooner. This is a great book, and we would recommend it to anyone who is married, or considering marriage.
