review/summary: Sophmoricreview/text: zSophmoric is the perfect word to describe Atlas Shrugged. It is full of youthful angst and energy, the same self-centeredness of adolescence and the profound ignorance of those who haven't travelled beyond their own safety zones, much less began university-level studies of politics, psychology and economics. Every high school student should read it - sophmore year! - so that he or she can more deeply appreciate the benefits of knowing something of the real world conveyed by higher education and how ideologues like Rand use ignorance to warp perceptions and sooth the guilt and greed of the Taggarts and Galts of the world while fluffing their own nests. Really, would anyone want to spend afternoon or an evening with any of the righteous, narcissistic and downright boring characters of this book while they talked non-stop for hours about things they know little about? If you have, or remember being, a teenager, you know what I'm talking about.
