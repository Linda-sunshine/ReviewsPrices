review/summary: Quick interesting readreview/text: My wife is an English teacher for the local high school and this is required reading this year. I wasn't impressed with the introduction, but continued anyway. Kind of glad I did. It was a journal that was kept by the author as he made his way through the concentration camps as he grew up. It was moving at times and never did my interest sway. Nice quick read.
