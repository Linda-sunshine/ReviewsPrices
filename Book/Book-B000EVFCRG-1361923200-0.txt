review/summary: this stood and will stand the test of timereview/text: because it's a story for everyone, regardless the time we live in.it's sweet, warm book with alive characters for whom you can't help caring.i never liked Amy, she was always to mannerish for me, but the relationship between the sisters and their mom is beautiful.How much they love their mother!It's a beautiful, sweet, warm, and kind story. I could use so many adjectives.I will love this book always.
