review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: The Arthur's writing this book is excellent and I like their plots of story. It was a good end, that's why I gave five full stars! Also, I like how they described about the characters in this book and it gave me some of version in my own imagery. I would recommend this book to my family members and English class at college. Or if any of my friends asked me what they should read, I would recommendation this book first thing! (:
