review/summary: Loved it!review/text: This review only pertains to the 50th anniversay edition of the novel ( considering the fact that the Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite novels and I have only words of applause for it ). The book is beautifully bound, with a cover that changes colors between black and dark blue depending on the light, the maps are gorgeous although you have to be very careful with them because they rip easily and the images from the book of Mazarbul are a delight. All in all I recommend this version of the book for those who have already enjoyed the novel and wish to add a fancier version to their old battered paperback version.
