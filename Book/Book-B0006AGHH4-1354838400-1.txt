review/summary: One of the best books, ever.review/text: Not only does this book capture the emotional and social essence of the climate of the slavery era in America, it also is a beautifully written piece of literature. The characters and plot lines are wonderful. The fact that the characters and plot-sub elements are based upon real people and real events only makes this book more wonderful. While it is hard to read at some points, the value of this book is so great, and gives you a huge insight into the times and attitudes from the 1800's that have impacted the ongoing history of our country.
