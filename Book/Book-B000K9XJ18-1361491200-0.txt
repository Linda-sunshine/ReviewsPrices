review/summary: What Surprise Ending?review/text: I've never written a review before but I am baffled by all the people who think this is the best Jack Reacher book. This book was offensively thin. The "bad guy" was so glaringly obvious early on and repeatedly supported as being the bad guy that I had to stop reading and come here to see what people were saying about it. I couldn't believe that I wasn't missing something. There must be a great twist the reveals a different bad guy. But the twist came and... it was exactly who they told you it was all the way through. I don't want to belittle anyone, but how thick headed must a person be not to know the end of this book a third of the way through. And the clues as to who it was were so heavy handed. I thought fur sure this character is our ruse. But it wasn't. I loved the first three reacher book, then I hit this turd and he's lost his luster. Maybe I just guessed the bad guy early and when you read with that person in mind the clues punch you in the face with striking clarity or something. Ugh! I want those hours back. And now all I've probably done is made you curious to read it and see if it's really as transparent as I said it was. I'm sorry if you do.
