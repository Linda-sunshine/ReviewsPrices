review/summary: Amazing insightreview/text: Hmmm! And I thought we were a mismatch. But after reading this book, it's not about being mismatched, it's about understanding the individualized person and what makes them tick. I'm going to encourage my husband to read this book. Total eye opener for me. Now I see what his love language is and can now begin using the suggestions Gary Chapman makes to encourage my husband and to hopefully get the relationship between the two of us moving forward in a positive manner.
