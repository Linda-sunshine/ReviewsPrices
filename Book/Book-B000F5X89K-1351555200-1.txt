review/summary: I know the secret of animating dead matter... But I'm not going to tell you...review/text: So here's a story about a really smart guy who figured how to make a man from scratch. You would think he'd have enough balls to not run away from what he created because it was a bit ugly. I guess he donated those to his creature.I'm glad I read this book because it is something I should have read when I was younger but I didn't care for how Frankenstein behaved in the story. For such a brilliant mind he sure acted like an idiot throughout the story which I believe makes him more responsible for the deaths of his family and friends than his creation.
