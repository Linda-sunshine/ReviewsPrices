review/summary: Good kindle version of an American classicreview/text: There are numerous reviews of this American classic available on the web, so I won't bother trying to re-hash them; suffice to say I found it thoroughly enjoyable and a good holiday read. This kindle version seemed well formatted, I had no problem with the default text size, and it is nice to have a linked table of contents.
