review/summary: It reaffirmed my view of reality as opposed to modern liberalism's intentional distortionsreview/text: After years of feeling somewhat estranged in modern liberal society, the book helped me to realize that I was right all along, that A=A and that 1+1 =2, not what other people desired it to be. For example, in the recent gun control controversy liberals are ignoring or even criticizing the protection of schools with armed guards, yet the President has just signed an executive order extending the secret service protection of himself and his family for life. Gun control advocates like Governor Cuomo are surrounded by armed guards all the time. Yet, they are not good enough for our children? A only equals A when they "feel" it does. Otherwise, it equals B or anything else to further their ideology.
