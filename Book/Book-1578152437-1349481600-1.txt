review/summary: A Great Book in Smaller Piecesreview/text: There is no need to comment on this Classic after all, but I am reading it to my kids at night, and the serial format is perfect. I am reading it twice at once, because I have to explain what the author is saying after virtually every chapter, but that helps me get more out of it as well. I only ever watched the movie, so this is a great way for me to get all the details I never knew about. And its free....nuff said!
