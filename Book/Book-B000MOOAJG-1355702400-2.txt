review/summary: Frighteningly accuratereview/text: The only reason I didn't give the book five stars I'd because I do not espouse objectivism in the form Ayn Rand did. I believe in helping those who truly need help, like the elderly, disabled, etc. but I believe I should help from the desire to help, not because some bloated federal government tells me how much I must give and to whom it should be distributed. The society the Rand envisioned over fifty years ago bears a frighteningly striking resemblance to the society in which we now find ourselves living. Even before I heard of this book, I found myself wishing there was some place those of us who are producers could go to get away from the leaches of the federal government. But I fear the &#34;last, best hope for freedom&#34; may not be that much longer, and there is really no where else to go. If those of sound reason do not get involved and enact change soon, we will find ourselves living in a society where &#34;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&#34; will be the law of the land. In that case, the &#34;needs&#34; keep growing and growing until they swallow up all the ability. Remember, Socialism starts out spreading the wealth and ends up spreading the poverty.
