review/summary: Wonderful classic and love story!review/text: Not being a very avid reader of the classics I was quite surprised at the relevance of the story to the fiction of today, but masterfully written! As a 28 year old guy I'm not usually accustomed to picking something like this up, but at the encouragement of my wife and the audio book available I was welcome to the opportunity of reading/ listening to it. All in all I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone looking to expand their language and or their list of great books to read.
