review/summary: JANE EYREreview/text: THIS IS ABOVE ALL A GREAT AND GRIPPING STORY. JANE IS A PERSON OF COURAGE AND HONESTY. HER ATTACHMENT TO ROCHESTER IS IN SOME WAYS A PUZZLE SINCE HE SEEMS TO BE A LESSER PERSON THAN JANE HERSELF. THE ONLY WEAK POINT IN THE STORY IS WHEN JANE FINDS SHE IS ACTUALLY A RELATIVE OF THE PEOPLE WHO SAVED HER LIFE.
