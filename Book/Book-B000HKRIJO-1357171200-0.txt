review/summary: Excellent Book!review/text: I love C.S. Lewis. His writings always amaze and teach me new ways of understanding and looking at something. This is one of his greatest works. This book is very deep so is sometimes difficult to comprehend if reading quickly. It is a book that must be read slowly, allowing lots of time to think, reflect, and process the thoughts of C.S. Lewis. I highly recommend Mere Christianity.
