review/summary: Incredible Bookreview/text: This book had 685 reviews when I downloaded it and I feel the 4-star ranking does not to justice to it's contents. This is a classic in self-help.There are self-help books put together with rehashed material or not enough material(lots of fluff), this is one book where some repetition is only aimed to drive home the point, when needed. Otherwise the anecdotes shared and the insights given are phenomenal. It confirmed my long held beliefs and instinctive reactions, which many women found objectionable.In my opinion, this book is applicable not just to romantic relationships but to all human interaction. It teaches a woman to hold herself in high regard under all circumstances, while being fun and spontaneous. There are 100 Attraction tips for holding your own in a relationship and winning the respect of your significant other, and they are all valid not just for singles but for wives as well.This book speaks to all those women who lead insecure lives, bending over backwards for men (and generally being bitchy to fellow women). It tells them how to create and maintain self worth, which is endearing and attractive to men. I can personally see a lot of women I know, benefiting from this sagacious writing.I also found the closing paragraph to be very powerful.
