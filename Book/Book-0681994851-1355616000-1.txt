review/summary: My favorite novelreview/text: This book was on my high school reading list and I just got to it 50+ years later! I loved this story! Even have read it twice and I NEVER read anything more than once. It was hard to put it down. The characters became so real to me. It was one of the best love stories, too. I have viewed four different versions of this book done on the screen. One of them shows just about the whole book and I love it!
