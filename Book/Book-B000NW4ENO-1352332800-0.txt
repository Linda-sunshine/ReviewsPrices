review/summary: Gone With the Wind 75th Anniversary editionreview/text: The book arrived on time, in good condition, however, I was disappointed that it was a paperback version. I should have read the comments closer and I would have known it was not a hardback--in which case I would not have purchased it. I do not feel it will remain in good condition for long and I am worried that the binding may work loose with reading and also will not store well on my shelf. I do not understand why this book was not offered in a hardback edition, after all, I would think most people purchase them to add to their collections and plan to keep them for many years.
