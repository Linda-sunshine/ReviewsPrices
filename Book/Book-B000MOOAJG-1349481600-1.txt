review/summary: Romance on a Hot Spotreview/text: Atlas Shrugged (Centennial Edition)Time has not mellowed one of the more controversial novels of the past fifty-five years. It is well worth a second visit if its length, dated style and syntactic weaknesses do not discourage the reader. The plot addresses philosophical and political issues as relevant today as at the time Rand drafted the novel. The protagonist's romantic adventures and the personalities of the many characters keep the novel from becoming overly polemic. Although the story line is fanciful, the underlying presumptions are forceful.D K Elliott, Author, The Canyon Caper
