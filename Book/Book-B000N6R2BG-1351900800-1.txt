review/summary: Dreamy paced novel that reflects on the bigger quetsionsreview/text: First, I would like to say that I enjoyed the novel. While I was reading it, I wasn't sure that I was. I realize that is a strange thing to say, but I felt the book cast a sort of melancholy spell over me, which seemed to pull some of the enjoyment of reading it away.Having said that though, I finished the book in 2 days, so it obviously kept me coming back.What I found interesting is that there was very little "place" description. What the surroundings and the people looked like were a mystery to me. I do not mind forming my own opinion of a characters outward appearances, however I do dislike it when I am told halfway through the book defining characteristics that disrupt what I had created in my minds eye. That is the reason I gave the book 4 stars. If you are going to tell me that someone looks a certain way, tell me upfront so I am not surprised by the information halfway through the book.The story asks some important questions, and does so in a lyrical and beautiful way. The story is one of light, set against the darkness of depression and infidelity an divorce.If you are interested in spirituality, angels, god, all the big unanswered questions, I think you will appreciate this book. Do not look for answers however, because none are forthcoming, which is exactly how it should be.
