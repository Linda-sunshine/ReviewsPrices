review/summary: The Great Gatsbyreview/text: Brilliantly written. It was extremely interesting, but also confusing, and I'm hoping when we do it for a set-work it will be a bit clearer. But I did get the most of it. The ending. It was horribly sad. That, not quite tears, but just ugly feeling sadness.But brilliant. Very good. Had me hooked.
