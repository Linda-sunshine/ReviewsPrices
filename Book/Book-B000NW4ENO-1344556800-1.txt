review/summary: A Book to ReRead Every Decadereview/text: This is my all time favorite. My Nana lived five houses away from MM in Ansley Park, an Atlanta suburb. She pointed out the house many times, she must have thought I wasn't listening. Nana, a staunch Presbyterian finally broke down and read the book, considered somewhat scandalous. (my mother said that Nana disappeared for days until she finished it...and did like it) Margaret was a bit ahead of her time...wanting to be a journalist, to work where only men were permitted. Finally, just to get her off their back...The Atlanta Constitution hired her to cover the homicide division. She flourished.She married Red, then divorced him but they would "meet up" from time to time. Apparently there was ample chemistry. She fashioned Rhett Butler after her handsome rogue of a husband so much so that MGM required Margaret to get a release from him fearing some kind of lawsuit. He signed it gladly, happy for the likeness.I first read the book at age 16 and have since read it five more times. The research for its historical accuracy, the language, the complex characters, the rich texture of the tale and then the FABULOUS ending! Still impressive. Pulitzer Prize, movie, MM's only book, has moved me in a different way each time I sit down with it.
