review/summary: One of my favourite booksreview/text: You cannot beat an old classic. I always loved this story. I'm keen on wordy books. I love to be overwhelmed by description and beautiful lavish language. Though the writing style is often flowery the novel is something I truly adore. Oscar Wilde transcends time. He is still an inspiration even now. And Dorian Gray is truly a remarkable multi layered story. Buy it! You will not regret the purchase.
