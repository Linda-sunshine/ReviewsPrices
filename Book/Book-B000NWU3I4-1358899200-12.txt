review/summary: The Hobbit:A Very Well Deserved Ratingreview/text: I think that the only way J.R.R. Tolkien could have improved TheHobbit is if there was more about The Battle of Five Armies. I understand it is supposed to be from Bilbo's point of view,but I still think that he could have improved.
