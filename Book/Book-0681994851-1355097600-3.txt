review/summary: My wife LOVES it...review/text: I downloaded this for my wife - as she said she used to watch Jane Eyre on British TV, waaaaay back. Though she said it's a bit hard to read, with it being a bit &#34;olde english&#34; (and found herself tapping on many words for their definitions), it was certainly worth re-living Jane and Mr Rochester's love affair.
