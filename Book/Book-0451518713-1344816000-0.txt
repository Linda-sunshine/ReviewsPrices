review/summary: Second Time Readreview/text: Charles Dickens really takes us on an adventure of what it is like for a poor boy (Pip) raised by his sister, and brother in law to come across riches and wealth, graced in servicing the needs of Miss Havisham (I believe), and Estelle. Of course, the moral of the story is, even when you have everything you want, money still cannot buy you love nor necessarily happiness.Other than that, this is yet another one of Charles Dickens' reads, that is classical, and will help expand on your vocabulary, and build on reading comprehension. My opinion is if we can understand the story that Charles Dickens has created ever so descriptively here, and in other stories, then we will understand present day literature, as it appears much easier to comprehend (from my personal perspective).
