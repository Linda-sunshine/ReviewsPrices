review/summary: My favorite booksreview/text: What can I say that people haven't been saying since these wonderful books came out? A most fantastic story that can be read and enjoyed over and over again. I own a variety of editions, including this one in print. I am glad I bought the Kindle version so I can have access to it pretty much anywhere. You never know when you will want to open the front door and step onto the road that seems to go on and on....
