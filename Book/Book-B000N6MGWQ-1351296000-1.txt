review/summary: All endings are also beginnings. We just don't know it at the time.review/text: Very profound,probably one of the best easy books i have read in the long time.After reading this book i became a big fan of Mitch Albom.Thia is one those books that will change your life for ever,it will make you wonder how you affect other peoples lives and how sometimes we take little things for granted,inspirational and a must read.
