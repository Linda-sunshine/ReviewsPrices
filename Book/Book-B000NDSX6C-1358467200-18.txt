review/summary: snuggle in with one of the greatest bedtime stories of all timereview/text: The book that defined a generation of fantasy and fantasy clich&eacute;s, though deeply rooted in a rich literary history of heroic journeys, concerns the quest for treasure of a little Hobbit, 13 dwarves, and a wizard. Though it lacks the powerful poetry of Lord of the Rings, its prose is that of a charming bedtime story, but with all the cleverness and antiquity of Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia. Bilbo is a wonderful character, now a clich&eacute; of the genre, the unwilling, comedic, yet wise and brave hero. And, though Tolkien falls into flat characters based on race, many of his characters, particularly Thorin (a flawed, yet heroic, character), defy classification. Bilbo and Gollum, are in fact, very childlike; two sides of the child: the greedy, selfish child, and the selfless, adventuring, heroic child. One grows up through adventures; one horrifically stagnates. Many of the scenes, particularly the Riddles in the Dark and the final ending, are the quintessential Tolkien: thoroughly engaging, deceptively simple, and totally, utterly brilliant. A fairy tale, hero tale that is a classic for a reason, even if it is just a book to curl up with with a cup of tea and a quilt. Grade: A-
