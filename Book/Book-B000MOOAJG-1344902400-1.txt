review/summary: Thousands of pages of the same point.review/text: I was given this book as a gift by a friend of mine. I don't like not finishing books that I start, although this one truly tested my commitment. I found the book extremely boring. It keeps repeating the same point over and over again, literally for over a thousand pages. I fail to see why this book is so popular. It didn't really change my point of view, but it did bore me a great deal and I was happy when it was finished.
