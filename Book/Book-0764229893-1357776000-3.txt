review/summary: Best fiction I've read in a long timereview/text: I got this book as a free download for my Kindle, and once I read it, I knew why it was free--because the author knew the story is so captivating that the reader would just HAVE to read the rest of the series! I actually read this entire book in one sitting, and when I got the second and third books from the library, I devoured those in one or two sittings each, also, which is rather unusual for me.I love the way the author develops the characters, and most of all, I love the way she remains true to the Biblical story. Various times I paused my reading to say what the Bible said about a particular incident, and I was amazed to see how closely the fiction story and the Bible agreed--character names, place names, and other specific details. This book (and series) has given me a new perspective on the times of the kings of Judah, and I will always read those sections of the Bible with a new vision and understanding of the history and culture surrounding the events.
