review/summary: Earns its place in the list of classicsreview/text: It is easy to see why this book made it in to the list of classics. Herman Melville is a whiz at descriptive text, though at times this makes the book a little long in the tooth. This book is less about a 'story' of the white whale and more a picture of what whaling is all about and whales in general. I enjoyed reading Moby Dick, but it's not a book I'll read again and by the end of the book I was relived I'd finished.
