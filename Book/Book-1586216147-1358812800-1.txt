review/summary: NOT GREAT, BUT ENJOYABLEreview/text: You know which book this reminds me of? Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants. Very similar plot, but not nearly as exciting or romantic as hers. As far as romance novels go, The Notebook was a touching story, but not a memorable one. I wasn't too impressed with the author's writing and was really disappointed as I've heard such good things about his writing and have always wanted to read one of his books. Since The Notebook was such a phenomenal movie (I hear, as I haven't seen it yet), I was all hyped-up to read this book. It must be good if it was made into a movie, right? The story was good, somewhat romantic and its premise sounded great. The problem is, I just didn't feel it. There were beautiful scenes which had me wishing I was in Allie's shoes at that moment, especially when they went out on the lake to feed the swans and geese, but the rest of it seemed so clich&eacute;d. You know that seen-it-done-it-bought-the-t-shirt feeling you get when something isn't new to you? I had that feeling often while reading it. True, this is escapism at its finest and most of us dream of a never-ending love exactly as this one, but I seriously struggled to feel their love for each other. The characters were nice, but not great and there was nothing in the way of character development. The dialogue wasn't all that great either. I'll admit, two or three poetic sentences from Noah struck a chord with me and I went "awwww...", almost wiping away a tear or two, but that's it. Nothing profound or which would stay with me afterwards. I'd still like to watch the movie though. I hear it's much better than the book.
