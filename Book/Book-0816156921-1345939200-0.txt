review/summary: Very disappointingreview/text: As awesome as Dracula started out and as amazing some sections were within the first half, the book as a whole is a huge yawn. I saw this on a few lists of best horror novels of all time (even on a list as one of the scariest books of all time) and I could not disagree more. As I approached the end of the book, I began to wonder "how could this end yet, only fifty more pages to get to the climax of the book and start on the gore by the Count or to the Count?". Fifty pages turned into thirty, then twenty, then ten, and alas Bram got to the climax (if you can call such a disastrous ending) and began and ended it within a paragraph. No gore, no horror, no nothing. I wanted this to be something of horror lore, but it signifies only a waste of time and money.
