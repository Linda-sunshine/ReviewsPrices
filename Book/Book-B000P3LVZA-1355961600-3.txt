review/summary: Still a valid commentaryreview/text: The first time I read Brave New World I was a teenager and I would have given it 5 stars then. This, and books such as Lord of the Flies, were really my introduction to thinking and caring about the way people and societies work.I still give it 4 stars but for slightly different reasons. Yes, the technologies are outdated and the reader has to get past that. The 'savage' character is rather over the top but is therefore useful to look in from the outside at the other characters who could be everyday members of our community. The current trends of society are the same as governments, religions, and industry attempt to stabilize, control and profit from the public. There is a willingness by at least some of the public to accept these trends but I don't believe any readers will identify themselves as Gammas or Epsilons. Huxley was able to draw a picture that is extreme but is naggingly familiar.I will dig out my old paperback with its notes and read it yet again. Yes, it is old and a bit tattered, but I refuse to throw it away and buy new.
