review/summary: VERY thought provoking and surprisingreview/text: When I first began reading this book I didn't know if I could finish it.The subject matter pulled at my heart strings. After all the twists and turns and thought provoking subject matter, I couldn't put it down. I find myself wondering what happened to these characters after the book ended. Hint hint Jodi - ever think about writing a sequel :-)
