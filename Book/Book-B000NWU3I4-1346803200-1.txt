review/summary: The Hobbittreview/text: The book that was sent was not the version that was advertised. I got an older version that was not correct and therefor could not use it and had to go buy the correct version. In dealing with books for future reference I advise the dealer to mail the correct advertised version so that the customer will not feel like it is a was a waste of time ordering online.
