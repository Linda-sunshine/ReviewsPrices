review/summary: Absolute Rubbishreview/text: This book took me 3 days to finish... over a one year period, that is how long it took to continuously muster the willpower to finish it. I don't know where to begin with what's wrong with this book, a much shorter list would be what is actually good about it and that is the few pages between Offred discovering the fate of her fellow handmaid Ofglen and discovering her own fate. But even this is problematic, much like the characters and the entire plot, this occurrence is underdeveloped and hurried. This book might as well have been a series of unrelated short stories, as each chapter is somewhat disjointed from the next. Simply put: Muddled use of flashback, rubbish ending with no closure to the preceding sequence of events and overall no perceivable plot. In addition to a painstakingly slow buildup to some sort of anti-climax at the very end of the book, with an abrupt ending leaving many unanswered questions.
