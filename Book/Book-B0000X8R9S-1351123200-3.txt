review/summary: Cray cray good book!!!!!!!review/text: The book Hatchet by Gary Paulson is a very good book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good read. The main reason that I gave it five stars is because it's probably one of the best books that I have read. I don't enjoy reading all that much but did enjoy reading this book. I could just pick it up and read and not want to stop. There was always something interesting going on that made me want to know what's going to happen next.Gary Paulson made the book very interesting and easy for me to understand. He makes it so you can imagine what it would be like to be Brian. This makes it so you want to just keep reading and never put down the book. This is a very well written book.
