review/summary: Jack Reacher: One Shot: A Novelreview/text: I found the probability that Reacher could avoid a man hunt in a relatively small urban area, without a vehicle, and by both the police and the bad guys, to be rather low. I liked the story line, but many of the actions were predictable and some seemed impossible to perform, like Reacher crushing a big man's chest with a bear hug. Over all, I enjoyed the book but it was not a "great" effort.
