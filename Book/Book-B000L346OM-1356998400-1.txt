review/summary: Man's Search for Meaningreview/text: The book was selected because of its listing in &#34;must read&#34; books. It is in fact two books with the first being his Concentration Camp survival story and the second about Logotherapy. The former is an incredible story of survival with perhaps a significant amount of sheer luck. What shocked me was the manipulation aspects of controlling prisoners by their own and the absolute lack of respect for life. I could not help thinking that many unpalatable incidents were left out of the book. I was not disappointed in the author's desire to show that survival was closely linked to having a meaning in life or positive attitude. Frankl did not wallow in pity, bitterness and was factual in his account during those dark years.The Logotherapy analysis did use jargon and technical terms. However, I was impressed with the argument of not digging into the past to solve all problems. More could have been done to highlight differences to Freud and Adler. Selected case studies did help.For any person wallowing in self-pity this book is a must read. It does add a great deal to the field of 'self-help' literature and a glimpse into the ability of a human being to survive atrocious conditions.
