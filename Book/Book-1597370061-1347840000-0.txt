review/summary: Surprising, interesting...not shockingreview/text: Okay when I bought this book I was leery because I thought it would be too scary. I've read scarier Harlequin Romances lol. Heck I read scarier children's bedtime stories lol. Now that isn't saying this book isn't good. I found myself constantly amazed that someone from Wilde's time could have had such clarity of thought on certain topics. I've never seen the movie made from this but I saw some movie posters. So it was hard taking the horror look and putting that in this book. It is more of a twisted coming of age story and not even one that gets too deep. Lord Henry has deeper moments of speech then Dorian. And as shocking as they said this book would be...I read nothing shocking. I thought maybe the unedited version would actually have a sex scene in it lol but they don't even mention a naughty body part lol. Nothing ever gets remotely sexual. I mean several characters are definitely gay but not in a shocking way. More like Jack McFarlan on Will and Grace. Most of the time I chuckled as I saw "Just Jack" with Jack doing his jazz hands as I read. The main appeal of this story is when it was written. So here is the thing...horror NO. Sexy No. Interesting ISH. neat insight to the time period of the story YEAH. Worth reading but don't fall for the shock and awe lol. Beautiful cover on this edition too. That alone is worth buying a cheap copy.
