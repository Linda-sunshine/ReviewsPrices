review/summary: Wonderful bookreview/text: This book was suggested to us when we were attending mandatory pre-martial counselling, and it is worth the read. Knowing and understanding your own love language, and the language of those around you (not just your spouse, but your parents and kids) can really make a difference in your relationships. For example, my mom-in-law definitely speaks the language of gifts, while my parents, myself, and my husband, don't. So while it's not normal for me to send flowers to my own mother on mother's day (a phone call is all that is desired), I make sure that my MIL is recognized with a gift for all her occasions. Knowing these things really does make your relationships with all the people around you better.
