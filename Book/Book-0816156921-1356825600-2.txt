review/summary: For high school classreview/text: I purchased Dover Thrift Editions version of Dracula to use with a high school literature class. To be fair, it was the most economical unabridged version, but there wasn't a whole lot of room for annotating. For us, it met our needs, but just barely. If you need more space for writing, you may want to consider a different version.
