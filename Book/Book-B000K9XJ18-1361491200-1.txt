review/summary: Another Jack Reacher read!review/text: I have just started reading the Jack Reacher series and am quite taken with the character, although I do not see Tom Cruise as the main character. He did a good job with the movie but I had pictured someone else. Anyway, the series is a good read and recommend that you start with the prequel titles #1 The Enemy and #2 The Affair as it seems to lay the story of Jack out a bit better.
