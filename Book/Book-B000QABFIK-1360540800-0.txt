review/summary: DAYTON SAYS: BUY THIS AUDIO BOOKreview/text: So much has already been written about this book, that there really is not much more that I can add. I am rather surprised that some people gave it a one-star rating. If/when you do listen to this audio of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I believe you will understand why I am a bit confused by the one-star ratings.Our Book Club had this as our February 2013 book to read. One of the things mentioned in our discussion was that what you felt about the book might depend a great deal upon the age at which you read/listened to it. Several of our members read the book in school. Now as older adults, with life experiences and having children of their own, the book meant more to them. I am so very pleased that I had the opportunity to listen to this book. There is a reason that it was named one of the books of the century by the New York Public Library. If you have never read it before, or even if you have, I believe this audio version is one which you will appreciate very much.I highly recommend this book and, in particular, this audio rendition by Carrington MacDuffie. She brought the book to life for me. And, for those of you with a busy life style, having the audio to listen to while you drive, walk, or just rest (and listen to it with your eyes closed), is a great way to experience the book.I will not soon forget this book.
