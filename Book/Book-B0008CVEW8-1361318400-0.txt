review/summary: The famous tale of swashbuckling pirates and buried treasure!review/text: After having watched many movie adaptations and of course the cartoon adaptations I grew up with I'm glad I took the time to read the book. Will I read it again? Certainly! I love the deeper intricacies of story that are often omitted from the movies. My only quarrel is I prefer the movie adaptations over the books representation of John Silver. The book had him more dark while movies had him little more likeable. He's just one of those bad guys you just have to like no matter the case I reckon. So the movies played a bit more on that. But definitely worth my time! I recommend it to anyone with a sense of adventure."Pieces of Eight! Pieces of Eight!"
