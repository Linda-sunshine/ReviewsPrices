review/summary: Love is a Choice!review/text: At first I didn't believe that books such as this would be able to clarify things for me as a man; but I was completely wrong. It truly helped me get a better understanding of myself and the Love I have for my wife and how I can be a better husband to my wife as well as how she could be a better wife to me. I true understand that Love is a choice, but if one Loves someone in a marriage that they will choose to love you as you need them to in order to feel loved, secure, respected and full and you will reciprocate that feeling.
