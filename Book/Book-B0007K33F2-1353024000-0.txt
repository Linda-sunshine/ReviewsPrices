review/summary: The Ultimate Tale of Vengeance!review/text: The Count of Monte Cristo is a classic for the ages with the unforgettable Edmund Dant&egrave;s. This book was enjoyable as a kid in grade school and still is as an adult. Truly a must read for everyone.I did not note many grammar errors in this Kindle version. Readers should keep in mind that this was written in the 19th century by a French author so the dialogue is a bit different but that shouldn't impede anyone from reading this book.
