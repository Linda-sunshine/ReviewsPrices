review/summary: Top Rate book for all Agesreview/text: The Hobbit is one book in the top rank of Fantasy books. Written as if it were a tale being told to children, it is a fitting introduction to the much more serious "Lord of the Ring" trilogy. Totally different in style, it is just as fascinating as The later trilogy.
