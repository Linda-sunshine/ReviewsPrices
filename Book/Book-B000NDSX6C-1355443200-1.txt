review/summary: Great edition to a great bookreview/text: As another reviewer commented, how so you review such a classic??! I was given this book as an I-love-you gift from my fianc&eacute;e. It had never occurred to me that I'd read all the books in the LoTR trilogy and had somehow skipped over The Hobbit; it's unfortunate that I missed out all these years from such a great read. But it's a great time to read it now, with the movie coming out.Since it's been so long since I read the trilogy, I can't really compare writing style/differences between the two. But Tolkien certainly has his way of writing which gives you just the details and describes the environment. He also does a wonderful job of portraying the characters and the personalities and the cultural differences between men/dwarfs/elves/wizards/hobbits. As one reads, they truly feel like they're right there along with Bilbo experiencing this adventure.After reading this book, I am an even bigger fan of JRR Tolkien's writing and I absolutely cannot wait to go see the movie!!**I received this book as a gift**
