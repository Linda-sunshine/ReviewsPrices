review/summary: Uncle Tom's Cabinreview/text: Written in truth and in ways that just break my heart Uncle Tom's Cabin should be required reading for ALL people. Reading how the slave owners ripped families apart reminded me of the Jews being tortured and killed in Germany during WW2. This book is one more piece of evidence of the deep evils humans can do and feel justified.
