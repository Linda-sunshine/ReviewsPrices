review/summary: Lovelyreview/text: I had a great time reading this book. I love the (more or less!) exaggerated characters (all of whom reminded me of real people), and the author's take on human nature. It surprises me that some people,few though they are, don't find humor in it; I think it wouldn't surprise Toole, though! They could have been characters in a future book had he lived. RIP, JKT.
