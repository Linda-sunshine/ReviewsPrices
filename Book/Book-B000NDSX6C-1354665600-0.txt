review/summary: Still a Great Storyreview/text: It's been 20 years since I read this book and it is still a very enjoyable, great story. Very, very imaginative world he creates in this book. Still amazed he didn't go into more detail in a lot of spots in the book, but this doesn't diminish the book at all.
