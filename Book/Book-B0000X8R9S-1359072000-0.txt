review/summary: wonderful!review/text: I bought this book for my 8 year old who reads a bit above age level. I was bored and decided to read it before he did. I loved it and couldn't wait for him to get started on it. My son has frequent and long hospitalizations and this book is an ideal choice for anyone needing some courage, strength, and patience told in a context that a kid could relate to.
