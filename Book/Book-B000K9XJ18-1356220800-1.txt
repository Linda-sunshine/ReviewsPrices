review/summary: Love Reacher, but not this bookreview/text: I've read 5 other Reacher books and thoroughly enjoyed them all. This one, however, was a bust. The FBI characters were absurd and the book had a very disappointing and ridiculously unrealistic killer and method for murder. When I realized what was going on in the middle of the book, I kept hoping that there was some other explanation, but the end brought disappointment with the realization I had been right all along. I would recommend skipping this book and sticking to the other Reacher titles.
