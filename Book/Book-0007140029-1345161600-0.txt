review/summary: one more book to goreview/text: dear other fans loli love the series. im on the very last book in the first series i cant wait to read it ^^this book makes methink of this place in MN near my friends house, we call it the cat barn, we call it the cat barn becuz they live in an old barn, theres this man who feeds them but besides that they are on their own. most of them are scared of humans but if you gothere very daythey start to war up to you. and i think right around the same time the warriors get sick (what do they call it? i dont remember) the cat barn cats do to,so im guessing its something stray cats pick up in that time of mounth... anyways i think the writer did a good job on figuring out what cats mite do if they were like humans, pretty much im saying she did good research for the book.your friend Herra
