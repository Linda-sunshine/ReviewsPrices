review/summary: Treasure Islandreview/text: This audio program was excellent. The characterizations were wonderful. The characters came alive and made the listener feel like he/she was really getting to know them. In this day of poor TV programing, listening to this great old story on CD was an excellent entertainment and a great way to relive this wonderful ageless story.
