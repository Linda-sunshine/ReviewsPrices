review/summary: Thought provokingreview/text: Lots to think about, I liked it, but sometimes it was hard to get the meaning behind which was the better parts. Interesting to see how life was, if you didn't grow up being taught that way. Makes you watch what is being taught to you and not to believe everything. Society can be wrong, life is a mixture of grays not black and white.
