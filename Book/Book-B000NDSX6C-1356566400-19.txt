review/summary: Simply the best!review/text: Tolkien took the world with him to Middle Earth with this beautiful story when it was first published and some of us have not been able to fully leave it since we first arrived. So I can not give it anything less than 5 stars.The way he paints you the landscape with his words and how he makes the strangest things sound perfectly normal breathes life to characters that invaded our hearts.
