review/summary: Sometimes hard to follow, but kept me interestedreview/text: I saw the movie a few years ago, wanted to compare with the book.Then I watched the DVD it is full of suspense.I seem to a special interest in the Twenties, and this fills the bill.I recommend it as a mystery full of surprise.
