review/summary: An excellent book!review/text: This is a classic book! Literally. An excellent story, well written and it provides a wonderful example that even some of the most cold and tight-pocketed people can be changed. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book, especially right around Christmas time. Really helps put you in the right spirit of the season! I recommend everyone should read this book, and since it's free what do you have to lose? Merry Christmas to all! And "God bless us, every one!"I
