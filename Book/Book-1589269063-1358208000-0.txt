review/summary: Will keep this for years!review/text: I bought this at the reccommendation of a friend before my now husband and I got married. I was pretty sceptical and thought it would be more religious mumbo jumbo about what people think is true about the &#34;real&#34; relationship. Boy, was I wrong. My husband and I both read this and learned so much more about each other which is saying a lot because we dated for 6 years before getting married. It has a lot of insight for everyone. I would definitely suggest this book for everyone and we'll be keeping ours around for a long time!
