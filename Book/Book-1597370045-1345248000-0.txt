review/summary: Interestingreview/text: I picked up this book as I was intrigued by the character of Dorian Gray after having watched The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. It was an interesting book, and while I cannot say that I liked it as such, it is good to have read it - my curiosity is satisfied.It was very sad that Dorian went so completely "off the rails", so to speak, under the influence of Henry, and I found the worldview difficult to cope with. At times the irony in the situations was very poignant - such as when Dorian tells Sybil Vane that she is selfish, while he, in fact, is the selfish one. I suppose that justice was met at the end of the book.
