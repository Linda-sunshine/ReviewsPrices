review/summary: Review for Huckleberry Finnreview/text: The novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain, is about a 12 year old boy who lives with 2 elderly sisters, Miss Watson and The Widow, since his dad was an abusive drunk. The theme in this novel is racism and how people thought it was okay. "We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson's N*, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him" (Twain 6.)What I liked about this novel was that it was from a child's point of view, "you don't know about me without you have read the a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter" (Twain 2.) I didn't like how it was so hard to interpret what Jim, the Run away slave, was saying; "I laid dah under de shavins' all day. I `uz hungry, but warn't afeard..." (Twain 55.)This should be read because not only is it a classic, but also it has a nice message. The message says not to abandon your friends, and it can be found anywhere. "'Well, I b'lieve you, Huck, I--I RUN OFF.' `Jim!' `But mind you, you said you wouldn' tell'" (Twain 54.)
