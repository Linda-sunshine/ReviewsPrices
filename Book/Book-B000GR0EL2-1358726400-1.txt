review/summary: A Life-Changing Storyreview/text: Whenever I read this book, my heart is softened toward my God, my family, and my fellow man. The courage of this family to fight for oppressed people, to be imprisoned themselves, and then to forgive those who mistreated them requires a higher calling for all of us. It's a book to be read more than once, in order to remind us to be faithful, kind and forgiving to all those we meet.
