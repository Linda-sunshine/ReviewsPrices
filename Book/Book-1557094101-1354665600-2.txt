review/summary: My daughter is not a huge fan of the bookreview/text: I like books that will keep kids attention. This book doesn't really do it for my child, therefore I rate it three stars. Im hoping she will grow into it, but right now she has very little interest in it. (15 months old) Maybe if your child is 2 or 3 years old they will like it more, but for the younger ones this is a little bit too much.
