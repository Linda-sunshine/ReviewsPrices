review/summary: A must read!review/text: Excellent writing. A fast read considering the subject matter. This is a MUST READ for all females over age 16.A MUST READ for everyone.Several practices in this book are already in use in today's society.Another book to add to my tag: "Big Brother" (along with 1984;Brave New World and Fahrenheit 451) .Fear is a tremendous tool that governments and politicians use to take control of the population.It has happened time after time in history and continues today.Why do we,as citizens and global population continue to give up our rights and freedoms for fear mongering? When will we learn?Very disturbing story.So many good quotes in this book.This book will have me thinking about it,for a very long time. We cannot get comfortable with our rights and freedoms.
