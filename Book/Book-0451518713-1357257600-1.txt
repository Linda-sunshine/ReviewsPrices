review/summary: One of the all time great classics.review/text: Dickens is a master of personalities. He never wastes a character he introduces. They are all tied in to the plot. In Pip he brings out all the good and evil in people. Though I was hoping for a happier ending, its anticlimatic that both Pip and Estella find themselves together years later though neither one fulfilled their life &#34;Expectations.&#34; This is my second time reading this great book and I would read it a thousand times and still love it.
