review/summary: As A Man Thinkethreview/text: I carried this little book in my purse for years, until I gave it to my grandson as part of his graduation gift. I read from it when stopped in traffic jams, waiting in the doctor's office, or sitting in the dentist's chair. Every sentence is full of meaning, and provides food for thought. I missed having that little book to turn to during quiet moments, so I ordered a new one, and enjoy it again today. I am ordering six more volumes as Christmas gifts for people I love.
