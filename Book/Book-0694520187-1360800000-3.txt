review/summary: Moby Dick - maybe the greatest book ever.review/text: This book is an awesome display of the power of the mind and imagination. It's structure is in the traditional sense less than perfect the plot wandering to a side character for pages and then we never hear of the character again. But that just adds to the charm. The book, to me, paints a picture of the human mind in action.I also love Melville's language. After the first two senctences, I was hooked: "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world". And off I went, to the seas with Ishmael, seemingly hunting the White Whale, but actually journeying through a feverish obsessed mind.I have had this book in print for ages, but I wanted to have the ebook too, so I can have it travel with me.
