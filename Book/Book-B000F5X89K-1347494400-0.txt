review/summary: Entertaining..review/text: Though the beginning is a little boring...the end is quite good. Of course, the first chapters are boring because they are mostly introductions and about the characters. I like the way that they have different vocabulary because it really helped me expand my own vocab list! I have to say that though this is a pretty good book, I probably will not read it again cause its just too long. And it is a classic, and I prefer more modern books. :)
