review/summary: Warriors #1:Into the wildreview/text: This book was amazing! I would recommend this book to people who like adventure and action. I would not recommend this book to younger kids because of all the killing. The author did very good at the describing the scenes of the book. Defiantly one of the best books I have read. Can't wait to read the next one.
