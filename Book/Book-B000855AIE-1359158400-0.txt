review/summary: memory hasn't failed yetreview/text: Read this many years ago and was overcome by its simplicity and power.Time passes and life goes on and the paper copy had fallen into one of those holes that life tosses in front of us.Bless you kindle people for providing access to the slightly obscure and uplifting volumes such as this. Found it, ordered it, reread it, and still loving it.
