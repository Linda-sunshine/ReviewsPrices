review/summary: A page-turner and eye openerreview/text: I got this e-book at a friend's recommendation, though I didn't expect it to be that good. I've read the Bible through several times, which of course includes Kings and Chronicles. But it never became as personal to me as it has since reading God and Kings.The atrocities committed in the name of worshipping the idol god Molech is unthinkable to us today. Yet it was commonplace among the people of that day. I have read other works of fiction that are based on Bible stories, and this was among the best.A great story and a great help in understanding the Bible.
