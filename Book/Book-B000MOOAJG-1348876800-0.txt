review/summary: I wish this was a mandatory readreview/text: I originally read Atlas Shrugged a long time ago (end of high school) and at the time it seemed far fetched. Now here we are, smack dab in the middle of exactly what Ayn Rand was trying to warn us about. Published in 1957, it could have turned America around if taken seriously at the time. The dead on accuracy of her dire predictions will astound you. I couldn't believe it when someone in the book gave the "You didn't build it" speech! It makes me glad that it is currently enjoying a renaissance with college students. Read it. It will affect you... It's not too late...
