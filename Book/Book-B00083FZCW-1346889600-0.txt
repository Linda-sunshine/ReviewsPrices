review/summary: A good read but not amazing.review/text: This book was recommended to me by a family member. I found it fairly interesting with cool concepts. However it tends to repeat the same the over and over again. It did leave me wanting to read the next in the series. I was disappointed in how the books turned out as a series. Not my Dave writing style.
