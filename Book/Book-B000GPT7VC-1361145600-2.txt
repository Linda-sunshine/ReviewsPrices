review/summary: grear read of an old classicreview/text: This was a great reminder that Jesus died for everyone and that each of us is called to share in His suffering if we are to share in His resurection. Uncle Tom was a great example of what we can bare if we trust in God to get us through this short journey on earth to ahare His eternal kingdom of glory. And what an example of bringing all around you to that glory.
