review/summary: Fast-paced funreview/text: "Treasure Island" is a great story that I've read a few times - a well-written, fun adventure, with clear descriptions and characterisation, and characters you can side with. It has one or two racist comments, similar to the novel "King Solomon's Mines", but if you can overlook that it is an enjoyable read.
