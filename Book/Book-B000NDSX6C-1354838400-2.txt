review/summary: A Fun and Dangerous Adventure from a Hobbit's Perspectivereview/text: This was a slow read for me, but that is because I haven't been in the spirit to read. However, be that as it may, it was a good read. It started out with a Hobbit (or a small creature) by the name of Bilbo Baggins, and a wizard by the name of Gandalf. The dwarves were in pursuit to avenge their "treasure," and needed a "burglar" (Bilbo Baggins referred by the wise Gandalf). In order to get their treasure, they ran into trolls, elves, wood elves, received some resources for their long journey, and came upon lake people who also aided them in their adventure. At the end, in order to avenge their treasure, that rightfully belonged to them so long ago, they had to fight a dragon named Smaug that doesn't so easily forget when danger is upon him, and he has a very good smell for dwarves. Although they ran into troubles along the way, and they appeared to have gotten their treasure, read more to see whether it was worth it in the end. And see what happens when greed is your number one focus on the prize at hand. Also see how Bilbo Baggins' "burgar expertise" may save more trouble than is worth in his reward to be received at the end of this journey. Enjoy this Reading Adventure!
