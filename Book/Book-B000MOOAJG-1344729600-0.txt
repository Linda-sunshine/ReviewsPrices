review/summary: The Ayn Rand recycled cult of selfishnessreview/text: Those who read this book need to follow up with "The Ayn Rand Cult" by Jeff Walker. Ayn Rand is a typical reactionary who radically overreacted to Russian Communist oppression. Young Russians who have been influenced by Rand and other "Objectivists" are like Super Capitalists on Steroids. What they fail to learn is the fact that ultra-capitalism (capitalist purism) eventually leads to a Plutocracy where the richest of the rich have the most power. Those who believe in God and come from a Judaeo Christian faith need to seriously consider where Rand is coming from and the cult following that is now being recycled in the 21st century (a modern cult of selfishness) and having a deleterious affect on Democracy and balance in the United States of America. The greatest teacher is one that Rand completely ignores. Nature and nature teaches that balance is the key to sustainability and success over the long run.
