review/summary: Great Book!review/text: This book was incredibly well written. It captured my attention from the start and held it all the way through the book. This book really allows us catch a glimpse of the horrible realities faced in Nazi prisons and camps and yet how God's goodness and faithfulness was shown through incredible suffering. I was challenged and inspired by the courage and strength of this amazing family.
