review/summary: Best vampire story ever written!review/text: As my title states, this is the best vampire story ever written. It's a pitty that with all the movie remakes that have been made, not one was a good retelling of Bram Stoker's classic tale. There have been horrible films, decent films, but not one really good film that brings the story to life or is as terrifying as the novel. Whether you're a fan of vampire lore or just want a good horror story, then this is the novel for you. Unlike so many of the movie remakes, Dracula in this novel is not romantic, he is pure evil with only one thing on his mind: human blood! And that's what makes it good. He is characterized as a monster no better than the devil himself. Oh, and did I mention this is also more terrifying than any of the movie remakes!The Plot:English solicitor Jonathan Harker tavels to Transylvania to meet the mysterious Count Dracula who is interested in buying a house (more like castle) near London. But when Jonathan meets the Count, it isn't long before he becomes a prisoner, trapped inside a house of horrors. And it isn't long before the Count threatens the people closest to him. When Dracula arrives in England and begins preying on the local residents (Joanthan's fiance included), it's up to one Professor Van Helsing to destroy this evil with the help of some friends and Jonathan Harker who later manages to escape from Castle Dracula and the bloodlust of Dracula's brides.An exciting and terrifying tale, and the best way to enjoy Bram Stoker's timeless classic! Highly recommended!
