review/summary: Can't believe I didn't read this beforereview/text: I could have sworn this was something a lot of people read for school, but somehow I made it 26 without ever picking it up. My mistake. This summer I was visiting a friend in Poland and took a day trip to Auschwitz and downloaded it on my Kindle immediately. It is a phenomenal and emotional read.
