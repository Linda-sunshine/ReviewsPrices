review/summary: A Christmas Classic - Kindle version formatting isues...review/text: I would recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed this story in one of its many film or television adaptations.Just one gripe about the Kindle version. It has some formatting issues. The page numbers from the print version appear at random places throughout the text of the Kindle version. The captions from the original illustrations appear, but the images themselves are not shown.The chapter headings are a bit misaligned, etc.But you get what you pay for, and I don&#8216;t intend to complain about a free version of this great story!
