review/summary: A MUST READ for every woman!!review/text: This book should have been written 40 years ago. It could have saved my marriage and saved me a great deal of heartache and messed up relationships. It explains so much about the games some men play...and how to counteract them. For example, many men want to do the pursuing and resent being pursued, they want the challenge, they don't want to be mothered or smothered. That's all common sense when you think of it, but the way she presents her arguments made me feel empowered. The book is like an advanced course in how to take care of yourself in a relationship. She points out that men reflect what we think of ourselves. That is so true. I hate the title; why couldn't she call it &#34;Why Men Love STRONG WOMEN.&#34; But perhaps this title gets more attention. Get it for all the women in your life.
