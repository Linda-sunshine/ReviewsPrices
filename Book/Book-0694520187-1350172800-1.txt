review/summary: Moby Dick reviewreview/text: My order for Moby Dick, Second Edition, Norton Critical Editions, arrived in a timely fashion. It was a new copy, without flaws. I am enjoying reading this greatest of American novels as part of coursework for a literature class at the Osher Institure of Lifelong Learning, a branch of the U. of Delaware, here in Wilmington, DE. Based on this experience, and others, I would continue ordering books from Amazon.com as the need arises.Donald H. Morgan, M.D.
