review/summary: Very intriguingreview/text: I first read this book in 3rd grade. But now in 4th I'm still mystified by the magic of this book. J.R.R Tolkien has a way of combining words imagination and real life in a science-fiction novel. But all in all it is the best book I ever read. For those planning to read lord of the rings I highly advise you to read this book. Not only does it help you understand but it also gives you an easier read to prepare yourself for the intriguing and confusing words in lord of the rings. Now after reading it again I would still read this book out if curiosity and would buy bilbo's last song. Very exiting book for read aloud for teachers
