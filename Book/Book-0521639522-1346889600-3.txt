review/summary: Witty, fun & quick readreview/text: The Importance of Being Earnest is a great play. It takes just a few minutes to catch on to the witty undertone of the writing as well as get pulled in to the fun family drama. I read this on my kindle while waiting for my car to be fixed at the shop and I was so glad this was my choice! I appreciated the details and subtle humor throughout. This read won't change your life but it sure will make you smile! You won't be disappointed, for sure.
