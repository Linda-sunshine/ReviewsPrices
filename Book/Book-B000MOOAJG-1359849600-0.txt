review/summary: Missing Somethingreview/text: I'm dyslexic and can have a hard time following some authors who tend to skip around a lot. I had a vague idea of what this book was about from a seminar I attended years ago and thought I would give it a read. Ouch! This thing is very cerebral and if one did not know what the theme was -hey I skipped the beginning part of how Ayn wrote the book because I did not care, I just wanted to read the book.I lumbered through some of it last night and thought this is the poorest written book I've come across in years. Was wondering if Amazon would give me my money back its so bad. Now I realize what my real problem is. I went to the book on there kindle page and it opened up and I know my problem: My book starts with Part II. There is no Part I that starts the story, explains the characters. That would have been a good thing.I will contact Amazon. Maybe something happened during the download and we can redo this or they credit my account. Not sure if I want to read this now, its very choppy. Starting at part II makes it even chopier. This is the first time I had an issue with a download.
