review/summary: A True Masterpiecereview/text: As with many great works, I can read this book at many different times in my life and uncover new layers of meaning. F. Scott Fitzgerald creates a world that is almost like an optical illusion. With one twist of the wrist, something can appear as the exact opposite of what it previously seemed. The characters are presented in such a way as to create sympathy for them which ultimately leads the reader to excuse their reckless deeds.There is no character that doesn't have something to like about them, however superficial those attributes they may be. However, if one looks beyond the superficial allure, instead of being dazzled by that which shines on the surface, one can see the more important deficits of character and human decency.The character Daisy, with the constant references to her sonorous voice, alluring visage and pleasant demeanor, is painted as the perfect portrait of a modern day siren. She was indeed a "beautiful fool" who can get people to like her by acting in ways that pander to their sensibilities and expectations. It is because of her charms and her apparent helplessness that most readers will, in some way, excuse or minimize her cold-blooded actions. The fact that F. Scott Fitzgerald has the reader rooting for characters that are so obviously self-centered true testament to his skill as a writer.The writing is enjoyable to read. The character descriptions are memorable and the action of the novel is well-paced. I read this book in one afternoon.
