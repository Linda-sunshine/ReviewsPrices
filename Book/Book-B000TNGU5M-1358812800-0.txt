review/summary: Understanding History is Keyreview/text: I read this years ago, but needed to rebuy for my son's Literature class. I highly recommend this book - I believe if we do not learn from history, we are destined to repeat it. I believe humanism is re-defining morality in America, just as it did in Germany. I believe we must comprehend how political correctness is robbing us of our freedom of speech. This book shows the end result.Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (1929 - 1968) said:&#34;We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was 'legal' and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was 'illegal'.&#34;There comes a time, when silence becomes betrayal. &#34;The day we see truth and cease to speak is the day we begin to die.&#34;
