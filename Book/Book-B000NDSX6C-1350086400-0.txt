review/summary: The Hobbitt - a Tolkien classicreview/text: If anyone is going to read the J R R tolkien's The Lord of the Rings series (actually one longstory split into 3 books), I truly believe reading the Hobbitt first gets one familiar with thelay of the land. I enjoyed The Hobbitt very, very much even though I had read the Lord of theRings a few years ago. I still enjoyed The Hobbit BUT wished I had read it first. A must readfor Tolkien fans.
