review/summary: Keeping Faith by Jodi Picoultreview/text: Story was captivating. Story of a mother's fight for her child. A little unrealistic that a father who made no attempt to take child during divorce decides less than a month later to sue for custody without ramifications from new wife. Question never answered about whether it was an imaginary friend or God seemed to be a combination of a cry for attention and a real miracle. but a well written story.
