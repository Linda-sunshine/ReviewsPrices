review/summary: A wonderful reread after many yearsreview/text: I really would like to give 4.75 stars. I had forgotton the cruelty of Heathcliff. My only complaint is that there was too much time spent on the frivolous thoughts of Cathy's daughter. A very engrossing read. There is so much more to this story than is depicted in the movie and I highly recommend it. A true classic. I wish Emily Bronte had written more books.
