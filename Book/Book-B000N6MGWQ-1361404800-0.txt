review/summary: I really love this bookreview/text: My boyfriend got me this book as a gift and he couldn't have picked a better one. Having lost a loved one recently I'm grieving but this book has made it a little less painful. Eddie like all of us has been hurt by the people we love, strangers, and ourselves but his journey after life gave him the peace he needed. I hope that I don't have to wait till I pass to find my peace and with this book I feel more confident I won't have to wait that long. Thank you Mr.Albom for your work and how it has touched my life.
