review/summary: A Work of Artreview/text: I am an avid reader and this book was 'jokingly' suggested to me that I read. The person that suggested it did state that it was good but it is about 1100 pages.This book was excellent. It is one of those stories that as one ages and matures and lives, the book will mean something a little different every time one reads it.The book is one of those books that make you want to go, "Hmmm". The story is about man's struggle to see what he is doing, what he has done, and what needs to be done, before it is too late.
