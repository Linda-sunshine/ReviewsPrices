review/summary: Man's Search for Meaningreview/text: This is an amazing, insightful book that should be read by everyone. I was inspired and motivated by it as it is written by someone who has witnessed suffering and gained enormous insight from it.There is no self pity but the soul of this wonderful man is laid bare. I only wish I could have met him but at least he has left a wonderful legacy in this and his other books. I am recomending it to anyone who wants to know how to really live. Logotherapy is something I am now exploring for my own benefit and in my work.
