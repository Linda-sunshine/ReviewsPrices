review/summary: Huckleberry Finnreview/text: I agree with previous comments that this novel is both amazing and controversial. But, I dare say we have to give Twain credit for the time period he was writing in and just what things were like back then. Essentially, he was making a political statement by writing this book. Whether we agree with him or not, we have to agree this novel is a piece of art. The way he uses literary style such as dialect and tone is just amazing. He also gives us a far deeper understanding and grasp of African American culture at this time, furthermore allowing us to appreciate what they endured. Twain brilliantly wrote about a boy who saw the world through non-racial eyes, he was not partial to whites or blacks, he associated with everyone. This concept is one I believe everyone should value because it is still something our society struggles with today. Twain had a grasp on what it means to love your neighbor, no matter what color they are. This book is amazing and brilliantly written, full of values that should be passed on for a long time. Although Twain is long gone, his essence and understanding of how the world should be is still very much alive.
