review/summary: Great Book and Movie too!review/text: I have known a lot of tough guys; and I never thought that Tom Cruise could pull it off playing Jack Reacher but in the movie; he does a creditable job at it! Just have to see the movie and his acting is top notch and he is tough in his scenes. Follows sort of close to the book and it nice to watch the plot when you know already read it! Very enjoyable!
