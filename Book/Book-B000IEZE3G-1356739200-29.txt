review/summary: Always a joyreview/text: I have read this book about four times now and it is still a joy to read and i would recommend it to anyone who has a wild imagination and a strong heart. I love experiencing the adventures with harrry ron and hermione and think its a wonderful book for all ages no matter how old. I will always remember these books and the amazing characters and lessons that are taught throughout this series. A touching read of true friendship.
