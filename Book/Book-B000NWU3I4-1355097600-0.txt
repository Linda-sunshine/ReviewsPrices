review/summary: Review of The Hobbitreview/text: I read this book a long time ago - 1974-ish - and thought it an interesting fictional tale of a land of orcs, dwarves, elves, hobbits, wizards and humans. It certainly whet my appetite for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I re-read this book (I could not find my original copy) and again enjoyed the tale. It refreshed the story in my mind as I look forward to seeing the movie by Peter Jackson, due to be released in a few days. This whole story is the pre-courser to the Lord of the Rings, and help that trilogy make more sense as you now know what adventures lead up to that follow-on masterpiece. J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a very entertaining tale about a Hobbit (half-sized human, of sorts), who steps out of the usual mold of Hobbit behaviour to join a band of 13 dwarves who are off to recover their stolen treasure from a dragon. The story is light reading, and very enjoyable!
