review/summary: A classicreview/text: Dracula is a classic. This book is one of the first serious and notable pieces of literature I read in high school, and it's been one of my favorites for years. I've read it many times since high school, and this time around it just seemed funny reading it on a Kindle instead of holding an actual book in my hands. Dracula is a timeless, masterpiece of horror, though, whether read on a white screen or from an old paperback.
