review/summary: GREAT CLASSICSreview/text: As a Man Thinketh is one of my all time favorites in literature. I often wondered if he had angelic visitations or something because he understood the mysteries of heaven pretty well. I find this a treasure of wisdom and knowledge I intent to use in my life and hopefully pass on to my kids.
