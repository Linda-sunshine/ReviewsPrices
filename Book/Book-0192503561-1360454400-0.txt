review/summary: Informative & Romanticreview/text: I love Jane Austen and all her books!This is a classic novel that I believe everyone should read. It doesn't get dry like Pride and Prejudice.This novel contains irony, dramatic irony, and comic relief with the funny things that the chacters' say or think.I don't want to summerize the book, because I believe that everyone should discover the magic of this novel for themselves.I will say this: I thought the ending was needing something more desired and solid. That is in my taste, though.Overall, I clearly enjoyed the novel. It taught me many things about England at the time, besides having a romantic story in it.
