review/summary: Cover choicereview/text: The book's content and plot are great. This won't be a book review, just a product review.The book was in perfect condition. Margins are very small though, so not much room to make notes (true of her other novels, too).My only issue dropping from 5 stars is that I received the 50th Anniversary Edition (without knowing this in the order), which has a picture of the Atlas statue on the cover. I would have preferred the classic cover to match my Fountainhead book.
