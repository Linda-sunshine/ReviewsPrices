review/summary: This is THE beginning...review/text: Though I did not read rest of the "lord of the rings" series, I am aware of the fact that every book had been turned into a movie and this one so, very recently. I was considering that I should read this series of books, since it is one of those classic "good versus evil" things that are never boring, and always tons of fun to read. Since it came out as a movie as well, I decided that I cannot hold it up longer, and started the series.The hobbit, for some of you who don't know, came first in 1937, before the wars, and it became the fourth best-selling novel ever. After it showing a lot of success, Tolkien decided to write series of book afterwards, which eventually became the infamous lord of the rings trilogy. The book (now a major motion picture) itself focuses on adventure and travel, giving you wonder and satisfaction as you read through them.The story goes on like this: there is this hobbit who goes by the name of Bilbo Baggins, who like any other hobbits, like their comfortable homes and teatime at 4 `o clock, keeps things tidy and scheduled, and never goes out on adventures. Well, never till now since Mr. Baggins was the first one to ever be out on a grand- scale adventure and return with a lot of success. He goes out on a great and a dangerous quest with 13 other dwarves and a magician to reclaim the great city of dale from Smaug, the dragon. In the end he manages to lead the dwarves safely to the destination, finish the quest in the end, and returns home, living happily ever after.There are classic adventure funs to be read from the story, about trusts and friendships, magic and discovery, and all sort of that great stuff, so read this book to begin the whole lord of the rings trilogy.
