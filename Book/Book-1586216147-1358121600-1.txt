review/summary: I'm hooked!review/text: I would say it's never to late to enjoy a good book! I love a book that just flows, and is not so overwelming with characters that I can't keep up. This is simple, touching, and full of powerful emotions. I'm happy I'm reading it before watching the movie, although I'm sure I will enjoy the movie too.
