review/summary: Still stunning after all these yearsreview/text: A classic is a classic is a classic. There's no disputing why people still read this great American novel, and I was moved this time around more than ever. I originally read this work in college, and only mildly "got it". Actually, I wondered what the fuss was all about, but maturity brings wisdom and reading this now, in middle age, makes all the difference. Actually, in today's terms, Gatsby is the 1 per cent. (Need I say, this read couldn't be more apt due to one of the presidential candidates?) The prototype could not be better. Both Gatsby and his wife, Daisy are so shallow, not minding the eventual fate that meets them. Of course, Nick Carraway is a great witness to that demise. Written in the 1920's, it proves classics remain this way for a reason: good story matters. Good characters matter. Only so many books today meet the test.
