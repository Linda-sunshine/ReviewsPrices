review/summary: Don't we all know someone like Ignatiusreview/text: During high school there were always people who had their own special version of looking at the world. That Ignatius is 30 doesn't really matter. He is one of those guys who try but fail, who think the whole world is against them and that they are the chosen one to end it. Yet they always get into the wrong situations.This book is great! Hilarious situations and great descriptive writing. Too bad he only wrote two books...
