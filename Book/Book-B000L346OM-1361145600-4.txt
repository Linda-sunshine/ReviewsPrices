review/summary: Great book!!!!!review/text: Great book!!!!! Well worth the read! Fast read! I love his writing and his perspective helped to validate my thoughts. Anyone experiencing loss, that has hit a roadblock in life or struggles with depression, must read this book. We have lost a brilliant man but his ideas and experience live on through his writing. Plan on giving this as a gift to many! A must read for everyone in my opinion!
