review/summary: Jane Eyrereview/text: Many of us read Jane Eyre in school, and perhaps found the dialects, moody setting, and pace a challenge. What a refreshing experience to re-read the book as an adult, with a lifetime of experiences to add to our understanding.The wispersync function allowed me to continue on with the narrative on long commutes when I couldn't continue reading, and the quality of the audio is wonderful. I encourage anyone who has dismissed Jane Eyre as a book relegated to their past to investigate it for insights into feminism, patriarchy, class, suffering, and forgiveness. I think they will find the human heart has not changed.
