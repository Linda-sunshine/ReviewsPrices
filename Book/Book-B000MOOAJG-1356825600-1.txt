review/summary: One of the Best Books ever writtenreview/text: I was an English Lit major in College. This book was my favorite for a number of reasons. This book will make you get to know yourself better no matter what the outcome is. This book will make you face important and life changing scenarios. The only other book that has affected me in such a way is Anna Karenina by Tolstoy. Enjoy
