review/summary: Superb reading for boysreview/text: A great story line is completed by well developed characters, a fast moving plot, pirates, moral ambiguities that must be resolved, and the interfacing of a boy with adult personalities. Seafaring terms, 18th century words, and pirate speak should not deter a young reader from a wonderful adventure.
