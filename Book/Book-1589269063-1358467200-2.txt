review/summary: So wonderfulreview/text: This book was so helpful in understanding myself and my spouse. I see the reasons for our difficulties. I look forward to my husband reading it so that he can learn as well. I have recommended this book to so many, even before I finished it. I knew that the insight I was receiving was great and wanted to share with others what I had learned and hope that their relationships would be better as well. Thank you Dr. Chapman.
