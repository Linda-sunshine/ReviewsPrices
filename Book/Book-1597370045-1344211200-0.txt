review/summary: One of my favoritesreview/text: It's free. It's brilliant. It is the catalyst that made me realize that art is useless and necessary and, as an artist, I am (ignore being useless) necessary. Jewel Kilcher wrote a poem about cynicism and how the brilliant find beauty in beautiful things. This book is her proof and I recommend all artists to read this, and understand what genius looks like.
