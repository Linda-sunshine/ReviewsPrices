review/summary: A great classicreview/text: Pride and Prejudice, I can now say, is a classic for a reason. Though hard to understand at times for the old style of writing, it is a very entertaining story that I believe is worth the effort. (I must admit that I was able to follow along better because I have seen the movie, which can act as a guide.)
