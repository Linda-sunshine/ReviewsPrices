review/summary: A great book.review/text: This book has many faults. It is verbose. There are indeed several long speeches made by characters that do interrupt the narrative. Additionally, I found it somewhat fantastic that every male protagonist fell hopelessly in love with the female protagonist based solely on her character and principals. However, and I've never said this about a book before, I personally found the faults were charming.It's also the most terrifying book I've read in 2012. There are eerie parallels. President Obama's "you didn't build that" remarks almost echo a speech made by one of the antagonists, making it wonderfully amusing for me to read the reviews about how "unbelievably evil and stupid" her "villains" are. The book is full of politicians using sweeping regulations to bypass congress, much like the FTC, EPA, and other non-elected governmental bodies do. The book does hold a mirror up to the American political process, though I will admit it is a somewhat warped mirror.What is saddening is that so many people read this book and reject her philosophy as wrong. I urge you, even if you disagree with her philosophy, please do not simply dismiss this book, because, I assure you, this is how many people today see the political machinations at work. And if you do not see it as truth than ask why so many do. For what good is literature if not to help us experience the world from another vantage point?
