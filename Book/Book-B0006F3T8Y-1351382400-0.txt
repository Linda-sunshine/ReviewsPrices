review/summary: Little Womenreview/text: Very pleased with the book. I was a little surprised to see how small the actual copy was as the copy I had years ago was very thick and bulky. When I got my replacement copy, I was a bit worried the full story would be missing and very surprised and pleased to find it was the full story in a smaller, easier to hold book. I would like to find the copies of Little Men and Jo's Boys in the same format if possible.
