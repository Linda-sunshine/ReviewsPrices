review/summary: You Get What You Pay Forreview/text: You already know that this is one of the greatest works of literature, and a must-have for any library. Sadly, this edition lacks John Tenniel's artwork, and it's surprising what a negative impact that makes on the story. Also, for no apparent reason, the prefaces (including the prefatory poem) are not included.Why does this edition exist? Why not just charge us the one dollar up front and save us the disappointment?
