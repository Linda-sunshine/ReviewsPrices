review/summary: GREAT READreview/text: This was my very first Jack Reacher ( Lee Child ) novel and it was a great find. No way the movie will be better ( or as good as ) the book but that's the way it goes. Reacher is a fascinating character and one that probably defines &#34;acting well&#34; in these moder times. You can't find him---he finds you. I can definitely recommend this book to you.
