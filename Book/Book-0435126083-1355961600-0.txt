review/summary: Not bad, but certainly not interestingreview/text: To make my review concise:This book is about a dysfunctional family and dysfunctional relationships between people - or more accurately, about relationships that revolve around a twisted man. It doesn't do much beyond flesh out those relationships over a span of many years.I suppose this book is interesting. It is well written and definitely has characters (although for the life of me, for some reason, keeping their names and identities straight in my mind was a tiring task that I never really fully accomplished, maybe it's just me). I went into this book hoping for more plot, more story of people's lives, with the dysfunctional family elements pervasive if not along the sidelines. That's just not what it is. It's a potential tenant learning about how twisted a family is from the reminiscent eyes of a previous inhabitant. And that is really all the book is.My review here is obviously not paying attention to the book's classic status. Or the fact that it's free and creative commons, written by a woman during a timeframe where as far as I understand, that wasn't common, lest of all to go on to be considered a classic. Or the fact that the story-inside-a-story concept was novel at the time.
