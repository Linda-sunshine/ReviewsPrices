review/summary: Can't go wrong with a classic storyreview/text: I was so glad to have finally read the actual words behind all of the film versions of this story. Since I was a child, I've been intrigued by every film adaptation of 'A Christmas Carol' and wondered how much of each was true to the original text. I enjoyed reading it much more than any interpretation I've seen, and will make it a tradition to read it every Christmas from now on.
