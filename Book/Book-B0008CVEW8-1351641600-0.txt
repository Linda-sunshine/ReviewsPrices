review/summary: Treasure Islandreview/text: I have seen the movie version numerous times since I was a Child of 8 years old I am now 69 years old and I enjoyed reading it for the First time. Walt Disney studios did a fab job on the picture but it can not hold a candle to the Original book. Robert Louis Stevenson was a sublime author and I love his stories. I could visualize the scenery and settings as I read it is wonderful.
