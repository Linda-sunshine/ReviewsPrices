review/summary: Rating the outrageous lack of a Kindle editionreview/text: Does Harper Lee have something against those of us with failing eyesight?I have and love my hardback of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. But now I really need a larger font size. That's why I got my Kindle. I read on the third-largest font size, and sometimes (after a long reading session) on the second-largest. Meaning I'll probably never read the little-font TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD again.Note that there's not even the usual button to click to request a Kindle version. Lee must have her mind made up never to allow a digital version.Shame on her. A great book but evidently a petty-minded author.
