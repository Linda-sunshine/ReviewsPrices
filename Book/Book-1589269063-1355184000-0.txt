review/summary: Love Speaksreview/text: My friend Laura recommended this book and I am so glad she did. Laura and her husband Rob are NLP Master Practioners. They are life coaches who help people find the root causes of their disease or anxiety. [...]After the death of my husband, I was lost and lonely. I was afraid to love again mainly because I didn't feel loved. In the words of Gary Chapman. "I had an empty love tank." With an empty love tank, I couldn't see how others were trying to tell me that they loved me. Gary Chapman's book, allowed me to see how people speak love. Some people show love by doing little things for them. Others by buying gifts; others by words of encouragement and affirmation; others by spending time with them; and still others by touching/hugging etc. This sounds so simple. It is. But not everyone speaks the same language. Learning to speak the language your loved ones speak and knowing what love language you speak is the challenge and the secret to being in love with all those you love. Thank you, Laura for this recommendation. And thank you Gary for writing this book.
