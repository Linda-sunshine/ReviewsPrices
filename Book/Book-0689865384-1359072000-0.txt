review/summary: I'm still not sure how I feel about this book...review/text: I still can't decide how I feel about Uglies. I finished it a day or two ago, but I find that when I think about it, a riot of emotion just overwhelms me. I'm a big ball of worry, sadness, disgust, curiosity, hopefulness, admiration, and a couple of other feelings. (Notice how I didn't include happy on my list. There's a reason for that and I'll talk about it in a bit.)Uglies is another spectacular dystopian novel, and reading it has increased my love for this particular genre. Scott Westerfeld created a world that was both realistic and surreal all at once, simply using a concept that modern day society makes a big deal out of - beauty. It literally took my breath away how he managed to wrangle this concept into something so seemingly definable, and how he used it to delineate between what kind of people the characters were. His writing is masterful and, best of all, I loved that it made me reflect and think about things I never would have thought about.Final verdict: This book is another brilliant dystopian novel, and personally, it definitely lived up to its hype. It also made me think a lot about beauty and society's pressure for a certain kind of beauty to prevail amongst all others - and that definitely made my mind whirl. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series, Pretties.
