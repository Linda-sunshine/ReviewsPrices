review/summary: AWESOME STORY!!!review/text: I loved this book so much that I read it straight through! And then I read the rest of them in succession. Austin is a great author, bringing the Biblical characters alive in a way I'd never imagined. This book series will expand your understanding of this Old Testament story of Hezekiah, and it is fascinating!
