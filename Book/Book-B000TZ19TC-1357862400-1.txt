review/summary: A Classicreview/text: So I seem to be on a dystopian kick when it comes to some of my recent selections. I have heard of this before and was some how part of a small group who didn't have to read this in high school or College. So I decided to give this classic a try.I loved the premise of this book, the idea that "Firemen" were causing fires instead of putting them out. And then the idea that the government is eliminating all books. It would mean a severe downfall in education. This was fun to read and I found the more I got into this book the more freaked out I became. Since I have gotten into reading more lately it was a scary thought of a world without books.I began asking myself questions, "What would I do if I couldn't read?, Would I be courageous enough to stand up to a government who would take away this great art, or would I hide my personal collection?" Well, over all I really enjoyed it and was glad I finally read it.
