review/summary: Shifting the focus to yourselfreview/text: I highly recommend this book because it encourages us women to focus more on ourselves and our needs. I do not intend to use it as a guide to win any man over. In fact, after my divorce, I have been practicing a lot of the principles in this book, and that is why I am still single. I would rather be happily single than stuck with a man who is not enthusiastic about me. I chose to get out of those relationships even though I could bend over backwards if I want to keep the men.I do want to point out that it might be difficult to fake bitchery. If a woman is not financially independent and does not have her life together, she will not be able to implement the principles in this book.
