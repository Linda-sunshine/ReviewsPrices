review/summary: Readinggirl Never Sent The Bookreview/text: I bought this book from another seller after Readinggirl never sent my book. It was a gift for my daughter's boyfriend after my dog chewed up his other one. I wanted to replace it with the same year/same cover. This seller never even responded to the three attempts to contact her. She tied up my money for a month. Buyer beware!
