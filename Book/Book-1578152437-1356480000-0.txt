review/summary: Dickens is still so current!review/text: I missed out on reading a lot of classics when I was at the right age. Something about my grade school not having a &#34;Fiction&#34; section. I'm trying to get through the entire Dickens folio this year, and Oliver Twist just moved me through the entire story. There's a perfect blend of social commentary, long-winded descriptions, plot twists and surprises, and Dickens' satirical voice, which is a surprise if you've just read something more straightforward of his. He's still current because many of the attitudes of his time are still present in the way we treat our fellow humans. Must read!
