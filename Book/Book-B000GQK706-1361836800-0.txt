review/summary: Finest book of the genre ever writtenreview/text: It is said by some to be the best novel of the 20th century. I don't know how many would agree, but it was certainly my favorite book for years and years, and is the standard against which I measure all other fantasies. The novel, in three books (but really 6 parts) traces four hobbits, along with various other of the beings of Middle Earth, in their quest to destroy the evil one ring of power that the powerful and evil lord Sauron forged in earliest times, that will give Sauron domination over all living things. The ring had been lost for ages before the book begins. Sauron's power and life are bound up in the ring. As Sauron learns that the lost ring has been found, he tries to discover it, and also launches a war against men, elves, dwarves, and the earth itself. But the themes are age old themes about good and evil, power and humility, love of the earth, and love of others. It follows the good guys as they try to fight against treachery and darkness as they move the ring closer to the fiery cracks of doom in the mountain where it was forged--the only place it can be unmade--deep in the heart of enemy territory. It also follows members of the Fellowship of the Ring as they fight evil in the good territories.This particular version is handy, since it has all three books of the trilogy present. However the only downside is that the table of contents does not list the chapters of the separate books separately. It would be even better if it did that.
