review/summary: Concerning Hobbitsreview/text: First of all, this book is amazing. J.R.R Tolkien was and forever will be one of the greatest authors of all time. The master of detail and one of the leading innovators of fantasy stories, Tolkien has created worlds, languages, and memorable characters that will never be forgotten. This book has some really interesting artwork done by Tolkien himself. A true gem for any LotR or Hobbit fan's collection. Plus it's hardback, which I prefer over paperback any day! A+ Recommend!
