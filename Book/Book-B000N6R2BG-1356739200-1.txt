review/summary: I had to Keep the Faith to finish.review/text: I am a real Piccoult fan, and when this book was on sale I picked it up via my Kindle app. I had a tough time following the story line and it didn't seem as believable as some of her other stories. Jodi Piccoult's printed books usually have different fonts to distinguish which character is speaking. That did not translate thru the Kindle app, and it made it difficult to follow.I have read almost every book by Jodi and this is the first one that didn't wow me.
