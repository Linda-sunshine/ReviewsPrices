review/summary: GREAT BOOK!review/text: This book is a timeless, classic. I purchased it for a friend's roomie, whom no one cares for much, because she is extremely snide and condescending mixed with almost, completely socially inept. I've read this book a long time ago and thought it made some good points regarding dealing with people. I read a couple pages when I received it again recently and thought perhaps I should invest in myself with this book, rather than someone else, and make some positive changes for myself rather than insult or harp on someone else s bad qualities. Just read the first 2 chapters again and can already see that applying these minor principles to my current relationship is helpful in major ways!:)
