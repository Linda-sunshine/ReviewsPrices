review/summary: A must read!review/text: I have overlooked this book for my whole life, thinking that the various movies had completely covered the book. I was wrong! Reading the original in Dickens' own prose was more than worth the time invested. Read and enjoy; and keep Christmas in your heart throughout the year as well!
