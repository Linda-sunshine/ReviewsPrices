review/summary: One of my favorite animal series and booksreview/text: I'm not usually an animal book fan, but holy crap, this was amazing. It is worth every penny--even though it doesn't cost anything, which is amazing--and the rest of the series is just as great. Get it now--you will NEVER regret you did.
