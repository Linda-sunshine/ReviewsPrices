review/summary: Hardcover Green Leather Collector's Editionreview/text: Alright, so the Hobbit is a great book. If you haven't read it go read it now! No need to review the literary works here. The Collector's edition is the way to read the story in my opinion. The 50th Anniversary is very similar as I can tell, but I prefer the green to the gold in addition to the green marbled page edges. The usual 5 of Tolkien's original watercolor artwork are resorted to their full color version and all the black and white pictures of the original version are now printed in black and green. Likewise, the maps are in black and green and in the front and back of the book.I was tempted to get the annotated version, which looks intriguing for long-time fans, but as I no longer had an original copy this felt like the right choice for now. I may buy the Annotated Hobbit down the road, although for now this one is perfect.
