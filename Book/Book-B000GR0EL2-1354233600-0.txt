review/summary: Inspiring beyond words. Excitement, tenderness, it has it all.review/text: The fascinating true story of a Dutch family that hid Jews during the Holocaust/German occupation of Holland.As soon as I read the last page I quickly ordered several copies for Christmas presents. I've always loved stories of Holocaust survivors...but this one was extra special because of the extreme faith that enabled the protagonists to endure - making it not only a story of unspeakable brutality and torture but a powerful love story of the intimacy between these two women and God, and what that faith enabled them to accomplish; it was incredible! There was nothing sappy or churchy about this story..very well written, absorbing, touching, and so very inspiring. Before I take it back to the library I'm going to copy many of the things Corrie's sister Betsy says during their imprisonment at the camp...there are certain things you never want to forget!One of those books that changes you...I highly recommend. One of my favorites, along with Elie Weisel's "Night".
