review/summary: Great lessonsreview/text: This book had some very interesting ideas, whether good or bad, on genetics and the productivity of a society. I expected the story to go another way (not sure what exactly what it was I expected though) and am still unsure of the meaning behind the ending. That the way their society operates was superior in the end? Are we supposed to draw our own conclusion?One of the things I love about Huxley is he has this uncanny ability to see where we are headed before we get there. A lot of the topics in this book aren't far from where we are now and maybe we should take these kinds of works as a lesson on humanity.I think this is a must read for everyone simply because of the lessons available with it.
