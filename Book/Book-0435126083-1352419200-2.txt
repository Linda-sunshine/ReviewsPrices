review/summary: Wuthering Heightsreview/text: Having never read this very old novel that is often required reading in school, I took the plunge and almost drowned in it before its completion. I found it to be depressing with its tale of abuse and relationship problems coupled with old English wording. Nevertheless, I had to know the ending so persevered to the end. Now ready for something lighter and enjoyable.
