review/summary: Christians Beware.review/text: Harry Potter is an exciting book, full of twist and turns. But if you're a Christian reading this I advise you to not go further. It discourages witchcraft in the Bible. For those who are not Christians please look into it. I'm not forcing this upon you but just look in the Bible, especially Matthew. If you have an I-phone you can get it. If you have a computer look it up. Please.
