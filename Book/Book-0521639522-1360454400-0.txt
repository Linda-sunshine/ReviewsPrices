review/summary: It was free.review/text: I'm not well versed on the classicals. This was a chance to read something light by Oscar Wilde. As a view into an attitude of frivolity of the very rich of that time, it was enlightening. I guess it made a bigger impression than I thought because I am reminded of scenes in the book by things I see in real life quite often.
