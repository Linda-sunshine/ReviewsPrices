review/summary: Great :)review/text: I was a little sad to find there were no illustrations in this book. When I was READING it, it never occurred to me, but when I downloaded "Through the Looking Glass" and found there were pics in it, it was a bit annoying.However, that being said, this is just gorgeous children's literature. I can't believe I waited so long to read it! I should have read this book as a little girl, when the magic would have been so much more real. I love the almost stream-of-consciousness feel to the words, and of course the extremely imaginative scenes. I think every child should have a copy of this book and the next Alice adventure!
