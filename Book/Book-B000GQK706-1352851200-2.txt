review/summary: Good, but pedantic in placesreview/text: 1200 pages of hobbits walking around. I'm a long time reader of fantasy/sci fi and such, and finally got around to reading this. Honestly I liked the movies better, over all. The book did help fill in some holes, as the movie had to jump around so much, I honestly wasn't sure who all the groups were and what was going on sometimes. Now that I read the story I need to watch the films again.
