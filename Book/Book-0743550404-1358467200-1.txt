review/summary: Interesting Story - Not Havenreview/text: If you are looking for the definitive HAVEN story, this is not it. Some of the characters in this short story are the same and that is all they have in common (period) This is an interesting SHORT Stephen King story BUT not worth the money being asked for it. If you can find it in the LIBRARY then it is worth the trip, otherwise borrow it from a friend. I would say $0.99 is a fair price, but the kindle price is way to much and the used prices are out of sight. If you are a King collector, fine, otherwise, wait and find it in a used bookstore or, like I said, borrow it. The story id about a 3 star and that is what I rated it.
