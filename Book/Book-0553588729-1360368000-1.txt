review/summary: Prefer DVD versionreview/text: As many have said, very repetitive, but good information. Someone actually bought us the DVD version of this book and I found that much more helpful. It was more concise and, being a visual person, it helped actually seeing someone do the techniques rather than trying to visualize in my head what it should look like as I'm reading about it.
