review/summary: Classic Readreview/text: I was very glad to find this copy for my Kindle. The format was easy to adjust to my preferences. The story was even better than I remembered. It was good to read the complete story with all Dickens' words. I did look up several words, which is very easy with the definition search ability on Kindle. I look forward to finding many more classics, hope they are all true to the original writings. This would be wonderful for students of all ages to enjoy the beautiful, masterly wording of Dickens.
