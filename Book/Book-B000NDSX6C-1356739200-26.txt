review/summary: Guaranteed classicreview/text: This was not an easy tale to read, and I have to admit that it took a few chapters read before I could truly delve in and appreciate the story. The story was well written, especially having been revised from the original 1937 writing. I am not disappointed; however, I am concerned that the movie version (2012) release will fail to include minute details detrimental to the theme. I highly recommend this book to be read by those seeking an adventure based on a different time period in another world.
