review/summary: An old book that reads like it could be our futurereview/text: Published in 1957, yet so many things sound like now: oil from shale in Colorado; a new lighter, stronger steel (like titanium?), politicians demonizing "the rich"; society demanding that anyone who has achieved more than others should feel guilty; and the government taxing wealth from those who earn it to give it to those who are failing at the same kind of work. A real eye opener, but it is very long.
