review/summary: It's Tolkien!review/text: The book that started it all. Tolkien's gift of imagination is second to none, While it seems that most other writers of this genre appear to be just adding to an already proven central theme J.R.R. Tolkien is an original. The characters, plots and subplots are unique and engaging.
