review/summary: Classicreview/text: Huckleberry Finn is a classic! How could you possibly go wrong? There are a couple of instances throughout the text where I've questioned the narrator's ability to know/not know certain things (such as the exact time in the middle of the night at one point while traveling down the river, to his inability to do the same later in the book), but regardless...it's a classic!!
