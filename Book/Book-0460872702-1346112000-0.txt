review/summary: It's about class and ambition, not true lovereview/text: This is a novel about class and ambition, not true love. Gatsby is that rarest of Americans, a rags-to-riches self-made man. He worked his way up from poverty. But he isn't happy. Why? Because he did it all for Daisy, and yet the web of American society (a supposedly classless place) prevents him from ever having her. Thus he is tragic. Gatsby may be amoral, but why is he so? He was born poor but ambitious and then he became successful and it killed him. The very top is out of reach, even if you get there. It's a fool's game. If Gatsby were set in today's world he might aspire to be a Donald Trump-like character. The tragedy (and farce) of our society, which Fitzgerald realizes, is that Donald Trump was born rich.People who read this novel as a love story are missing the point. Gatsby is not in love, he is infatuated with Daisy because of what she represents. Many people confuse this with love (in literature and in life) but that is a terrible mistake.
