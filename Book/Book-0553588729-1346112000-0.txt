review/summary: Should have been a brochure!review/text: I really wanted to like this book, and some of the advice sounds good. Unfortunately it is waaaaay too long and tedious to read. It really should have been a short brochure. I could not finish it, and forgot most of it immediately.10/13/12 update- the advice in this book really works, I am giving it more stars! I went back and retread pertinent chapters- I realized that reading it like a novel does not work. It's better to reference it as you go along.
