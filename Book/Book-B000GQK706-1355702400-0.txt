review/summary: Great Audio recordingreview/text: I heard this version when I was in middle school. I have tried to find it ever since. I have listened to other versions but they were either dramatized or shortened. The unabridged edition is the only one that is not like that. I enjoy listening to audio books when I am doing other things and this is a perfect recording for me to do that. I do not care if an audio book has looks of voice variations and I certainly do not look full cast audio books. If you like books that are simply read. Nicely and clearly you will probably like it. I would suggest listening to a excerpt of it somewhere if you are picky about how someone reads a book.I am glad to have this version and highly recommend it.
