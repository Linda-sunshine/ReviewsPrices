review/summary: Still beautiful after all these yearsreview/text: Numerous movies have been made of this novel, or based in parts on the novel, and there is a reason why: it is a haunting, coming-of-age story, with a dark mystery and love story embedded within. Jane Eyre, who is shunted around due to her &#34;unladylike&#34; intelligence and strong sense of self, discovers love with her employer-the strange and moody Mr. Rochester. He is hiding a secret though, and it will threaten Jane's chance of happiness. Unlike many &#34;love&#34; stories from past and present however, Jane uses her inner-strength to succeed on her own, and sets the example for future &#34;strong women&#34; stories that have developed since this groundbreaking novel was written.The wordy descriptions and redundancy of some of the writing clearly dates this novel as a &#34;classic&#34; but do not let that scare you from reading. Having read this more than once, I like to skim much of it, including descriptions of her early years at the school Jane is sent to, for standing up for herself at the home she were she grew up. The descriptions DO set the mood for everything, but are still overly-wordy, which was the norm for this period of writing. One exception to this, is the novel &#34;Ivanhoe,&#34; set during the time of Robin Hood and written during the time of Queen Victoria's birth. Otherwise, as with the Bronte's works, you will deal with a lot of seemingly-useless descriptive paragraphs. AGain, it does set the mood though, and the writing itself is beautiful, even if it doesn't always forward the purpose of the story.This story is haunting, much like &#34;Wuthering Heights&#34; but I prefer &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; any day for the sheer strength of the heroine, and the surprisingly moving passion of the star-crossed lovers.
