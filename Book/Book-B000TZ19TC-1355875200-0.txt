review/summary: Ironic & Captivatingreview/text: This book was short, and deep. It was amazingly deep in fact, for the length. Bradbury captures something about our nature both to believe in something passionately, and to ignorantly become sheepish. There is lying, betrayal, and small glimmers of home, in a macabre future. One of my favorites by far.
