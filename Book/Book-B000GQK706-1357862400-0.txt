review/summary: Well worth the wait.review/text: So after years of umming and ahhhing over reading this series I am finally glad to have done so! Having brought it I did not emerge from the book until I was finished and this is what I love in a book. One that truly ensnares the reader in the world and doesn't let go until the end. This is the essence of J.R.R.Tolkeins writing, he is the utmost master of writing that draws the reader in from the first world. I would insert a huge paragraph about how amazing these books are but given the fact that almost everyone knows how great they are it would be pointless.This kindle set is a nice set. Highly Recommend.
