review/summary: The Colorado Kidreview/text: This was a very good book. The tale is awesome, but the only reason I read it was because of the tv show called "Haven." I am anxious to see how all of this turns out to go with the Colorado Kid story. But it is a good read and very interesting thought out process of eliminating each "what if" of a mystery story. Stephen King did good on this one and wasn't scary! For once! lolRead and enjoy this page turning story.
