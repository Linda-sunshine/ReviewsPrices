review/summary: This is nothing against Amazon.com.review/text: Amazon.com is amazing, so I'm not giving it one star because I hate Amazon.com because I don't. But I found Pride and Prejudice extremely boring but maybe that's just me. It was just so hard for me to read I like almost died it's so exasperatingly long and sooooooooooooooooooooo boring!!!!!
