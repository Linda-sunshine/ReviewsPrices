review/summary: Read this when you think you're too happyreview/text: Mr. Vonnegut is one of my favorite authors. He had a different way of viewing life and can make me laugh out loud on a bus while reading his work. Slaughterhouse is trying to reason with the devastation of war. Why this and why that. Dresden was bombed, but why? So much was lost in human accomplishment that could never be replaced. Army grunts are pawns and all you can do is live or die by chance. A good read, but a downer.
