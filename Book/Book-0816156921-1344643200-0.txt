review/summary: Don't rely on the movies: read this bookreview/text: This was a surprisingly good book. I was sure I already knew the story and that reading the book would simply be stirring up old memories, but I was wrong. I don't think I've seen a film or TV version that I'd call "fully faithful" to the book. The religious themes are usually watered down. The story is usually simplified or streamlined, with entire lines cut out or simply implied. The experience was definitely new.This is also slow reading. I'm accustomed to 55-65 pages an hour with most books, whether popular/commercial or literary, but I read this at about half that speed. Unfortunately, this was mostly my lunchtime book, meaning that it took me far too long to take the entire story in at once. It was still worthwhile.
