review/summary: Atlas Shruggedreview/text: i haven't finished this insightful book even though i read every evening. Ayn Rand was an skillful writer with an astute observation of governmental trends and the passivity of the average American. the sexual encounters seem gratuitous and therefore uninteresting but probably necessary to hold the average reader. i'm nearly at 80% an am sorry i didn't read this book sixty years ago!
