review/summary: Realizing the Relevance in The Real World.review/text: This book foretells our future by describing advances in technology. The scary part is how close we are. The sea shell radio can be portrayed as teenagers and their headphones. Mildred and the gals might as well be the stereotypical women who are having a tough relationship week; the ones who watch chick flicks with a tub of ice cream all week end. If you are interested in seeing what people from the seventies though about the future then this book is a good fit. Also, if you are interested in the future and sci-fi this is also a good book because their are some inventions not yet invented that are mentioned. I was required to read this book for my 9th grade year and I probably won't be reading it again because its just not one of those books. Not one of those books with descriptive features you might miss and want to read again for, or characters you can adore, or even events you would be on the edge of your seat to read.
