review/summary: An Excellent Communicatorreview/text: A logical presentation with vivid illustrations! Easy to read and understand. The reader is being guided step by step to comprehend the essences of Christianity. As a lively adaptation of this serious series of radio talks during the second world war when enmity was the core mentality, Lewis has successfully touched the heart of his readers with love and humility. He is particularly keen on giving his readers freedom not to read a certain chapter if they think the topic is irrelevant to them, thus making them even more eager to find out what is irrelevant. He also admits that some of his ideas are just guesses and some of his illustrations are limited, thus making him even more sincere and likable. Both Christians and "Christians-to-be" (as perceived by Lewis) will enjoy reading this concise and cogent case for Christianity.
