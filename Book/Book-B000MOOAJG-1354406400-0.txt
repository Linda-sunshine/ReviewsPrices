review/summary: Its all coming true!!review/text: I have read this book 3 times in the past 20 years now I have it on the Kindle. Ayn Rand predicted the future of America and it's slide into socialism and the predictable sales pitch of the left whose cradle to the grave coddling of the population turns them into defenseless lambs on their way to the slaughter. The class warfare described in this book and the governments persecution of the successful is shockingly accurate and is happening right now. Rand wrote the book originally as warning to American's about what was just starting to happen back in the 50's when the progressive, socialist movement was gearing up here. Unfortunately no one paid attention to the message. It may be too late now to wake up to the grim reality of a socialist, marxist American. Great reading.
