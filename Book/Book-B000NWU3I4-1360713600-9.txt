review/summary: Love it!!review/text: What can I say? I have loved this book for the past 40 years. I grew up with The Hobbit. I had the little kid's book with the vinyl record and then moved on up to the real book and the VHS of the cartoon and then with Jackson's movies and now can't wait for the Hobbit to come out on Blu-Ray (I saw it in the theater 3 times). This is the best book I've ever read (other than the Bible of course). I have it in many forms but this one is on my kindle. Love it!
