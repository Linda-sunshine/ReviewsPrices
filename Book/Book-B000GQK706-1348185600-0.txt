review/summary: One Book to Rule Them Allreview/text: Ever since I first read this book (in the 60's), almost any other fantasy book pales by comparison! I enjoy rereading it every couple of years, and it never gets old. I highly recommend it to everyone -- but if you are a youngster, don't try to read it until you are a bit older -- it can be very daunting, but it will be worth the wait!
