review/summary: Oliver Twistreview/text: I enjoyed the story but didn't realize there was more books available in a serial form. At the end of the first book Nancy had met with Rose on the bridge when the story ended. I had to get another Oliver Twist book that had a few more chapters that ended with Fagen being jailed and due for hanging. I don't know when Amazon will send me more chapters or more books in the series.
