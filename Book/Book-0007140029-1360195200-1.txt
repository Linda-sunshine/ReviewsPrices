review/summary: Grandpa Enjoyed This Bookreview/text: I have two grandsons, 8 & 9, who are immersed in this series. Upon their urging I read this first book. I understand the appeal but be aware that there are about 54 characters, 15 places and numerous "invented" words. It put a severe strain on the 70 year old brain.Erin Hunter is a pen name used in common by multiple authors of this series.
