review/summary: Ideal for Fans and Familiesreview/text: Not only does this excellent work contain a wealth of information about the influences and development of The Hobbit (as so ably described in other reviews), the large format and illustrations make it ideal for reading with your kids snuggled up next to you. Pulling this one off the shelf lets them know that there's something special in store.
