review/summary: My Favorite Book of All Timereview/text: I read Atlas Shrugged for the first time when I was 19. Since then I have read it at least once every two years or so (I am now over 50), and have worn out many copies. My current copy is full of place-markers so I can reread my favorite sections. The writing style is rich with detail, but one of the hardest things I dealt with in the books was the lengthy dialog. Ayn (rhymes with 'nine') Rand's story development is exceptional.
