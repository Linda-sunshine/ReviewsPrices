review/summary: This book offers more than 12" of Paradisereview/text: Fortuna's wheel has spun most decidedly in favor of Mr. Toole's visionary work.With the style and substance of Voltaire, Chaucer, Cervantes and Fitzgerald we are taken on a journey through the Crescent City. Mr. Toole's protagonist, Ignacious Reilly, is nothing short of Don Quixote tilting at wrought iron windmills.Mr. Toole captures early 60's New Orleans to its core. From the architecture of the City and the Quarter; to the residents/tourists/characters that inhabit the city; and most importantly to the novel, the regional dialectic that makes each social group unique.Enjoy the book. It is a most satisfying read.
