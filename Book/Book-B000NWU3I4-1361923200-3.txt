review/summary: Just as I remembered itreview/text: I purchased this edition for my 13 year old son so he could enjoy the same experience I had as a youth reading the wonderfull adventures of Biblo and crew. The book and binding are high quality and the print quality is very good. My son is enjoying the book, but he does complain that it seems a little slow. Not a surprise given the way most modern books are written today. Since he is still reading it, I guess the story is still good enough to hold the attention of today's teenagers, even if it is a little &#34;slow.&#34; I should note he has not seen any of the related movies so he is relying on his own imagination for creating mental images.
