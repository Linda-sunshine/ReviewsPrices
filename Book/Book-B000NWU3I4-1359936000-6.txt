review/summary: Im sure Ill love it like the others in the seriesreview/text: Ive been meaning to buy this a long time ago but the time was right. I had to buy this before I bought the movie. I wanted a standard size paperback to go with my Lord of the Rings books, but am just thrilled with the perfect condition of this book. Tolkien is a genius and I cant wait to get lost in his world again. :)
