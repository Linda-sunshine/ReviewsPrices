review/summary: beautiful old-style bookreview/text: I got this book for my dad and he loved it! The binding is nice and the pictures are scattered throughout the book which will help. I thought it was need they had some Olde English symbols (I think? Though I didn't read the series myself so maybe it's Middle Earth symbols?). Whatever language it is, it adds to the authentic feel the book brings. The type in the pages isn't too small and there seems to be good contrast throughout for easy reading.
