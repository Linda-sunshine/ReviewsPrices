review/summary: An old classic with great illustrationsreview/text: What can one say about Dickens - one of the greatest writers in English of all times. The illustrations make this a real joy for the Christmas. A note: this is not a religious book even though it has ghosts etc. The real theme of the book is the possibilities of the human heart. It is a timeless story and being tied to Christmas simply ties it to a European Tribal Ritual.
