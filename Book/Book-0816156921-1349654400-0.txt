review/summary: A classic readreview/text: A phenomenal (and classic) story that Stoker weaves together mainly fromdiary-entries story-telling. But despite the creative brilliance, the bookis also quite slow and even repetitive i the middle parts.The interaction between the characters is also over-dramatizedand over-emotional in many places.But despite these shortcomings, the read is highly captivating.
