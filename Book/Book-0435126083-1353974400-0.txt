review/summary: Recommendation on Wuthering Heightsreview/text: This is one of the classics that I have downloaded onto my Kindle from Amazon. I like that it didn't have a cost and loved the story. It is good literature and I would recommend it to others, especially writers who could gain some tips on telling a good story.
