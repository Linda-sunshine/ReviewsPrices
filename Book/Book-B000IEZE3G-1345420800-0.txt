review/summary: Perfect translation from book to movie!review/text: Wow! What an enjoyable / fun read. Ill admit, I was one of 'those people' who watched the movies first. But now that I just started to read the book for research (seeing how books translate to film), this book is nearly word for word from book to movie unlike Lord of the Rings which I started reading also.Way to go JK Rowling! What a vivid imagination you have!
