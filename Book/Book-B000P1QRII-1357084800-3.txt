review/summary: wish i never read itreview/text: i dont think I've ever read a book this bad. it is very disturbing. i mean, who thinks of killing babies as a normal thing in any situation ?! not to be a prude but the whole bathing thing is just gross . it's also the worst ending I've ever read. this book is sooooo boring! i had to read it for school and i almost fell asleep reading it and i never do that. don't read this book. don't look at it. don't think about it. you would seriously regret it. i would give it negative stars if i could.XOXO HR Cali
