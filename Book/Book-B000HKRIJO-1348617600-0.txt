review/summary: great book.review/text: this book is truly inspired.he speaks with such authority that could only come from the presence of God.this book was not based much on intellectual research but divine insight and experiential knowledge.i recommend this book to anyone who seeks more than just religion.this is true human philosophy; not the varied theories and opinions we have of humanity but the truth about humanity.
