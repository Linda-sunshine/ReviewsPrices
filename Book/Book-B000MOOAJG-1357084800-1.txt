review/summary: Must read for every hard-working personreview/text: ... And for anyone who likes to understand how the worl works. A wonderful inquiry into the logic of capitalism.I think I was very very late in reading this book. Anyone around 20 should already get their hands on it.The missing 5 th star is for the lack of literary brilliance although it is still a good read.
