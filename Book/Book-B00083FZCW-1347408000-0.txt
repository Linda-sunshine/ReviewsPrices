review/summary: One that is hard to put downreview/text: I really enjoyed this book and have purchased four books of the series and currently reading the second book. I was able to read this book in three sittings. It is a very easy ready and well written. I do believe this may have been geared toward teenagers and young adults (I am 45), but I am still enjoying it. I was glad I had the second book on hand when I finished the first one.I love James Patterson and the way he writes books. You really are engulfed in the story as it goes. I could picture the characters as I went along.It would be interesting if they ever made this series into a movie or mini-series. I would be sure to watch it.
