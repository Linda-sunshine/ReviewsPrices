review/summary: I can't beleive I read the whole thingreview/text: I got to hand to the author on how she was able to come up with new words to say the same thing over and over and over and over and over, again. Two thirds of the words could be easily eliminated without missing a beat. I've seen this book described as a mystery but I see none. It was pretty simple to figure out what was gonna happen and who was who.
