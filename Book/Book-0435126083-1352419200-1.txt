review/summary: Terrible Beautyreview/text: Never watch The Titanic again. Toss your copy of Pride and Prejudice.Cuz THIS is true romance--heartbreaking and sweet and beautiful and terrible and sometimes leaving you so confused and asking WHY, all mixed up into what is Wuthering Heights. It's like.....a romance but NOT a romance. Oh, I can't really explain. Just read it. It isn't flowery or fake, just....amazing. Nothing (except perhaps Gone with the Wind) can compare.
