review/summary: SLOreview/text: Best book I've ever read. Not easy reading, but prophetic. It's a MUST for anyone in this day and age of politics where Obama is seen as a socialist (he's not) and the real socialism in France, England, Canada, Germany is being challenged, but not as Ayn Rand challenged it. It's being challenged by the benefactors of socialism for their respective Government cutting their socialist benefits! Amazing.
