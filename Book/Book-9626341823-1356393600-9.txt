review/summary: Great book, Kindle pictures were nicereview/text: Normall I don't buy illustrated novels on Kindle because, unless you have a Fire, Kindle and Pictures just don't go together. However, this book was free so I figured, how bad could it be? This worked out great, I got to read a novel I really enjoy, and my daughter got 10 or 12 photos to look at, enhancing her enjoyment of this book.
