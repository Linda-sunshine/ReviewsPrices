review/summary: Aged to perfectionreview/text: And I mean the book and me. Although I am not perfectly aged. I mean by my title that with age, I have been able to really appreciate the beautifully poetic words that Fitzgerald used for his story. I think that teachers must assign this because they think the simplicity of Fitzgerald's words are easy for teenagers to understand. They may be able to understand all the words, but I really don't think most teenagers can truly understand the meaning behind the beautiful word choices Fitzgerald made. I for one, did not and I just loved this book the second time around. Life experiences make it easier to see Daisy and Gatsby for what they truly are, very shallow people. I think only Tom shockingly looks good in this book. He recognizes his life for what it is. When I was young, I really thought Tom was a bad guy. I feel differently after reading it the second time. I still see this as such a sad, sad story, where nothing happy takes place.A must read!
