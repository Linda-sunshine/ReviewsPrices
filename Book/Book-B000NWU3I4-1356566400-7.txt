review/summary: A Wonderful Classic Readreview/text: I saw the movie when I was about halfway through the first third of the book. I have since completed the book and found it to be a wonderful adventure. I only hope that the upcoming movies stick a little closer to the book. What a neat book! It has stood the test of time and is as good a read as it was in the 50's when I first read it.
