review/summary: Top Non-Holy Book of All-Timereview/text: I've read this book over ten times in the past 30 years. It's shaped my life. I know that it sounds hokey. However, this is the first great book on self-awareness and self-motivation. The tenets of this book will undoubtedly increase the success you enjoy in your personal and professional relationships. I've never read another self-help book that wasn't based upon the themes of this book somewhat.
