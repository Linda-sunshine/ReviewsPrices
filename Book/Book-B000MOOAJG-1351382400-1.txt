review/summary: Why isn't everyone reading this book?review/text: Anyone who is troubled by the direction our society is heading should be reading this book. So go buy it. Now, before it is too late. Even if you are not troubled, it is a fantastic read. I had no idea what to expect when I picked up the book, but I had a hard time putting it down (which is saying something for a 1000-page book). There was only one spot (20 or so pages toward the end) where someone is giving a speech that drags on a bit (you want to say, okay Ayn, I get it...), but other than that, I was captivated.
