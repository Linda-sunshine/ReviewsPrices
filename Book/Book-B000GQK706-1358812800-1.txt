review/summary: Still a great read..review/text: After seeing the Hobbit, I had to re-read all 4 volumes from start to finish. I've been reading the Hobbit and the Lord of the rings since the early 70's and it is just a great piece of literature. Had to buy this as my daughter has my hard copy away at college.
