review/summary: NBC collectorreview/text: My husband and I collect different editions of "The Night Before Christmas" and we were so delighted by find Jane Daniell's version of the famous Clement C. Moore Christmas poem. Her illustrations are wonderful, very imaginative and give us an ideal of an English Christmas as well an another look at the well known family whose home is visited by Santa and his reindeer. We are so pleased to add this version to our collection, and want to thank Ms. Daniell for her time and talent.
