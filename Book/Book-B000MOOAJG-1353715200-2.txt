review/summary: A classicreview/text: I had felt so overwhelmed trying to read this book in print. It weighed a ton. Finally purchased for my Kindle and buckled in. Ayn has a unique classic and devoted perspective to man and his expectations of society. While all may not fully agree, this is an indepth story of triumph and will, love and devotion. I think its place among classic novels is well deserved and should be on everyones literature list.
