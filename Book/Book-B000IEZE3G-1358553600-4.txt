review/summary: A fabulous book for a new seriesreview/text: My friend ANNA started a club with her friend Braxton at my old school, Claxton. I always thought of the books as weird and boring but when my dad got me a Kindle Fire, it was on there so I tried it and loved it so much. I read books 2 3 4 5 and last night I finished this book. I like to go to sleep with it on because the voice makes me sleepy. It is a good book.
