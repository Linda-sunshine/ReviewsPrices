review/summary: Still a fabulous read 40 years onreview/text: This book should be on the &#34;must read&#34; list for any aspiring author. Its prose is clear and direct and the plot is driven by action, with Tolkien's rare skill of putting the reader right there among the hobbits, dwarves (Tolkien's spelling), elves, goblins, wolves, eagles, dragons and men. Its a fantasy but you forget that when immersed in the fabulous tale.
