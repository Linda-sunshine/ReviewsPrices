review/summary: We're Almost Therereview/text: Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451" is a pretty depressing book to read. Oh, not really because of what happens in the book (which is not a bowl of cherries), but because of how close we are to the society he describes. We've pretty much reached the big media/pervasive television/don't read point that he describes as the precursor to his universe. The only thing left is the actual banning of books. Though horrible for us, Bradbury writes a pretty good story around it. The problem I have with the book is that Bradbury jumps the "tell-a-story" rails quite a bit and ends up on the "classic citations" and philosophy tracks too often and for too long. It just gets in the way of what he's saying. Of course, my saying that is one of the slippery slopes he describes (condense books down by removing the thought-producing parts) as leading to his world. But, even so, because of these "interruptions" to the story, I rate this book at merely an OK 3 stars out of 5.
