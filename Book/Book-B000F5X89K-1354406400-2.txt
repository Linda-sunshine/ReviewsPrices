review/summary: A Classic!review/text: This is Mary Shelley's best (only?) work. Originally titled &#34;The Promethean Man,&#34; this book is about grotesque science experiments into what many religious folks would call &#34;God's territory.&#34; If you do not know what Frankenstein is about, then you probably don't care anyway, though.
