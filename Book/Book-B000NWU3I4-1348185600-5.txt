review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: I really enjoyed reading this book and can't wait for the movie. I have watched the three Lord of the Ring movies, dozens of times, and if this movie follows the book as well as the the LOTR movies did I will be very very happy. If you are a fan of LOTR you will definetly enjoy The Hobbit.
