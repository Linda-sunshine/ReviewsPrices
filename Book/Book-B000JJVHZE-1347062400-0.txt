review/summary: Best of the 20th Centuryreview/text: I think this may be the best book of the 20th century, at least written in the English language. I know many will disagree, but how can you not put it in the top 10? My good friend Perry, who passed away last year, used to tell me to read Mockingbird every 10 years or so. As we age there is something new between those same old pages. He was right. Read it as a child in school, again in your twenties, then your thirties, and on. Lee tells an adult story through the eyes of a child and with every passing decade the story deepens.
