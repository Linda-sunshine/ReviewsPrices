review/summary: Epic winreview/text: I am completely blown away by the beautiful detail of this book. If this kind of care and attention were still given to the publishing of all great literature we might find that more people would still have the respect for reading that we once did. I would like every book in my library to be this kind of quality. As far as a review of the book goes... Well, it's Lord of the Rings. There just isn't much I should need to say about that.
