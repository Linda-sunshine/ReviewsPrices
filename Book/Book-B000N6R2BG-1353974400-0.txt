review/summary: Pretty good but not her bestreview/text: I've read just about all of Jodi Picoult's books, and while this one was pretty good, it was far from her best. I won't summarize the plot--many others have--but it bordered on being a romance, a genre I'm not crazy about. The courtroom testimonies went on and on and on and were too repetitive. Generally, I find Picoult's books absorbing from one page to the next, but wound up skimming a lot of the pages to get the plot moving along. I still give the book 4 stars for an intriguing story, but I expected more from this author.
