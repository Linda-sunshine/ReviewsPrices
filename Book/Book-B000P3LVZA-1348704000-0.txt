review/summary: Brave New World Reviewreview/text: I am known for my lack of focus on one particular piece of literature at a time. This book, however, pulled me in and I set aside all other projects. Within four days I had finished it and was actually quite sad when the book ended. It's a brilliant look on civilization and culture and how technological advances can cause drastic changes to each in a very short amount of time.
