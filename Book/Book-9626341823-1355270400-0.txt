review/summary: Amazing!review/text: An all-time classic, Charles Dickens's A Christmas carol was a total star to me. it's not Christmas without watching the Muppet version, why not read it for a change? And for those of you hating how &#34;long and boring&#34; Dickens's novels can be, (I resent that) this one is farily short and well worth your time.
