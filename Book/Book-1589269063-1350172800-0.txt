review/summary: Life Saviing Advicereview/text: This book came recommended by my counselor. I read it. I gave my copy to my wife. It is most insightful. In short fantastic. Over three million copies sold in different languages. The author is very well respected. His methods are tried and tested. My wife and I have discussed his methods. They work, I can really tell you that. I recommend this book to ALL married couples. I bought the authors book on anger. That is also very very good and I highly recommend it to everyone. I had severe anger issues. Again, his methods work. I feel so much better. I will continue to use the methods taught to me in these books for the rest of my life. Thank you Dr. Gary Chapman.
