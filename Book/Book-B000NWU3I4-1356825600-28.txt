review/summary: Best story ever!!!review/text: Bilbo transforms into a complete hard-core adventurer while attaining the gratitude, loyalty, and respect of his dwarven comrades. My favorite part of the story, besides the iconic Gollum scene, would probably be the final battle against the goblins with the aid of men and elves and dwarves all against the wicked mutual enemy. A ten out of ten epic tale of bravery,friendship and honor. I would suggest for the aspiring young reader the classic tale of the hobbits.
