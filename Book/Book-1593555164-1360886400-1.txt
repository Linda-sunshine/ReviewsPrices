review/summary: Entertainingreview/text: I had never read any Jack Reacher books before, and my interest was stimulated by the movie (which I ended up never seeing). I am picking this up mid-series, so a lot is already established, but I found it a fun, quick read, not too preposterous (except how do you cast the diminutive Tom Cruise in the movie!??!?).
