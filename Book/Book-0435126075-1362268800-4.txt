review/summary: 200 years yet still relevantreview/text: This is the first time I read a Jane Austen book. The language is so formidable and lovely at the same time. I was inspired to read Pride and Prejudice because of the 200th anniversary it's writing and now I understand the reasoning behind the long-term love by Austen readers.
