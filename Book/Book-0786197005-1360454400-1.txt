review/summary: The Movie is an Improvement on the Bookreview/text: I first read the John Carter series decades ago and enjoyed them very much. When Disney announced the John Carter movie, I downloaded them and read them again. Wow, has my taste changed. I found the novels contrived, overly melodramatic and filled with blatant plot devices. They were fun to read - don't misunderstand, but not classics by any stretch. I thought the Movie &#34;John Carter&#34; was a good adaptation. I definitely thought the movie more enjoyable than the books.
