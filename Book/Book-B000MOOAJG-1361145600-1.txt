review/summary: greatreview/text: Everyone in the US should read this. The woman is a profit. The book is written in 1957 but it is like she had a window to today, The story line is a bit simplistic (1957). However, without some kind of back story no one would have read it. The parallels to presen day America and other parts of the world are amazing.
