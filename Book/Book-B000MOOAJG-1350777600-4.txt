review/summary: Atlas Shugreview/text: This is a classic. Simply put this is a mind bending look at how the good intentions of the many and the greed of the few can stifle the advancement of the whole world. This should be a must read for every high school senior. If you have never read this book get it and read it. The disease of Socialism is like any other malady of man. It must first be diagnosed before it can be irradiated.Atlas Shrugged
