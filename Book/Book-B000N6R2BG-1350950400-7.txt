review/summary: Enjoyable read.review/text: "Keeping Faith" is an interesting book that includes multiple dynamics of a mother-daughter relationship when tinged with the reality of the unknown. I am enjoying it very much and would suggest for anyone that has enjoyed Jodi Picoult books in the past or would just like a great fiction read.
