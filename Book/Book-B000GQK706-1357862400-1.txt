review/summary: Tolkien is a master story crafter and also a credible poetreview/text: This is a 3 books in one group and over 1100 pages. However, the story telling, descriptions and poetry are lovely. I have finished, thus far, about half the book and can't put it down, although I can only read in the evening. I bought it used and it was in the good condition that it was advertised and also arrived well within the time allotted for delivery.
