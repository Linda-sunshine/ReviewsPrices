review/summary: New fan of Jane Austenreview/text: Somehow never read Austen as a youngster but decided to read it on my new Kindle! I'm so glad I did! The story got off to a slow start, dull and dry! As I plowed on through a lot of dinners and dances some of the characters became appealing, the plot thickened. Suddenly I was hooked. I've become an Austen enthusiast I will be ordering more of her novels.
