review/summary: I wish I read this book 2 years ago (I am 22 now)review/text: I am young, and I was in a serious relation. Unfortunately, I messed it up. Then I found this book, and now I understand a lot more and know how to love a girl with her language, I wish I read this book 2 years ago. It is really good and make sense, it is probably the most worthy book I ever read. No matter you have a wonderful relation or not, you should read it, it only help you make your relation better and understand your partner more.
