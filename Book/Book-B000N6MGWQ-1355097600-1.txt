review/summary: Touching and heartwarmingreview/text: I bought this book months ago and only read it recently. What a mistake. I'm not sure if it was the basic message of the book or the way it made me think, but, it definitely is a book that touched me deeply. I have recommended this book to others. Now, who are the five people you would want to meet in heaven?
