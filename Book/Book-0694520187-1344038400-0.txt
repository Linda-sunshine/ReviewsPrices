review/summary: Update on the Kindle free versionreview/text: It looks as if the free Kindle version of Moby Dick has been improved. Earlier reviewers remarked that the free version lacked a working table of contents, and/or the etymological extracts about whales prefacing the text. Also, Fr. Mapples' sermon passage was reported to be missing from Ch. 9.Thanks to the Project Gutenberg volunteers, for as of when I uploaded this six weeks ago, the text looks intact. Of course, without footnotes being a public domain text, this will remain daunting to newcomers. Melville's range of references and his style may not please today's impatient readers. I recommend using a free version in tandem with a volume with more guidance, such as the Norton Critical Edition.Still, it's convenient to have this to dip into and search within on a Kindle platform, gratis. I had to read this in college and grad school, but I found myself returning to it for the pleasure of it a while ago. Now I am also starting "Redburn," one of his now overlooked, but more accessible, earlier tales. That free text was not directly downloadable via the Amazon link when I tried, but go to gutenberg-dot-org and you can find that file easily transferable for a Kindle device. So are all of his stories and his novels, so enjoy the easy search for your seabound quest.
