review/summary: Fantastic Tale!review/text: This is a great book with very exciting surprises along the unexpected adventure. I enjoyed every chapter of this amazing tale. Whether it was from fighting spiders deep from the forest of Kirkwood, or dueling 3 trolls while snooping around. I am positive that any reader will thoroughly enjoy the miraculous story of an extraordinary Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins.
