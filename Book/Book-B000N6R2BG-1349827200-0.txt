review/summary: I do not understand the ending at all!!!!review/text: I have read quite a few Jodi Picoult books and usually love them. Actually, I have found most of them to be very hard to put down. This one was different. The Mariah described in the beginning becomes a completely different person as the book goes on. There is way too much religious information in here that I found boring and unnecessary. Last but not least, I truly do not get the ending at all. I have read the last couple of pages over and over and I can't figure it out. Maybe it's subject to interpretation? Even so, I am lost. If anyone "gets" the ending, please comment.
