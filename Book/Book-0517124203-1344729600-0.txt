review/summary: I Read It - Finally!review/text: I must confess that I don't like fantasy or children's tales which accounts for my longstanding reluctance to read this classic work. But one too many references to "Alice in Wonderland" made me finally decide I need to know, first hand, what all the fuss was about.Reading a text that has long become embedded into our culture, turns things upside down. I had so long heard of the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the Rabbit Hole, that I feel like I know these reference when in fact, I don't. Now I do and that is what I got most of the book. Alice's plucky, no nonsense tone is a bracing counterpoint to the ridiculousness going on around her. The Queen cracked me up and I now see where Baron Sasha Cohen's Dictator comes from. As a work of literature, perhaps its charms would have been more intoxicating at age 7 but alas, I cannot turn back time.So I'm glad I read the thing but there was no transport, no insight and my general dislike for children's books and fantasy remains as fortress-like as before I began down the rabbit hole.
