review/summary: Classic Novelreview/text: I recommend this book to any lover of historical fiction. It tells of the inherent evils of slavery. This classic novel is one which many are familiar but few in recent years have read. I am saddened when I'm reminded of the pains that my people (Blacks) endured for centuries but I am filled with pride that they were strong in body and spirit and made it through those horrid times. Their perseverance and faithfulness give me hope when I feel despair.
