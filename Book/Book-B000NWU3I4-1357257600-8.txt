review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: This is an awesome book! I rated it 5 stars because it has adventure, details, a few jokes, and detailed illustration. If you haven't read it, you should because you'll probably like it so much that you would want to let everyone know how AWESOME it is. If you do read it I hope you like it and share it. Thank J.R.R Tolkien for such a great book! :) Also you should rate it 5 stars.
