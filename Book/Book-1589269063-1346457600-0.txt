review/summary: language of lovereview/text: My husband had been reading this book at his work place and there was a test in the book that you can take to find out what language of love you are more inclined to.When this book finally arrived my husband said the test was not in this particular book, But he was able to find it on line. I guess I purchased the wrong book. I am sure that this book is pretty much the same as the one at work except for the test. I haven't read it but hope to soon. My husband liked it. Said it was interesting.
