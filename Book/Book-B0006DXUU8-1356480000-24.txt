review/summary: Wonderful Illustrations Befot a Great Storyreview/text: To borrow from Dickens and A Christmas Carol: "An intelligent book...a remarkable book...What a delightful book!"I got this book at the "Dickens on the Strand" festival in Galveston, TX, in December 2012. The book is all the more special because it was signed by Dickens' g-g-granddaughter and g-g-g-grandaughter, who were special guests that weekend.The illustrations are excellent and really bring the story - and, especially, the characters - to life.And the story! Oh, what a story! I think my favorite aspect is the descriptions of the characters and settings. As a morality tale, it is so interesting that there is very little sermonizing. The three ghosts do not jibber jabber...they let Scrooge come to his own realization by placing him in situations where he can see and contemplate his own actions. The most biting part is when his own cruel words are turned on him. But other characters, too, act without charity, and if we don;t see ourselves in Scrooge and his outlandish meanness, perhaps we can see ourselves in the minor characters and their snide remarks, and improve ourselves on that account. While Tiny Tim seems to be the iconic character of The book, I actually like several others more, including the nephew, Fred; Fezziwig and his family; and the folks who stole the very curtains and clothes from Scrooge on his deathbed - their behavior was atrocious but their characterization was superb!This book capped off a year when I read two other Dickens works - Bleak House and Great Expectations for the first time. I plan to read more of him next year and will once again end with the Carol.Merry Christmas!
