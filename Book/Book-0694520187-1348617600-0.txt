review/summary: Still the Great American Novelreview/text: Even now, this novel rings true to the experience of the American way, but the wonderful thing is that it includes characters from everywhere in the world. The human inclination is to conquer nature, and this novel expounds on that theme. In the United States, as elsewhere, the exploitation of any resource (bison, passenger pigeons, cod, oil) is absolute. It is a miracle that we have any whales left, given the way they were hunted for so many decades.
