review/summary: Glad I read itreview/text: Glad I finally picked this up to read after seeing a great review for the fourth book, The Son, in this series. Figured I'd start with the first to see how it was. Great book. Moves quickly, characters well developed, and interesting dystopian plot. I think it's a good book for all ages. It's also a commentary on society without being preachy. I've since read the second in the series's and look forward to the next two as well.
