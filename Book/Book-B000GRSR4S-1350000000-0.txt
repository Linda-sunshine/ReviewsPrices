review/summary: Breathtaking book!review/text: No many words are needed to describe how much I enjoyed this book. Vonnegut's writing style is literary genius and the reoccurring themes, examples of human nature and deja vu will leave you lost for words in a bliss of awe. I only wished that there was such a thing as a 6 star rating. So it goes.
