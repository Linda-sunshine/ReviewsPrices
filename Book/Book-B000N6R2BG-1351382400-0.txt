review/summary: Very good read ! Makes you thinkreview/text: This was a good read. I found the story eyeopening & touching. It's amazing how it shows the way issues are blown out of proportion and in another way hope & faith can make all the difference ....I would recommend it but I will warn people I found my self frustrated with how ignorant people are regarding depression & how quickly society is to judge....how the media is like vultures .... yet I liked the dynamic & I find her take on these issues as true.
