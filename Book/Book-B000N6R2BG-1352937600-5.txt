review/summary: Picoult has done betterreview/text: I have enjoyed Picoult's writing in the past and liked this one in general, but felt at times it was too descriptive. There were long sections that described things that didn't add to the story. I felt sometimes the story went sideways and not forward - just my thought. I like books to move a long once I am hooked. I will still read her again.
