review/summary: Propriety pays offreview/text: In the Pride and prejudice era, a woman's means of survival and finances was determined by the men in her life-first her father and then Her husband. This is the story of the five Bennett sisters and their quest for suitable husbands. Their felicity in life depends on overcoming pride and prejudice to follow their heart in matters of matrimony. This was a fun story that left me longing for social norms of yesteryear.
