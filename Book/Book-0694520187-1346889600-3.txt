review/summary: Cetology's finest momentreview/text: Moby Dick is the greatest of all novels. Other works may be more refined, or ask less of the reader and perhaps, give more in return to those who peruse a book casually, but The Whale, is not that kind of work. It is a testament written in blood, and in turn, demands blood from the reader. You must devote yourself to The Whale, sign on to The Pequod and give yourself tooth and nail to an adventure without equal. Do not, be discouraged by the difficulties, but instead look for the subtleties. This is not simply a book about a man's obsession, it is more particularly, Ishmael's story, and he is a SIddartha to Ahab's vengeful old testament God. A man who finds himself in the mists and foam of the fitful seas rather than the whirlpools and harpoons of Ahab's longing. It is a work without equal, that rewards every reading with new insights into what it means to be human. Superb. Truly a classic.
