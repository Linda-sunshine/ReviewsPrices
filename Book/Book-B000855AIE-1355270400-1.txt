review/summary: Read this in high schoolreview/text: Have to say, it doesn't hold up well. It's kind of a preachy book full of ideas I already know. (Remember, I did read it in high school. Plus, I have almost 50 years of post-high school experience now.) I'd say for high schoolers or older people who haven't given much thought before to just how we should conduct ourselves and evaluate our experiences, it's worth dipping into.
