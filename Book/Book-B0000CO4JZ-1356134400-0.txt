review/summary: Nonereview/text: The first time i read this book iwas bored because i didnt fully understand how Fitzgerald conveyed the plot of the story. But now i have read it again with a more mature state of mind I really find it like a soap oprah... there was evidence of gossip that placed a &#34;umph&#34; to the supension I had when reading. The love story between Daisy and Gatsby, with Nick and Jordon, Tom and Myrtle, and Daisy too, interuptions not to mention their individual ives, and how FItzgerald cleverly used elements of prose and literary devices, to convey confusion and suspense highlights the fact that this story was well written and will remain one of the best years to come.
