review/summary: TERRIFIC BOOK!review/text: Our Pastor told us almost 15 years ago to read this book together and THEN he would marry us. OH my what a wonderful book this is and it has helped us understand each other in ways we would have never know before reading this book. I just bought it for my son and his girlfriend.. I recommend it to anyone.. Married or not married. It helps you understand yourself and your mate and what each of you need to feel loved.
