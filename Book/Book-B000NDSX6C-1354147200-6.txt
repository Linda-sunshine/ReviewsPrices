review/summary: Small characters, BIG adventurereview/text: "The Hobbit" is an amazing story and a big adventure. A hobbit named Bilbo, a wizard named Gandalf, Thorin and a dozen other dwarves join together to slay a huge dragon and reclaim the dwarves' treasure. They meet many along the way, friends and foes, including elves, wolves, eagles, trolls, and many more! You don't have to be adventuress to love this book. I'd give "The Hobbit" 100 stars if possible. I've wished to go back home just like Bilbo many times. I could also relate to many fantasy books I've read. Anyone who loves a good odyssey, or even just a fantasy, should read "The Hobbit," young or old! There isn't a single chapter you won't like! Though lengthy, it is one of the best books you will ever read!
