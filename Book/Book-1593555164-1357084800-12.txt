review/summary: Great Read!review/text: I recommend this book to anyone who likes a fast moving novel. Jack Reacher is a believable character and although Tom Cruise was way to small to play this part, the movie which recreates one shot, was well done, but not better than the novel.I give this novel a five star rating. I woud recommend this book to my high school students.
