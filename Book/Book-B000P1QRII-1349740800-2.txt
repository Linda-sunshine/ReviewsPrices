review/summary: Loved this book.review/text: This book was assigned as homework for my son's 6th grade class. I also read the book to be able to discuss the book together. He really enjoyed the book and it initiated many a conversations about science fiction books, science fiction movies, Nazis and different utopian societies. I thought it was truly engaging and at every turn there was a "what's going to happen next" question. We spent a lot of time discussing the decisions that were made by the characters and why they made those decisions.
