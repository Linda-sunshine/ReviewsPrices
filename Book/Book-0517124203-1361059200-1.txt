review/summary: Lewis Carroll was magicalreview/text: I suppose I have nothing to say really about the Kindle version, but what a bizzarre book this is, especially for the time period this was written. Did Lewis Carroll not do any drugs when he wrote this? That's hard to believe, because this story is from another planet.
