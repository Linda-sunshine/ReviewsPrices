review/summary: Wish it was longerreview/text: I really wish this book had been written for a higher reading level. I loved the idea, but I felt like it was cut short. I felt like I really missed out on the entire picture, or like this a portion of a more elaborate novel. I loved it, but was definitely left wanting more. It would have been perfect if it were longer and had a little more detail!
