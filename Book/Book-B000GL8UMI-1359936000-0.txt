review/summary: Fascinating!review/text: I started writing sci fi because of this book. Actually had the honor of seeing Ray Bradbury speak- LIVE - (yea, I know, it was eons ago) - but I hadn't read anything he had written before that speech. I got a copy of this book shoved into my chest just after that speech, and couldn't put it down. A marvelous read. And a must read for anyone who wants to understand how things can go wrong in society, and to get a glimpse of the cleverness of the human spirit. I'd say this is a must read for everyone!
