review/summary: Loved it!review/text: This is the first Dickens book I've read and I enjoyed it very much - have just bought more of his novels. The few illustrations in this version are lovely and do really add to the pleasure of reading this book.This version has both endings (the one 'official' that Dickens added after the fact once a friend pointed out that the original ending was to dismal and the 'original' ending). I tend to prefer the original ending, but you would have to read the book to see for yourself...Would really recommend reading this book!
