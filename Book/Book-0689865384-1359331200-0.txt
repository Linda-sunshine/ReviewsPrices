review/summary: Uglies by Scott Westerfeldreview/text: I chose this rating because the book is Interesting. It held my attention and was very hard to put down. This book was recommended to me by my Granddaughter. It is the kind of book I would recommend to young ladies. I am not a young lady but I enjoy reading different kinds of novels & this one was Great! Have now started reading the sequel to this one and am already glad that I am.
