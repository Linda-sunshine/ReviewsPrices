review/summary: Another Hit for J. Picoultreview/text: Of course, I purchased this because I have read so many other books by this author. It did not disappoint me. The story line was rather bizarre, leaving me more on the side of disbelief than belief. It did offer a glimpse of a religious experience with the little girl and her &#34;wounds&#34; and quite convincingly pointed out differences between the &#34;believers&#34; and &#34;non-believers.&#34; I liked the way Ms. Picoult wove into the story the role of the church in attempting to prove or disprove the validity of the little girl's medical events. THe book has its share of suspense and intrigue.
