review/summary: More than a classicreview/text: As a writer with an MA in literature, I of course read this book as a adolescent and as part of courses in Victorian English writing. The book is a little long--but then all Victorian novels are (people had more time to read then),but the material before about who Charlotte Bronte was and that she served as a governess herself gave tremendous background to what might seem like an over-dramatic story. Charlotte Bronte was one of the first novelists to talk about the plight of single women (who had to make a living) of that era in England. Descriptions of the country side and the travel by coach are amazing and the reader feels as if he/she can actually see and experience what it must have been like to live and travel there.Charlotte Bronte's characters are sharply delineated and the main character is a strong woman in an era of weak ones; I compared them with some of the strong women found in the novels of Jane Austen. I definitely recommend it for winter reading, when there is time to snuggle up to a wood stove or fireplace with a cup of cocoa or a glass of wine and immerse oneself in another era. Probably not for male readers unless they are English majors or really appreciate women.
