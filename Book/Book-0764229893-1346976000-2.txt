review/summary: Taterannereview/text: This was not the book I had expected when I down loaded it but Anyone that has any knowledge of the Bible and Its documented history of the Kings of IsraelWill enjoy following this series. Its mainly about Heziekial who grows up to be king of israel and how he outsmarts his enemys and brings peace to his peopleIts a harsh life with harsh outcomes at times but well worth reading if only to realise how history influences modern living
