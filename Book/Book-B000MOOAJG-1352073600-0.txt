review/summary: Obama's Playbook and its outcomreview/text: An unfortunate script for liberal thinkers written 60 plus years ago. A philosphy exposed by the author that lived it. A bit wordy in places but if you take the time to understand the message ... it is revealing of human nature. Should be a mandatory read for every young person preparing to enocounter the world.
