review/summary: Book is Great, Cover Art is Wrong.review/text: One Shot is a good book. Reacher is a great character. I have read all the Reacher books and enjoyed them immensely. My bone of contention is with the cover art. Tom Cruise is not and never will be Jack Reacher. His association with this character has created a dilemma: can I read another Jack Reacher novel without the Tiny Scientologist intruding on my visualisation of Reacher and spoiling my enjoyment? If I'm lucky. But it will take a great deal of effort, and Cruise and Child are responsible.
