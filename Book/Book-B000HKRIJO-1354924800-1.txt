review/summary: An exceptional book!review/text: I have recently been reading many books on Christianity and had heard several good things about the works of C.S Lewis. Thankfully, this book confirmed all of those positive remarks and did much more.Lewis has an incredible writing style which enables him to express the key concepts of Christianity in layman's terms, thus making it easier for the non-Christian to make sense of it. My favorite sentence in the book is one that I remember Christian apologist Douglas Geivett mentioning in a debate, and is in Chapter 10 - Hope. The author states "If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world..."Lewis goes on to talk about the ongoing battle that man endures between his desire for autonomy and the subjugation of his will to the Will of God. He explains that what appears to be the difficult path in the short-run turns out to be most beneficial and rewarding in the long term. I also found his thoughts about the trinity to be quite interesting. The author states that when praying to God, it is helpful to consider Jesus as standing beside you, assisting you in your prayers and the Holy Spirit to be behind you or within you.The only contention that I wish to make is concerning "Lewis' Trilemma" (the assertion that either Jesus was Lord, a Liar or a Lunatic). I personally don't believe that these are not the only conclusions that one can draw from his teachings, however this does not prevent me from giving this book a 5-star rating. Highly recommended.
