review/summary: One hot to Five Starsreview/text: I read "One Shot" the first time in 2006 and it sold me on Lee child and Jack Reacher.I have just finished re-reading the novel in anticiopation of the movie being released in Dec.I am reminded of what made me become a Lee Child / jack Reacher fan. Once I ginished this book, I went our brought all of Lee child's previous books and have purchased each Jack rEACHER NOVEL (AND SHORT STORY) AS THEY CAME OUT.Jack Reacher is a highly intelligent, ex-military cop who has his own highly developed sense of justice. This novel is classic Reacher in every form.I highly recommend every one read this thriller.
