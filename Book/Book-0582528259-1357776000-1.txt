review/summary: Worth Getting Into!review/text: I downloaded this book for my thirteen-year-old daughter to read. When she first picked it up to read, she had some difficultly with the language and the writting style. Because of this she put it down and went and read something else. Later, she came back to this book and tried it again. While the first chapter did give her problems, she continued reading and as the story progressed she became enthralled with the story. In the end, she loved the book and has suggested that I read it as well, which is something that I plan to do, when I'm done my reading list.
