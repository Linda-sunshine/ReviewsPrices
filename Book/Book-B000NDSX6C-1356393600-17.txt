review/summary: Neglected classicreview/text: In the shadow of the Lord of the Rings, all too many have neglected the immensely creative, clever, exciting, and ultimately satisfying prequel, The Hobbit. As Peter Jackson discovered when he had to stretch the movie series to a trilogy, The Hobbit is packed with interesting and imaginative characters and situations. It is relatively short, yet plants the seeds for the huge trilogy that follows, as well as telling a ripping good tale. Get it and read it!
