review/summary: Hobbit, not my kind of talereview/text: I purchased this because my grand sons are real Tolkien fans, have read his books and seen the movies.I wanted to be able to talk with them about both the book and the movie. That is now possible, but I don't think that I will read the rest. I don't really enjoy this kind of book.
