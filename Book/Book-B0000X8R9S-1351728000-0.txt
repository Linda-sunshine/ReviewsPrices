review/summary: Hatchet - Great for 6th Graders!review/text: (From my daughter) - I'm 11 and in 6th grade and we read this book for class. I loved the book, but it was a bit gruesome in parts. It's a great story about overcoming obstacles and surviving despite the odds. My favorite part of the book was learning to build a fire without any matches! This book teaches you a lot about what it would be like to survive a plane crash and be left all alone to fend for yourself out in the elements. All you're left with are your own thoughts and you have to process things that happened in your life because you don't have anyone else to talk to. You have to learn to be resourceful and figure out how to survive, even when you don't want to.
