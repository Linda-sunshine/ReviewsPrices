review/summary: creative writingreview/text: Strong beginning. A lot of thought went into the world creation. A few dark points surprising in a children's book. Its society mocks families by replacing it with a pale imitation. Interesting. The ending feels rushed. The final ending is open ended, but that doesn't bother me.
