review/summary: Classic and still funreview/text: I had read this book as a kid and decided that with the recent movie being released, I would revisit the book. It is quite short, but even so, the plot covers a lot of ground.John Carter finds himself transported to Mars, which the natives there call Barsoom. He is captured by the Tharks, four-armed green men, but earns their respect with his battle prowess. His earthly muscles and strength give him an advantage over the creatures of Barsoom, with the ability to make superhero leaps and deliver extreme force with a single blow. As John Carter makes allies and enemies among the Tharks, he meets Dejah Thoris, a princess from Helium. She is taken captive by the Tharks, but Carter vows to free her and return her to her home. As the adventure unfolds, they are swept up in a greater war.I enjoyed this book and rooted for John Carter the entire time. In some places the description of the world of Barsoom bogs down the pace. The love story was not terribly believable, but the interactions between Sola and the other Tharks made for a nice secondary plot.
