review/summary: A great mix of fantasy and reality!review/text: Many out there that have only seen the movie and never touched the book are missing out on the brilliance that is this novel. Presented as a chronological compilation of journals and documents written by the different characters, this book accomplishes a level of closeness between the reader and the cast unseen in other works of fiction.Beyond that, the engaging story, with well delivered mystery and thrills, will keep most readers flipping through its pages.The Audible book is a pleasure to listen to as every character is read by a different actor, really fleshing them out.
