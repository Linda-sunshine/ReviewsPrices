review/summary: The book is always better than the movie.review/text: This is the first book I read on the Kindle. The writing style is very old school but the Kindle built in dictionary makes it easier to read. Both the Monster and Dr. Frankenstein are very different than those we grew up with on the silver screen. I like these better.
