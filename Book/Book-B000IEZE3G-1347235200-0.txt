review/summary: Timeless Classicreview/text: When I wroteFiona Thorn and the Carapacem SpellI only hoped I'd be able to conjure a vivid magical landscape bursting with full, well realized characters like Harry, Hermione and Ron. Not to mention the rest of the countless memorable characters like the Weasleys, Dumbledore, Snape or even Dobby, everyone's favorite House Elf.Rowling has set the bar so high with the Harry Potter franchise she is literally on another planet. Harry Potter, and everything that those two magical words summon, has become not only a world wide sensation, but an undeniable part of our culture. Say "Harry Potter" to anyone and I bet they smile.I even remember where I was, all those years ago, when I started reading the kids' book everyone was talking about. I was sitting in a diner, waiting for some friends. They were late, and when they finally arrived I secretly wished they'd stood me up and left me to my book. By October I was fashioning a Nimus 2000 out of an old broom and sporting a round pair of plastic glasses for Halloween.Rowling is the undisputed queen of her genre, and an inspiration on how it's done, proving that good fiction doesn't have to be snooty and pretentious to be classic. I can't wait to introduce it to my grandchildren someday.
