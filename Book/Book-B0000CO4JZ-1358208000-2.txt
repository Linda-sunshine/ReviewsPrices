review/summary: Classic!review/text: This book is a classic and when I read it I instantly knew why.The writing is poetic and so are the characters.I had been meaning to read this for a long time and jumped on it when it went on sale. I'm glad I did. This book takes you on a journey through what is right and wrong, good and evil and the blurred lines that exist in that mindset.
