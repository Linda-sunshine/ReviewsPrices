review/summary: Read and read againreview/text: I simply love this book. The writing style is unique and though hard to read at spots the descriptions and scenes are artfully written. Much like many older books one doesn't get the pleasure of reading such epic tales without a bit of dedication and perseverance. But like Bilbo's journey it's well worth the experience.
