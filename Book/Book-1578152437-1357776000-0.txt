review/summary: A sure thing, Mr. Dickensreview/text: For the last 5 years I have started each year with Dickens' novel because I knew that he is a sure thing that will shine light on everything about being human. He never disappointed and I think Oliver Twist so far is the saddest one. (which is alot to say considering the fantastic dramas in all of his books) I call Dickens' books 'Prego'--Spaghetti sauce-- because like the old commercial, whatever you want, it is in it. The potential to be good, evil, be a victim and perpetrator, to be heartless and to be generous...all in his books. A wholesome reading experience.
