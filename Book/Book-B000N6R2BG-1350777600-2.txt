review/summary: Keeping Faithreview/text: This is one of the few books which I will add to my list of books in which I couldn't put down. I was intrigued from beginning to end. I've read other books by this author, and was somewhat impressed, but this read stands out as a favorite. I will certainly check out more books by Jody Picoult.
