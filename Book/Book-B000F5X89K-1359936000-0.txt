review/summary: Frankensteinreview/text: I read this book only because it was required of me for a college course. It was rather difficult for me to get into it because the wording is very different than what I am use to reading. Once I got into it, I felt it was a very dark book. There where things that surprised me and humbled me as well. I now understand why it's one everyone should read.
