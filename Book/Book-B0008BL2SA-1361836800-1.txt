review/summary: An old classic that still has relevancereview/text: I never got around to reading this earlier in life , but am so glad that I did finally have the time. You'll be drawn into the book by the characters and their dilemmas with life. Yes, it's from times past, but the nature of mankind hasn't changed. Read it!
