review/summary: A Really Well-written Novelreview/text: This is the Kindle version of the novel. It uses the page number location as well as the locator number (less useful). It has the usual table of contents to go to when you've either lost your place or want to skip chapters you're not interested in.The novel itself is very well written and is worth reading again, especially if the last time you read it was in high school, or you've seen the movies and need to review some of the passages you feel the movie(s) missed or glossed over. Good fantasy.
