review/summary: The quintessential enjoyable bookreview/text: I somehow managed to not find this book on required reading through the many different schools I attended and am most gratified that I was able to experience this with a few years of maturity added on. It's stunning to experience a book that elicits such a wide spectrum of emotion. The characters are fleshed out and practical in their roles with no trimming or additions needed. Atticus Finch is such a spectacle of honesty and integrity that , I'm afraid, it's too impossible for him to exist in real life. Following the day- to- day activities of Scout and her slightly older brother, Jem, around for a few summers makes me wish I had the childhood and upbringing they had in this story and I feel like I'm stung with such a bittersweet feeling caught in between laughing and crying. A plot synapsis is unnecessary. The writing flows so smoothly and easily you'll be holding most of the pages in your left hand quicker than any book you'll ever read.
