review/summary: LOVE!!!review/text: I didn't realize there were full-page color pictures peppered throughout the book! the artwork is absolutely stunning, and captures the characters in all the youth and beauty that Jane Austen probably intended them to have. Mr. Wickham is absolutely dashing!! I can't believe I got a 1940s edition in such good condition and for such a great deal.
