review/summary: A great classic adventure.review/text: I've enjoyed this reading more than my original boyhood reading of the timeless classic. I liked the humor and characters. Huck&#8216;s reasoning and understanding of a racial era, may or may not help us today. Rafting the great river with Huck and Jim and sharing their adventures! What fun!
