review/summary: One of the Greatest American Novelsreview/text: This is one of the only books I read in high school that I remember vividly. This is one of the great American novels. It is is not a very long book, but it truly captures the time, and upper crust New York life. The characters are wonderful and the plot moves quickly. There are references to many things that happened in the 20's and issues of the time. The ending was pretty anticlimactic as well.
