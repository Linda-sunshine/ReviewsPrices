review/summary: I wish I had read this earlierreview/text: This book was written to instruct and encourage young people (men, in those days--but it can apply to anyone) to live a simple and productive life. Franklin learned early the unpleasantness of being in debt and in trouble with others, and made for himself a rule of life, which he strove daily to adhere to. He quickly learned that advice from others can be mistaken and the necessity of evaluating what others prescribed. He gives a good account of a prudent life, but does not spare himself, clearly declaring when he was at fault or mistaken. I wish I had read this when I was young--I might have been more consistent and productive.
