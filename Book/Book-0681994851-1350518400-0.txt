review/summary: A classicreview/text: Old, old classic book. The story is great. Reading it, though, is SO tedious. Over and over, I found myself flipping pages to get back to the story. I really didn't need to know the details about the fringe on the material of the drapes in the rooms! Just too much minutiae.
