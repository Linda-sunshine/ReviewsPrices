review/summary: Greatest series everreview/text: You can't go wrong with Harry Potter. I got this because my sister and I shared a collection, and then we both moved from home and she took it. I love the series so much I got this because I wanted to reread it. I read this when I was in elementary school, and find it just as wonderful as a graduate of college years later. JK ROwling is an incredible author. I'd recomend this book to anyone in any age group, but I'm really looking forward to reading it to my future babies. THe characters are amazing, the plot is amazing, the setting is amazing.... basically there's nothing wrong with this book at all.
