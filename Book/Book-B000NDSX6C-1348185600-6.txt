review/summary: Maddy's Overviewreview/text: I am an avid fan of Lord of the Rings and I consider myself to have a vivid imagination. My imagination went on this ride of fantasy and wizardry full of delight and dread as well. This is the first novel of this type that I have read, usually I just love to watch the movie version of these types of stories. I can truly say, however, that I enjoyed the journey of the hobbit and hope that the movie will be as entertaining as the book itself.
