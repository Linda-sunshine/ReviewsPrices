review/summary: The Hobbit, a review from a readerreview/text: If you loved the&#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy, then you must read this book either before or after reading the trilogy, as it gives you a broader background on the shire and of the history of Frodo's uncle Bilbo. Although the two stories were written as to be stand alone stories, they need to be read by any reader of Hobbit Lore. The fantastic world of the Middle Earth is so like our own world, yet much is not the same, as in the animals and the people inhabiting Middle Earth. The spirit of being the best person is alive in both stories. Read it and you will not be sorry for the time you spent with Tolkien!
