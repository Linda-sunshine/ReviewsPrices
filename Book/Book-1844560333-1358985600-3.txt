review/summary: A Favoritereview/text: While I haven't read this version yet I seen it for the kindle and knew I had to have it.I love the book, I love the movie (BBC version with Colin Firth), and I love Jane AustinI have to admit that I watched the movie first having avoided the the book for years. I thought it would be to dry and boring. Having seen the movie I had to find out what was left out, so I took the leap.I loved it! I do think that having watched the movie helped. It was pretty well true to the book a few things left out. I did find some parts a bit dry and the speech awkward and don't think if I were younger would have had the patience to move thru it. It is good and definitely worth the push.
