review/summary: A Magical Beginning.review/text: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful first novel in what is an outstanding series. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is largely a struggle for self identity story and Rowling does such a brillant job developing Harry's world. Harry grows up thinking he's an ordinary boy,but on his 11th birthday,Harry recieves an invatation to a specail school that starts the embarkment on a journey for Harry to discover who he really is and what his destiny is. One reason Harry Potter has been so popular is that Rowling suceeds in making the readers care about her characters. The characters feel so real. You can almost feel their joys,fears,and sorrows through the pages. That's the thing that makes Harry Potter such a wonderful series,all the characters and their feelings and reactions seem so real. This is easily the most charming and innocent of the Harry Potter novels,but one reason the later books resonate so much is that,by making us fall in love with Harry,Ron,Hermione,Dumbledore,and Hagrid in this the lighter adventures of Sorcerer's Stone,we are thus really able to fear and empathize with them when they face the darker and more tragic and intense events of the later books because we've grown to care for them. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a rousing first novel in a series that only gets better afterwards. I strongly recommend this book for readers of all ages.
