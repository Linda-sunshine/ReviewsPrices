review/summary: Still surprisingreview/text: I originally read this as an assignment in high school. I was not only shocked by the adult content back then but also the fact that someone from so long ago could predict the future in so many ways. Now that I've started to reread it, it still surprises me. How could someone predict something like cloning?? It's not the easiest book to read. When I come across a word I've never heard of, I smile and tell myself the author was trying to prove how smart he was. But don't be put off, it is an interesting read.
