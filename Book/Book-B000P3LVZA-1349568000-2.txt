review/summary: Brainy but sterile narrative - I much preferred 1984review/text: Extremely boring in many stretches. Really, it's more an exposition of a future possible state, with archetypes instead of characters, and long, highly technical descriptions of factories and flying machines. Don't look for subtle emotions or subtle anything here - I guess that wasn't the point.For a dystopian novel, I'd highly recommend Orwell's 1984 instead.But two stars for Brave New World's prescience and the obvious smarts of its author, and that affecting scene of the conditioning of the Delta babies (poor things!).Lastly, I am surprised this is required reading for many English classes - it could really turn off students to dystopian literature.
