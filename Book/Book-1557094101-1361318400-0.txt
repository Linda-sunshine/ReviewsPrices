review/summary: The AniMotion ruins itreview/text: Well, it's the same classic story and I thought my 2 year old might like the added &#34;AniMotion&#34; stuff, so I chose this version. Unfortunately, the parts that utilized the AniMotion were so dark, it was really hard to see what it was. I'm not sure if you have to look at it in exactly the right angle (I tried) or if I just got a bad copy, but I was pretty disappointed.
