review/summary: Still a Great Story on 3rd Readingreview/text: Whilst light in character and plot compared with the epic Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit is still a great read and provides some context for the later story. The dwarves are never as likeable as the elves but Bilbo's adventures bring him into contact with Gandalf, Beorn and the Elves. Definitely a recommended read if you like this fantasy world.
