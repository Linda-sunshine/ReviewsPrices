review/summary: The Noble Savagereview/text: Brave New WorldHuxley uses almost 85%(15 chapters) of this great literary work to weave fantasy into a somewhat gripping story,showing us where we're "headed". (At a much faster rate during the first 80 years since its publicationthan he envisioned.) It seems, we've come about 85% of the way to"Utopia" in about 15% of the 632years he alloted.The final 15% (3 chapters) of Brave New World is where the "meat" of the book is; ie, the choice of Heaven OnEarth vs. the possibility of Heaven after death.One of my strongest doubts about Christianity is the depiction of Heaven as some kind of etheral bliss thatseems, almost, sufficatingly boring. We aren't all alike. One man's pleasure is another woman's poison. (I'ma bit ashamed to bow to PC.)Contrary to most Christian theology that bemoans the fact that Adam & Eve chose the fruit of the "Tree OFKnowledge" rather than the "Tree Of Life". I thank God that, becaue of that choice, we've put off "Utopia"for a few million years!
