review/summary: Good Readreview/text: This book was a good read for sure. Makes you think about who "your" five people will be that you meet in heaven. Great price as well...bought because it was Amazon's daily book deal. However, I would love it if Amazon offered book lending to people that own an iPad. I pay for "prime", so I feel I should get all the perks even though I don't own a Kindle.
