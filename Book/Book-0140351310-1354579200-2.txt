review/summary: So sweetreview/text: I chose to read this book out of a recommendation from a fond friend in high school, and yet I feel it was written for me. The themes touched upon in the book, although from centuries past, still continue to appeal to the modern day romantic and the unpredictable plot keeps one delighted with every page turn. I highly recommend this book to those in search of an escape from daily toils.
