review/summary: The one that started it for mereview/text: Love the style and writing of Burroughs. A return to the books I read as a child and young adult in the backwood communities and tourist meccas of Northern Canada. Brings back many fond memories and seems to let the imagination flow freely and to another world, or place and time. A wonderful book.
