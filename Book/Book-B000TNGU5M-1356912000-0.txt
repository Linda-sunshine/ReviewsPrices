review/summary: An Incredible Insightreview/text: My teenage daughter had read this book at school about a month ago. She'd been begging me to read it as well. When I was reading it I could hardly wait to turn to the next page. It was absolutely heart-wrenching to &#34;see&#34; what this young man and his father went through at the horrific concentration camps. It allowed the reader to experience them first hand through his eyes. I would highly recommend this book to people from teen years and up. It's an eye opening experience. Have tissues nearby.
