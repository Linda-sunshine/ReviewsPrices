review/summary: For all you saying, "It's not an anit-war novel," you're right.review/text: Many of the bad reviews seem to be from disappointed customers who heard this book lauded as an anti-war novel and, after reading, felt cheated because that was not the case. And to this I say, yes. You are correct.To understand this book, you have to read the first chapter, which (though unrelated to the plot of the rest of the story) explains why the novel was written. Vonnegut wrote the story because he was sick of hearing "war novels" that romanticized, overglorified, or hyperbolized war. He was trying to show how boring, nonsensical, and pointless war is, and he did that through a book that is (in the best way) boring, nonsensical, and pointless.If you're reading this book for the plot, I'll concede, it can be a little bland at times, and if you read it with the wrong expectations it seems juvenile, but overall I thought it was an impressive, well executed, and unique piece of literature.
