review/summary: Gods and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings - no 1review/text: This is the first book in this series of five books. I am part way through no 4. The story is fast moving and totally captivating. I couldn't put it down. I totally recommend this book and will look at reading others written by her. This was the first time I had read anything by Lynn Austin. She was recommended to me and I glad they did.
