review/summary: A classic, still relevant and GOOD!review/text: Everyone like C.S. Lewis. In this work he covers the basics of Christianity in depth. I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in exploring Christianity as a possible &#34;religion&#34;, and to anyone who has already embraced this faith and would like to have a better understanding of it.
