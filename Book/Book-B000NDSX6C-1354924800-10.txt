review/summary: Tinyreview/text: I had no idea the text in this book would be so tiny. I guess I didn't really know what the description of &#34;Pocket Edition&#34; really means: Microscopic text. I need something that can actually read by a family member who does not have the eyesight of a teenager, so this book is worthless to me. Yet I don't need the hassle of returning it, so I'm probably just out $15. That's the downfall of buy online, I guess. A warning about small text would be appropriate for books with unusually tiny text.
