review/summary: Disappointingreview/text: As a non-native speaker, I had meant to read this book for years. I had very high expectations, but found myself utterly disappointed. I don't really understand why this book has become so famous. First, rather than being a story on racial discrimination and moral injustice in the South(as advertised on my edition of the book), it's really a sequence of different stories/events in the life of a 10 years old, that develops rather slowly. The title itself is little revealing. Even after who knows how many pages into the book, I did not fully grasp the main story line or point about the book - I kept on reading, hoping that it would eventually reveal itself, but it never did. Instead, it seems to be a loose narrative of different events in the life of a 10-years old , and none of the stories are really brought to an end or illuminated/analysed from a moral standpoint. Everything was just too obvious and cliche-ridden. Second, it was poorly written and bar of any signs of great literature that would deserve the Pulitzer Price. Someone just please explain this to me.
