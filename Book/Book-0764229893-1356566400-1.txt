review/summary: Gods and Kingsreview/text: OT history written in story style with dialogue. Character developmentFleshes out people to be more real than just historical figure.Not sure all is 100% accurate but makes the reading more captivating.I would recommend this book with reservations. Let the reader bewarethe book in not biblical but based on the Bible.For that reason I give it 4 stars, not 5.
