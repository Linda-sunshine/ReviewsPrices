review/summary: Huck Finnreview/text: A great read! Hard to believe it took me until now (age 48) to read it! I have heard many say that they believe it is a racist book but I disagree. Yes, there are slaves in the book and they are referred to with the "N" word. That is just the way it was back then and it was common to speak that way and refer to slaves that way. Throughout the book, however, they were not referred to in a disparaging way and the friendship and even love between Huck and Jim is evident throughout the book.
