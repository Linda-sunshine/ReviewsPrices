review/summary: Fantastic book, decent productreview/text: I'm not even going to review the book. If you want to know whether or not the book is good, don't bother. Just read it. The printing job on the book was decent for the most part, although I found a few places where the ink was smudged but still legible. This didn't bother me though, as it was only one or two pages in the whole book and it didn't mar my enjoyment of one of my favorite books of all time. Seriously, if you haven't read this book yet, just buy this book. $10 is worth this integral cultural experience. Even if you don't like it, you should still read it. It's a good experience, and should get you thinking at the end.
