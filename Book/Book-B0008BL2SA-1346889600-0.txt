review/summary: Little Womenreview/text: Little Women is certainly a classic that I shall enjoy now reading to my great granddaughter. The book contains so many of life's lessons to share with our loved ones and these lessons do not change with the ongoing years. I will enjoy sharing this book many times with my grandchildren.I can still remember so many of the adventures of this family from the first time I read it at the age of 10 years.Little WomenMary Bridgewater
