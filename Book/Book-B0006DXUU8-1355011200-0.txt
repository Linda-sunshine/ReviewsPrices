review/summary: A Beautifully Illustrated Version of a Timeless Classic!review/text: This e published version of "A Christmas Carol" is beautifully illustrated and an absolute joy to read. This is the first time I read this book. I expected a revision of Hollywood's version of this story. Obviously, no movie can do justice to any book or novel; this book is no exception. What is excellent about this version is that it gives a brief history of the historical background that Dickens' wrote his work in and the history of this timeless classic. There may be a minor ( and I mean minor issue) on two of the illustrations: Bob Cratchit carrying Tiny Tim on his shoulders and Scrooge raising his salary. The Kindle Fire version of all the illustrations are recreated perfectly. They are partially duplicated on the top third portion and look like the top third of the illustration is above the the whole of the image in the Kindle 3G Keyboard version. I think that the publisher should look into this. This is no reason to avoid purchasing this version. Again, this version is excellent!
