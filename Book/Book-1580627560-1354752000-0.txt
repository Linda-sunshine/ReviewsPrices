review/summary: "B" is for "Beautiful!"review/text: It turns out that the women in "Why Men Love Bitches" are not "Bitches" at all. Rather they are women who have rich, full lives, filled with passion. They follow their instincts, express themselves fully and have loving relationships with men without losing themselves in the process. There are also vivid descriptions of women who put their lives on hold when in romantic relationships with men; canceling plans with others to be with him, planning the future and putting pressure on the guy to commit. This naturally makes the guy want to run for the hills. Instead, she suggests that a woman can maintain her interests and passions at the same time she's in a relationship. Who wouldn't want to be with someone who loves her life? The "Bitch" in this book is a powerful and passionate woman who knows herself well and has love to share. It's a woman's authenticity and integrity that men love.Authenticity and integrity bring to mind a new favorite book of mine:How to Have A Match Made in HeavenAriel and Shya Kane are relationship experts and their brilliance shows in this powerful book (based on video interviews that can be instantly viewed online) as they interact with people from all walks of life in innovative and inspiring ways. I discovered compassion for myself and others as I read this lovely book. I highly recommend both of these books if you're looking for love...of yourself and others.
