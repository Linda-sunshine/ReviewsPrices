review/summary: Wonderful Collectionreview/text: The three volumes of the Lord of the Rings trilogy are collected into One Volume which Shall Rule Them All. Just kidding about the rule them all part. But the one volume is very well conceived and saves you a buck or two over the individual purchases. And Tolkien writes beautifully still. Sit down with it and enjoy the tale again.
