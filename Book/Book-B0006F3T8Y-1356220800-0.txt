review/summary: Classic - Excellent Lengthy Readreview/text: I read this book as a young girl and thoroughly enjoyed it then. Forty plus years on I enjoyed it just as much if not more the second time round. A book of it's time, very engaging and endearing the story follows four sisters throughout their moral upbringing to womanhood. Lots of lessons are learned by all four of the sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. who all have very different characters. Much laughter, fun and sad times too, the mother is portrayed as a loving, nurturing parent who directs her children through trial, tribulations and turbulent times. I would definitiely recommend for a heart warming story. I read it in abou four long stints, so be prepared to put some time on one side!Denise12/12/23
