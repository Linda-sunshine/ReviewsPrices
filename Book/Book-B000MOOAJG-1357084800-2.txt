review/summary: Interesting readreview/text: Rand's writing style is to cover every issue to the nth detail. While I did read the entire book and did enjoy it, I think her message could have been conveyed in half or even a quarter as many pages without losing any of its impact. I found myself frequently thinking, &#34;Okay, I get it. Let's move on.&#34;A friend described this book as the &#34;conservative's manifesto.&#34; Written 50 years ago but you can practically hear the Republican's quoting from it today.
