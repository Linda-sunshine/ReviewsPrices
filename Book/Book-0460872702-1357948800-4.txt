review/summary: A Layman's Reviewreview/text: The Great Gatsby is a classic and it's considered a masterpiece. I'm not going to pretend I fully grasped the full beauty of this book. I do hope that in the future I will come back to this book and be able to fully appreciate it.With that said, I found this book quite boring. For me, the book didn't pick up till the "car accident" and that's towards the end.Good news is that it's only 170 pages and reads fairly fast. I enjoyed the way the book ended and it made me think about the events that lead up to it all.While it was a worthwhile read, there are a lot of other books I would recommend before this one, just a personal opinion.
