review/summary: Book Review Assignmentreview/text: Author F. Scott Fitzgerald composed his 3rd and most renown novel, The Great Gatsby, when wanting to write a new and exciting book. A romantic tragedy of a man and a women who are in love but life and money gets in the way. Set in the jazz age in Long Island, NY, a man name Gatsby has made him self a fun and exciting persona. Throwing grand parties for people every weekend just so people would like him, but they liked his money more than Gatsby himself. This character he made is fake. He throws parties because he used to be poor and it's the only way to attract the love of his life, the married Daisy, to his home. Daisy is a rich woman and he wants her to leave her spouse,Tom, for him. I would give this book a 3 out of 5 stars. I had read this book a few years ago and did not understand the main theme of the book. This time around I realized the theme was greed, and doing useless things for a spark of pleasure. Fitzgerald who had lived in so many places around the world really understood the hardships of peoples lives during the jazz age. It had a lot of information for 180 pages and is a good book to read when you are over 15 years of age but it can be a little dull at times, or at least for me anyways.
