review/summary: A Whale of a Talereview/text: This was the first time I reread &#34;The Hobbit&#34; in over 20 years. I am a staunch Tolkien fan and I wanted to refresh my memory before seeing &#34;The Hobbit&#34; on the big, 3D, digital screen. It was a pure joy to relive Bilbo's rollicking adventure again...both in print and at the movies. I eagerly await this coming summer's Part 2.
