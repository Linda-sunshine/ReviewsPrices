review/summary: A treasured classicreview/text: I arrived at my first reading of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit after first seeing The Lord of the Rings movies when they premiered, and then I followed that by reading the novels. I guess I'm working backwards.What an enchanting little book this is with a language so lyrical it seems to sing! In fact it does sing at times. And you can't help but love Bilbo and his ever-present need to be back home safe in his hobbit-hole, cradling a good cup of tea.The story format is episodic, which makes sense for an adventure quest and I suspect is also a product of when it was written, but the narrative feeling of "this happens and then this happens and then this happens" disconnects the tale a bit. I'm probably being too nitpicky. The Hobbit is timeless good fun so don't miss out.
