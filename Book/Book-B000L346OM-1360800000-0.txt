review/summary: Looking for the meaning of life? You won't find it here.review/text: More of a personal account of the author's terrible experience as a victim of the Holocaust than a blueprint for living, this popular book is still worth reading.But if you are in a &#34;search for meaning&#34;, you won't find it here. To be fair, Frankl never sets out to answer the question, and in fact proposes that each individual must answer it on their own, for themselves.Frankl's position seems to be very similar to those of people like Albert Camus: that despite man's incessant search, there is no inherent meaning in life. Frankl differs in his response to this reality from people like Camus in that his solution to the meaninglessness of life is to create meaning on our own, based on our own interests and experiences. For Frankl this meant identifying with human suffering and helping others to find individual meaning. For me at least, it's hardly enough.Of course there are no easy answers, and that is precisely the point.
