review/summary: The basis of the story opens up many concerns on FREEDOM of CHOICE.review/text: The Giver was recommended to me by my granddaughter as her favorite book. I found the early chapters a bit confusing as to how the community structure was evolving in such a foreign way. It mystified me if this story was a human, animal, or unknown species. As the story unfolded I felt for young readers could be frightened or mislead by the structure and rules of the community, on how the community tolerated inhumane rules and violations of human dignity perpetrated on all ages. From the killing of young babies, the elderly, and the match making of couples in order to marry, as well as only allowing 2 children per family unit. Where did democracy, freedom, and individual choice disappear to, especially after all the past wars fought to protect FREEDOM for ALL!
