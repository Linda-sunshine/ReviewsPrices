review/summary: The Great American Novel of the 20th Century. Just Glorious.review/text: Atticus Finch is the best role model for a father of any novel I have ever read. He is also the best role model for what a noble,decent and heroic human being would look like in every way that you would measure such a man. It is quite simply one of the most stirring, emotional and thought-provoking novels ever written. And depicted, as seen through the eyes of his children, in brilliant, humorous and touching ways.This is a must read for all who have lost faith in the goodness of the human spirit. A spirit that will live on in literature in the man called Atticus Finch.
