review/summary: This is the work of a twentieth century genius.review/text: Excellent works by definition...held back from public view for so long, by short-sighted &#34;literary cogs,&#34; in the strange wheel of the publishing industry by their very own &#34;elite&#34; society. Not until a tireless mother of the Author, hammering away for years (long after his tragic suicide) does this masterpiece become available for all to enjoy. I discovered it only by means of hearing this very sad story behind the story. It is hilarious and a great deal more!
