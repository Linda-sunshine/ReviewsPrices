review/summary: Oddly action-less thrillerreview/text: Didn't do a whole lot for me. Reacher spends a ton of time in this book walking around, talking to people, just hangin'. Seemed too long, with a lot of padding. Sleep-inducing second act. Nice resolution, I thought, but I felt I like I had waited forever for it. Hope the movie moves a lot quicker...
