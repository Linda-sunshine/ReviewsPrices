review/summary: Havenreview/text: I liked this story mostly because it sort of does leave one hanging. That's the mystery of it. However, I think I like the TV show loosely based on it, better. I bought and read "Colorado Kid" because I wanted to know about the Colorado Kid in the show. At this point, the name and a couple of the characters are all it has in common, but I still like "Haven" better.
