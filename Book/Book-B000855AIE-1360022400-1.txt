review/summary: like a late night info-commercial productreview/text: A very brief pamphlet like product, not a book. There are a few good words here but definitely not what I was expecting or hoping for. The bulk of the pamphlet contains sayings like "be brave for only the brave can be accomplished" etc. This is mostly trivial writing, the stuff of what you heard your high school coach say. You do not need this unless you are five and new to the world of advice. I think this has been repackaged by some marketing firm as an easy way to make a few bucks. They don't deserve to line their pockets with your money too.
