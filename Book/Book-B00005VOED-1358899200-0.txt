review/summary: Remarkable and memorablereview/text: This is like no other book I've read, a farce but with plenty of commentary to insult almost all in our society. One can only imagine what other innovative creations Toole might have given us had he lived longer. This book is NOT a beautiful creation but rather a critical vision of what we are through some hilarious characters the author develops in the book. I highly recommend &#34;A Confederacy of Dunces&#34;.
