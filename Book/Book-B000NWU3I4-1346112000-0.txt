review/summary: Classicreview/text: This graphic novel sets the bar for fantasy literature writers and readers as well. It is a satisfying retelling that weaves a story for the reader to discover and leaves one wanting more without gaping holes in the mythos.Perfect as an introduction for younger readers.
