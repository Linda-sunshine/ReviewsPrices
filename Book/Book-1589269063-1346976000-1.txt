review/summary: Great book!review/text: This book was recommended to me by a friend. I was wondering if it really was going to be a book that I enjoyed and learned a lot from. I ordered it for my Kindle and started reading it and it brought so many new views on love and how we "speak" love. Even though I am not married and this book speaks a lot about marriage, it is still very helpful to anyone in any serious relationship. This will be a book that I will recommend to anyone who is looking for a way to improve their relationship. This is a book that I will be coming back to a lot to remind me exactly what it is that I need to do to keep the love alive in my relationship.
