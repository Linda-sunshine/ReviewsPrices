review/summary: Best gift for weddings!review/text: I buy this by the dozen and give them as wedding gifts w/ a 20$ bill in them. I use the love languages in every relationship I have! I love to know what someone is and then I know how to best to communicate with them. I think it's something everyone should know about and use! I have actually been asked to hold mini-workshops on these in small church groups. It's been really fun!It took me a long time to realize my true language and now that I know, I don't get as offended when someone does something in their love language, and not mine. I'm more aware of how the other person is sharing love. It really helps to know when they are showing appreciation for you, even in small ways.Best book ever!
