review/summary: A new parent's MUST HAVE!review/text: This book was recommended by the hospital at the course we took before our baby was born. The tips in this book have literally given us the tools to help our baby stop crying in record time. She is so content, and has been sleeping wonderfully. We also paired this information with &#34;Baby Wise,&#34; by Gary Ezzo, and at 8 weeks our baby was sleeping 7-9 hours a night! She is a really good baby anyways, but I do feel that the information in these two books have been so very helpful!
