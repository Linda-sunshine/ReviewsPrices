review/summary: Is it salvageable if you met someone and didn't start out playing this game?review/text: If you met someone, and they invited you out with him and his friends and seems very interested in you: Do you think that if I accepted the invite the first three times, that I will have not played by the rules and ruined my chances? I have not initiated anyting, but I wonder if I played too easy to get by accepting these invites. I saw him and his friends Thursday night, and a week later on the next THursday night, then Sunday night. We couldn't stop talking on both those thursday nights and I wish I would have said "oh I have to go" on Thursday night instead of enjoying our conversation so much. Sunday he invited me to a superbowl party and I talked to everyone and not him as much that time. Which makes me think I shouldn't have accepted. He knew I was studying and that I came after half time because I got enough done.What can I do now, based on the rules?: I JUST started reading this book so I have no idea. This guy is recently unengaged, so I don't think this guy is pursuing me, but I do think he is attracted to me and interested in me--so it's a unique situation where I don't expect him/want him to start with dating. He is healing, and I am healing, and it's just a friendship for now. He does seem like the type to believe in the male being the pursuer.My main question is: if I maybe was a little too eager to accept, is it fixable? SHould I try to drop something into the conversation that says something along the lines of "right now I really like just hanging out with friends and meeting new people, which is why I go out with you and your friends and am doing the same with my other friends, but I'm not interested in dating right now."....is that a good way for me to play hard to get and cover my tracks? I want to back track a little.
