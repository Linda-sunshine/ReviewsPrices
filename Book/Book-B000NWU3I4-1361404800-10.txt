review/summary: The Kindle version is CRAP!!!review/text: If you're looking for annotations like what is in the book, dont buy this. There are none except for what you see in the preview. The book has some illustrations by Tolkein but that's it. There are audio links of Tolkien speaking some poems and such, but on the Kindle Fire, they don't work either. This book is just another copy of the Hobbit with some additional background of how the story came to be and nothing else.
