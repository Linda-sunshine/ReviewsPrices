review/summary: Great book for everyone!review/text: Alice in Wonderland is an all time classic story! The tale of Alice and her first adventure to Wonderland, it's just spectacular. The characters are memorable, the story is interesting, and it's a great read for adults and kids alike. If you're looking for something old--in some cases something new to read--check out this timeless tale. If you like The Adventure Down The Wishing Well, By: Jason F. Mihalak, then this is definitely something I would recommend too!
