review/summary: Great book and wonderful insight to what is important in life.review/text: Viktor Frankl is a Phychologist and Jew which gives him an amazing insight into Hitler's Death camps during WWII as he tells of his first hand experiences. This is a great book for those who are interested in learning more about the human spirit and how it reacts to such extreme conditions and despair.
