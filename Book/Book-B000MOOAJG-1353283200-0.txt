review/summary: Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Randreview/text: This book, separated into three parts, is three books under one cover. It is very long but worth reading.A descriptive writer, Rand describes everything, literally everything. In addition to what her characters are saying, Rand writes what they are thinking and why they think as they do and why they do what they did. She keeps you interested throughout, even though it is tedious to read at times because of the length.What happens in this book is what could happen in the United States unless people come to realize nothing is free, you should work for a living and the majority of jobs come from big business.Ignorance by choice in the US is frightening and appalling. If the people continue to be easily lead and believe everything they hear without listening to facts, we are doomed. If they continue to hate big business and the rich who worked to become wealthy and employ thousands of people, they will regret it in the end.If the government continues as it is, what happens in Atlas Shrugged could happen in the US and the people will be the ones who suffer in the long run, because of their lack of interest and looking for a free handout or drug fix.Read this book, you will learn something. Part 1 and Part 2 are movies but the book is better. Park 3 will be a movie also.
