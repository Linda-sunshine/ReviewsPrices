review/summary: Opened my eyesreview/text: Throughout the book, references are made to the macro and micro workings of this "organism" that love is. These concepts truly incorporate the inner essence that married and single people "ought" to know by putting phrases in plain language anyone can translate and understand. The 5 Languages is a awesome concept, something that can be embraced by anyone of any background ANYWHERE.
