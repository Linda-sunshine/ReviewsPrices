review/summary: Interesting bookreview/text: I liked the first part of the book describing some of the author's experience in the WWII concentration camps. It would have been good if that same topic continued throughout. The textbook in the second half reminded me of my college career. Not pleasureable reading, but having the author's philosophy spoon fed with the expectation that it will be digested and accepted. In my retirement, I am not interested in scholarly philosophies, I read for curiosity and self-fulfilment.
