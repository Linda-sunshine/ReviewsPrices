review/summary: Was in great shape.review/text: Came quickly and just in time for my moms birthday. Considering most people have probably read this masterpiece, I'm just going to review the quality of the hardcover itself. It is well done. My mom didn't wanna read her first edition anymore as she was afraid it would fall apart. Perfect substitute if I do say so myself!
