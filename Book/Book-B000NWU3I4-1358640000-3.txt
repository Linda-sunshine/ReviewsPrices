review/summary: A lifetime love affair with Tolkiens booksreview/text: Over the years (lots and lots of them) I have read this book numerous times. It never gets old or stale. I seem to always take something new away from it. I would reocommend this be read first and then continue on with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. If you love a good story with interesting and lovable (or hateable) chracters then thiese books are a must read.
