review/summary: Expect the unexpectedreview/text: This is the fourth in the Jack Reacher series and Lee Child continues to develop the character. The irony was that while reading this book I saw the promo of the new movie &#34;jack Reacher&#34;. In this book Jack Reacher recalls that there came a time when he walked down the streets and he had become an intimidating &#34;scary guy&#34; that everyone avoided. The Jack Reacher in the series is a big guy, tall and heavy set. I can't believe they selected one of the world's puniest actors to play his role in the movie ... Tom Cruise. Go figure. The Visitor is a smokes and mirror book. Without giving away the plot it suffices to say that Lee Child has created many blind alleys which he takes the reader down before a final twist. It is a good read. I can't wait for the next Jack Reacher novel.
