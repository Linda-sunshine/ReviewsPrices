review/summary: Amazing!review/text: My expectations for this book were high, and I was not disappointed. From the time I picked this book up, I could not put it down. I rushed through it and was disappointed I hadn't picked up the second as well.Scott Westerfeld tells the tale of Tally, an ugly that wants to be pretty. She has wanted to be pretty for so long, and see's nothing wrong with it. The life of a pretty is easy. There is nothing to worry about except what parties your invited to. Who wouldn't want that? Her operation is approaching fast, and soon she will get her dream granted. Then, she meets Shay, and she suddenly she doesn't know what to think anymore.The plot takes you for loops and whirls, and there is never a slow moment.The characters are all interesting, even Peris- her friend who is a pretty. Actually, I liked him a lot. He wasn't in the book much, or even very important, but still. Through out the whole book, there were some funny moments and some heartfelt moments. Everything moved very quickly. Most books drag out the "chase" but not this one! It was actually refreshing. There's not much to say about the writing style. It is very simple and nothing special, but still it's captivating.There is so much content contained within the 400 pages, it ridiculous.And that ending! It was having me hit myself.
