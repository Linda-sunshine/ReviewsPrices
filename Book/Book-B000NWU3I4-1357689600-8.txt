review/summary: Classicreview/text: As everyone knows, this is an absolute classic and a good place to start for beginners and veteran readers alike. It is especially nice to see the forward where Tolkin kindly reminds the teachers to boy try and read anything into the book - it is for enjoyment only, not dissection.
