review/summary: Goodreview/text: "Fahrenheit 451" is set in a time where reading books is strictly forbidden. In this world, instead of putting out fires and keeping people safe, firefighters burn entire houses containing books, and occasionally even people. One of these firefighters, Guy Montag, has doubts about the whole situation, and those doubts are strengthened when he meets a freethinking girl by the name of Clarisse McClellan. The major themes in this book include the value of intelligence and human interaction. I would suggest everyone read this book at least once, to help understand why it is important to attain knowledge and break free from ignorance. I overall liked this book, and would give it a 4/5
