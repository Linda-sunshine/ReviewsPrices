review/summary: A Novel that Demands Respect, but...review/text: "Dracula" has to be read because it's the definitive item in terms of vampire fiction. It pretty much gave birth to the genre, and for that reason at least it demands respect.But, in short, and putting all literary pretension to one side; the meandering plot told as phlegmatic diary entries from umpteen different perspectives and the dawdling pace at which the now overly-familiar (to a modern reader) events unfold make this a crushing bore of a gothic novel.
