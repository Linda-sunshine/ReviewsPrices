review/summary: Highly recommended book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!review/text: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic book!! When I read this book I didn't know how I read without Harry Potter! Now I am done with the series. In the Sorcerer's Stone, Rowling introduces the characters well and wrote the book even better. I don't know how people lived without Harry Potter and I think you should start with this book. Rowling puts clues all over the book and makes exciting parts when you think nothing is going to happen. This book is fabulous and one of a kind (until you get to the next). -TRS,8
