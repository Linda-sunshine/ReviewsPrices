review/summary: Inspiringreview/text: A must read. Her way of telling her narrative tied together what God had been doing in her life up until the time of the Nazi occupation and after. Each season of her life from childhood to adulthood made sense as she was going through this horrific ordeal. I will be reading this with my children as a reminder that we really don't know what God is preparing us for but we do know that God is totally faithful and will provide. Thankful.
