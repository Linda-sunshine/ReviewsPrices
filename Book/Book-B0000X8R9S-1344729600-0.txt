review/summary: Was great when I was a kid and it's still great as an adultreview/text: This was one of the few required reading books I actually enjoyed when I was a young student. It had been so long since I first read it (15-20 years?) that the only thing I remembered about it was how much I liked it. When I recently purchased it again to read on my Kindle I was worried that I wouldn't like it as an adult and I'd spoil my memories of it. That didn't even come close to happening, this book is still great. In fact, I'm tempted to read some of the other Brian Robeson book that Paulsen has written. This is a great read for anyone.
