review/summary: Not as good as I had hopedreview/text: This book is obviously a classic and easy to read. However, the amount of characters is too much to follow and also the author sometimes doesn't let the reader know when a different character is speaking. Which made it a bit frustrating fir the first couple if chapters. Also, I did not feel attached to the characters. Their emotions were held back through the whole book, so when Darcy and Elizabeth finally get together it is not as exciting and heart wrenching as it should be.
