review/summary: Is there a God?review/text: I'm atheist and read this based on a friend's recommendation. I had just finished 'Godless' by Dan Barker, a former evangelist turned atheist and I was told to read this from a former atheist turned Christian. It was presented as 'here's some facts that led this atheist to believe in God' when in fact it's just a feel-good book with no real relevant facts or revelation. Certainly it isn't on par with the arguments made by Barker in his book. I wasted my money.
