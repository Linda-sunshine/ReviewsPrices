review/summary: Even good relationships get better!review/text: I am not married, but have been with my boyfriend for 5 years. We already had a great relationship and this book was still valuable. As you are reading, the information seems completely logical and not at all ground breaking... however, it's often the things right under our noses that we don't pay attention to.After reading the book, my boyfriend and I both took the quiz at the back which helps you determine your love language. I learned that the language most valuable to him (physical touch) is the hardest one for me. I wasn't terribly surprised, but had never really thought about it. I absolutely notice a difference when I am stepping out of my comfort zone and paying attention to his language.The principles in this book are fun because the changes in behavior are immediate... and I know how much people love instant gratification!
