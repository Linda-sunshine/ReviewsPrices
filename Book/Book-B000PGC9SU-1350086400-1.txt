review/summary: What a fantastic insight into a fantastic man!review/text: I'll make this short. Benjamin Franklin is a hoot. He's hilarious. Althought this book is short and unfinished, he is an exceptional writer and plays on his ability to fascinate the mind of the reader extricating the right amount of concern and appeal desired. There are a few parts, primarily his 13 virtues, that I believe are good to really chew down on; i.e. his striving to achieve personal discipline. He also mentions other great books that he has read that should also give you a few good reads. Enjoy. You won't be disappointed.
