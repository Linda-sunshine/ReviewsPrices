review/summary: Extraordinary!review/text: It is amazing that the themes of a novel written in the early 1800's are still relevant in current time. This story speaks of cruelty, passion, struggle, friendship and passionate romantic love. Of course, the style of writing is wordy and flowery at times and perhaps overly descriptive, but I loved it! A classic that everybody should read.
