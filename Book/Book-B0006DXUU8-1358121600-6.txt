review/summary: Superb!review/text: Jim Dale does a fantastic job, as usual, narrating this audio book. A Christmas Carol is one of my favorite stories and I am enjoying listening to it told by a true Englishman. If you are not familiar with Jim Dale, he was also &#34;voice&#34; for the Harry Potter audio books for which he has won awards. I cannot say whether this audiobook is truly unabridged as I am still listening to it, but so far, so good.
