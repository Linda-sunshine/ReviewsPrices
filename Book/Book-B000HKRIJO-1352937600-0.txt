review/summary: Fantastic Collectionreview/text: What a fantastic collection of books this is! This collection has some of Lewis' best theology as well as some fantastic fiction. My personal favorite is "The Screwtape Letters" which really makes you think as Lewis explores the way a demon may think. Lewis is one of the greatest minds of his time and arguably one of the best fantasy writers ever. I recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys reading quality lit.
