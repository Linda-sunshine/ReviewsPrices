review/summary: A Monster of a Let-down...review/text: I had never read this book before and it's always been on my list of "To Read" since I was in middle school. Then, I got to college and it was a required reading for one of my classes and I was so excited to start reading it. Now, I knew by then that the movie and book had almost nothing in common and that the Monster looked nothing like Karloff's character. But I still expected there to be some creepiness in the book. So I open to the first page......Ummm...okay...so, there's some guy writing letters. Should get to the good stuff anytime soon.The book was a slow read from the get-go. By the time Frankenstein had created the Monster I was forcing myself to read this book because I HAD to read it. I've only ever started and not finished a book once in my life, and if this wasn't a required reading, this book would've been my second. Victor's narration of this story is so uninspired and down right boring most of the time.The ONLY reason that I gave this book a 2-star rating was because of the Monster's narration in the story. By that time, the book was 2/3 of the way done, so I figured the rest of the book would be a little more fast-paced. I was wrong. After the few chapters of the Monster's story, the book went right back to the pace it began with.The ending wasn't the worst ending out there, but it still didn't give this book any redeeming factors.I was surprised by this book, but in a bad way. For a book that got so much acclaim over the years I just didn't see it here. Maybe it's because of when the book was written and how books like this were written back then. I'm not sure. But this book was a very large let-down, and that's sad because this book I had been looking forward to read for years and I was largely disappointed in the end. Don't read this unless you have to. Otherwise, it's not worth it. Watch the movie.
