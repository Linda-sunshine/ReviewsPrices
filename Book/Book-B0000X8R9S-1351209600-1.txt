review/summary: The Wildernessreview/text: This story is about a boy named Brian that is stranded in the Canadian wilderness. He was riding in a bush plane with a pilot. Brian could not stop thinking about his mom and dad's divorce, so the pilot let him fly the plane. The pilot taught Brian all about the plane controllers and how to fly the plane. A few minutes later the pilot had a tragedy. I think this story is really good because it has a lot of detail of all the things what Brian ate, how he fought through all those days, and how he built a shelter. I felt so sad when he was stranded all alone in the Canadian wilderness, but I liked this book because it was so exciting, i would recommend this book.
