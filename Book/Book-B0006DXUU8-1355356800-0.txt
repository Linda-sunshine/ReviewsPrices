review/summary: The most glorious story everreview/text: Since I was a child I've read this story every Christmas season and it never gets old. Regardless of what medium it's told in it will forever be a classic. Even if you've seen the movies or plays or listened to the radio dramas, this book should be read by anyone who loves Christmas. And for those of you that don't love Christmas, this book should certainly change your heart and mind lest you suffer the end Old Scrooge may have suffered!!! Merry Christmas and ..."as Tiny Tim observed, God bless us..every one!"
