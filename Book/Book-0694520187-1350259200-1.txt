review/summary: A Classic Adventurereview/text: I read "Moby Dick" to my four children at night time. When I was tired of reading, I hit the play button and let Audible read it to them.The vivid decriptions of the sailors life at sea made my children thankful for a warm and cozy home. As the main characters of the book speculated upon their place in this world, so did my children. My boys dreamed of going to sea to finish the job that Captain Ahab could not and my little girl dreamed of helping the sailors who were hurt by the great white whale.At first they viewed Moby Dick as a ruthless whale attacking innocent sailors. Later, they saw that the ruthlessness belonged to Captain Ahab and his yearning to kill the great while whale at whatever the cost including his own life and the life of his men.This opened the door to our talks regarding "good stewardship" as we discussed the gifts God has given to us and how we might use them in a way pleasing to Him. In the end, they had a view of Captain Ahab that was more in line with the character portrayed in the novel... he was a vicious man whose base human instincts were malignant and evil.A very good read but much explaining for a parent to do with his/her children.
