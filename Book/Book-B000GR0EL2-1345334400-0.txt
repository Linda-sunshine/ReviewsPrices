review/summary: An inspirational book!!!review/text: The Hiding Place is the remarkable story of a woman's walk with God while going through the horrors of World War II. After her home country of Holland was invaded by Germany, Corrie Ten Boom took on the dangerous task of helping Jews. Even after she was arrested and placed in concentration camps, her faith in God still remained. This book shows us how she battled loving those who persecuted her. Her love for God through all her experiences is what makes her story inspiring and extraordinary. Corrie Ten Boom's faith is what true Christian faith should look like. I highly recommend this book!
