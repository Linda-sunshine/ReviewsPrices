review/summary: Intriguing and Still Relevantreview/text: Bradbury considered this novel his best work -- identifying himself on his tombstone as the author of Fahrenheit 451. It is an intriguing piece of work, though more fable than novel. Bradbury, like Dick, was never one to develop great characters, though his dialogue is a lot better than Dick's. And while Bradbury's plots are never as brilliantly convoluted as those of Dick, the imagination and philosophy behind his plots are his strength.Here Bradbury anticipates by 60 years the plugged-in, hyper consumerism of our present society. Books and ideas are abandoned voluntarily - first the books are condensed, then outlined, then just not read at all. And finally society as a whole mobilizes against the perceived snobbery and divisiveness of intellectuals, resulting in organized bookburning. In the background is a commitment to a permanent state of war with other countries.Like the interrogator of the hero in 1984, the chief book burner who tries to keep Bradbury's book-burning hero on the straight and narrow is one of the most interesting characters in the book. One gets the impression that he's an intellectual who has recovered from his heresy with a vengeance. Also interesting is the character of Clarisse, who first persuades the hero to ask questions about his life. I wish that character had been better developed.This is a very good book, though it has a truncated feel. The novel would have benefitted from expanding the characters and from giving a better feel for day-to-day life in this imagined future dystopia.
