review/summary: Kid's; This is the First Hunger Games. Sci-Fi at it's Bestreview/text: This right here, was an epic read.The writing was flawless. The plot spoke to me; about the way we must look after our planet and to accept ourselves as who we are and what we look like.Tally - I think - is a great Heroin. She is a determent girl that tries her best; even when things don't go well for her. But I honestly didn't like the way she betrayed her friends.
