review/summary: The best way to start a great Seriesreview/text: This mayy not get a five in my eyes but it is great. I think this is the secoond best book in the saga next to Fang. This book is about a girl named Maximum/Max who was raised in a lab/The SCHOOL. After escaping her and her frinds Fly away drom the school. Thats right i sais flyas in kids that have winds. Well back to the story. they leav and move into a place called W. and they live happly ever after. NOT. they all get depressed in the later books and all but Max Fang and Dylin who is aclone of her and her boy friend who comws in at book 6. well so that group of 3 they are the only people who live in the world and everyone esle dies. all out this is the best book besides fang Ever READ THIS BOOK OR MAX WILL BE SAD AND YOU DONT WANT TO SEE A SAD BIRDKID
