review/summary: This is one of the most important books a married couple could ever find to readreview/text: I ran across this book by accident, while doing an Amazon search for a different book. It appeared under recommendations, so I decided that I'd buy it. It turned out to be one of the most important decisions of my like. Prior to reading this book, I never gave it so much as a thought that each person in a relationship, be it marriage or otherwise, has their own unique way of looking at the world. If your partner and you are not in tune with what is meaningful to each of you, it will be difficult to sustain a long-term, satisfying relationship. After reading this book, I have a totally new outlook on marriage and relationships in general. It's important to know the love language of your partner because it may be completely different than yours. Effective relationships require not only a mutual respect for one another, but a deeper understanding of what your partner finds important and what they find unimportant. After reading this book, I realized that many of the things that were important to me, weren't to my wife and vice versa. Now that we realize that each of us has their own love language, an already wonderful marriage has become even better. I believe that this book should be required reading for anyone in a serious relationship. It will have a profoundly positive effect on your life and the life of your partner.
