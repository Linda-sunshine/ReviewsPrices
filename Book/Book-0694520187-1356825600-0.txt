review/summary: Moby Dick, a whale of a novel!review/text: Moby Dick...I finally finished it! (one grueling month later). But seriously it was totally worth it. This is a fantastic story about revenge, the follies of man, and the inevitable shadow of fate. The only downside to this novel is Melville's extreme use of confusing diction. Sometimes adding twenty adjectives to a simple sentence or over describing an unembellished setting makes it arduous to follow. But the incredible story makes up for this measly flaw.The story touches greatly on symbolism and imagery that enhances the novel's purpose. For example, Captain Ahab's ship, The Pequod, represents doom. The ship's name even comes from a Native American tribe that vanished off the face of the earth after being attacked by white settlers. The ship is also decorated with objects relating to death; which include whale bones and teeth. Not to mention the boat's painted with a dark black.As acknowledged before, the diction in this book is more than prevalent; which sets the foundation for excellent imagery. The description of Father Mable when Ishmael listens to his sermon in New Bedford to the final pages of the climatical battle of Moby Dick conjures a movie inside your head. Everything seems real and looks as if it's happening in front of your eyes. Herman Melville entices the reader with his exquisite form of imagery.This book offers something for everyone. Whether its the incredible story for those enjoyable raconteurs or the author's unique style for the literature fanatics. Moby Dick is a novel that will last for centuries to com and will never lose its literary merit.
