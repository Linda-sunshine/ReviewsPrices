review/summary: Interesting, but not what I expectedreview/text: I have seen a few Stephen King movies and I love the "Haven" series based on the Colorado Kid so I figured I would read the book. I would have to say the series is loosely based on the story; the book tells about who the Colorado Kid was and possibly how he ended up in Maine, with a lot of speculation and what if? compared to the series which is more about the character Audrey and how she helps the "troubled"--not mentioned in the Colorado Kid. A good read, just not what I expected based on the "Haven" series.
