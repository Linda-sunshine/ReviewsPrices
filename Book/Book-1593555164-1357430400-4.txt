review/summary: Good, but Not Greatreview/text: I chose this novel because I've enjoyed previous Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child.I felt much of the descriptions were too long and drawn out and seemed to be just filler to lengthen the novel. Chapters are too long for most busy, working readers to pause reading conveniently. Otherwise the story line is interesting and worth reading.
