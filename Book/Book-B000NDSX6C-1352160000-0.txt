review/summary: Pleasing to the ear...review/text: I purchased this audio edition to bolster slow readers; it is pleasing to the ear. The voice actor is smooth and makes great character transitions; he is obviously practiced at his craft and has a very even pacing. He is British; this helps with class explanations of grammar and pronunciation.Typical of any CD audio edition, breaks on the CD are "random" at approximately 3 minutes; chapter tracks are NOT labeled. This necessitated listening to each track beginning to identify tracks for chapter listening; fortunately, chapter breaks are announced and at the beginning of the corresponding track.
