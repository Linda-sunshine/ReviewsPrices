review/summary: Perfect Dystopianreview/text: This is a series made up of 4 books about a society obsessed with beauty, and is on the top of my list. What makes this one great is the fact that on the outside this future seems kind of perfect. Everyone is beautiful and there is no more poverty, but there is a price to perfection. Tally and Shay go on the adventure of their lives and discover a dark secret that brings their perfect world crashing down. This book, along with many dystopian books, is perfect for girls and boys because of the action and adventure along with a bit a light romance.
