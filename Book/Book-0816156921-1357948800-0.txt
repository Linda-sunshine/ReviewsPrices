review/summary: My favorite all-time bookreview/text: I have this book in hard back cover and cherish it much. I was excited when my husband surprised me with a Kindle Fire for Christmas. I was elated when I discovered this book on the Kindle, mind you I much prefer the original book cover, but I already own the hard back book, but this copy is great!
