review/summary: A perfect inventionreview/text: What a lot of people fail to realize about the Harry Potter series, is not only the brilliant creativity and thought J.K. Rowling poured into these books but the fact that her literacy is magnificent. She really can write, she isn't just creative. It truly takes a brilliant mind to create an entire new world, with its own history and set of rules, and races and creatures. Granted, not all of it is original, but a great deal is, whatever isn't recreated or enhanced to her own liking. This series did not get famous for no reason.
