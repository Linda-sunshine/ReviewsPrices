review/summary: Not Exactly What You Think You Knowreview/text: As part of my Halloween month of October creepfest, I thought I'd read Frankenstein. I read Dracula earlier this year and it wasn't at all what I thought. Frankenstein, similarly, had very little to do with the films. While there are vague connections, the blind man, the murders and executions, the book was significantly different. First of all, this is a Victorian novel. The prose style is refined and sophisticated. Frankenstein is French living in the Swiss Alps. He is also a young college student when he creates the monster. He neither creates a bride for the monster nor does he celebrate his achievement of animating dead tissue. No castle in Bavaria nor lightning nor creepy assistant. Just a romantic young scholar obsessed with the secrets of nature.The book has a comic edge. The monster, rejected by his maker, goes off to live in a village where he hides and simply observes peasants living. He learns to speak by listening to them. He also learns human kindness and dignity. When he reveals himself and is rejected by them, he seeks out his maker and tells his tale. Somehow, he speaks better than Frankenstein. The dialogue Shelly gives the monster would be a stretch for a character purported to have doctoral level studies in the liberal arts. He is so sophisticated that he recognized man's search for meaning and the significance of a mate and asks Frankenstein to create him a mate. To the extend that the monster's dialogue is comical, this book is something of a real, vintage Price and Prejudice and Zombies, though unintentional.I wouldn't give the book away, but the story begins and ends in the Arctic - not the mountains of Eastern Europe. And the scenes take us from Geneva to Ireland to Arctic Russia and beyond. Nicely written, though dated in it's Victorian style, and a fast, fun, creepy Halloween read.
