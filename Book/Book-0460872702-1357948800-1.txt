review/summary: Good book, fun readreview/text: I read this back in high school and I wanted to revisit it now that I could read it leisurely instead of being under deadlines to read so many chapters in so many nights. The book is so much better for me now that I am older. I enjoy the story and the writing style and the development of the characters. There are certain insights that I have now that I was not even aware of 10 years ago when I was in school. Good book, quick read, definitely recommend.
