review/summary: Frankensteinreview/text: I found the story Frankenstein a pretty dark story. It was totally different of a tale than I had expected. My impression of the book Frankenstein was based on &#34;The Munsters&#34; show with the green dark haired giant with screws holding his head on. In the book you don't get that vision of him.
