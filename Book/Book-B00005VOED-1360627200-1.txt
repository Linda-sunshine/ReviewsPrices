review/summary: Overratedreview/text: First things first. Unlike other readers I do not abhor this book, but neither do I think it's the masterful satiric comedy almost everybody thinks is, including the Pulitzer comitee (I found myself smiling a lot throughout the book, but It didn't manage to make me raise a single laughter). Also, unlike other readers, I never start a book expecting to "relate" to the characters, plot or story, I'm quite comfortable with obnoxious, unpleasant, exaggerated, overtly egocentric, misanthropic, homophobic and mysoginous characters, and I'm quite comfortable also with shallow and trivial plots as long as there is great writing behind and a sense of purpose to the book.And that is exactly my biggest issue with the book, I felt JKT writing to be somewhat amateurish, like the author tries too hard to be ironic or sardonic, or hilarious, or imaginative, or shocking or even purposely disgusting, but in the end it gives you nothing and you are left with nothing from the read.I totally understand the novel is written in a way to match a satire or farse, even absurdist play, perhaps to mimic Ignatius Reilly obsessions with medieval literature; but in the end it leans a lot less towards Shakespeare, Cervantes and Chaucer and a lot more towards South Park and Family Guy (I'm in no way a big fan of purposely-moronic in-your-face situational humor).I really believe this would have been a good start for a promising author and we will never know how he would have evolved, but as far as this book goes, I don't see where all the reverence comes from.
