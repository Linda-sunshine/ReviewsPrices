review/summary: Great book...review/text: I had wanted to read this book for quite some time now, and I'm glad I finally got the chance to. It is a good piece, which I very much enjoyed. For me, it didn't totally live up to my expectations of it, but I found it very enjoyable to read. And I can't wait to read more of Jane Austen's books...
