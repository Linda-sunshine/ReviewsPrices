review/summary: A Painful, Yet Beautiful, Storyreview/text: Corrie ten Boom' s account of her family's efforts to help and protect Jewish neighbors and the ensuing imprisonment that she and her sister suffered is an amazing testament to the power of their religious faith and commitment. This writing puts the misery of those who endured the prison camps on a very personal level, and I couldn't help but envision myself and my family under those circumstances as I read. Corrie credited her sister with stronger faith than her own, and wrote almost apologetically of what she felt were lapses in her own, yet she continued her selfless work once released from imprisonment, far into old age. I believe it's important that we never forget that era of history, lest we allow history to repeat itself, and Corrie ten Boom' s words pave a road toward remembering.
