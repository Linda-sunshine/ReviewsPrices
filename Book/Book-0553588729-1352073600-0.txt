review/summary: This is for mothers of colicky babiesreview/text: Attention mothers of truly colicky babies: Do not feel like you are a bad mother because you did all of the techniques listed out in this book, along with every other bit of advice you were given, and your little angels still cried...eh hem...I mean SCREAMED all day and all night like mine did. I read this book before my baby girl was born and was a full fledged believer in the fact that "colic" had a cure and even though I was sure my baby wouldn't be colic...if she was, I was ready to cure it with these techniques. This book makes sense, it draws you in, it is logical, and quite frankly one of the most convincing parenting books I've ever read. Unfortunately - if your baby is colic, this book makes you feel like a complete and utter failure. Do you want to know what stopped my precious baby girl from screaming (sometimes)? Bouncing on a large medicine ball in the middle of my kitchen with the oven fan on and the kitchen sink turned on full blast, while holding her in the fetal position. THAT WAS IT! I don't care how IN SHAPE you are (I'm in excellent shape - worked out everyday of my pregnancy) you will not be able to do this forever. After hours of doing this, your back hurts and your arms feel like they will simply fall off.
