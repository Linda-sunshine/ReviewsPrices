review/summary: This is an amazing and scary bookreview/text: I had read this book years ago, and just reread it. It seems like a Twilight Zone post apocalyptic episode where ultra conservative religion factions took over the United States. In this political environment, this book seems to be even more relevant as a worst case scenario. A must read for all!
