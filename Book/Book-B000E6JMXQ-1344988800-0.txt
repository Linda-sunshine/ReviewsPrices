review/summary: Prose and Adventure - Classicreview/text: I was a kid when I first saw the movie and a teenager when I heard a discussion about it and so I knew going into the source material there was no woman and thus no hint of romance; which is fine by me.20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is interesting mix of excessive prose, "pages" worth, detailing underwater life forms and environments, real and - it is sci-fi so - imagined. If you are into marine biology you might appreciate the detailed descriptions of undersea creepy crawlies better than me but I still made my way through them.The other descriptions are rich in detail, it's been a while since I saw the movie so Verne's descriptions of the ship were in my mind's eye and I felt like I knew what it was like to be aboard the Nautilus, in the dormant volcano, walking through the ruins of Atlantis.When it comes to the action scenes they are also descriptive but they move quickly as the crew and passengers battle with various sea monsters and go through the wild maelstrom that may, or may not have, destroyed the beautiful, magical Nautilus.
