review/summary: Great, unadulterated portrait of the essence of Christianityreview/text: If you want know what the true essence of Christianity looks like, this is where you should start. Lewis works from his position as a converted atheist and presents the case for Christianity with enough logic and rationality to appeal to even unbelievers. His tone is conversational, but there is no questioning his intellect when you read his points. Overall an excellent read for both those with questions about Christianity and believers looking to understand their own place in Christ better.
