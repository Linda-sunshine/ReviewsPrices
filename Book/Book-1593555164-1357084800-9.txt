review/summary: Even an older Reacher novel is still #1!review/text: This book,as with most of Lee Child's work, is a stimulating, well written story with terrific characters (especially JR!) and a wonderful, fast, page turning story line that is satisfying, thought provoking, and very entertaining. I have read all of the Reacher novels - this was the second time through One Shot for me. After seeing the trailer and the new movie release, I reread the book to try to confirm my initial very strong feeling that Jack Reacher is not well served by Tom Cruise's portrayal. It worked, big time!(In fairness, I rewatched TC in A Few Good Men and I thought he did a fine job in that role, as well as in Top Gun. But Jack Reacher he ain't!)By the way, the book was just as good the second time through.
