review/summary: A Brutal Readreview/text: I had heard so much about this book that I had to read it to see what all of the fuss was about. First I read Fountainhead and found it interesting, even though it was a bit heavy-handed. I think Fountainhead was a much better book; probably because I could see some depth in the characters and it was the first time I had been exposed to Rand's point of view. Sadly, Rand covers a lot of the same ground with Atlas and the characters in Atlas are one-dimensional. The reader gets to choose from strong,smart, manly heroes (Dagny included) and the smarmy, wimpy, whining losers that make up all of the characters with few exceptions. I understood early on that Government was bad, the Creators were good, and the rest of the people were pawns, but Rand goes over and over and over the same territory. Did I mention that she goes over the same territory again and again?
