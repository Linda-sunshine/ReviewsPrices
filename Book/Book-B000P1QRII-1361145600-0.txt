review/summary: The giverreview/text: I would give the book like a 9 because it is like a saga of books well it is but this is a different kind of text that is hard to understand. I would pick this book for like a project because it is kinda hard to understand. You have to pay close attention to the novel to get a feeling of it in order to understand it.
