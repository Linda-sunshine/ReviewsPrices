review/summary: Still Pertinentreview/text: Although this is quite an old work, it is still relevant for today. For those of us who sometimes question, &#34;what is the meaning of life?&#34;, Frankl gives us thoughts to ponder. Life is more meaningful when one has a passion about something or someone. The different view of the Nazi concentration camps was enlightening for me; the people banded together and protected one another even when the only thing left to them was the prospect of yet another day of suffering. Perhaps finding a passion or reason to live is the solution to depression treatment; perhaps more effective than drug therapies.
