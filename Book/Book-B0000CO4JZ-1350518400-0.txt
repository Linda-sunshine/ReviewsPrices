review/summary: Worth reading.review/text: The ending seems quite abrupt, but that's not necessarily bad. The only thing that annoys me about this book is that the protagonist doesn't seem to have much depth. All of the other characters in the book are much more fleshed-out than the first-person narrator and it bugged me that it felt a bit hollow.Still good though.
