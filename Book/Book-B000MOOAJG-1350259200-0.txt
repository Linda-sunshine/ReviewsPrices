review/summary: Atlas Shrugged: (Centennial Edition)review/text: I am still reading the book and am about 65% through. It seems to describe, sort of, the way our country is headed under Mr Obama. It appears there is no way around a more socilist government with out the complete colapse that the book is showing. I recomend it.
