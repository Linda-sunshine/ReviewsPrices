review/summary: Mehreview/text: This book was ok. I had high expectations for the novel as I'd heard so many positive reviews. It seemed underdeveloped with the characters lacking great depth. Noah was better developed than Allie and I did have a bit of a soft spot for the guy, but I was still underwhelmed. And the last chapter was just plain depressing. Hasn't this guy had enough heartache? I don't think this author is for me.
