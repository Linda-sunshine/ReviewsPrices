review/summary: Great bookreview/text: The book was really good, I think it was better than the movie. I would recommend this book to adolescents or adults. I'm a 13 year old boy, and I saw the movie so I thought I might try the book. It really surprised me that the book was way better than the movie. I loved it and I would read it everywhere and at anytime. I read the book whither my brother and he's nine, and he loved the book. The book is hard to understand but you will figure it out as you keep reading. I hope my review helped you think about what to read next, and if you chose this book I hope you enjoy it.Thank you.
