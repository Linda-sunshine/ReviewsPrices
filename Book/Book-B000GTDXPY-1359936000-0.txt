review/summary: She's kinda ineptreview/text: but still pretty endearing. I do wish Jayne's conversations wouldn't all consist of her asking others a dozen questions without taking a breath, or waiting for an answer. Seriously, what kind of reporter does that? However, her personality is buoyant and the author hints at all kinds of crazy adventures/incidents and accidents in Jayne's past so she's a fun girl to hang out with.
