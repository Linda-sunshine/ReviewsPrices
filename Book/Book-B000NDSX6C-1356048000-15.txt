review/summary: There and Back againreview/text: I have lost track of how many times I read this book in the past 30+ years. It cracks open the door to the great Trilogy in particular and Tolkein in general. Whether adult or child, the moment the round green door opens, you will be lost in a marvelous believable world that that never existed but which you will ardently wish was real. These books will have the longevity of Shakespeare.
