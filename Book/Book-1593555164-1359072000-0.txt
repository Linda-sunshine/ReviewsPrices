review/summary: Jack Reacher, One Shotreview/text: I enjoy Books that deal with War. Korea, Nam, some WW II. and have read many since getting My Kindle. The last was Into the Fire. The personal story of Dakota Meyer induced me to try the book about Jack Reacher whom I learned about through the upcoming Movie, and then researching the book and Author.I was not wrong ! I could not put the book down. Worth Reading. .
