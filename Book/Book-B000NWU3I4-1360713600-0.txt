review/summary: A very old friendreview/text: I first read this as a teenager, set text in school, and fell in love with the myth and adventure that is middle earth. Compared to LOR, this is light, but provides a glimpse into a wonderful and powerful world, were even the awkward and unadventurous can find new dimensions.
