review/summary: A classic and a joy to read every timereview/text: A classic and wonderfully fun. The Hobbit is an easy read, with fun narrative and a great introduction for anyone looking to get into the fantasy genre. I first read this book when I was 8 and have reread it several times. A great book to read as a family!
