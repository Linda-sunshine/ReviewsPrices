review/summary: Who is Uncle Tom? A Christian saintreview/text: I recently read Uncle Tom's Cabin for the first time after hearing remarks in passing on NPR that Uncle Tom was a very different character from the stereotype that currently exists. Harriet Beecher Stowe is an excellent writer. She is vehemently anti-slavery and sprinkles her story with editorial pleas to the reader. But I tried to understand who Uncle Tom was, and found my thoughts evolving as I went along. The book contained characters who were "Uncle Toms" but he was not one of them. At first I thought he was just a simple minded person who "went with the flow." But as the story evolved, I could see that he was more than that. He was kind and thoughtful to whites, and tried to see the best in them. But he was also kind and thoughtful to blacks, and tried to see the best in them as well. He was, I realized, kind and thoughtful to other human beings in general.But as I read further, I came to see that the key to Uncle Tom was his powerful faith in redemption through Christ. He believed that whites, blacks, slaveholders and slaves should reach out and accept the Grace of God through Christ. Interestingly, although Uncle Tom's Cabin is an anti-slavery philippic, Uncle Tom himself does not denounce slavery. He would like to be free, but even more important is the embrace of Christ. Once Christ has been truly embraced, slavery becomes a non-sequitur that fades like mist before Christ's shining light.My view of "Uncle Tom" had undergone quite an interesting conceptual evolution. However, the transfiguration was not yet complete. Thinking further about the course of events, I realized that Uncle Tom was worthy of beatification, if not canonization. His profound faith converted and saved unrepentant sinners who were on the tortuous road to Hell. At the end of the novel, he fell into the clutches of a slaveholder who was the devil incarnate. The devil tempted him as he had tempted Christ in the desert, but here, rather than mastery of the world, the promise was of better treatment (if you become my overseer you can drink whiskey with me and lord over the other slaves.) As with Christ in the wilderness, Uncle Tom replied, "Get thee behind me, Satan!" For this, he was delivered up to Satan's minions where he suffered abuse, torture and death.In death, Uncle Tom imparts his final grace. His injuries were cared for by a slave woman who had been horribly abused by Satan, lost all faith and turned to the path of darkness. She risked her life to do this and in the process rediscovered her faith and her salvation. In effect, she was reborn. The minions who delivered the blows cowered before his grace and were converted, like the Roman soldiers at the foot of the Cross. Finally, Uncle Tom was found on death's door by the son of the kind master who was forced to sell him "down the river" at the beginning of the book. He had come to purchase Uncle Tom back and return him to his slave wife and children, back at home. In Uncle Tom's dying words, this young man came to see that even kindly treatment in slavery is wrong. He freed all the remaining slaves on his return home, and set upon a new path of Christian righteousness.Uncle Tom's Cabin is a remarkable book that can be read and interpreted on many different levels. The book should serve as an important touchstone for discussions of race and religion even today.
