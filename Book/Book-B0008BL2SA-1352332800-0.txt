review/summary: great book about moral characterreview/text: I loved that each of these characters had faults, recognized them and worked through the entire novel to grow and essentially conquer those faults. It is a book that reminds us we can be good and should be good. You feel as though you can sit right at home with the March family and they would welcome you there. Loved it can't believe I've have waited so long to read it!
