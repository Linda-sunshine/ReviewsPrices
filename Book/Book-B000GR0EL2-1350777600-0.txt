review/summary: Amazing bookreview/text: Once I started this book, I could not put it down. It is so hard to imagine the hate and murder people are capable of. The total opposite of Corrie and her family who were such warm, loving, giving and forgiving people. I have learned from Corrie to offer up to God any situation that is out of my control to fix and move on. She makes me want to be a better person. God Bless her
