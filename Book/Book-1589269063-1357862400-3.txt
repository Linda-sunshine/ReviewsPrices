review/summary: If you don't have this book, GET IT!review/text: This is a great book for whoever is in any kind of a relationship. It works well for a romantic relationship but I really think it could apply to all kinds of relationships, sisters, girlfriends, etc. It offers sound and practical advice. It offers tips on things you can do right away, I already tried the requesting-instead-of-demanding tip right after I read it and guess what, it worked! Its crazy how we overlook some things or think of them as trivial but if you implement Dr Chapman's advice, you get instant results, if not long lasting. This book is a must have for everyone. Now I understand why my mom and cousin kept insisting that I needed to read it :-)
