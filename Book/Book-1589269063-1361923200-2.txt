review/summary: Great Book!review/text: A very well written book that makes very great points. There are many great examples as well! It is great for people in relationship as well, not only married couples (although it refers to married couples). I've recently tried the app they have for iphone with weekly challenges they have for you and your partner, which is really entertaining. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone!
