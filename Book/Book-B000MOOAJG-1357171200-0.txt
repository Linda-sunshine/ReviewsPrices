review/summary: This is my first book on Kindle.....review/text: .....and I love the book. Best book I ever read. I have been wanting to read it for years, finally got started on it, and found that it was too heavy to hold and read. (Which is why I bought the Kindle!) My only problem with this Kindle product is the typographical errors all through it. Doesn't anybody proofread these things?
