review/summary: Excellent story with engaging charactersreview/text: This book is very well written with engaging characters. Younger, I had read this in school but wanted to read it again before the movie came out. Little did I think I would be fully drawn into the story and be done reading it within a weeks time.I definitely recommend this book.
