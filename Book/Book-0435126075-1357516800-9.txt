review/summary: Pride and Prejudicereview/text: Wonderful story and loved all the &#34;proper&#34; behavior along with the secret thoughts of a young girl back in the 19th Century. When marriage was the main course for unmarried ladies and how involved the entire family became in order to strive for that objective. I have wanted to read this work for a long time after becoming interested in 19th Century classics, I wasn't disappointed. Lizzie being so bright and level headed was refreshing in comparison to her younger sisters and even with her older sister Jane, the kindest one. The one character, Mr. Darcy was hard to understand his aloofness to the point of being extremely rude just didn't seem to fit at first meeting since later in the book he showed himself to be so totally compassionate and sensitive to Lizzie's trouble's with her younger sister's plight. All's well that end's well, loved the book.
