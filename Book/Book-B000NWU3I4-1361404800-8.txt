review/summary: Fantastic read from someone that never readsreview/text: I don't read a lot of books because I find a lot of my time spent studying for my degree and reading has never excited me much before. However I decided I had to change and sart reading for fun more so I got this book for Christmas. I HAVEN'T PUT IT DOWN SINCE (apart from the first few weeks of class which were hectic)!! It's amazing, the story is fantastic and it's written in such a fantastic style that makes the chapters fly by and allows your imagination to take over as you read through Bilbo's adventure. I can't recommend this book highly enough
