review/summary: Fun, Entertaining Read!review/text: It's not easy to make me laugh, but I did so several times during Calamity Jayne. Tressa, the poor dear, got into so many predicaments. The more she strove to overcome her dumb blonde reputation, the more it caught up with her. On certain occasions, it actually came in handy to pretend she was the ditz most everyone in town believed her to be.Even at the scariest points in the story, I found myself chuckling at the author's turn of phrase.Also enjoyable was the blooming relationship between Tressa and Townsend, the ranger. Faced with the outlandish happenings Tressa kept throwing in his path, it wasn't easy for Townsend to handle both his job and the feisty blonde.I had a great time reading this novel and highly recommend it.Morgan Mandel
