review/summary: Must read.review/text: If you're wondering whether or not you should read this book before the LOTR, it's a must. Gives very useful background info about major characters in LOTR and is in itself entertaining. It starts off kind of slow but quickly speeds up. Well worth the buy, haven't reread it yet but definitely will before the first part of the movie comes out.
