review/summary: Great!review/text: I had never actually read this book, thinking that the drama might be too frustrating for me. However, after recently viewing two different Hollywood adaptations, I decided I needed to read the book and I was not disappointed. Its a great story that doesn't go too heavily on the gothic elements. Jane Eyre is a great character.
