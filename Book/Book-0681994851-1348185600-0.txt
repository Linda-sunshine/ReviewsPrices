review/summary: So you want to read Jane Eyre?review/text: I really liked this book though it took AGES for me to finish it!One of the reasons is that it is every wordy and sometimes I wasn't sure what they where talking about!! If your not very good with words then stay away from this book. The good thing was that I was reading it on my Kindle Touch which has a dictionary on it so I just highlighted the word and it gave me the meaning!!I highly reccomend this book!!!Don't miss out!!
