review/summary: A great story!review/text: Yes, I would highly recommend the book, Hatchet, to everyone. I enjoyed reading the story. Brian was in a plane to go see his dad in Canada when the pilot had a heart attack and died, leaving him alone in the plane, in the air. Brian crashed in the Canadian forest and was stranded. This story is all about how he survived in the wilderness for two and a half months. I think everything in the story was believable. My favorite part was when Brian went through a tornado. I also loved the ending because it made me feel happy. I would like to read this book again because I enjoyed it so much!
