review/summary: Interestingreview/text: I had a little familiarity with this title before I read the book. The story is interesting as a description of a alternative future, based socio-politico issues from yesteryear and continue today. I suppose some people might find the feminism issue thought provoking. As a woman of color, I am generally less struck by the feminism issue, experiencing the racial issue more profoundly anyway, and that society wants to have it all ways, is not surprising to me, as it seemed to be to the Handmaid and expect acceptance and cooperation from the oppressed. Nevertheless, as sci fi, it was an interesting read of a future history that one should beware.
