review/summary: an AUTOBIOGRAPHY!review/text: It is so interesting to read of Benjamin Franklin's life, in his own words! It is not a complete biography, just the parts he chose to write about, but so interesting to read HIS words! It just takes you back two centuries with ease. I had not kown this existed until I stumbled across it on Amazon. If you like US history, you will like this.
