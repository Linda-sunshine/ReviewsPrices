review/summary: Still shocking after all these decadesreview/text: I read this book 30 years ago, and I couldn't believe a Government in total control of people's memories and opinions. It seemed like a very distant and utopian future then...Now I read this book again, and the plot is very - frightening - close to reality. Many of the mind-washing methods are in use today, like campaing promisses and even presidential speeches about &#34;soaring economy&#34;, &#34;record-breaking production&#34;, and even &#34;the sacrifice in our well-beign for a brighter future&#34;...Note: 50 years ago, there was no Internet. Just picture what George Orwell could have written then about our present...
