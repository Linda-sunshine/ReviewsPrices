review/summary: Great book, must read!!review/text: First off, I'm not a literature buff, I just like to read. I happened to come across and read this book. It's now one of my all time favorites. It dark, thought provoking and hard to put down. Bradbury has one amazing imagination, (i.e. the Mechanical Dog) Brilliant.
