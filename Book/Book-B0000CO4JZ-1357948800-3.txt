review/summary: Five Stars for F.Scottreview/text: A grand book. Couldn't put it down with a re-read in mind. I read it in college. We had studied it. On my own, it was very challenging. Gatsby masters the face of an idol. Dedication to Zelda with love is very heart-felt as then the book unfolds. I get a feel for great authors and read with maximum speed. This one was no exception. Hurrah for the twenties! A serious yet talky comical side for F. Scott. A natural!
