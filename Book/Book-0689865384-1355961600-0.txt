review/summary: I need the second book!review/text: Wow! This book was amazing! I thought I knew where the author was going throughout the story, but suddenly he threw in twists I wasn't expecting and they were amazing. The characters had great depth and had something they were fighting for. I love everything about this book. When can I read the next one?
