review/summary: Distopia creates a reader's utopiareview/text: This was my first excursion into the world of distopia. I must say, that it was amazing. My teacher had pressured me to read it, saying I needed to read something beyond the hum drum of my regular readings to challenge myself. When I saw a cheap copy at my local book store, I picked it up. It was amazing.Bradbury does a masterful job of making a world that is so different and almost unimaginable, completely believable. A must read for anyone. With this book, also look into The Martian Chronicles.Also, RIP Bradbury, the world lost one of its best science fiction writers.
