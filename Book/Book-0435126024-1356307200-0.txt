review/summary: Love it as much as I did in high school!review/text: I remember Jane Eyre as one of my favorite books in my Junior Year College-prep English class. I wanted to read it again as I didn't remember many details. I'm just gettting back into it and can't put it down. I might have to re-read Wuthering Heights next.
