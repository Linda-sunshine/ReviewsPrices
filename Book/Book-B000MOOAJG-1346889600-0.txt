review/summary: Atlas Shruggedreview/text: Everyone should read this Conservative Masterpiece!! For those who desire such, it has graphic sex. However, the lessons about Conservative virtues are and continue to be unsurpassed, even after almost 60 years. The story must be equated to methods used by the Russian Soviets, European Socialists, and even the Nazis. Those who are well-educated in the above can, at least, understand why we do not want Socialists (or even liberals) in this country.
