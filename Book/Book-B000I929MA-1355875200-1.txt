review/summary: Just as relevant as when I first read it 15 years agoreview/text: With the rise of fundamentalist extremism in America, it's not difficult to imagine the scenario fictionalized in The Handmaid's Tale. A religious and militant state is a frightening thought, but presented in a very plausible fashion. It is certainly a gripping read, as well as a cautionary tale.
