review/summary: John Carter ..review/text: I don't think the first person narration does the story any justice at all. It would have been a lot better in third person.The actual storyline is choppy in places and is written in a more steampunk rather than classic sci-fi way, but without the use of over the top futuristic languages or objects.I am not overly keen on the style or structure, but enjoy a well spun yarn.I am quite impressed by what producers have been able to deduce and create on to film. They have managed to give an inkling of this authors underrated talent.AVP-UK
