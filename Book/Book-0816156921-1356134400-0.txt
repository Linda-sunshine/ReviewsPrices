review/summary: I found it very drawn outreview/text: I have audible and book. I found it easier to read the book. Maybe it was the actors that put me off. The different voices and acting and over acting changed the feeling of the story. The actual story is good and holds up to todays writing on similar themes.Overall I thought the story was very drawn out, maybe an abridged version would have got to the point sooner.
