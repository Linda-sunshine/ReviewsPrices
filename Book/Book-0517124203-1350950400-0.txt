review/summary: My Freebie is ilustrated, too - Read, People, read!!review/text: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is for most children pure pleasure. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's codes in the text, or debate this or that, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new."There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters, my preferred is the Cat! - fantastical and totally normal creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences.For more than 130 years, children love the delightfully non-moralistic, non-sense, nopn-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education.Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are almost as important as the well-loved story.And for 0,00 Pounds, Dollars, Euros to pay - what can You lose?It is a whole win-win situation!Grab, people, grab!
