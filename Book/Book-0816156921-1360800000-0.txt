review/summary: The best gothic novel.review/text: I chose Bram stokers dracula because I wanted something new; something with the elements of horror , which would give me shills down my spine; and dracula did that. Its mystery and suspence, which enhaces the book, keep going througtout most of the novel, and captivates the reader with its peculiarity. I highly recommend it to any fan of horror novels.
