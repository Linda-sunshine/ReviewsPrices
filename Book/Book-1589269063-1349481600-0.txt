review/summary: Worth readingreview/text: Chapman explains how we can live and love together yet not understand that we don't connect on the same wavelength. By observing that some people touch, others use words, gifts, time, or actions to express devotion the recipient may only receive a different language. It has helped me understand how my girlfriend enjoys having time together but does not value gifts.
