review/summary: Thrilling and well writen classicreview/text: This is actually my first English book that i have read. Even the language is little bit harder to understand in some passages it is actually no bog problem to understand context. Book itself is a masterpiece of thriller, horror and drama. The classy format of diaries, correspondence making feel that you are reading the file of some case is astonishing clever. This book is way to discover history of England/Europe, get thrilled by original story of Dracula and to understand what it mean the word Gentleman.
