review/summary: A whole adventure in a single book!review/text: I think a lot of writers of our age have forgotten that you don't need to write a 1000 page book in a 10 book series to tell an epic story. This books is less than 500 pages and has withstood the test of time. Characters are memorable, plot is excellent, writing is concise and it has the perfect amount of detail.I realize that this books supports a much larger book series (Lord of the Rings), but it could easily have been a stand alone book.
