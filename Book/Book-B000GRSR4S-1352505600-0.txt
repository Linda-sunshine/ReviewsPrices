review/summary: An Outstanding Rule-Breakerreview/text: I had not read this book before, but my grandson selected it to read for his essay assignment and wanted to discuss the book with me. It's clear why this book has become a classic. In one sense it breaks all the rules of writing and sets itself apart. The author has been true to his own vision and shows the reader the fluidity of the mind of a person who has endured shellshock and has post traumatic stress disorder -- the moving in and out of time in what appear to be alternately flashbacks (the war) and hallucinations (abduction by aliens). It further addresses the horror of the Allied bombing of Dresden, Germany, in World War II -- to our shame. I told my grandson to imagine that someone had just knocked on the door and ordered him to go to war. How would he feel? That's the point of view of this book. A young man is conscripted and sent to war. What does he fear? How does he view the daily life of war? Because Kurt Vonnegut was himself a prisoner in the slaughterhouse converted into a prison, his writing is that more realistic about what he witnessed in Dresden through the eyes of his protagonist. Because of the slipping in and out of time, it can be a bit confusing, especially for a young reader, but one adapts to share this amazing journey of memories and discoveries.
