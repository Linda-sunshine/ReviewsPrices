review/summary: Pilgrim's progressreview/text: This is an odd book. I finally read it a month back, and enjoyed it a great deal. I suppose there are two possible interpretations of the plot: a slightly magical interpretation and a mundane one.In either case, the book follows the reminiscences of Billy Pilgrim, who was a hapless young recruit to the US Army in WW2, swiftly becoming a hapless young prisoner of war in Dresden, surviving the firebombing of the city by sheer luck, going home, training as dentist, getting middle aged, and surviving a head injury in a plane crash. From his daughter's viewpoint his head injury unhinges him slightly and makes him have worrying hallucinations about travelling through time. From his viewpoint they aren't hallucinations, and he has always had them: throughout his life he has sometimes, without warning, jumped through time to a different point in his own existence, and then jumped back. Not only that but he has been kidnapped by aliens and kept in a zoo on their home planet. Is Billy right, or is he a damaged and deluded individual? We'll never know.
