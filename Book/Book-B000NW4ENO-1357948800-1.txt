review/summary: Worthy of Its Pulitzerreview/text: Margaret Mitchell clearly captured the heart and view of the Confederacy during and after the Civil War. Her vivid descriptions of people and places make it easy to visualize the story. Her attention to detail and accuracy make GWTW believable window into the lives of 1860s Georgia.Her style of writing is easy to read and lazily draws you back to the Antebellum South until you find yourself an intimate observer of a lifestyle based on an economy of slavery. Mitchell's book doesn't apologize or campaign for the institution, it just presents a picture of what was.I find I revisit Gone With the Wind every ten years or so, and each read brings a new light to a classic novel.
