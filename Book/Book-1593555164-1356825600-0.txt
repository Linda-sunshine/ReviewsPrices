review/summary: Moviereview/text: This was an excellent book. How is the world could Tom Cruise be cast as Jack Reacher. He is NO Jack Reacher...I will not see the movie. Poor choice of an actor to play Reacher. Tom Cruise is nothing like the profile of Reacher you've built in all of your novels. The only people who will enjoy the movie are those who have not read your books. Big mistake.
