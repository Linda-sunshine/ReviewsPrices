review/summary: C.S. Lewis is a man of marked intelligence who is tremendously gifted at teachingreview/text: C.S. Lewis is a man of marked intelligence who is tremendously gifted at teaching. His book, Mere Christianity, is broken into four parts, each discussing a major principle of Christianity. Lewis takes the complexity of the Bible and is able to present its major tenets in a clear and concise way. He uses his reason and intelligence to logically present his arguments and to defend the heart of Christianity.Lewis lays out the precepts of Christianity and describes what Christians believe and why using simple terms and examples. He uses compelling evidence to verify God's existence and uses rational to show that Christianity in fact does make sense and that it is the only truth.Mere Christianity is so thought-provoking and provides a sound defense of the Christian faith. It clarifies many points of questions- such as how to love your neighbor, why Jesus had to die, how Jesus could be both perfectly man and perfectly God, and many more.This is not only a book that you will read, but one which you will take notes, study, pray, and constantly refer to your Bible as you examine many aspects of Christianity. It is a fascinating book that will lead you to the truth. I highly recommend it!
