review/summary: Great book, but kind of a let downreview/text: Having heard about how great this book was several times, I must say I was let down by it in the end. After all the time travel and visits to Tramalfador, I was expecting a big finish in this book, but nothing ever developed. The plot never resolved.Although I found it to be a let down, I was still happy to have read this. Vonnegut provided many laughs throughout, and maybe if I was paying closer attention the whole way I would have gotten more out of this.The key message does seem to be to not fret about the petty things in life. Billy Pilgrim is a crusader when it comes to not letting things get under his skin, in fact, other people actually get upset with his insane ability to not give a hoot.With that being said, I'm sure this book does offer a lot of things to learn from, but overall, I was let down. Still, if you like time travel and space and World War II stories, check this book out.
