review/summary: There and Back Againreview/text: I first read this book in 1996 when was 8 years of age and I was fascinated by the story, characters, and world of Tolkien. 16 years later today, after reading it again, I am greatly impressed with how well written this story is. It is easy to read, funny in parts, and interesting to say the least. What else is there to say, I have never read a novel like unto it. You have to experience the Hobbit for yourself to know how impressed I am with this novel.
