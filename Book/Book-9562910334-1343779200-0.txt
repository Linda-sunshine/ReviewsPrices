review/summary: Definitely a Classicreview/text: Nineteen Eighty-FourBy George OrwellGeorge Orwell creates a world where the government has complete control and even thinking of something that "Big Brother" does not seem worthy is punishable by torture and or death. Big Brother has complete control of the citizens and alters the information people receive so that they blindly follow whatever is put forth to them. The main character, Winston Smith, dares to defy what he is being told and tries to rebel, unfortunately he lives in a society where you cannot trust anyone and Big Brother is always watching you.This is definitely a thought provoking novel of blind faith, and the inner workings of the human psyche. What makes children turn on their own parents? What would you do if you were not even allowed to enjoy intercourse? These are just a couple of the questions that George Orwell brings to mind, I am not sure if we could ever truly know the answers to some of the questions that are posed in this novel and I hope we would never have to find out. It was an interesting book and I am glad I read it. George Orwell was able to capture such a frightening future so realistically some people have begun to believe this story may be prophetic, I myself see it as purely science fiction. This is truly a classic in every sense of the word and I believe it will stand the test of time to scare the daylights out of generations to come.
