review/summary: Jane's Way To Successreview/text: The novel I read "Jane Eyre" was very interesting. Jane Eyre was a little orphanage girl, that lived with a family she did not love. Jane didn't feel as if that was her home. Jane says, "I was like nobody there. If they did not love me, in fact, as little as I did them." There was to main people that had hurt her the most physically and mentally, Master Reed and Mrs. Reed . Master Reed was a cruel young boy. He liked to criticize, make fun of, and hurt Jane. He thought he was the boss and owned everything in the house. In the book it says that Jane was reading a book and he came along and asked, "Why are you touching my stuff? Everything in here will belong to me one day." She responded, "I'm only reading a book." He made her look away and threw the book to her head. Master Reed didn't get in trouble at all, because he was Mrs. Reed precious son.Another thing that interested me is that she was a girl that wanted to be different. No matter how people looked down at her, or ridiculed her, she was always determined to be someone in life. Mrs. Reed was very cruel to Jane because she was trying every way possible to put her in school or send her away. Jane began to think that she wasn't good enough for that family. They had downgraded her so much, that Jane began to think bad about herself. Jane began to think to herself, " What thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? She wanted someone to care about her and show her love. This novel would be good for a person looking for motivation or a book that is very inspiring. I recommend this book because it is a very detailed and is a very heartwarming book.
