review/summary: On the scale of classic dystopian - not as scary as 1984 or Brave New World but more meaningful than Hunger Gamesreview/text: In Ray Bradbury's future, firemen have a new job. Houses have become completely fireproof (and no-one seems to own cats, or trees for that matter.) Indeed the new role of the fireman is to ensure that fires happen, fuelled by books, writing and probably artwork if there was any left in this future.Enter Montag, a dedicated fireman who finds himself curious as to why people keep defying the law and owning books. Given this is a dystopian novel imagine you can tell where this leads.While shortish (the novella was orignially 25,000 words, before various magazines including Playboy asked for a longer work) Bradbury was a lot to say about the future of Western society. The scariest part for me was the fact people had all but become reality TV zombies, considering the people of the 'walls' to be their family's. A trend which I can see happening entirely naturally without any tyrannical political force.In summary, Fahrenheit 451 won't take up much of your time, but is worth more than the time you will spend on it.
