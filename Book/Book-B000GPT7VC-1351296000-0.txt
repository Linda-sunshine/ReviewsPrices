review/summary: Classic revisitedreview/text: This was a selection of a 3 person reading group. The book was selected from Jay Parini's list of"13 Bookds that changed the world". Uncle Tom's Cabin was published in 1852 and was written byHarriet Beecher Stowe. It caused quite a stir at the time. It is an interesting read and a reminder of progress made and so much more to be accomplished. It gives the reader much to reflect on. As a northerner who came to the south as a child my experience was much different from the others in our little group which gave us an interesting discussion. I recommend the book as a reminder of the past.
