review/summary: Book was as good as the moviesreview/text: Have seen what seems like about every movie ever made about A Christmas Carol, but had never read the book and always wanted to. Finally decided to read the book and it wasn't disappointing. A little hard to read at times because it has some of the old English in it, but generally a very good book
