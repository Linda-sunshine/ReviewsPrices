review/summary: Everyone get one!review/text: Yes, this book has not been on the NY Times best seller list for almost 190 weeks for no reason...I just started my kindle edition and skipped right to chapter 9 to find out my love language! My son just got engaged and I bought this for him, I will give it to him privately as I do believe this may very well be the most important gift I give him...Gary D Chapman makes so much sense...my future daughter in law also got it...I want everyone to get it because it's not just for couples. I want to be able to give my loved ones the love that They need and I would Love if the could love me in my language. This could not be simpler, all you have to do is want to do it...want your relationships to be the very best they can be. I love this and I hope this review helps, the more people that get this and work it, the more fabulous love we will have all around!!!
