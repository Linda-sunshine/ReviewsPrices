review/summary: "Atlas Shrugged" - a magnificent Kindle read!review/text: While I'm still in the process of reading "Atlas Shrugged" I'm pleased to report that the book is a supah read. Ayn Rand is a terrific author whose story-telling is a delight. Her descriptions transport the reader into the book's environs, and her characters are "real" folks with whom the reader can easily identify. For those who want to spend relaxing hours with a good book I highly recommend "Atlas Shrugged".
