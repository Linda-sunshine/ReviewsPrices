review/summary: Unremittingly Grim Tale of Love and Revengereview/text: After reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, I thought I should continue in the same vein with Wuthering Heights, written by her sister Emily Bronte. But whereas Jane Eyre is a story of love rewarded and hopes fulfilled, Wuthering Heights so far is an unremittingly grim tale of cruelty and revenge in two related families.Structurally, the book is a frame tale within a frame tale: Mr. Lockwood, the narrator who introduces the story, is soon replaced by the voice of Nelly Dean, the faithful servant who relates to Mr. Lockwood the family history that has led to the current misery. To my view, Nelly is the strongest and most believable character. Most of the rest of the characters in the story seem overdrawn. They are also hard to keep straight, partly because names are shared between generations; sometimes I think a family tree might be helpful.Considering that Wuthering Heights was written about 1845, I was expecting more difficulty with language than I actually encountered. There are few speeches in a heavy Yorkshire dialect which are daunting, and apparently even the author at one point considered revising them to make them intelligible to a broader audience. And there are some isolated words which seem to have changed their meaning over the years; but for the most part the book is quite readable.I have so far read about two-thirds of the text. I am plodding through to the end, hoping that there may be some ray of light shed before the end of the book.
