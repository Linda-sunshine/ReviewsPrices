review/summary: Huck Finnreview/text: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a very exciting book. It starts out in Missouri right on the Mississippi River. Huck Finn was a young boy who was adopted and was taught manners and how to live like a proper person. He never like this much and to be quite honest, he hated it. Huck's father was a drunk and one day kidnapped Huck and took him out to his cabin. Whenever Pap would leave, he would lock Huck in the cabin. Huck fakes his own death to get away from his father who abuses him. He hides on an island in the middle of the Mississippi river. While there, Huck meets a kind African American man named Jim. Jim and Huck develop a good relationship and begin on a long adventure together. They come across some tough times when they come across other people because they think Jim is a runaway slave. They encounter some con artists who sell Jim as a runaway slave. Jim was sold to Tom Sawyer's aunt and uncle. Huck and Tom device a plan to get Jim freed. Their plan works to free Jim and they realize later that Jim has already been a free man. The book ends with a good ending and Huck continues his adventurous ambitions by heading out west. I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars. It was a great book but not my perfect book to read. Overall it was great.
