review/summary: A Hungry, Sleepy, Whiny Start witha Thrilling Endingreview/text: 3 1/2 stars, but can;t bear to give it 3 so will round up to 4.A book I should have read a long time ago but never did, but am mist happy that I finally have.Not sure how to approach it as far as a review...it's not the best book ever written, as some fans breathlessly describe, but it is a very good one and timeless at that, I think.The character descriptions are terrific...the fantasy elements are also amazing, with talking birds, elves, dwarfs, man-beasts, goblins, and more.The ending is just thrilling, with an epic battle, bravery, forgiveness, redemption, and more.But the beginning and the premise of the adventure just killed me. I suppose there is some justice in retrieving the dwarf treasure from the clutches of the dragon, but it seemed so rooted in greed than in justice that just didn't seem a story-worthy plot or one worth risking life and limb for. And the first 50% of the book was just so whiny - I'm hungry! I'm thirsty! I'm sleepy! I'm cold! I'm wet! I want to go back! - that it reminded me of many a hike and camping trip in Scouts when I was a patrol leader with kids on their first time out.And yet, Bilbo does emerge as a leader of the quest, and learns a lor about himself in doing so. In that, I think a child would find inspiration in what is, at heart, a children's story.It is must reading to backfill the lore in Lord of the Rings, but the sense of good vs. evil is *so* much better in LotR than in the Hobbit.And speaking of greed: 3 movies for a 300-page book? Really? I just don;t know how they are going to do it and it seems so much against the moral of the story in terms of what Bilbo happily took in the end.
