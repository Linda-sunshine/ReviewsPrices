review/summary: From Here to Havenreview/text: I bought this book because of the SyFy Network series "Haven," which is said to be based on "The Colorado Kid." There were a handful of familiar characters and a mysterious death. That, I am afraid, is where the similarities end. If you are hoping to gain some insight into the background of a science fiction television show, this story will be of little help. If you are, however, searching for an enjoyable read, "The Colorado Kid" is as good as any by Stephen King. Far less terrifying than his usual offerings but every bit as mysterious. Thumbs up.
