review/summary: What an excellent story.review/text: I read it over the summer after my boyfriend finished it. To be honest there were some things in the story that surprised me. I thought that the story would have been a little different. I thought some things were also unbelievable but nothing off the charts outrageous. It was long but I was glad because it gave me something to look forward to everyday for a long time. I was entertained by this book.
