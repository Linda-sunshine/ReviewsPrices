review/summary: LOVE this book!review/text: This book is SO Stephen King! I ordered it because I realized it was one I had missed, and I've been watching the series loosely based on it, &#34;Haven&#34;. The series pulls a few things from the book, but takes a very small amount from the actual storyline. I'd recommend this to &#34;Haven&#34; fans, mystery fans, and those who are looking for a good book to while away the afternoon!
