review/summary: We must never let this happen againreview/text: Night (Oprah's Book Club)This book was spellbinding as I had never read a book that told the story as well as my neighbor who was a survivor of the death camps. I visited the holocaust museum as soon as it opened to see if if told the story as well as my neighbor...but while it was impressive...I didn't feel it told it well as my friend did.. This book was amazing and can't believe I have missed it this long..Will continue on with more of his books as he tells the story well
