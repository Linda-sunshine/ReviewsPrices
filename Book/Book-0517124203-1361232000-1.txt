review/summary: Alice in wonderlandreview/text: This is a great book for all ages. If you haven't seen the movie yet that's fine. Because the movie is very similar to the book. I have always loved Alice in wonderland. And this is a great book. It is a short book but it's good because it has a lot of impressive details. GREAT BOOK!!!!!! Especially by Lewis Carroll. FIVE STAR BOOK!!!!
