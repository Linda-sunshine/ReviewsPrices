review/summary: It was a hard readreview/text: I got this on the Kindle. It's not an easy read, nor a happy one. It's filled with obsessive compulsion, depression, denial, murder, and God-playing by man. I found myself forwarding through it to get to the action. I know it's a classic, it's just not a writing style I'm used to. It's fun to say that I read it, but it wasn't a fun read. To each his own.
