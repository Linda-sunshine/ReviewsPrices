review/summary: One of the Greatsreview/text: 1984 is as real and frightening now as it was in 1948, 1984 or any other time period. The difference is it was mostly conceived as a political story originally but has now become terrifyingly accurate and real in a high-tech world of government and corporate surveillance. Privacy is a major concern now when in the 1980s it was hardly given any mention or great concern. 1984 is about a government worker (Winston) who enjoys his job but starts to have suspicions about what is really going on in the world. The government severely restricts individual freedom, religion, choice of partner (procreation is not particularly encouraged), choice at all, movement and occupation. Winston starts to slip up and slip into the dark side. He knows he will get caught but cannot help himself. Yet Winston dreams the proletariats will rise up to defeat Big Brother. Is there some force in us which cannot be defeated? It is a powerful work that everyone can relate to. George Orwell has been blatantly copied by scores of book and film writers for over 50 years. Read the original for yourself and be amazed. Is the idea of 24-hour a day surveillance, "hall passes", spying, control, restriction and propaganda that far off? All in the "good intentions" of protecting us.
