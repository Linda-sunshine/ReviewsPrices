review/summary: Challenging and Full of Lovereview/text: I purchased this book for someone else as a gift and while waiting for my coffee began to read it (I try not to give out books I have not read). I was not aware of the journey it would take me on. Many may look at this book and wonder why only 1/3 or so of the book is about the actual hiding place in Haarlem and the other portion in the concentration camps: it's called a double-entendre. Although the book highlights the physical hiding place for those on the run, unbeknownst to Corrie a spiritual Hiding Place is discovered in the midst of a horrific time. I read it in a couple days (could've read it in one!) Very easy read; perfect for those who need help learning about forgiveness or questioning "why?"
