review/summary: Simply put, a must read.review/text: What can you say about one of the greatest minds of the last two centuries? Well, you don't have to say anything, just listen to the author. One minute care free, the next anal retentive. And vain? Me, myself and I, we get along so well. I'm still trying to figure out if I would have liked Franklin in person, but I certainly have no regrets about getting to know him better. Should be required reading.
