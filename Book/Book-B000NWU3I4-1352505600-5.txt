review/summary: The Hobbit - The spirit makes a man not the size or appearancereview/text: The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is a classic and my favorite book of all time next to the Bible. Tolkien creates the world of Middle Earth and the inhabitants of it. In this story the smallest and least likely of these inhabitants is sucked into an adventure he does not want yet where he proves himself the unlikely hero and rescuer many times over of those companions who are experienced in hardship, war, and adventures that he travels with. Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire, proves to all that it is the spirit and not the size, appearance, or experience of a person that truly makes a man and a hero. Sometimes the simple things of life are worth more.
