review/summary: Pivotal book in creating modern American culturereview/text: Carnegie has some great ideas here, although I think Stephen Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is a much better book. As I read I kept thinking about where Carnegie's ideas led--to a culture of "making nice" at all costs and never confronting failure. The "make nice" culture which is prevalent today sinks companies, universities and cultures. When Carnegie lauds Lincoln for not confronting his general's failure to decisively end the war after Gettysburg, he effectively says it is better to lose thousands of innocent lives than to tell a general he has messed up! Carnegie says everyone needs to feel positive about themselves. This is true. But there are 2 choices for a leader and mentor--spurious praise vs. helping someone achieve. The emphasis on being interested in others in order to get them to do what you want also made me feel a bit queasy. There is no social conscience to the book. It will probably help you to get ahead in life, though.
