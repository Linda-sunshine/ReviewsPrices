review/summary: The Hobbit -- Finally!review/text: I must confess that I have lived 60 years without once having read the Hobbit! I don't know why, exactly, but after recently getting interested in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy with a friend of mine, I decided to give the Hobbit a try.I really enjoyed the book and am looking forward to the movie release soon.
