review/summary: A good tie in to the moviereview/text: The book really did match the movie that I recently watched and was a good prelude to the the Lord of the rings but it seemed rather uneventful overall it was almost a boring let down overall. I would only recommend this book to people who are looking for more details on Bilbo's adventures before Frodo's.
