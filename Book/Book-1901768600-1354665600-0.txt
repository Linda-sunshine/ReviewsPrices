review/summary: My favorite Jane Austen bookreview/text: I like the kindle version of this book. As far as books go, this is one of my favorites and I like the fact that it discusses second chances. It's beautifully written and the main character is sympathetic without being tragic. I highly recommend this to other Austen fans.
