review/summary: Great entertainmentreview/text: Child has created a &#34;can't put down&#34; plot line and engaging characters. Reacher is someone you want on your side, someone you would like to know better. &#34;One Shot&#34; is a fine thriller, but definitely, perhaps purposefully not great literature; it is a fun read.
