review/summary: Take the time to actually read a great book, read A Christmas Carol!review/text: A Christmas Carol is one of the great works of English literature, and it is well known throughout the world. However, have you actually read it, or only seen it on television? I decided I wanted to read the original and find out what really was part of the story.This is an excellent story, with a great lesson. There's a reason why it's still so popular some 170 years after its original publication. Do yourself a favor, and take the time to actually read a great book, read A Christmas Carol!
