review/summary: love readingreview/text: I have read Gwtw at least 3 times in the past. Somehow I lost my book ina move, and saw it for sale on Amazon, and couldn't wait for it to comein the mail.I was very pleased to receive it in excellent condition ! Even though Ihave read it 3 times before, it intrigues me, and I can't put it down.I love the characters Rhett Butler and Scarlet O'Hara. I have the sequelScarlet and find that book is also very enjoyable, However NOT as muchas Gone with the wind. I will never loose my book again. I'm passing itdown to family who I hope will make this a keepsake.thanks. katie
