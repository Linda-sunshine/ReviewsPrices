review/summary: One of the best kindle editionsreview/text: As a kindle owner, I've learned to be a bit wary of free editions of classic works as well as various &#34;illustrated&#34; editions. I was so very pleasantly surprised with this little gem. The table of contents is active and easy to navigate. The illustrations are faithfully and beautifully rendered and placed properly within the story. I hope the price remains &#34;free&#34; on this edition so that more readers can enjoy this timeless Christmas tale as Dickens intended. Cheers all around!
