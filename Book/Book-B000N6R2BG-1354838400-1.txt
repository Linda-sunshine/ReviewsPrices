review/summary: Begging the questionreview/text: Jodi Picoult is a very good storyteller; she grabs your attention and moves the story along quite well. I admire her willingness to explore a very difficult question in a fairly unbiased manner. But the ending confused me Perhaps she hurried through writing the final scene, or perhaps she simply didn't want to end up on one side of the question. Whatever the reason, I was dissatisfied with the final scene or two.
