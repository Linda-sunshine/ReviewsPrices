review/summary: Life changing and must read for relationships, marriages or notreview/text: Just wanted to give this book a 5 star review, it has been life changing to me and my relationships, especially with my husband and new in-laws years ago. My husband and I read it together and discussed each of the chapters, and we did this BEFORE we married, which was a really excellent idea. It has helped me in relationships in general, not just with him. I am a huge fan of Dr Chapman and highly recommend this book.
