review/summary: What an amazing story.review/text: My book arrived for me in Australia in excellent packaging. I would have loved a slip cover but the hard cover was perfect and the movie is amazing but the book is better.What an incredible story.I challenge anyone to read the first page and not feel like they can not put it down until they finish it. Harper Lee was an extraordinary authoress....what a book.It is a book that grabs your heart on the first page and you KNOW you just have to read it all, and then later, again.Harper takes you into the community, you are a neighbour and you can SEE all that is happening in the storyline.Harper gives the read two things - the words and, the pictures in your mind's eye.You will love this book and mine will always be on my bookshelf.
