review/summary: Just So-Soreview/text: As far as fantasy books go, this one was quite disappointing. I put off reading it for years but I finally gave in. I guess I'm glad I did because it is another notch in my bookshelf. However, the characters are not compelling, and the story is not that great. Furthermore, the lack of female characters makes it an unbalanced read.
