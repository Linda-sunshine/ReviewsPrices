review/summary: Simple. Easy. Ready.review/text: I hate self help books. I never read them. I decided to read this because my husband and I are going through so much hectic stuff that I don't want to lose the spark. Our real estate agent recommended it to me. I absolutely positively loved this book. It only took me a couple of days to read and I have a 4 month old son, a full time job and no time in between. I read it while pumping breastmilk on my little pump breaks.I am so excited to go home and try the activities that I could just burst.I should add I have a bachelor of science in psychology; not because it was an easy degree, but because I am avid fan of conditioning and reinforcement - this is right up my alley.
