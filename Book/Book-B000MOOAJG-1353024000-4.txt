review/summary: Interestingly written but too flawed to be embracedreview/text: Depending on your belief system this is one of many viewpoints: from an alternative lifestyle to a road to hell. She was a good writer but her Eastern European block upbringing warped her perceptions of life. I feel sorry for those who embrace this philosophy - it is as cold and hard as the East Berlin she escaped.
