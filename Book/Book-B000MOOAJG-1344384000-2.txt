review/summary: enough!review/text: I get the ideology and the significance of industrialism, objectivism, self reliance, accountability etc. I also get the criticism of the bureaucracy, and the vicious cycle of the able supporting and fostering the weak which become not welfare but entitlement, and the artificial moralization of vice and virtue etc. I agree with the author on multiple points that need and deserve to be discussed. The reason why I am giving only 2 stars is that at least for me, (I am acknowledging the fact that this book has been known as one of the most life changing, influential books for alot of people) the author fails to communicate her ideas in the form of storytelling. Most of great fictions reflect and investigate politial/social phenomena---The Jungle, Sister Carrie, The invisible man, and the Native Boy, to say a few--but they do it through plots, characters, and their stories. Atlas Shrugged starts with interesting foreshadow and promising characters...but after maybe 300 pages, no new ideas appear and the book turns into the author's ranting and pontificating her ideas over and over and over...like force feeding, shoving them down my throat. There are many characters but ther are so one dimensional, in reality, there are only two characters. The stories are so unrealistic and outrageously absolute and simplistic, it feels like either a cult or comic book in the end. I have read Fountainhead and I liked it, and it was supposed to be just an overture to this book. I think the ideas are good but this is not what I consider good literature.
