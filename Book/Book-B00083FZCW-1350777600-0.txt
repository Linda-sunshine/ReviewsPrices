review/summary: The Angel Experiencereview/text: I thought this book was awesome! I like how the idea was about something everyone has dreamt about having wings. I like how there is so much action. The only thing I didn&#8216;t like was that Max sounded slightly like a hill-billy. Other than that, I would recomend this book to anyone who likes adventure.
