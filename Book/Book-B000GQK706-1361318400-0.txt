review/summary: Tolkien = Fantasy!review/text: I love J.R.R. Tolkien's works. He is the father of Fantasy and inspired all other works. He is great at telling a story, painting a detailed and descriptive world, and putting so many layers of depth and complexity that it really makes the mind work to take it all in, understand it and visualize. I love it!
