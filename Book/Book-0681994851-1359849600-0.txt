review/summary: A never to go out of style classic!review/text: This is so much more than a love story, although reading about the love story in &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; is exciting precisely because it is from a time when courtesy and appropriate behavior was so highly valued. Some may compare that kind of behavior with today's much more open and free male/fremale relations and not understand the impediments to verbal and physical demonstration of your love back in those days. However, I think that added so deliciously to the sexual tension.Mostly, I find this to be about a particular female who has an incredibly admirable personality. Independent, clever, modest yet feisty, she sets a great example for true feminism to come. We need to pay attention to the hardships she faced, and the ways in which she handled them. It sets an example for us to be better people and to face our own modern day challenges with ethics and fortitude.The characters were clearly delineated and we would have no trouble identifying them if they were to come to life. Bronte handled the English language in a most eloquent fashion, which I enjoyed very much. It is fascinating to see how a language grows and changes over time. It reflects the society it is expressing information about. What will our brand of English say about us?
