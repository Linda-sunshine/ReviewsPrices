review/summary: This book saved us!review/text: Our son had colic and reflux. Sleep was precious and fleeting. Thankfully, a nurse recommended this book (and the cheesy DVD) to us. We bought both and began using the 5Ss immediately. It's amazing how well those work! It took a bit of practice, but they worked the first night. They really helped us to get some sleep and to help soothe a very difficult to soothe baby. I also greatly appreciated having the DVD for swaddling help. I think we had the earlier version of it - it was cheesy as all get out. He goes over swaddling slowly and repeatedly, as well as the 5Ss. If you're a visual person like I am, I recommend buying it along with the book. If you're a new parent and have zero time (what new parent doesn't?), it's a lot faster to just watch the "movie" and the movie covers the same basic principles.
