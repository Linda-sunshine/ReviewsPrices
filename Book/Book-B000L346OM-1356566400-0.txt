review/summary: Amazing book about an amazing journey.review/text: I loved Frankl's perspective on our time here as being a choice of attitude. His account of concentration camp life was heart-stopping and his ability to see light in such a dark time, his ability to pull himself out of such a desperate and sick situation lends hope that I can do the same in my times which can, in no way, compare to his. This book inspired me and shed light on what I might call depression. GREAT read!
