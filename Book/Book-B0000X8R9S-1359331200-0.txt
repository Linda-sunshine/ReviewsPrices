review/summary: excellent bookreview/text: Bought this for my son who does not enjoy reading but is an outdoorsy type. He LOVED this book. He has read Brian's Winter and The River and he has Lawn Boy and Brian's Return to read. I think Brian's Winter was even better than Hatchet. Highly recommend for boys who don't like to read! It held his interest!
