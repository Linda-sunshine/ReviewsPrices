review/summary: Roads Go Ever Ever Onreview/text: Having first read The Hobbit almost 20 years ago when I was in Middle School, I always recalled the book fondly. Though it was not my introduction to fantasy, it was one of the first books of fantasy that I had read. Now, a couple decades later, I returned to the Hobbit in preparation for the movie coming out in December 2012.The story is straight forward. Bilbo Baggins, a respectable Hobbit living a respectable life, somehow finds himself part of an adventure. An adventure of all things! Adventures are not respectable. And yet somehow Bilbo is bamboozled into it. On the adventure Bilbo finds himself in the company of a wizard and 13 dwarves. Definitely not respectable company. This particular adventure involves trolls, endless roads, no chances for second breakfast, elves, men who turn into bears, goblins, more elves, and even a dragon. And of course, Gollum and a rather famous ring. Trying to write a review of this particular book without giving away spoilers is hard, but necessary. But you may be wondering what is the point of the adventure. Well now . . . the point of the quest is to reclaim the stolen dwarf treasure from the dragon, Smaug. If you've read the Lord of the Rings or watched the film adaptations then you probably know how things turn for Bilbo.The edition that I read was fantastic. It includes audio of J.R.R. Tolkien reading from select portions of the book. It also includes beautiful color illustrations. The book itself is short - a little over 300 pages -, but the memories that it will leave you with will last you a lifetime.
