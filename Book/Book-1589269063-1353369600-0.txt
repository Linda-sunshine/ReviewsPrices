review/summary: Great book! I highly recommend it for everyone!review/text: This book exceeded my expectations! I highly recommend it as required reading for all adults of all ages who have not previously read any of Gary Chapman's books about the 5 love languages. It gives useful information about relating to all people that we care about, whether they be spouse, child, parent, sibling, friend, or in-law.
