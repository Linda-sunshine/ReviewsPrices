review/summary: It's worthwhile to reread the Harry Potter booksreview/text: The first reading of the Harry Potter series was fun and well worth the time spent. Enjoyed each of the movies based on the books. It is interesting to go back to the books to both reread and compare the books ' storyline/details vs. the movie version/details. The movies have small & larger changes, condensations, and missing scenes, but this does not detract from the original story of the books. Enjoying reading the Potter books again and it is interesting to notice all the differences between the books and the movies.
