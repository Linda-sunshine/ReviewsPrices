review/summary: Night Reviewreview/text: I read this book because it was a reading assignment for my granddaughter's English class. She was having problems relating to the topic and the main character so I thought if I read it I could have a sort of home review with her and open some discussion to help her better understand what was happening in the era of the book. We did have some good discussions and my granddaughter had a good grasp for her assignments around the book. I remember all too well what went on in Nazi Germany; not personally, but because I was born in 1945 and, therefore, studied this topic when I was in school. I also attended a church with families from the Netherlands who escaped from their country during these horrible times. I believe we need to keep this information in ongoing studies for our young people so they will be able to recognize the horrors of man's inhumanity to man and prevent it from happening in their lives.
