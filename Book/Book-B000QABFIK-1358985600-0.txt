review/summary: A Story that Amazes, Compels and Consumes Youreview/text: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is a story that lingers in the minds of young adults worldwide. It is wrong, farfetched even, to say that this book is just about a girl and her life in New York City. This is a story about life at its limit and a girl that learns to grow up. Fragile threads of a seemingly dull existence and the tragedies of poor family are what holds the bindings of the book together. It is the rich past that makes it suddenly an adventure worth reading. The peace in it provides the finally perfect piece for the restless minds of people like me, who read this story. It teaches me that no matter how wrong the start, there is always a conclusion that fits incredibly well, despite the trail of sharp and cutting glass that a shattered mirror leaves behind. This is a journey spun beautifully by Betty Smith through her concise but stunning words, woven to life by her cunning twists of characters. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, a journey of life, misfortunes, and maturity, will become a towering figure that roots deep into your conscious mind.
