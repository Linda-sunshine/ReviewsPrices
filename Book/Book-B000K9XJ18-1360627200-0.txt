review/summary: Gripping bookreview/text: I read this in strict sequence. It is as easy to read as the other Lee Child 'Jack Reacher' books. I have read five of them in a bit over a week so you can assume they can hold your attention. I thought I had the bad guy picked about a third of the way through this one even if I didn't know the name but I was only half right. That's the good thing about this book. It takes you to different places and then throws you off the scent before you realize.This book didn't have the graphic violence that a couple of the others have had. It was different in that respect but the plot was pretty simple and there were enough blind corners, rough stuff and sexual tension to make it a good read.
