review/summary: Great survival adventurereview/text: A small plane crashes. Brian, a 14 year old boy survives the crash. Then he has to survive in the wild. Luckily he has the hatchet his mother had given him, but that's about all he has. Thru trial and error he figures out how to get food and shelter. He learns to listen and pay attention to his surroundings. He learns how to move to fit in with nature. He sees the world in an entirely different way. He is forever changed. The things he took for granted when in civilization are missed at first, but he comes to realize most of those things are not central to survival. When he can finally access the survival kit from the plane he finds a gun, but he sets it aside, he wants to consider how a gun would make his wilderness experience different. He isn't sure he wants a gun. He is completely satisfied with what he accomplished.My 8 year old loved this story. It stimulated him to think about what he would do under those conditions. I've always enjoyed survival stories. This one is particularly well done as we are in Brian's head and hear what he's thinking, how he motivates himself to solve the problems he is facing. Brian has many setbacks but he thinks out the problems and comes up with a plan. I've already ordered the sequel, River.
