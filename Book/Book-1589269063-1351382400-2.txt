review/summary: the 5 love languagesreview/text: This is a wonderful book for couples and for for singles too. He gives such helpful information and insight on relationships concerning how to show love and what you need to feel loved. I have been married for over 20 years and we now are trying to implement these theories into our marriage and find it is very helpful to our relationship. Even if your happily married its still so helpful!! Thank you Gary Chapman!!!:)tbell
