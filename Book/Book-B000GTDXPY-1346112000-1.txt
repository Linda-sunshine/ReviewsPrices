review/summary: Love this for the fun of itreview/text: I wouldn't say these are the most challenging mysteries, but the writing is charmingly funny and sweet. The characters are highly engaging and the plots are so full of fun you just can't help but keep reading. The only problem I have with the series is that she hasn't written any more.
