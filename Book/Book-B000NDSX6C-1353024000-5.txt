review/summary: Quite a good bookreview/text: I had seen all the LOTR movies, and loved them, but feared I would not like the books as much. In the movies, the plot always seemed so incredibly complicated, that I figured it would just be tedious to read about. I was wrong. The book was very easy to follow, and very well done. I enjoyed it immensely.
