review/summary: Good Writerreview/text: I down loaded this e-book from Amazon.com to my Kindle Fire. The e-book starts out with a well written intense scene. There is a lot of good detail in the story. Sniper, gun fire and confusion cause the story to start to unfold as you read it. I am a fan of the series with Jack Reacher as the main character even though the action takes a little bit too long to get to, for me. The Author Lee Child does a good job writing this e-book and this series but, I find myself drifting off and trying to stay with the stories. Some of the technology is questionable for the time period (phone booth). There were three typographical errors in the e-book. One of the sentences was really messed up. The copy editing was done automatically by a computer, because there were words that were spelled correctly but they were the wrong words. The formatting of the e-book was done very poorly. There were large spaces in-between words throughout the e-book. There were problems with the spacing between the paragraphs throughout the e-book. The Author Lee Child has a big name in the industry. I expected a better overall quality in the e-book seems there were a lot of short cuts taken. Feel a little cheated expected better publishing quality. Overall this is a much better than average story. This is a good well written story with good to excellent Dialog, Plot, Tension, Suspense, Character development. I have and would recommend the book to a friend.
