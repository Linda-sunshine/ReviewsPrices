review/summary: A mystery with laughter.review/text: I really enjoyed this book.I just couldn't help liking Calamity, cheering her on in places and feeling sorry for her in others.Its a well written mystery that had me guessing "who done it." But at the same time had romance and quite a bit of laughter. (You don't half get some funny looks when your sat giggling during your lunch hour.)I downloaded it, simply because it was free but I'm glad I did. I'm definately going to read more from this writer.
