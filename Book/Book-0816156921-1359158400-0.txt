review/summary: Interesting but different than I expectedreview/text: After a lifetime of watching many film versions of this classic vampire story, I finally settled down to read the original story. What a shock! It is a good story, but told from a completely different point of view than all of the films. The focus is on the people horribly affected by Dracula, not the Count himself, and his is definetly not the poor, lonely, misunderstood noble figure of today's vampire inspired stories--re: the Twilight Saga. A good story yes, but I favor the modern good vampire over the old despicable one that started it all.
