review/summary: Awesome Blokereview/text: He went through many phases of life : As a printer and then using a pseudonym to start printing his own stories through his brother's paper. He seemed to always get back into the printing business. He had a bunch of bludger friends and soon became a better judge of people and mitigated his life risks that way.He was very involved in community life - the establishment of the post office, libraries and universities were some of his accomplishments.His philosophy in life was sound. you can;t be perfect, but if you are anything like Ben, you will be doing this world a service !
