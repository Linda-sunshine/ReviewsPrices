review/summary: My Hobbit Reviewreview/text: I love this book! The way Tolken weaves this story into exciting and heart racing chapters! I was sad that they made a movie; I know no one could ever copy this book because Tolken is the only one has th magic to do so. So say, read the book!p.s. The end might be frightening to some. But enjoy!
