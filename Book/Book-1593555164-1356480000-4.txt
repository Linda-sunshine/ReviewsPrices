review/summary: Jack Reacher: One Shot: A Novelreview/text: I remember reading 'The Killing Floor', the first Reacher novel, and thinking, 'oh, boy! i hope i get to read more!!' Since then, i have read every one of the Jack Reacher books and as one is ending, i am already anticipating the next. I appreciate that author Lee Child does not find it necessary to use profanity and gore to tell his story - book after book is one great, suspenseful read after another. I read this book for the second time, thinking that it would help me enjoy the new Jack Reacher movie. The second read was just as good as the first. What can i say? Jack is Jack: he is a hard man to describe; he is elusive; he is one cool dude; he is a reluctant hero, much like the Lone Ranger; he is alone, but apparently he is not lonely. In this latest adventure, he ends up exactly where he should be, doing something he did not plan to do. Some may think the story implausible, but in this day and age, why not? I find the story believable, typical Reacher with a story that builds and builds. I love the ending of the book, especially the last paragraph. I hope you will get to know Jack Reacher through this book and i hope you will enjoy everyone of the Reacher novels as much as I do.
