review/summary: YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOVE THE CLASSICS TO LOVE LITTLE WOMEN!review/text: L.W., although written 150 years ago, is as charming and entertaining today as any modern tome written today. I read it in my 20s and enjoyed it as much inn my 40s. Rarely do I reread any books, but L.W. is timeless annd a wonderful escape from modern daily life. Each character is unique and special and believable.Each entertwined story is as interesting as the next, you truly don't wish the story to end.Again, if you've never read a 19th century classic before, Little Women will grab and hold you throughout the entire book.L.W. is appropriate for all ages and especially &#34;tweens&#34; may receive a positive lesson in ambitions and decorum by enjkoying the way life was for their ancestors 150 years ago.This is an all-aroud 5-Star book any age girl won't want to put down..
