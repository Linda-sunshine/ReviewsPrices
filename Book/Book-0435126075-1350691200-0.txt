review/summary: Pride and Prejudicereview/text: I love this book. I read this book 20 years ago and I'm reading it a second time. I love it even more. I plan to read it again in the near future. I just love the two main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. The details of their thoughts make you feel like you know them.
