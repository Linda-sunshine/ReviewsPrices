review/summary: Fabulousreview/text: This was the first Lynn Austin book I read, and I could not put it down. I quickly read the following books in this series. This first one started out difficult to read, simply because of the subject matter, and almost a year after I read it I still think about it from time to time. Even if you are not a fan of Biblical fiction, I would still highly suggest this book. Well done, Lynn Austin!
