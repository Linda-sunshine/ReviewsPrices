review/summary: the hobbittreview/text: The movie is probably good but for me the book stinks . With a capital S. Tried to read it twice. Each time got farther but to childish of a story. I read in the paper it was a rush job for his daugther or it was his granddaugther. Movie makes millions . Think about it. It don't take a lot to please some people. One star not low enough !! Give me back my money.!!!
