review/summary: Beautifulreview/text: In my opinion, Pride and the Prejudice is a work of art.From a teens point of view its quite beautiful. That leaves you in tears. Some might say its in a old time theme, but I would like to think the romance in this story is so typical every 2000 kinda day. We live in a world where men and women play the "I don't like you card." Even when we have already fallen for that person. Instead of realizing right of the bat they were meant to be. Anyway, if you're looking for a nail biter, empty box of tissues, this is an amazing book. Don't over look it because of the title or date written. It's really a piece of art it's self.
