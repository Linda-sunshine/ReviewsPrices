review/summary: A Great Readreview/text: Jack Reacher is every woman's dream, and every guys aspriration. One Shot is a fast paced, action packed book. Child is such a good writer, you feel, see, hear and experience each page. This thrill ride takes it's cue from the world we live in, with a random killing of five people, did I say random? The twist and turns will keep you locked down for the duration. I'm reading all the &#34;Reacher&#34; novels in order, I have yet to hit a sour note. I love each adventure, and go along for each ride. They chose this one to make the first movie for the &#34;Reacher&#34; character. For me reading the book was just as good or better, because you are given such a vivid picture of all the action, it plays on the stage of your mind. If books got academy awards, this one gets top honors.One small negative for me, is that, I get a little put off with Reacher sleeping with every beautiful female character he meets and works with. That's just me. Perhaps I think love should figure into his life more, not just getting whats available.I realize he's had a serious relationship in earlier books, and I understand the character enough that love ties are too restrictive for &#34;Reacher&#34;.All reads considered, this one is great.I intend to read them all.
