review/summary: Atlas Shruggedreview/text: Poignant novel of our present times. This is not a new read for me as I've read it five or six times over the last 20 plus years. However, given the present times, socio-economic conditions and cultural events it's a great re-read. In a novel format it ties in well with F.A. Hayek's works which are a bit more rigorous in nature. Hayek's works are not recommended as a "bed time" read.
