review/summary: could not put this book down...review/text: I was throughly engaged in this book. After I started it, I could not put it down. Without giving away the storyline, this is a story of how our lives impact each other as we go through our individual "Life Journeys", even the lives of people you may not know or be aware of. I look forward to reading more of this author's books.
