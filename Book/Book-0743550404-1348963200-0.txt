review/summary: A Different But Satisfying King Talereview/text: I supposed this book will polarize many readers. They will either love it or hate it. Personally, I quite enjoyed it. The best way to go into the book is not to have any expectations. Begin reading and let Stephen King take you on a journey. This is one author that you can trust to deliver. Although I was not in love with many of his recent books, I still respect his mastery of the craft. The Colorado Kid had a lot more hits than misses for me and was one of the better reads of recent King releases.This short crime mystery is published under the Hard Case Crime label has some very memorable characters and dialogue. As it begins to unfold, the story becomes more and more fascinating. Some will argue that King's weakness has always been his endings, and for those readers, this book might top their list. However, as King writes in the afterword, it was the journey that I enjoyed and did not need the ending tied up so neatly. I felt more than satisfied with King's little tale. One's imagination, the theater of the mind, can be just as effective, if not more, than having everything spelled out. So, for me, this was a delightful read that I whole-heartedly recommend. Just keep an open mind, don't struggle, and let the story pull you along.
