review/summary: A great prequal for anyone wanting to read The Lord of The Ringsreview/text: If you want to read The Lord of The Rings, then The Hobbit is a must read first. A classic and fun story with lots of action and adventure in its own right, The Hobbit sets the scene for a much wider world of his other books and hints at the story to come. A great introduction to JRR Tolkien's fertile imagination.
