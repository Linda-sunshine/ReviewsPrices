review/summary: Piece of Crapreview/text: This is the most frustrating and horrible thing I've ever purchased! It is unreliable, recording bits and pieces of the text, getting it right sometimes, and then turning the page and getting it wrong most of the time.We worked for hours trying to get a completely correct recording and my husband (who does voiceovers for a living - lots of practice and experience recording!) left saying, I'm done, this thing is a piece of crap!&#34;
