review/summary: Harry Potter, good for all ages.review/text: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone is an incedible book. When Harry Potter books and movies became popular, I only wanted to see the films, but after seeing the films, I realized I wanted to get to know the characters a little more. So, I decided to read the books. This process began with this book. This book contains a great deal of information which allows the reader to get to know Harry and other essentail characters better. The backgroud of Harry's past is explained in a way that the movies could not protray. Also, while reading this book, I was able to notice differnt aspects of Hogwarts that were not shown in the movie. I understand that these books can be concerning to some people because they contain witchcraft, but I do not believe the protrayal of witchcraft is too over powering. This book takes a good approach to a make believe world. Students in middle school would really enjoy this book because it is an easy read, and it allows them to escape from the ordinary. Also, students can compare the book to the movie. They can essentail questions like "Was the movie better than the book? Why or why not?" Or, "If I lived in this "different world" how would it affect the way I act, or go about daily life." This book is great because it allows people to step outside of the ordinary and experience something extraordinary, which is what every middle schoolers wants anyways, right?
