review/summary: Too Little Inforeview/text: I ordered this book so that I could write in it for my British Literature class at school. I thought I was going to receive the paperback form of the book and have the correct page numbers that corresponded with the teacher's copy of the book. Not only was this the hardback version (which wasn't the problem), but the top edge of the cover of the book looked like it had been chewed on and the page numbers didn't match up. No where in the description did I see that the book was going to be hardback and in such poor condition. The same thing also happened to my friend who also ordered it from Amazon.
