review/summary: Good Charactersreview/text: For a Stephen King Book this had so much to desire. He is an excellent writer, and he didn't fail in his writing here. It was a story that could have went so far, but didn't. I realize that was the whole point, real mysteries are often left hanging. But when you read a Stephen King Book you exoect certain things and this book had none of those things. I was disappointed.
