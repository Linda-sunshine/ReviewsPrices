review/summary: Great for a long ridereview/text: I read this book in high school 20 years ago and thought it was time to read it again because of it's relevance to todays society. I didn't have time to read the book so I bought the audio and listened while driving on a long business trip. The story still holds up and I really liked the narrator. I don't agree with Rands objectivist outlook but this is a book that everyone should be familiar with.
