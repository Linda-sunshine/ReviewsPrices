review/summary: Another great Jack Reacher book!review/text: This book keeps the Jack Reacher character alive and well. Too bad the movie producers didn't read enough of these books to understand how important Jack's size is to his overall character. Great book...haven't seen the Tom Cruise Jack Reacher movie yet...probably won't.
