review/summary: True or not, very interesting reading.review/text: I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Surprisingly, this was a quick read and the subject matter was handled in such a way that I could not put the book down. After death, I hope I am reunited with others this way as well. It would be good to know that you really did make a difference to someone in this life as we know it.
