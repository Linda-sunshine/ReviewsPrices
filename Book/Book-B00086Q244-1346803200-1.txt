review/summary: Timelessreview/text: This is an absolutely timeless and fabulous read. Dale Carnegie truly was a man ahead of his time and I feel so grateful to get the opportunity to learn his teachings through this book. There are so many passages that I have copied from this book and hung on the walls of my cubicle area at work, I love looking up and reading them to remind me of those things I'm working on.Although I use these principles in my work life I find I use them much more in my personal life. Especially when dealing with silly little disagreements, where I would normally argue how I'm right regardless of how it is affecting other people. Reading this book really helped me to recognize that automatic response to argue and prove our points so that I'm able to refrain from such behavior when it isn't even remotely necessary.This is a book that is meant to be read multiple times. So much great information that you'll never retain it all in one read.Highly recommended!!!!
