review/summary: Art Imitating Lifereview/text: GREAT read...and pretty scary how many parallels can be drawn to the current economic and political climate in our country. Government takeover of major industries (healthcare), increased taxation and "roadblocks" thrown in front of innovators and entrepeneurs, punishing success in business under the guise of "fairness and equitability" and "redistribution of wealth". Ayn Rand had better vision 55 years ago than some folks do today. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the movies, but I'm dreading the next 4 years as "Atlas Shrugged: The Live Version" plays out in front of us. Who...and Where...is our John Galt??
