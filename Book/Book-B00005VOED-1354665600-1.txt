review/summary: Hilarious! Although you may have to stop reading because your laughter is disturbing other people on the flight.review/text: Great book. Very funny. Great cast of characters. Also hits on some serious social issues. Toole does an excellent job jumping between different scenes. Would make a great move. Its amazing it to read the history of the failed attempts to get this made into a film.
