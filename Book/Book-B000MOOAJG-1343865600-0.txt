review/summary: Classic Philosophical Novelreview/text: Atlas Shrugged is a brilliantly structured argument for Rand's objectivist thoughts. Spelling out the arguments is the story of brilliant capitalist thinkers clashing with socialist pigs (hah).Regardless of your political views, this is a thought-provoking read and classic literature. Very neat how Rand writes her views into entertaining stories with (mostly) realistic characters.
