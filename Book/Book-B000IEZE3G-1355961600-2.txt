review/summary: 2nd Copy of Book 1review/text: I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I wore out my first copy of these discs and could not go without one. This was so much cheaper than going to a store where you have to be lucky to find one. The box was a little worn but the product is perfect. Thanks, Harry and I can continue to be friends. By the way I'm a retired school teacher and have seen kids go from being uninterested in reading to avid readers thanks to the Harry Potter series. I've even seen kids start with listening to the audios first to wanting to read it for themselves. These books, audios, movies didn't sell millions for nothing. They teach could moral living and values like few books have ever done. Donna Hicks
