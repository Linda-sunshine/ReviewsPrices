review/summary: It Was Returned...review/text: Thinking I wouldn't find a recordable storybook in stores this past Christmas, I purchased this online. It was the 'last' one and I received it quickly. It looked as though it had been around for a long time....as in sitting at the bottom of a pile of other books. The back was scuffed toward the outer edges and even had a hole punctured into the soft back cover. I was ok with that, and I actually ended up using marker to blend in the white ripped area and then putting clear tape over it. I was giving it to my 3 yr old granddaughter, and she would end up doing the same thing to it eventually anyway... Repairing it just sounded easier than trying to return it, since I couldn't get a replacement anyway. Then I find recordable books in stores, but still decided to keep this one because I really liked the artwork. Then I tried recording it. After recording the book and playing it back, it never did work right. It wouldn't play on some pages, then would play on a page that it didn't belong to...it was a MESS! So, I finally returned it for a refund. The return was easier than I thought, and they paid for the return, too! It would have been a nice book if it had worked, but I think it DID sit around on the shelf too long and became defective in the process. New batteries did not help. I gave it 3 stars because it was still a book with nice artwork.
