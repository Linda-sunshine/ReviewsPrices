review/summary: Great GREAT Readreview/text: I had heard of this book a few times before purchasing it. I'm interested in history and thought that reading Frankl's experience as a POW camp would fit right along those interests.The book goes into a bit of the actual experience that he had as a POW but the content is so much more than that. It's an excellent depiction of how we act in various circumstances. Frankl relates these stories with such clarity and purpose that the book sucks you right in!I'd HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is looking for ways to view the world differently -- to view themselves and their circumstances differently. Such a great book!
