review/summary: Deserves its place on the 1001 books list.review/text: The extremely cautionary and moving tale is of a woman in a dystopian society; a religious regime where women have been stripped of their rights and forced into service; either as Wives, concubines or housekeepers. It is told in a first person narrative and by an admittedly unreliable narrator. This device lends genuineness as well as obscures details that might derail the story. Our narrator, Offred, is introspective and capricious. She is rebellious in her thoughts, but not her actions for much of the book. This gives us entry into the world she inhabits, allows for a building of empathy for her and a desire to see her escape from her situation. She also intersperses her tale, and it is noticeably a transcription of an oration, with meandering memories of "the time before," giving more depth to the characters around her and informing us of how the world came to be the way it was. The most startling thing about it is that it's not too far-fetched. In fact, I think, today much more than the time it was written, you see (scarily large, disturbingly vocal) sectors of society clamoring for a return to the kind of values this fictional society enforces. It literally made me shudder. I'm pretty sure I'd kill myself if they took all my books away and told me I "couldn't" read (neither permitted to or capable of).
