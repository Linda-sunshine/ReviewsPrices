review/summary: Great story idea, if you are under 14review/text: Really great idea for a story, but could not get past the juvenile writing. Yes this is a young adult book, but it was so childish at times that I had a hard time getting through it. Not sure if I will continue the series, to be honest the only real motivation I had to finish the book was so that I could start something different.
