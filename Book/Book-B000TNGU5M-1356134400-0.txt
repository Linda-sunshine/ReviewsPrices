review/summary: Mind blowing eventsreview/text: Contemplated reading this legendary novel for weeks. More than happy with the purchase. Amazing and over well delivered events of our past. A brutal interpretation of a dictatorship delivered by a mad man ( Hitler). Could not put it down, no question why schools all over the country are usingthisbook to depict the events that have scarred lives for the rest of their existence. Amazing read!
