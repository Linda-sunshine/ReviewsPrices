review/summary: Excellent Readreview/text: I loved this book! It is no wonder why disney adapted it to the big screen.As with all books turned into movies, the book is different but better. So if you are looking to follow the story of the film... just rewatch the movie lolthe moment I finished this book I went and purchased the other 6 books in the series... :-)
