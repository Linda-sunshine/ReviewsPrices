review/summary: Uglies ... amazingreview/text: I enjoyed this book. To imagine a world where plastic surgery is the norm.... transforming from normal to model ... but then tally met Shah and her whole life changes. The journey to the smoke and falling in love with David. But then destroying the locket led special circumstances to their camp... the daring rescue and tally turning herself in..... what about the lesions?????? What'll become of tally??? I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
