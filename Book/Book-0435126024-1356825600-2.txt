review/summary: Good readreview/text: Saw the movie and wanted to read the book. I bought this for my Kindle and am very happy with it. The story has lots of words that we don't use in our English language anymore. With the Kindle I just bring the curser down to the word I don't know and it gives me the definition. Having the Kindle has made it so much easier to bring more meaning to the story.
