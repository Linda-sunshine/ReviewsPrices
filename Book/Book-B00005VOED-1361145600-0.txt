review/summary: So utterly disapointedreview/text: Due to the respect I have for many great and funny writers who have lauded this book's brilliance over the years I have planned to read it for some time. I recently read something that referred to the book and decided, "it is time to do this".As a reader I try to give a book 1-2 hours, maybe 100 pages before giving up. I read this whole thing waiting to laugh, find something funny, anything. THis was a great disapointment in my literary life. I have been trying to rethink this book and try to imagine what could be funny. Perhaps I'm such a dunce myself I could not get into the high-mindedness of it?Oh well . . . like some disapointed movie fan I'll say, thats a few evenings of my life I'll never get back.
