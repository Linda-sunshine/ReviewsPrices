review/summary: Good Read!review/text: I had to read this book for an English project when comparing The Giver to The Scarlet Letter. It was a good book and I would definitely read it again. Lowry is a fantastic writer and I have read her other books, which of course were fantastic. Even though this book isn't that long, the plot is wonderful and exciting!
