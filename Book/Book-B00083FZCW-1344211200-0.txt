review/summary: A Fair Warning.....review/text: These books ae good. REALLY good. But if you start them, DO NOT go past the third book. All of them are out now, and the series sunk like the Titanic after he stopped writing and let his ghost writers take over. I can honestly say that if you start this series, and go on to read all of them, you may wish you never did. I do, and I LOVED the fist three.In short, if you must read them, stop at the third one and fill in the one blank he did not fill in it. If you are the kind of person who does not prefer to fill in his or her own blanks, that is fine. Don't bother with this series and do something worth more of your time. ANYTHING would be more more life fullfilling than reading how Patterson concluded this series.In fact, go to a Rest Home for the elderly, offer to clip their toenails, and save the clippings. THAT would even be worth more money than the last Maximum Ride installment.Don't want to take my word for it? Fine. Throw yourself into the black hole known as this series. Don't say I didn't warn you......
