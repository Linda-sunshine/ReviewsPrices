review/summary: nice book!review/text: I like having the entire trilogy at my finger tips and the beginning goes over somethings that i hadn't seen before in the individual books. Plus what a bargin getting all three books for the price of one; on the kindle this is great as the actual book is bulky and a bit cumbersum to handle.
