review/summary: Can't believe how much I loved the book!!!review/text: The one thing I noticed is 18th century communication.It was much more a part of life than the lack of communicationtoday. People thought before speaking, gained knowledgeabout another person through communication. It's sad to thinkThat now we text more, and communicate less.Sad, very sad.
