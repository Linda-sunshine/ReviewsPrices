review/summary: Not many books I enjoy re-reading ... but this is one!review/text: A reading experience for any age groupA classic to be reread and rereadThis book is brilliantly written. It is a classic read not just because of the storyline but the excellent writing, the wonderful readability. Lee gives so much social background and so much personal background by weaving it deftly into the plot. There is never that sense of blah-blah-blah pages that often annoy in current narratives (that strike me as author's notes that force the characterisation on the reader rather than it being gained by osmosis).This is an encompassing experience : such a vivid portrait of the times, of childhood, of growing up, of bigotry ... of so many, many things. It is a slow, warm, endearingly evocative insight into the world of the Scout, Jem and Atticus. I was sad to leave them at the end!
