review/summary: Required Readingreview/text: This book used to be required reading. It's the scariest book I ever read and it's becoming scarier as time goes on. Orwell was a true prophet of where we are headed; his timing was just off. While the book has London as its setting, the story could take place anywhere in the world. Despite the American Founders' best plans, America is heading in the direction of Orwell's 1984 world, tiny tiny bit at a time.The book is well written and reads fast. If you love America, you owe it to yourself to read this book. If you haven't read it and don't intend to, you are probably sticking your head in the sand, hoping things will be OK anyway.
