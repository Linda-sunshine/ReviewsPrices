review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: This is the first real novel that I read (25 years ago) and it remains one of my favorites. Tolkien 's easiest work to read has all the elements of great storytelling, folklore, and mythology. The movie does not capture the elegance of the descriptive style which Tolkien writes with. I highly recommend this book and the rest of his work to everyone.
