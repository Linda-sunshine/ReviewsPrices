review/summary: A timeless classicreview/text: This is one of the best stories of &#34;conversion&#34; ever written. It is very perceptive of Charles Dickens to understand the workings of the human psyche. He cleverly uses images from the past, present and future to evoke deep emotion in Scrooge to break his icy heart and bring him back into the human community.I also enjoyed the style of writing. It brought the period of time into sharp focus and drew the reader right into the story.
