review/summary: Well worth the money.review/text: I originally bought this to read to see if it would be engaging for my students - I LOVED the book and bought a hard copy which is looking well worn now that my students have gotten a hold of it. I'm being pestered to buy the next 2 in the series for them as they have really been bitten hard by the reading bug for this book - a teacher's dream come true!
