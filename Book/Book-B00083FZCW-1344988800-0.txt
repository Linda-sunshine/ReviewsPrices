review/summary: heads upreview/text: just a heads up to all the new Maximum Ride fans. DO NOT under any circumstances READ BOOKS FOUR THROUGH EIGHT. they were absolutely TERRIBLE but i think this was because JP origanally made Maximum Ride as a trilogy but people kept demanding more books so he made five more. but seriously they were AWFUL especially the last one and im certain others will agree with me. heres some advice..... read books one to three and totally ignore the others.
