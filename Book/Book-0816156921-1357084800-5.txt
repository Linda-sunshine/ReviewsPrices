review/summary: Worthwhile, though frustrating at times.review/text: The first and last portions of the book are the most compelling. I felt as though the middle portion would never come to a conclusion. The format was difficult for me to become accustomed to as it is mostly compromised of journal and diary entries, newspaper clippings, and telegrams.That said, I do find it to be a worthwhile read as it is interesting to read the book that so much has been based upon since. The characters, although two-dimensional in some respects, provide interesting glimpses into the concepts and stereotypes of the time. The deep conviction shared by the main group of characters towards the accomplishment of a most important goal is compelling.Give yourself plenty of time to finish this as rushing through it will only lead to frustration due to the format used to tell the story.
