review/summary: Classic Christian Literaturereview/text: Mere Christianity does not pretend to be systematic theology, but it approaches that. Compared to systematic theology texts, it is disappointing, compared to popular literature, it is deep. It is accessible to non-theologians and has several classic statements of Christianity.
