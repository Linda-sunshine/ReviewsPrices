review/summary: The best cat book ever!review/text: This might appeal to some people exceptionally people like me.This is one of the best books I have ever read. The good things about this book are that there is a number of small stories in the book and there is a bigger one at the end. The bad thing about this book is that there's a lot of strange names like Firepaw and Graypaw. Otherwise this was a fabulous book.
