review/summary: As a Man Thinkethreview/text: When I first ordered, James Allen's book, &Auml;s a Man Thinketh,I didn't know what to expect. When it arrived, I was surprised how few pages it had. I thought, something so profound should be 200 pages or more. The material was summarized and featured "straight to the point" thought provoking information and pointed out that where we are in life NOW our previous thoughts led us to our current existence. And if we want to change our current status, then we must change our thoughts. Our thoughts, become words and our words become action. - SOS Notes
