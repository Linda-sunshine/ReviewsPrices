review/summary: Not the writing it seemedreview/text: Tolkien's efforts, the third time around, seem to decline in quality as he goes along. The Hobbit I just reread for at least the third time, and it is well-written. By the time one comes to The Return of The King, his prose is stilted, seeming to mimic Malory's Morte d'Arthur and deserve the same kind of criticism Mark Twain wrote regarding Fenimore Cooper. Also, if anyone notices these things, in The Fellowship Sauron seems unaware of the existence of the ring, and doesn't know whether Gollum or Bilbo have it, and can't find the Shire. By the time the Return of The King was written, Sauron's existence depended on the Ring and he vanished when it was destroyed. I am not quoting but Gandalf does not seem to think the Ring is essential at first to Sauron's power but would prove disastrous in his possession, while later to destroy it is to destroy Sauron. Also he seems to know where Frodo is at the last when Frodo dons it. This may seem subtle to some, but you can't actually have it both ways. It seems as though Tolkien changed his own ideas about the nature and power of the ring, but never went back and revised his text.Him they sent thither. Sore hard were their travails. And thus he spake... this Malory pastiche belongs in the 16th century, or in Dante Gabriel Rosseti, but not in the 20th. I am surprised so many are sucked in by it. Still, "The Scouring of the Shire" finds Tolkien back in his best story-telling mode and sections like this make for great reading.
