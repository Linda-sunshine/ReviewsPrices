review/summary: Uncle Tom's Cabinreview/text: I had often heard the appellation 'Uncle Tom' applied to certain people, back in the 1960's, but had never read the book from which this term was taken. Finally, upon retiring, I had time to start reading those many books I had put off for so long, "Uncle Tom's Cabin" being one. I find it to be a powerful anti-slavery tract, extremely empathic to the suffering of the slaves and fascinating for the language and characters of the time. I am enjoying it thoroughly.
