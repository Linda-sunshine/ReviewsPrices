review/summary: Left me depressedreview/text: I just got this book yesterday and read it in one sitting, so obviously it DID hook me in. I tried very hard to understand why a couple of the five people chosen to "meet" were that important, but failed to see their significance. The story is about a man who had been abused as a child, volunteered to fight in a horrible war and returned from that war both physically and emotionally damaged - never to really recover. The story jumps around from his last moments of life to previous experiences to what he then experiences after his death, so there is no continuity - and for me, left huge gaps and questions. It seems he had mostly disappointments in life from start to finish with the sole exception of marrying his one true love - but even that didn't seem to hold much joy for him. He was stuck in a go-nowhere manual labor job that brought no satisfaction, was haunted by his experiences in the war and was left with chronic pain and disabilities. Albom could not have painted a bleaker picture of a life - and then this very weird "accounting" of it after he died - all just left me cold and depressed. I will have to admit that I am in the minority when I say that I also did not like "Tuesdays with Morrie" - I read the book and saw the movie. Maybe I need to just accept that Mitch Albom is just not my cup of tea!
