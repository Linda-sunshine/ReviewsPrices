review/summary: A classic story of adventure -- great for young adultsreview/text: I have read the book several times as a child. I decided to reread it before the movie adaptions came out to refresh my memory.The story was not as detailed as I remembered it being...I guess my imagination filled in a lot of blanks as a child.Overall, the story is a fast read and at a level that is quite suitable for young adults. The violence in the story is not graphic rather implied. It is not in the Drizzt vain of adventure stories (every sword stike described in key battles). The characters are interesting and well executed given the large number of characters in the story. The dwarves are a bit on the bumbling side which is counter to most of the ways dwarves are represented recently (short, stout highlanders).It is a great read especially on a cold or rainy day! This is a book/story that will last the test of time.
