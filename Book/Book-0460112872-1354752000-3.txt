review/summary: Jane Eyrereview/text: Sometimes we wonder just how little things have actually changed since that time. Family, love, relationship, friendship, on one hand; and on the other, backstabbing, scheming, rivalry, heartbreaks etc. All such things apparently do not lose their meaning and value over time, unlike technology, social establishments, cultural distinctions and class differentiation, to name but a few. The author masterly describes human nature in its various negative and positive aspects, thus subtly inferring the moral of the story, filled with action, tregady, drama, struggle, romance, affection and ultimate achievement. The main characters, who eventually fall in love through loads of trouble, are heroic in their development, however, realistic, emerging and aspiring, unselfish and memorable; whereas being quite natural modest and sincere since the very beginning.Overall, there is a lot of wisdom and sense in this lovely book. Something for anyone who is truly interested in personal improvement, good manners, real feelings and emotional intelligence, and last but not least, immaculate language and style.
