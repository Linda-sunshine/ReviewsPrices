review/summary: A wonder-full readreview/text: Alice in Wonderland is an interesting book about a little girl who dreams of adventures in another world. It all starts with Alice believing to see a White Rabbit go down a hole. She follows it and falls down into wonderland, where she grows on a whim and where everyone is "mad". She meets talking animals, moody royalty, and a hatter who believes that it is tea time all the time.All in all, it was a got book and I recommend it to everyone looking for either wit or fantasy.
