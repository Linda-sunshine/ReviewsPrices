review/summary: A Classic Novel at the Right Pricereview/text: I love reading the old novels, and to be able to get them at a reasonable price is amazing. I highly recommend this classic.I added the audio version done by Tim Curry, and loved it even more. I plugged in my headphones and was genuinely entertained while working on my Christmas projects. Thanks Amazon!!
