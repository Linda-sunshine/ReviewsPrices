review/summary: Charlotte Bronte Unsurpassedreview/text: It's easy to see why this novel is regarded as one of the greatest of all time. If you love classic English literature, Charlotte Bronte is unsurpassed in her command of the language. She delves into the depths of feelings of her characters which must have been especially gripping to her audience in the mid-19th century and indeed today. Well read by Juliet Mills.
