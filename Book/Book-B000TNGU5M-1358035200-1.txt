review/summary: Great Bookreview/text: Night is an excellent book that I would recommend to anybody that is looking for a nonfiction book. I read this book my sophomore year in high school and really do not think I got the full picture of it until I just read it recently for a writing class. This book really opens the reader's eye and shows how horrific these events actually were. I believe it is a very good thing that Ellie wrote this book so that everyone can see what happened in the past in order to try to prevent something like this happening ever again. The only thing that I wish he would have added to the end of the book was how it affected his life after he was out, but otherwise it was a fantastic book that I would recommend everyone to read.
