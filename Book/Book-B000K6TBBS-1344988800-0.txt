review/summary: A gotta read book...review/text: I am not a speed reader by no means but I read this in under 16 hours and tended to my daily chores...in fact I've read the Lee Child Jack Reacher series in order up to and including Running Blind in under a week...I was introduced to the Jack Reacher Legend by Diane Capri's You Don't know Jack then again in Jack and Jill that's when I went in search of The whole story of Jack Reacher...After reading Stephen J Cannell's Shane Skulley series, Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series and Robert Crais Elvis Cole (including Joe Pike series)I figure those are the 4 guys I'd want in my squad if I ever have to go back into battle, Let me add DKT Bryans Dillon Caldwell to that list ( got to have 1 seal on the team)...Like action read the previously mentioned novels
