review/summary: Pointless and awfulreview/text: Why adapt a work of art that is genius into a boring superficial version? It's not as if the original Frankenstein is so hard to understand, as are some "classics" such as Paradise Lost. It's an easy read and full of poetic imagery. I do not recommend this version. I see no point to it. Even a child could read the original.
