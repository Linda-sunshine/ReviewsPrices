review/summary: Wonderful tale!review/text: Wanting to preserve my late husband's four book series of the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings set, I purchased the Hobbit for my Kindle to read just once more before going to see the Hobbit movie. Having read the whole set multiple times, each time I come away with something different...a different perspective, different interpretation. This piece will remain forever spell-binding and timeless...will last throughout the ages.
