review/summary: The Mother of all revenge booksreview/text: My favorite book of all time. Dumas was a master storyteller and knew how to create a cast of tremendous characters. He put together everything you need in one marvelous story. The setting is perfect, and though a little too detailed for today's writing, it was necessary at the time when people didn't travel and see the world.Conflict permeates the book, and Dumas dishes out the suspense like a master, tossing a dash in just when needed.Every character has depth, lots of depth, and the plot is not only intricate, but devious. The mother of all revenge books. And who doesn't love a good taste of vengeance?Edmond Dantes ranks high on my list of greatest characters in literature, and Alexandre Dumas as one of the best writers.
