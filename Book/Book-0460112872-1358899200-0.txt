review/summary: Repeatsreview/text: I decided to make this year the year of the classics. This was the first one I chose and to be honest, I was disappointed for there were a lot of sentences that were repeated and many of the names of the towns were missing. However, reading about the trials and triumphs of a young woman and having love win in the end, there is nothing better.
