review/summary: Very goodreview/text: I really liked the story of the Nolens I thought they were a strong family. I did not like how it skipped around in the timeline. I thought it was so sad when Johnny died, I cried. Then when Sissy took in the baby, then had her own I was so happy! Overall very good!
