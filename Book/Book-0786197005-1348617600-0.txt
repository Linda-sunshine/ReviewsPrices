review/summary: One of the best Sci-Fi books ever written!!review/text: This is a classic, and perhaps one of the best Sci-fi books ever written. Are there more sophisticated sci-fi books out there? Sure. Are there more modern books that are more topical? Of course! But for sheer enjoyment and old-fasioned fun, A Princess of Mars is a CLASSIC. It may seem outdated, but then you have to realize it came before all the other stories and really is an original. See the movie- it is outstanding, and without question the most under rated film of 2012!
