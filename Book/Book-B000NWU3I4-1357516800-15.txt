review/summary: Nothing better than an old friendreview/text: I read this book 40 years ago as a boy - completely enthralled! Later came the Lord of the Rings, but they never replaced this first taste of Tolkien, as magnificent as they are. Now, after Hollywood has taken some imagination out of my Tolkien experience, this book returns me back to the true middle earth and the experiencing of the adventure as if it were the first time! I'm thankful to Peter Jackson only that he has driven me back to the real master storyteller!
