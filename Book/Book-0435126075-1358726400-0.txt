review/summary: I enjoyed this bookreview/text: The story line is good but the writing style takes a little getting used to. Jane Austen writes in long complicated sentence structures that sometime required me to reread a time or two to understand. I consider it a good mental exercise for my aging brain. I will continue to read her works.
