review/summary: Unforgettable Story of a Familyreview/text: This book popped up on some kind of must-read list recently, which I thought was a little odd. All I knew about this book was there was a movie version, which I vaguely remembered seeing part of on TV as a child. I got the book from the library and was immediately entranced. This story of a bright, sensitive child growing up poor in Brooklyn in the early 1900s is also a story about family, the strength of women and the value of love, hard work and education.This book is so honest about the weaknesses and flaws of its characters as well as their good points. In addition to the story, which draws you along to see what happens next, you learn what it was like to grow up in this hardscrabble environment and in this time. But it's not like a boring history lesson, but a fascinating feeling of being "in it" and exactly what it was like to live on pennies a day. I was worried it would be sentimental, but it's just the opposite.From reading the material that came with my copy, apparently this book started out as autobiography and the author was persuaded to fictionalize it. Perhaps this is why it is so heartfelt. It was also marketed as for adults, but it could be read by 14 and up in my opinion (there is some adult subject matter, but it's only dealt with on the level of a child's understanding.)This is one of those books where you're gulping it down while at the same time wishing it would never end. There are so many parts I related to as a wife, mother and daughter--it's timeless, while being very "of a time."Perhaps the best compliment I can give is that this book made as huge an impact on me as Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House books. I can't believe I never read it before, and if you haven't, you need to!
