review/summary: Reread every decade or soreview/text: When he's in the mood, Ray Bradbury can raise his prose to the level of poetry. This entire book is in that surrealistic style, beautiful to some and maddening to others. As the years go by, Fahrenheit 451 becomes ever more prophetic. For me, the most haunting theme is that this is not some 1984 style dictatorship. We subjugated ourselves through apathy and fear of anything different. Recent hits such as &#34;Feed&#34; by M.T. Anderson are deeply in debt to this novel.
