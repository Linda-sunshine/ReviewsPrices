review/summary: Time to re-think this classicreview/text: I originally read this book in high school, but I purchased this e-book to refresh my memory for the new Gatsby movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio coming out in the near future. The only thing it refreshed about my memory is that it's an extremely boring book with syntax that is hard to follow.
