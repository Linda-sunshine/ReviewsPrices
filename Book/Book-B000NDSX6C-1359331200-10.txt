review/summary: Tolkien one of the best!review/text: It has been many years since I originally read the Hobbit and have watched numerous movie adaptations over the years, but I decided it would be one of my first digital books to read. I now remember why I've always watched the adaptations. Tolkien is a great writer and I'm am enjoying the book again after all these years.
