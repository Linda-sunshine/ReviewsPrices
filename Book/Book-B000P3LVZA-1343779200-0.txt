review/summary: Not as good as 1984 but more realistic for those in the Western Worldreview/text: I read this after reading 1984. It took a while to get into it and I wasn't as gripped as I was when I read 1984. It seemed to advance at a slow pace up until the death of Linda, and then following that it ended rather quickly. The best part of the book is the dialogue between the Savage and Mustapha Mond. A lot of things came sharply into focus at that point.While 1984 showed us a picture of Totalitarian control through force, and intimidation, Brave New World shows us Totalitarian control by making it's citizens so happy and well entertained that they willingly forgo their personal freedom. But the great cost is that they lose their dignity, morality, personal connections, and emotions. In other words they lose their humanity. People will do anything to be happy and will even give up the truth, that's where Soma comes in. Huxley's world is one where the primary good is happiness and stability. Truth and happiness are incompatible, as are freedom and happiness. Yet I kept thinking that it was a false choice. But that does depend on how you define truth. Huxley's book is in some ways more of a satire than a dystopian society. It carries a liberal consumer society and powerful state to it's logical conclusion. Like 1984 it reminds us to be wary of giving governments too much control and power, especially over new technologies. Those who wield power seldom relinquish it and most frequently use it further their own ends, even at the expense of others.I enjoyed the book and it was a lot less gloomy than 1984 - even with the terrible ending! It's one of those books everyone should read.
