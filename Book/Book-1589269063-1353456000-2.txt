review/summary: Nice For Opening Up Communication With Partnerreview/text: This book is a testament to the fact that every person we meet in an intimate situation is different. "Different strokes for different folks" as they say. I love the way the author laid out the different love languages with case studies and everything. I easily identified my own love language, and it was really an eye opening experience. I think that the love languages system is a good way to open up communication with your mate as to what you both need from the relationship. It's straight forward and not too out there so that anyone can relate. I would definitely recommend this book if you want to better understand yourself and your mate better.
