review/summary: Moby Dickreview/text: Moby Dick by Herman Melville is a captivating book that takes you on a thrilling journey as you follow a sailor by the name of Ishmael who is a sailor on Pequod, a whaling vessel. The ship is commanded by Ahab who is determined to kill Moby Dick, the whale that took away one of his legs. This book picks up momentum as you getter farther into it, building up anticipation until it is almost too much to tolerate. This book is well written and is one that I would recommend.
