review/summary: Books are much better than movies!review/text: It was disappointing to me what the movie producers did to this book! The movie would have been great without all the extra fighting and computer imagery they added. Granted, The Hobbit would NEED computer imagery, however they went over the top to make it exciting. As usual, the book is much better than the movie.
