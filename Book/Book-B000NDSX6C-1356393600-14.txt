review/summary: Great, and some further recommendations!review/text: I loved this book in my childhood and it was the "one" (excuse the pun!) which set me to loving fantasy. I suppose you could say this is entry level, which then leads to the more mature Lord of the Rings Trilogy - just like the Harry Potter books seemed to get more and more complex as the series went on. Anyway, it's a great first step into the fantasy genre and will immediately make you aware of the pretenders out there; In fact, annoyingly so. I now spend my time looking for something as great, but still original. This has led me to the likes ofPerdido Street Station (New Crobuzon)by China Mi&eacute;ville,13 1/2 Lives of Captain Bluebearby Walter Moers and the excellentInto The Treesby J Alastair Nash. Just knowing those names has save you hours already!
