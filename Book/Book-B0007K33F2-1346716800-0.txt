review/summary: Count of Monte Cristo - Must Read!review/text: I highly recommend reading the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo. If you pick the abridged, much shorter version, then you will miss countless secrets, meticulous acts of vengeance, and a great love story. Any reader who is seeking adventure, violence, revenge, love, and glory should read this story. Yes, it is a long book, but they are pages well worth reading, each and every one.
