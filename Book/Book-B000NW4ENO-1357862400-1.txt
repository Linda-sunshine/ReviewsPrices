review/summary: Gone With The Windreview/text: Gone With The Wind is timeless. Though the movie gives an overview of the book, there is so much more that is revealed in the book. It reveals much more about each character; it gives a background about Tara and its acquistion; it gives more insight into the relationships between the characters. The historical era is described so that the reader can understand the southern culture of that time. I have read the book at least 5 times, and each time I get something new from the book.
