review/summary: So much better than the moviereview/text: I've now read this book twice. I read it some time ago and when I found out that this is the book that they made the Tom Cruise movie &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; about, I read it again. Now most books are better than the movies they make about them so the fact that this one fits into the same category is no surprise. But Jack Reacher is such a great character, and his physicality is such a part of it, that the little Tom Cruise is just not up to the task! Anyway, this review is about the book, and like most of the Lee Child Jack Reacher books, it's just terrific.
