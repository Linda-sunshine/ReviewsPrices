review/summary: A Timeless Adventurereview/text: There are many strengths to The Hobbit including it's great writing, characters, and overall length. I especially enjoyed the plot of the book. It is expertly paced to with the chaotic moments separated by clever conversations and character development. I was hard pressed to find really any kind of weaknesses in this book, which is part of the reason that it is known as a classic. One of the negatives I found though was that of the 13 dwarves in the party, really only half of them are actually useful and have an important role in the story. I cannot even remember hearing Oin and Bifur's names being used in the story besides the beginning where they are introduced and the end. Another small issue I found with The Hobbit was that how Bilbo was able to expertly fight off many different beasts and creatures with his sword even though he had no past experience with one. However, these are extremely minor flaws to an otherwise amazing tale.
