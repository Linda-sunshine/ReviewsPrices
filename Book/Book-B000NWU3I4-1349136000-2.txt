review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: The book was purchase for a 24 year old Birthday. She wanted it as a collectors piece on her mantle but on occasions just be able to pick up the book and read. She thought it was brilliant and so did I. She adored the cover and had it firmly planted in her hand (in a padded bag) as she boarded the plane.
