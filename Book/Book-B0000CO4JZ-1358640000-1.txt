review/summary: Thre Great Gatsby returns!!review/text: I loved the book but didn't reallize the print would be so small and light in this edition(paperback). I had not read the story before and thought it was much different from the older films. It will be interesting to read it again just before the new film is out. For older eyes, I would recommend another printing.
