review/summary: A Priceless Piece of Americanareview/text: Of all things, I discovered this book while watching the Tom Hanks/Spielberg Mini-Series Band of Brothers. Picante is handed the book by a fellow soldier who is asked, is it full of blood and guts and gets the answer, it's not that kind of book. Rather it is about a smart young girl growing up in a tough tenement neighbourhood of Brooklyn who at one point assumes a fake home address so she can get into a better school. Reputed to be autobiographical the book is told matter-of-factually without pathos or appeals for sympathy. If it isn't on every high school reading list already it should be.
