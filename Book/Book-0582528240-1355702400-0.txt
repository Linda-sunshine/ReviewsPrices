review/summary: True Lifereview/text: In the novel "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" a young boy Huck forced form his home with a kind widow into the abusive home of his father is made to run away with an escaped slave. Huck escapes from his fathers iron grip into the woods where he is faced with the difficult choice of befriending a slave or turning him in. The two traveling mates go down the river and work together to survive and they become extremely close. The relationship that grows throught the novel between Huck and Jim stands out in my mind. I like the part where Huck realises how much Jim means tohim and even if it means he may go to jail he will do it to save Jim. This reminds me of ignorance and how people teach their kids ignorance, but that child can still rise above and make better judgments on their own. I think that the moral is important. The fact that a child can realise and judge right from wrong better than their parents with their pure mind shows that ignorance can be stopped and racial equality can be spread. I did not like the part where "the king" sells Jim so that he can have money for alcohol. The author's message is that racism is cruel and unjust and everyone deserves a clean slate to be judged on personal qualities and actions not skin tone. I would recomend this book to juniors because they learn about U.S. history which entitles slavery and that era. I would not recomend this book those without open minds.
