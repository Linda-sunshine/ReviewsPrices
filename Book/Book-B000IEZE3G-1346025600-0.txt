review/summary: I Admit It!review/text: I admit that I truly loved this book and the entire series. Rowling keeps the story moving at a fast pace, she creates such a unique universe that is truly (yes I'm going to say it) magical. There is a masterful blend of sweetness, conflict, suspense and delight in these stories. I highly recommend these books to the ten people that probably haven't read them yet ;)
