review/summary: Required reading in collegereview/text: This book was required reading in college and now 20 years later it seems to take on a different kind of meaning for me. The second read was so much more than I expected. The book helped me be more appreciative, less judgmental of others and gave me insight into life and how to deal better with what life throws at me. We do have choices about how we think.
