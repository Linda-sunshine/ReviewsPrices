review/summary: Disappointed in Serialsreview/text: I was looking forward to reading this story in "episodes". A lot of people here were complaining about the long wait time, but I used to wait a week for podiobook chapters and figured this would be like that.However, when I downloaded the book, it downloaded all released chapters at once! Now the experience is ruined for me. At the very least, Amazon, give the user a choice to download the next chapter early rather than ruin the serial experience by lumping everything together.
