review/summary: Haven't finished so I can't say for certain you understand... but here are some fun facts.review/text: When I first read this book I was... in grade school, and I was too young to appriciate it. Now I'm in college, and I think it's great. So here are some fun facts about this book. When Herman Melville first published this book, it was a flop. No one bought it. They said it was... too deep, no pun intended. Back then long books weren't popular, short stories were, so his publisher told him to stop writing books like this - books that are full of allusions, metaphors and all that good stuff. Melville said, in essence, screw you guys. I like writing like this. And so he was all but kicked out of the literary world. He stuck around, don't get me wrong, but no one would read his works. Now of course Moby Dick is considered the greatest book in American literature. So should you read it? Yes. It is a great book; very well written; well planned. Of course you need to understand that books were written a bit differently back then, so be prepared for... well, something completely unlike Hunger Games.TLDR, if you like literature you will love this book.
