review/summary: My favorite book of all timereview/text: When I need comfort, I turn to Pride and Prejudice. Elizabeth Bennett is one of my personal heroes, and Darcy is an excellent match for her.The first time I read it--when I was 17--I was keenly aware of the brilliant comedy in the book. As I re-read it again and again over the years, it still makes me laugh, but it also makes me think of Jane Austen herself, and how a woman whose life was so circumscribed by her circumstances could manage to create such an astonishing array of characters, with such depth.Don't miss it. And for goodness sake, DON'T CALL IT A ROMANCE! It's a comedy of manners.
