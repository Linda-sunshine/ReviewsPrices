review/summary: Amazing book for every couple!review/text: I really like this book. It doesn't complicate things or give a lot of very specific things to try. The author presents the concept of the love languages and really leaves it up to the reader to translate the idea into his or her own situation. I like this book for several reasons. First, is that it doesn't make the book too long. Most people could read this in a day or two. Second, I have found that a lot of books get bogged down in the "try this, and this and this" part of the book and most of it is only going to work for a small subset or the people reading the book. Third, he never lets his ego get the best of him. Many books I have read can tell you all the specifics of a concept or idea but then immediately follow it with, make sure you are working closely with a trained professional. Immediately making the reader think that it is impossible to do any or even part of the concept on their own. This book is really the presentation of a concept and nothing more. That means it is open for your own interpretation and the author leaves it up to you to figure out how to make this work in your marriage.This book is wonderful and I would recommend it to everyone, even if the marriage was stable. Everyone can decide to love their spouse a little better or make some changes to their love strategy.
