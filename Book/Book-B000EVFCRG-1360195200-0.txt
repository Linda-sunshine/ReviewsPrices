review/summary: A classicreview/text: I read this classic when I was a kid. Now my kids have all read it. Easy enough for a child to read and be entertained, yet it stretches their skills a bit. It's also written well and has enough complexity to appeal to adults as too. It's of the rare ilk that appeals to a wide audience with equal success.
