review/summary: Self-help scamreview/text: As others have said, the message of this book could have been delivered in about two pages max. Granted, the premise is interesting, and I got some insights from examining how the 5 Love Languages play out in my own life. However, I did that BEFORE I read the book, based on a short review of it.The book itself is awful. It is superficial, anecdotal, opinionated, self-promoting drivel. It wasn't even worth the trip to the library, much less buying.
