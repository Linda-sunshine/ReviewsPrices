review/summary: Classic American Novelreview/text: I got this a for a special class in the novel. It arrived in a timely manner and in perfect shape. The book is a wonderful story.It was made into a movie in 1973 with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. Good choices for the characters in the book. It will come out again as a remake in summer 2013 with Leonardo DiCaprio. Should be a winner. Read the book first and you will find the movie much more satisfying. Of course the book is taught as a classic in American Literature in thousands of high schools and universities every year. Annual sales now are greater than the total sales during the authors entire lifetime! Nice income for his only daughter I think.
