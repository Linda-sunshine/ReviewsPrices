review/summary: Excellent story!review/text: What makes a great book is great characters and that's what I found in Harper Lee's, To Kill a Mockingbird--great characters! I loved Scout, Jem, Dill, and most of all, the gentle Atticus. It's a classic novel that I am so glad that I took the time to read.
