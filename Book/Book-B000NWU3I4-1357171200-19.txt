review/summary: Excellentreview/text: I bought this book after seeing the movie because I didn't want to wait to see how the story ends, and I didn't feel like digging out my paperback copy. And to be honest, I haven't read many books recently so I was kind of worried it would be like the last two books I tried to read and id lose interest even though I know it's a good story ahead of time.I couldn't have been more wrong.
