review/summary: Atlas Shrugged - just so-so.review/text: I bought this book because I was told that it was a good story about capitalism. Obviously it was fiction and in my opinion it was just exactly that - fiction. I didn't think it was realistic at all and it did not live up to my expectations based on what others had told me. Others liked it a lot, but I thought it was just &#34;okay.&#34; Knowing what I know now, I would not buy it.
