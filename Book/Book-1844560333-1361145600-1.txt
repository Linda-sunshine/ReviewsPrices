review/summary: I can read it over and over.review/text: I recommend this book for all to read if you are a romanticist. This book is about chivalry, friendship, total loyalty among sisters and most of all true love over coming obstacles of power and money. I love the part when she is confronted by the Aunt and all her responses. She is sharp to the point and remains a Lady.
