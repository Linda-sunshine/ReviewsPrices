review/summary: A Trip to Mars or how to spend a rainy afternoon.review/text: "A Princess of Mars" is a sci-fi adventure story. It's the first in a series of stories about the red planet. We first meet our hero John Carter in the wild west. For some reason he is transported to Mars. Here he meets the incomparable Dejah Thoris, his friend Tars Tarkas. We learn that Mars has many types of inhabitants who, living on Mars don't get along with each other. We also learn that Mars is a dieing planet.The story has all the elements of a typical adventure story: a damsel in distress, the knight in white shining armour, foes to be defeated. As this is the first in a series, Carter is essentially a one dimensional character with all the attributes we expect our hero to possess. That being said we turn the pages as we follow our hero on his adventures. The book ends with a cliffhanger: does Dejah Thoris survive? will all the inhabitants of Mars survive?The book is much better than the film version. And what may be unfortunate is that the film will deter readers from reading "A Princess of Mars". Don't let the film stop you.Just get comfy, open the book and enjoy the ride.
