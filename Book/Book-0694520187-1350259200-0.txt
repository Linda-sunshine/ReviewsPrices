review/summary: I am now a whalerreview/text: I give credit where it is due... Melville knew his subject. All of that knowledge, however, weighs down the story. There were times when I drifted away, forgetting about Captain Ahab and his fervor to find and kill the white whale and thought I was listening to a manual on how to be a whaler. I feel now I am trained well enough to go on such an expedition, that is what I carry away from the story. Which is sad, for this voyage that Ishmael has taken on by chance, his friend Queequeg and above all the maniacal bent of Ahab upon the Pequod seeking revenge is so diluted that much of its impact is lessened.No doubt, this book is a classic full of thought provoking themes. At times it's enjoyable. But the intent on reading it is not to become a whaler. Remove that third from the book and the ill-fated seafarers' voyage resonates as a deeply emotional metaphor.Volume and rate were good, reader was engaging.
