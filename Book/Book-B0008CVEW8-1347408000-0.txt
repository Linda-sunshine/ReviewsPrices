review/summary: The fundamental work of Adventure.review/text: This novel is one of the best novels written in this genre. It has been turned into every imaginable type of media. Plays, musicals, operas, and a movie adaptation by the Muppets.I don't need to go through a detailed analysis of the plot. Nearly everyone knows that. The contribution this work makes to pirate lore is legendary. Everyone in the culture knows of Captain Flint and the quest for the treasure. The Black Spot, et al. demonstrates the complete cultural penetration this work has. It is a masterfully developed one. If you know of the previous matters, and have not read this book, do so, you will enjoy it.
