review/summary: Good Book, but i needed something more...review/text: It was a good read. The fast paced story and short chapters helped me read this in one sitting. I like the idea of the story and i like Max, but i feel that the story had to many "holes" in it. Although it is a series, i feel like the first book in a series can determine whether someone continues reading it or not. I felt that there wasn't enough depth in the characters. Also i felt the story was wasnt consistent. Some parts of it were written so well you could feel the mood of the situation; the tension, or the relief, but other parts felt rushed. There were some moments were i had to re-read a sentence, because some things had happened so abruptly.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER:[like when Ari died, although i understood it was supposed to be a quick death, i felt like it was too rushed, right after Max killed him she left. Furthermore it was hard to feel any sympathy for Ari when we knew so little about him. " at that moment i thought to myself "wait, thats it? He's dead?" i had wanted to know more about him.)SPOILER(END) SPOILER(END) SPOILER(END)In this story, i just wanted more, more depth, more emotion, more detailed interaction between the characters. Im not saying this book is bad, if it was i probably wouldnt have finished it. It just disappointed me at certain times. What i was expecting and what i got were two different things. I just didnt think the characters were going to be so short with each other. No one asked what happened to max when she went to help elle, or even what happened to her after talking to the man that was supposed to be a "father" to her. Or ask what actually happened to Angel in the lab. I am most likely going to read the second book because i do like the overall plot and i want to see what happens, maybe i might see more of what i wanted in the next book. Only time will tell.
