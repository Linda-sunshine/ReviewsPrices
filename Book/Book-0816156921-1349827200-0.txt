review/summary: best vampire book ever writtenreview/text: Loved the style and pace of this book. The author builds suspense, I think the diary entry style adds to this. There is excellent character development and you feel like you're in the setting with the characters. Its funny but at this late date you know most of the Dracula lore but the book somehow makes it fresh. Love the character Van Helsing.
