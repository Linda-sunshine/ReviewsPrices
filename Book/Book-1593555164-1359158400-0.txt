review/summary: One Shot - GREAT !!review/text: I have enjoyed all of Child's Reacher books. For whatever reason you really become entranced with this character. The plots and characters are all very believable even if sometimes on the fringe and the action is great, but Reacher is the cement and he's well worth the price of all the books in his series! Wish it didn't have Mr. Cruise on the cover. I mean really, the books were great and selling like crazy long before the movie!!
