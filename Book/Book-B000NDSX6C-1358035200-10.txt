review/summary: A genius creates a world.review/text: JRR Tolkien is the author of all authors. I balk when people compare his series to Harry Potter or dare I even mention it...Twilight. JRR Tolkien has created a masterpiece with his world that he created for the Hobbit, LOTR, Children of Hurin, The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales etc.The amount of detail and historical chronologies are absolutely amazing. The stories aren't bad either. The Hobbit is probably one of his easiest reads.
