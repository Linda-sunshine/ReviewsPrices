review/summary: Great story, awkward progressionreview/text: As this was meant to be a children's story originally it's understandable that this wasn't developed to take you from beginning to end in a expected transition but to be picked up each night in a segmented manner. The character dialogue which was at the time supposed to have been left to imagination rather than exact is rather awkward as well as the continual jumps from one scenario to another though they are great stories, it feels pieced together.
