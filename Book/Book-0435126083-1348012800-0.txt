review/summary: To read or not to read...review/text: Admittedly, I saw the PBS Masterpiece Classic version of this story before ever picking up the book. My reasons are my own but I have to say - neither disappoint. Though it's no surprise that the two stories are different in many ways - the book version is so visceral and touching. It's no wonder that since it was first published in 1847, it's never been out of print.
