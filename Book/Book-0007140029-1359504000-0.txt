review/summary: Hawkbeak speaks: the beginning of the BEST SERIES EVERreview/text: Im a fan of redwall, legend of the guardians, but warriors will blow you away. I started reading these in 5th grade and understood them entirely. Some may complain about it having too many characters, but I think it adds to the story. In this book, the main character must figure out whether a clan hero is actually a murderer before its too late while protecting his clan against intruders.SPOILER ALERT;)Summary: Rusty becomes Firepaw and trains to become a warrior. He becomes BFFS with Graypaw. Another friend Ravenpaw believes hero Tigerclaw to be a murderer. He is fearful that Tigerclaw will kill him for knowing about this. A Shadowclan cat named Yellowfang is taken prisoner. Enemy Shadowclan cat Clawface sneakily kills Spottedleaf. Though the blame is on Yellowfang, Firepaw goes to Shadowclan with some other cats and sends the tyrant running SC. out of clan territory. Yellowfang is proven to be innocent and stays with the clan as medicine cat. Ravenpaw flees from the camp with Firepaws help. Firepaw becomes a warrior named Fireheart. Graypaw becomes a warrior named Greystripe.END OF SPOILERSorry for any timeline glitches... to find out what really happens, you have to read the book!!!Thank you Erin Hunter for such an amazing series!!!Windclan deputyHawkbeak
