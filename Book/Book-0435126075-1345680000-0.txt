review/summary: Maybe the best constructed story of all.review/text: What sets this work apart from many others is that the story is so well focused that one does not lose track of any of the main characters. Really, there is no need for sequels because all the loose ends are tied up. For that reason, Austen has given us a remarkable masterpiece.I will not go into the plot, you need to read it, but just know that this book is at one time a fanciful and a serious examination of the lives of women in the neoclassical era.
