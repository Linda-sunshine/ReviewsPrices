review/summary: The book I never read in highschoolreview/text: There were a multitude of books I read in high school which allowed me to become the engineer I am... basically saying English was never my favorite subject. However, ever since I went to college, I have a new found love for reading stories . This is one of many books I have never read and chose to because of the movie that is about to come out.My heart goes out to Gatsby. Good story!
