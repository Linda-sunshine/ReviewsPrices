review/summary: Reading the classic Draculareview/text: I am glad I took the time to read this classic! It was well-written and gave insight into Victorian ideals. A note of warning to modern horror enthusiasts: If you are looking for a gory slasher tale - this book will disappoint. I might also add that the only video version of Dracula that comes closest to this book is the BBC's 1977 version of Dracula.
