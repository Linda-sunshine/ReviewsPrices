review/summary: Beautifulreview/text: This book by Charlotte Bronte is wonderfully written. In it, the reader will find a vividness in the descriptions of English gentry life. The poignancy of the storyline will envelope the reader and submerge them completely in the pages of this classic book. The love between its main characters and the trials it goes through will enthralled romanticism at heart.
