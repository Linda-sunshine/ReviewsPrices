review/summary: Not goodreview/text: The writing is not especially good. The underlying philosophy is contrary to Christian values (yet this is oddly very popular with conservative Christians). I honestly had to force myself to finish this. It is a cynical view of life that reflects an extreme "me first" view of humanity. How that meshes with the words of Christ (compare with the Sermon on the Mount, for example) or any religious tradition or humanistic view is totally unclear to me. Unfortunately, the children of the greatest generation (the baby boomers) have instilled a sense of extreme self-centeredness in our society. The hippies became Regan era yuppies and then morphed into angry and aging tea party members. The self-centered objectivism philosophy meets the needs of this very spoiled generation perfectly.
