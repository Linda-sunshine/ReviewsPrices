review/summary: Probably the greatest Book EVER!review/text: I wish i would have read this book when i was in High School. It would have saved me years of being a sheep.This book was written 60 years ago and I am amazed that I hear and read the same lines word for word that were in this book.It spells out exactly what is happening to our world, and one way that it could end up if we let it.If you believe in the greatness that we as a society can be, read this book.
