review/summary: Astouding literature but unnecisary reviews.review/text: J.R.R. Tolkien is one of my prefered authors being, along with Homer one of the greatest authors of all time! But while the story itself is excellent I have to ask, why do people continue to comment on the binding and illustrations when this is the kindle edition which lacks illustrations and you only have abinding if you bought a case!
