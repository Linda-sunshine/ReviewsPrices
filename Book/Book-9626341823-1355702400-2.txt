review/summary: Charles Dickens always has a way of getting the truth over!review/text: One of the best, I must say. Charles Dickens just blesses my heart. When I read a Christmas Carol, I was truly touched; anyone reading this story should grasp the concept that we all need to love one another: That includes sharing, helping, and just being kind. The best way of getting it over to the reader that as a person one should live so that a happy afterlife is ensured is the ghost voice of Marley, Scrooge's partner. Marley had lived as a tight grasping old man, just like Scrooge. He died, and Scrooge is the heir. Scrooge takes over, but he is NO BETTER than Marley. He is such a greedy, stingy person that even the dogs hate him! He has not friends--PERIOD. And then...one day...On Christmas Eve, Scrooge's nephew drops in to invite him over for a Christmas dinner. In his usual manner, Scrooge dismisses the young man with his usual 'humbug' word.That night, he is visited by Marley's ghost. Scrooge is not a scary man. He talks to Marley as if it is nothing, but inwardly he is a bit shaken. What really scares him is when he is told by Marley that he will be visited by the ghosts.Marley is right.First, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past. Then the Ghost of Christmast Present. And last...and scariest...of all, is the Ghost of Christmas Future. In a short while, he shows Scrooge what will happen to him if he does not change his way. And he shows Scrooge his own grave! Imagine being shown your own grave! In the end, Scrooge has a complete transformation. He is no longer stingy or greedy. I like to think that he devoted the rest of his life to helping others. Now, I don't believe in ghosts, but I sure do think that this little ghost-like story is one of the best!
