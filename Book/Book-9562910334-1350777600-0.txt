review/summary: ORWELL 1984 5 STARreview/text: 1984 ia a depressing and frightening book because it has been such an accurate prediction of the future to date. It illustrates the danger, alluded to by Dwight David Eisenhower, of the military industrial complex of a paranoid state running out of control. It seems ludicrous to think of the Ministry of Peace as concerning itself with matters of war until we reflect that in the US the Department of Defense (DoD) was formerly the Department of War (maybe soon the Department of Peace?). Ignorance is strength? Silly? Just look at our public school systems. Peace is War? Impossible??? Afghanistan is the longest war in US history intended to protect the homeland and give us peace and you can tell the current right wing "Oceania" is chomping at the bit to get us embroiled in Syria, Iran, or North Africa (preferably all of the above simultaneously). Slavery is freedom? No way??? Just watch the masses enthralled by the words of the right wing media not so un-remeniscent of the old news reels from Hitler's Germany. All we need to finish it off right is to have a daily two minute Hate and a Hate Week like in 1984 and we'll be good to go! Yes, Orwell saw it all coming back in 1948. He got one thing wrong though when the protagonist Winston claims the only place you can't be seen is in the dark (he never thought of infra-red cameras and satelites that can read a pack of cigarettes from earth orbit). 1984 is like reading tomorrow's newspaper today. Great piece of literature! The only fault I see is that it was advertised by Amazon as a novel when, in fact, it is a documentary.
