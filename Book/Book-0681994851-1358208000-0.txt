review/summary: Classic Brit Lit at its bestreview/text: I was weary of this Book because it seemed so long winded. However, much to my surprise I ended up enjoying it a lot! It is an awesome love story with many twist and turns of events in the plot. Charlotte 's writing is something I had to get used to, but once you are past that the book is actually really good! I had to read this for my English class and I think that it's a great novel that anyone can enjoy. Love all of the characters too!!!
