review/summary: Fiction or self fullfilling prophecy?review/text: An eye opener vision of how far big government, big business, and any dictator can control apathetic people and societies when we decide to go with the status quo. We don't want to lose our jobs so we accept compromising what is right -- it gets easier every time. How about putting the fun and easy things in life before fixing the things in our nation, neighborhoods and families that are failing. More laziness leads to freedoms lost when peoples of a nation live with the mindset of let the government take care of us , let's trust them to do what is best for us without complaining when the loss of our freedoms are disappearing ,slowly, but usually in the guise of - being told these laws will be better for our safety, our pocket books, the health of the earth etc... Apathy to the extent of having 1+1=3 be an acceptable "reality".... we reap what we sew and a whole nation sewing apathy seeds in their lives every day paves a path to our own destruction.Look at what is on TV we have shows telling us vampires, big foot, werewolves, zombies etc... may be or are a reality , how many people believe this nonesense... again I say we reap what we sew. Orwells 1984 is well on its way to becoming reality and noone cares enough to ban together in thought and ideals to say 'no more' . The USA constitution reminds us that people are willing to suffer all kinds of evils and do nothing until the suffering is absolutely unbearable. That in my opinion is the reality of todays' America. And it is the picture so clearly painted by George Orwell in his book 1984. I would give the book a 5 , it deserves a 5 , but my heart cannot stand the thought of the horrors my grandchildren and great-grandchildrens lives will be if we pass them our legacy of apathy - sheep led to slaughter, by the actions (or nonaction) of our own laziness.
