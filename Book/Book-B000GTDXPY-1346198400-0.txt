review/summary: For Fun.review/text: A good beach or plane read. Fun and funny in many places. I did want Tressa, the sleuth, to get on with it sometimes and thought, she isn't that dumb and then she'd be dumb! So for an easy, don't have to think a lot, plane drone leading to sleep, this story can be fine.
