review/summary: a work of genius on Kindlereview/text: George Orwell's genius and prophetic book does not need my review. I would only mention that Orwell made also a scientific and sociological discovery that is valid in today's world: If you change the very meaning of words, if you change the language, you are able to change the society. Newspeak can destroy the Western civilization. Change the very meaning of words 'justice,&#34; &#34;freedom,&#34; &#34;fairness,&#34; and we will be in the Stone Age in no time.Kindle addition looks good, and its new X-Ray feature is interesting and helpful.
