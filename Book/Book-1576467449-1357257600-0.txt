review/summary: Oldie but Goodiereview/text: I got into reading a lot this past fall and haven't been able to stop. I read in a couple of different series one of the main characters mention reading a few old books from Great Britain. I decided to read them to see what I was missing out on. I love this book. I never care for endings... that means I have to find a new book!!! LOL but this has up, downs, twists and turns; I am so glad I took the time to read it.
