review/summary: Great work of fictionreview/text: A lot of right wing commentators got carried away with treating this like it's allegory for modern washington political dysfuntion. Rand was a polarizing figure as well. When the book is kept in context it is a great work of fiction. I don't espouse Ayn Rand's philosophy of objectivism, but I'm still drawn to the characters in the book -strong willed, industrialists, intelligent, and driven. What's their not to like for a Texan? Irregardless of whether you agree with objectivism as a personal philosophy I think Atlas Shrugged is one of those books that can change your perception on life, which is always a good thing.
