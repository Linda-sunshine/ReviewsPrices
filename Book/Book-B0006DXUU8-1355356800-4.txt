review/summary: Classic book with lovely illustrationsreview/text: A Christmas Carol is a classic book and a timeless story and one that everyone should read at least once even if you have seen various versions of it on film. I bought this for my Kindle Fire and read it along with my son. He had to read it for a school report. It was great having an extra copy to read along with him and his book didn't have the lovely illustrations that mine had. I was able to share those with him as we went along and they added to the story. All in all a wonderful story that still holds true for today's world and highly recommended.
