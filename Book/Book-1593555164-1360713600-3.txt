review/summary: Jack Reacher at his Bestreview/text: This is an amazing story from start to finish. It is the best suspense that I have read in quite a while. Jack Reacher is a lone wolf. He is a solver of problems. In addition he gets thinks done. The story is like running a sprint but you find yourself in a marathon and you have to go the distance if you are to survive. Throughout the story it seems like you are standing right next to the main character seeing what he sees and thinking what he is thinking. It is quite a page turner and I would strongly recommend it to readers who love stories of who done it and what happens next. I read this story in a sort time because I could not put it down once I had started it. It fulfills all the requirements of a great suspenseful thriller! So enjoy! You will glad you did!
