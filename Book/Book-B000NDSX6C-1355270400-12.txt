review/summary: Great Readreview/text: I read the LOTR trilogy many years ago 2 times. Finally getting around to The Hobbit.I wish the issues about the rings corrupting influence was covered in this story -- its not really.There is nothing bad about this book. It's 100% the most up-to-date version of this book, it just says &#34;(movie tie in)&#34; at the very top of every page.
