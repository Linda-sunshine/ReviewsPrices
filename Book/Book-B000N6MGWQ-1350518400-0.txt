review/summary: Amazingreview/text: I saw the movie to this book about 6 years ago and always wanted to read the book! The book was just as compelling as the movie! I always felt that everything had meaning and purpose in life. As a person that lost their mother 24 years ago, i always questioned why and how can a child lose their mother at such an early age? And it took many many years to accept what happened and eventually realized that everything has a purpose! This book just solidified that belief! Great book!!!
