review/summary: Love love lovereview/text: I love this book. What an introduction to the series. At first I thought the avian mutation concept was too sci-fi for me but who am I kidding?! I love sci-fi an this book fed into my imagination. Great, quick and easy read. My children have all read the series as well.
