review/summary: okay, average mystery bookreview/text: This author tried to please too many people with too many "understories". The attempt to portray the heroine as a struggling Christian wanting to improve herself, and the perverted "religious" leading man who whored after everything female was unbelieving. I believe that in the case of this story the "sex" scene seemed forced. The story its self was not bad, but I hate it when a romance novel tries to fight for the lead in a mystery book and I feel that this author did not combine the two well.
