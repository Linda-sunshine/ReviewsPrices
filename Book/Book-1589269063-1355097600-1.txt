review/summary: Serious help for all of usreview/text: Even if you and your spouse are fine, this book can help. If you are engaged or thinking seriously about marriage to someone, USE THE BOOK. It walks you through a series of exercises and thought provoking and conversation evoking pages. Something I learned, the test is subject to interpretation. By this I mean I looked at the test to define what I always need where my fiance looked at it from the prospective of what she will need more of in the future because I was providing a number of the things already.
