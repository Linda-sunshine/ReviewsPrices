review/summary: Lovereview/text: I absolutely think that J.K. Rowling is the J.R.R. Tolkien of our time. She is imaginative, clever, exciting and all the things that a person could want in a story teller! These books span age and intelligence. I think her stories can make anyone feel inspired. They have depth character conflict and all the things a great book requires. Sure wish it was me that had this talent.
