review/summary: Fantastic reading.review/text: Was guided to this story by the program "The Will" on I'D. Had never heard about Toole or his two novels; but wow this is an incredible read. Truly enjoyed the humor along with the brilliance. Too bad the publisher kept rejecting this amazing book before John Kennedy Toole committed suicide.
