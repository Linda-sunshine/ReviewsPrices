review/summary: A Must Read For All Marriage Bound Couplesreview/text: I wish I had read this book early in my marriage. I gave this book to my own children once they ventured into serious relationships. Even after 25 years of marriage this book opened my eyes to the reasons why love is so often misunderstood and difficult to keep alive. Read this book and you will find the reasons why your partner is not accepting or feeling the love you are communicating to them. In addition, you will learn how to explain to them your love language and what they do that speaks love to you.
