review/summary: Quite goodreview/text: It is a very nice book, and it's free aswell, but it could have pictures (ok so I know that's not really possible, but still you would have thought that they would have found a way to do it) and also, when the mouse is telling his tail/tale, it isn't diminishing in size or going in a tail shape like in the book. Other than that it just as good as the book.
