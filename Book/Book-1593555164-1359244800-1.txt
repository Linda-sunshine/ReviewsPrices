review/summary: LET'S SHOOT SOME MORE BAD GUYSreview/text: I HAVE READ ALL 14 or 15 Jack Reacher books. This is my second time through them ... Steinbeck they are not but good stories they are. Everyday life is full of injustice and power plays at all levels of life. The whole premise of good and evil is sharp and clear cut in Teacher's world ... true escapism. Child writing is crisp and clean - fast moving. Worth the time I invest.
