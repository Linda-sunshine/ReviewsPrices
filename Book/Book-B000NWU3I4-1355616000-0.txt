review/summary: A map, the book, and GOLD PAGES :Oreview/text: Any fan, or non fan will love this. First of all, it is a great book. Its like the size of a pocket bible or koran. I love it because it is small, and on the back of the front and back covers, there is the map they have in movie. It is the best gift, I wish someone bought this for me, but I had to buy it myself. Also, the pages are outlined in Gold. So...its pretty darn cool.ONE PROBLEM&#62; since it is smaller, the letters are obviously smaller to make it fit on the pages. So if you need glasses, or are pretty weak in the eyes, I suggest getting the bigger book, just to make it easy on your eyes.
