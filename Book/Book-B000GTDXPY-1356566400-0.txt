review/summary: I was surpirisedreview/text: I read some of the negative reviews and thought that this book would be a bomb, but I actually liked it. My favorite parts is the banter Jane has with Joseph and their attempts at sleuthing. My slight disappointment is that Rick could have been a little more mature in how he approached Jane.
