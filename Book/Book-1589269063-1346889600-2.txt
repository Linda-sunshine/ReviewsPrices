review/summary: The 5 Love Languages should be read by EVERY couplereview/text: After 50 yrs of marriage I now understand why some periods of the last 50 yrs seemed like we weren't communicating on the same wave-length but we have come through the tough years and learned that it was worth 'hanging in' for the long haul. With a grandson getting married soon I believe this is a good book for them to read.
