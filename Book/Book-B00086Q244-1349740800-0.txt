review/summary: Some Things Never Changereview/text: This is the type of book that you can read at any age, in any era, and still receive vauable insight. Along with this book, there are a couple easy-to-read books that can help to: 1)something like God: Six Weeks to SpiritualityandThe Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenmentcome to mind. Everything preached in this book is attainable and super simple... it would be a great replacement for some of the "history" books I read in school. It should be mandatory reading before one graduates high school.
