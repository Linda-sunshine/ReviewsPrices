review/summary: Wonderful book.review/text: I read this book when I was probably 12 years old. I'm now 18 and I still haven't forgotten this series. I would finish 1 book in a few hours because I couldn't put them down. I've read everyone in the series and this one is still my favourite because you get to read about both sides uglies and pretties. I;m not going to write a synopsis on the book because I don't want to spoil it and I think it should encourage you to read it for yourself. I recently bought this for an 11 year old girl who loves to read and I think she will like it. Now I'm not sure if it will appear to older audiences because of the language used for the book but it's worth a read if you like action and futuristic stories. As a side note, the cover of the book has changed and I don't really like it because I feel it looks very girly and the other one didn't so now it doesn't appeal to a wider audience.
