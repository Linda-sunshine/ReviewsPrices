review/summary: Very Quality PB Editionreview/text: There are many different paperback versions of LOTR out there but for my money this is one of the better ones. I have recently started doing my thesis work for my MA and I needed a PB version that I could make notes in (I didn't want to write in my 50th anniversary HB version). This edition has fantastic weight and feels very sturdy. It feels like it will hold up well over the years, which is great because I read LOTR at least once a year. It is not a showpiece, being paperback, but it does have a very nice look to it and will work beautifully as an everyday reader. If you're looking to get into LOTR, or if you just need a new copy and don't want to purchase one of the more expensive hardbacks, this is a good edition to start with.
