review/summary: Night by Elie Wiese lreview/text: I think everyone should read this book. I read alot but few books touched me as this one did. I think that the period of time just a few years prior to my birth in 1946 had events so unbelieveably perpetrated by human beings that they must be revisited often to revalidate that the events were indeed fact and not fiction. The book reaffirms the strength of the human spirit.
