review/summary: A little bit prejudiced......review/text: I am, I will admit. I've read this book at least four times and it never gets old. My first experience was when I was 18 and I am now 59, I've never had a problem understanding or following the story. I think mid teen and older would enjoy this story. It is a great break from my normal reading of historical mysteries and Christian romance.
