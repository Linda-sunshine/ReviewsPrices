review/summary: A Fantastic Classic that One Must Readreview/text: This book stands in sharp contrast as to compared to the books of today. It is the culmination of many different ideas and genres that boggles and astounds the mind and leaves the reader wanting more. Frankly, the inclusion of the scientific inquiry throughout the novel only adds to this feeling. To think that Verne was capable of creating such a masterpiece, adding pieces that may have been before his time (or at least in their infancy)is a true masterpiece. I highly suggest this book to anyone looking for a long and satisfying read.
