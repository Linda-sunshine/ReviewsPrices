review/summary: A touch of brilliancereview/text: Brilliant writing. What a use of the English language. So rich and complex. It takes a while to get into her writing stylewhich is so sophisticated and witty.Besides her use of the language which makes &#34;american English&#34; so much more pitiful, it is incredible how she weavesa fascinating tale, page after page, on the basis of a very simple story: i.e. boy meets girl.One is constantly in suspense and the level of eroticism is so high without even a hint of touch between the twoprotagonists for more than half the book.
