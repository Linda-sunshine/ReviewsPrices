review/summary: Awesomereview/text: This book was AWESOME. I had to read it over the summer for class, and I was totally bummed out because I had already spent half the summer reading other really old, lousy books for the same class, but I really liked this one! It went fast, which I liked, even though it was on the long side, and it was just really cool. The storyline was different, and though I was sort of expecting some of the events, they were still surprising and realistic. The end was also really interesting, and I wasn't expecting it to end how it did. Read it, it's a classic, and it's really good!
