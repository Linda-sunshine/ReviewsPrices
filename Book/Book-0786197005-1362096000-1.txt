review/summary: Funreview/text: I had watched the movie based on this book, and thought I might as well go to the source. It was fun, and of course differed vastly from the film. It is however dated to the time period in which it was written. Dejah Thorris is of course completely helpless outside of the realm of politics, and can't help but fall in love with the all powerful southern gentleman.
