review/summary: Comparisons between this and the movies.review/text: I was curious how the new movie would break up this simple story into threes, so I re-read the original to see what I thought would happen. I must say that so far, after viewing the first movie, I was correct in my first assumption. It will be interesting to see where the breaks will now take place between the next two movies and if it follows my guess. I also hope to see some things left out of the Lord of the Rings being addressed, but not to the detriment of the timing of the storytelling. We'll see . . . .
