review/summary: A Good Story Hampered by Writing Style and a Lame Endingreview/text: So many others have commented this way or that on the pros and cons of the prose, but in the end a book is only as good as it makes you feel.I liked the story, but I felt the author's constant jumping back and forth in time, and from reality to fantasy and back, to be annoying. Just as I would be getting wrapped up in the story, the author would slam on the brakes and take it in a whole new direction...and for only a paragraph or two...and then leave it up to the reader to try to get back on track when she returned from her digression.And I did not enjoy the ending. I won't spoil it, but suffice it to say that it was one of the weakest endings in a dystopian novel that I can recall. Especially in this genre, I do not expect...nor want...a happy ending, but this was something entire unique and one that I did not appreciate after having spend the time reading until that point. It felt tacked on, as if the publisher asked the author to come up with a better ending than what most people think, erroneously, is the ending.Enough people liked this novel, so I can't recommend avoiding it, but do not get your hopes up too high.
