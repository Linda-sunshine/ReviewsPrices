review/summary: One of a Kindreview/text: I won't repeat all the good stuff others have said about this book. But I will say this:This was written in the fifties and is still the freshest idea in literature. Why aren't there other books like this? Why are there so few stories where the rich CEO inventor is the good guy (only recently are there stories like "Ironman" popping up) and the government liberal Robin Hoods are the bad guys? For about my entire life I've felt something is terribly wrong with the Hollywood template of rich evil business guy vs. poor good community organizer guy. So much has always been left off the table with this done, redone, and overdone formula. Atlas Shrugged is one story--one tiny attempt--to balance those scales.Read it for a breath of freshest air.
