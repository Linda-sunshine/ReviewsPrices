review/summary: An Absolute Classicreview/text: What can be said about this book that hasn't already be said?Of course, this is an amazing book. The story is fantastic, whimsical, engaging, and has a moral depth uncharacteristic of many modern novels. It is considerably lighter both in content and length than The Lord of the Rings and is meant generally for a younger audience, but that does not affect it adversely. I won't go into too much detail about the story itself. I'll just say that if you haven't read it, do yourself a favor and do so! I'll focus the rest of my review on the version that I bought.I got the Hardcover released on September 18, 2012, which has a green cover with a little &#34;Now a Major Motion Picture&#34; emblem over one of Tolkein's illustrations of Smaug. The binding and physical quality of the book is, of course, more than satisfactory. It includes a decent copy of Thorin's map, although it is spread over two pages, and thus some of the center of the map is lost. I would have preferred to see a fold-out map. It contains some excellent illustrations by Tolkein at various points in the story, including a drawing of Bilbo's hobbit hole. Overall, I have no issues with this physical manifestation of Tolkein's immortal story.5/5
