review/summary: Loved reading this againreview/text: I had read Uncle Tom's Cabin years ago as a required read in school. Fifty years later it was fun to read again and to enjoy in a much different way with an appreciation for the time in which it was written. I have decided to re-read many of the classics with a different set of eyes and experiences with which to see the wisdom of the writing.
