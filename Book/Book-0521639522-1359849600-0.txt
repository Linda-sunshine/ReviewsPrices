review/summary: Classic & Cleverreview/text: The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde was witty & clever. It's comment on social classes and "being proper" was very interesting and there always seems to be an old over-bearing aunt or mother in these sort of classics to make sure everything is kept that way. I found it an easy, quick read and did so in one sitting. I think everyone should read a classic like this at least once in their lives.
