review/summary: It's okayreview/text: I found the book an easy read and simple to follow but I did not get drawn in as some books do. Friends told me I would love it so I was anxious to start reading it. I kept waiting for the part that I was going to love but it never happened. I did not hate the book but it's not one of my favorites.
