review/summary: A great book, lovely illustrationsreview/text: I'm a fan of A Christmas Carol. I have both print and electronic copies. I was glad to find the illustrated copy in an e version. It's easy to read and the illustration enhance the reading experience. If you haven't already purchased it, do so promptly. You won't be sorry.
