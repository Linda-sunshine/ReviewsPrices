review/summary: I missed you Middle-Earth!review/text: I first read LOTR back in 2001 in order to watch the movies and at that point, I also read the short version of the Hobbit that comes with The LOTR. Since then I have doubted that I'd like this book but now that the movies are out I decided to give it a chance.I just wish I had given it a chance before! I really loved reading about Bilbo, Gandalf and all other Middle-Earth aspects all over again.My only complaint is that it could have been longer, because now I'm just longing for more Tolkien.
