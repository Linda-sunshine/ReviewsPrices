review/summary: Was on my Bucket Listreview/text: Have always wanted to read this and finally doing it. I am only about 20% into it but am enjoying it and finding it hard to put down. Had seen the movie but as in all movies the book fills in the gaps! Definitely recommend: A good insight to English life style along with a good read.
