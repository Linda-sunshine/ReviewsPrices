review/summary: See the moviereview/text: Great Gatsby is required reading often in college, but why in the world did my book club choose to read it? We all have masters degrees and above and are all teachers or retired teachers and we had no clue what was going on in this renowned book. It was short and wordy. That is amazing in itself when you think about it. I even knew the story from having read it in college and didn't understand much of what I was reading. I had to go on schmoop after (a great site with summaries of classic novels) to find out what I was reading. This is a classic but far from what I consider great reading. I guess I am going to stick to newer choices after reading this or see the movie when it comes out in December.
