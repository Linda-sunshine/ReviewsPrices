review/summary: The Five Love Languagesreview/text: A friend told me about this book when I was complaining about my son and his decision to end an engagement with the girl of our dreams. I have been so wrong. After reading this book, of which I ordered and received five copies, I knew I was wrong. I immediately called him to apologize. I did not go into detail, but did send him and her each a copy of this book. I also sent a copy to my daughter and her husband of two years. They are in that rough patch when the honeymoon is over. I pray they will read it and work it out before making a decision to end the relationship. It is so easy these days to just walk away. They did take the test online and found out their Love Language. That is a start. Thank you for writing such a clear presentation of how we can all live and love together. Even after many years of marriage, my husband and I read it. It has put into us a new kind of thinking. We are a lot closer. Thanks again, Keep writing. Ty
