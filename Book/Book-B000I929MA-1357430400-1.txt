review/summary: Creepyreview/text: This book really made me feel upset a few times while reading it. The way the women were basically ousted from the adult world of actually having a job and family was crazy. I wouldn't have done well in such a place. I feel the lack of control would be the most difficult thing to deal with.My only real criticism is the ending was super abrupt, but other than that the story was interesting and scary to think if that were to really happen it would be hard to want to live like that as a woman.
