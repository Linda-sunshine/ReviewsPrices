review/summary: Treasure Island, by Robert Louis Stevensonreview/text: I have never read the book until now, I had only seen different versions made into movies. The books are generally better than the movies and I wanted to see for myself. The movies are close to the book but cannot include every detail of the book. This is a classic good read.
