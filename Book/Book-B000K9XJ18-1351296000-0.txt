review/summary: A different Teacher storyreview/text: I really enjoyed the story, but this one is a little different. A little more cerebral"whodunnit" and a little less action. Jack must also resolve issues of growing roots vs a nomadic life style. Book is still fast paced and won't disappoint the Reacher fan
