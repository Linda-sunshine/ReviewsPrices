review/summary: Cliff Hangerreview/text: I normally dont read Stephen King novels so this was a first for me. I book did keep my attention but I was never sure where the author was going with the story line. Then the way he finished the book was a cliff hanger. There was no answers to the story line. He left you hanging like he might write another book.I was told that this book is what the TV series Haven was based on. Personally I dont see it other than the name of the missing person is The Colorado Kid.It one of those books where you need to read it for yourself in order to make an opinion.
