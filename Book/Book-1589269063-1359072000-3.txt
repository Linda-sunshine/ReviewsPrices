review/summary: Amazingly helpfulreview/text: Relationships fascinate me. How do people come together and stay together?This book is how they do it.Once the real relationship starts, it is a choice to be there.It is as simply as not being selfish. Choose to do things that fill their love tank and they will do the same for you.Never do anything for the person you love with the expectation of reciprocation.Truly learned so much about myself and well as my husband.I would recommend this to everyone, whether you are happy in a relationship or not.
