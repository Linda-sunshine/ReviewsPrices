review/summary: Great Classic and Illustrations Make it Betterreview/text: The Kindle Illustrated Hobbit edition was a quick decision to refresh the memory of Tolkien's work and compare it to the recent motion picture release. Tolkien's Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogy are classic fantasy adventures that are thoroughly enjoyable, and the e-book Kindle experience makes that very convenient whether using a Reader, Smartphone, Tablet, or Computer, or any number of them in concert. (Tolkien's Silmarillion &#34;pre-quel&#34;, however, is a much harder read). This Illustrated Edition of The Hobbit adds to the overall experience, especially if reading to children.
