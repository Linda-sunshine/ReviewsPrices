review/summary: Stature Countsreview/text: I've read all of Lee Child's books with relish. It is always an engaging read...and suspenseful to the end. Not sure I want to see the movie...with Jack Reacher's stature of 6'5&#34; and stocky to Tom Cruise's 5'7&#34; lean and short stature...AND although I admire Tom Cruise's acting, it's a wonderment as to to casting's choice with such a physical difference. Part of Reacher's personality is defined by his stature. (Sigh).
