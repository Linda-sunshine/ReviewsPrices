review/summary: THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!review/text: A very dear friend of mine insisted I drop everything and read this book immediately! I was a little reluctant to do so as I was always mistakenly under the impression that "To Kill A Mockingbird" is an old-English, Shakespearean-like read for highly educated scholars. I wouldn't understand a thing of it and be bored out of my mind, was what I thought. Oh boy, was I wrong.This is undoubtedly one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life. Never before have I fallen in love with so many characters in one book, as I have in this one. For as long as it took me to finish this book, I was part of a close-knit community in a small town, with all its daily ups and downs. I walked in so many characters' shoes; I got to see every facet of human nature from various angles. I have experienced every emotion a reader could possibly get out of a one-of-a-kind book, and I grew as a person.Someone once asked me to define a "talented" writer. I had many answers to that question, but in hindsight, the answer should've only been this: Harper Lee is the epitome of a talented writer. Her writing is pure liquid gold and it leaves you in awe.If you haven't yet read "To Kill a Mockingbird", you haven't yet experienced ultimate reading bliss. You can take my word for it. I highly recommend this unforgettable, thought-provoking, beautifully-written, delightfully charming book to absolutely everyone. No matter what your age, no matter what your genre preference - you have to read this book! It's a classic for a reason.
