review/summary: A great read!review/text: If you are a Jack Reacher fan, you won't be disappointed with this book. If you are not a fan, read this and you will be. Lee Child makes Reacher the most believable anti-hero you will ever encounter. And the best news is that there are many other Child/Reacher novels to keep you entertained.
