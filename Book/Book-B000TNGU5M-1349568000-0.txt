review/summary: Excellent Bookreview/text: I bought this book at the end of my freshman year for my summer assignment, and I'm definitely glad that I had this assignment. This book gives a good perspective on a young boy who had to suffer through the Holocaust and how it changed him. Plus, I liked the author's writing style. I received the book in excellent condition, and it still is in excellent condition (I'm now a college freshman, so it's been a while [:) Anyways, I would recommend this book to my family and friends, especially if they want to learn more about the Holocaust.
