review/summary: Simply Beautifulreview/text: I bought this as a gift for my mother. The clssics have always been in our house but all of her's are worn paperbacks, that are probably over 20 years old. So when I stumbled across these beautifully covered books I was so excited. I wanted to buy all of them and I hope they aren't a limited edition, because I would build a library of classics with these. The book comes with a built in bookmark and the cover is a perfect fit for this beautiful story!
