review/summary: A Companion to Your Biblereview/text: If you are a serious student (or believer who wants to drill deeper into the Word) of Christianity this is the book for you. As someone who is never shy about discussing his faith, I often hear comments that I am unable to answer as well as I would like. Such as, "I like Christ as a teacher, but I don't believe he is God." Or, "Christianity?---don't need it. I try to be a good person."And of course, "Don't judge me!"But there is more to it than that. His discussion of Good and Evil and interpretation of Bible verses will light you up. Sometimes, however, reading Mere Christianity you'll feel that you fall short of the Christian ideal. No need to despair.Paul himself reminds us to spend our time thinking beautiful thoughts: reading the Word. Singing hymns. Mere Christianity is just that---keeping our souls focused on a track of continued spiritual enlightenment. A must read and a permanent part of your library.
