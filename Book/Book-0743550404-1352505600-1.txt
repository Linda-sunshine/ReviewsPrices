review/summary: Thought provoking storyreview/text: Delightful story. It sets up an improbable situation and then ends, giving you no explanation. You are free to imagine your own solution to the mystery. Not King's usual thriller, but good nontheless. To add to the fun, the cover of the book offers no insight into what the story is about.
