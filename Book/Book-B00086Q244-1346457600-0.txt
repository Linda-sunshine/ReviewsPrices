review/summary: Dale Carnegiereview/text: This is a wonderful book on disc - I highly recommend it. It puts everyday life into perspective and creates an understanding of why people react the way they do to certain situations and suggests ways to handle situations differently. I've listened to the series in the past and wanted to do it again, as well as share it with others we know. You are never too young or too old to learn from it.
