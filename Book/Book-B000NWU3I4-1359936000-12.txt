review/summary: The beginning..... :-Dreview/text: Ah, The Hobbit. If you're a newcomer to Tolkien's fantasy world (and by that I mean books, movies, whatever) start here. Its the easiest to read of Tolkien's Middle Earth series, and arguably the most charming. The Lord Of The Rings is more epic, and the Silmarillion appeals to my love of history and mythology, but The Hobbit is just a darn good adventure. There are some differences in tone from the rest of the ME canon (talking wallets and beasts, for example) but nothing to get bent out of shape over. Read it. You'll enjoy it.And for God's sake, DO NOT say "I don't need to read it, I'll just see the movie." I promise you, however good the movie is (and it promises to be superb), you will enjoy it better with the book as a base.
