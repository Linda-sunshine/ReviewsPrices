review/summary: Awesome Explanation!review/text: Absolutely LOVE this book! It was such a revelation for me and my husband. We both read the book and found out that we do have very different love languages. This is why that we were starting to struggle as a couple, because he was showing me love in a way that made him felt loved -but not me. I was also doing the same thing. So we were both wrong. This showed us that we needed to express what made us feel loved and that way we could change our focus. He now knows how to show me love, and I know how to show him love. It has been a HUGE help. Now I am reading "The One Year Love Language Minute Devotional" By Gary Chapman. It is really great! It breaks down a day to day devotion to help improve your relationship while teaching you what God has told us about marriage. LOVE LOVE LOVE both of these books!
