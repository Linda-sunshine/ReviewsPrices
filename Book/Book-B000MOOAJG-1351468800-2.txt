review/summary: Heavyhanded but worthwhilereview/text: There are a few 'classic' books you're supposed to read, and "Atlas Shrugged" is one of them. I readThe Fountainheadyears ago, and knew I liked Rand's writing, so that gave me the courage to tackle a book of this length and depth.The heart of the story is the fight of three industrialists to keep their business alive in the face of a hostile socio-economic climate. They're surrounded by incompetence and greed, whereas their own motives - despite on the surface looking greedy - are more noble: to build, to create, to move life forward. Add in political intrigue, romance, and a dash of mystery, and you've got a story which manages to pull you forward through content more than four times longer than the other novels I've seen lately.Despite being published in the late 50's at the height of cold war paranoia, the messages within this book are surprisingly relevant today, and other than a few social differences (such as the role of women), it could have been written 10 years ago instead of 55.On the down side, Rand bludgeons you repeatedly with her philosophy throughout. I can't tell you how many times a character says "It's not my fault! I couldn't help it" or stonily accepts responsibility for fixing some cock-up. It's not enough to spoil the story, but it did inspire a few eye rolls, especially towards the end.The audiobook (which I listened to) is good, though the melodramatic nature of some of the scenes - an artifact of the era of literature, perhaps - can make them a bit less engaging. Still, a good narrative and I had no problem following transitions between different characters thanks to the narrator's choice of voices and skill in being consistent in providing them.
