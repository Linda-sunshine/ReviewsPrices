review/summary: An excellent read-works well on Kindlereview/text: This is probably the 4th or 5th time I've read the Hobbit-I wanted to re-read it prior to seeing the new movie, and as we were going out on a 5 week vacation, and needed to travel light, I got it on the Kindle. One of the big advantages of using the Kindle edition for those of you who like me, are rapidly approaching 60, is that you can readily adjust the font size. This makes for an easy read. Great fantasy book if you happen to be one of the few people not yet introduced to Bilbo Baggins.
