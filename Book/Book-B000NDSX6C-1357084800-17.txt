review/summary: A fun readreview/text: Although I have been a huge fantasy/sci fi fan since I first picked up a book, I just recently began reading Tolkien' s works. I read the fellowship of the rings and found it a tad difficult to get through as it took me awhile to adjust to his writing style and method of storytelling. I then began the hobbit after seeing the movie and I couldn't stop reading it. It's a classic that I think everyone should be exposed to. The only reason I didn't give it a five is that it read like a children's story and although that may be how it was intended to come across I found it confusing at first. All in all, the hobbit was fantastic and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre and is looking for a fun read.
