review/summary: Careful of child's age-mature subject matter-boy attempts suicide, discovers parent cheatingreview/text: My son is an advanced reader for his age so in third grade (8 years old) his teacher gave him this book as a reading assignment. I read through it and was surprised at the mature subject matter for a third grade school assignment. I love the idea of the story, a determined boy surviving and overcoming on many levels. At one point in the story however, he contemplates slitting his wrists to attempt suicide. My 8 year does not need to learn about suicide and methods to attempt suicide at this age and he doesn't need to read about a boy discovering his parent cheating on the other parent as a third grade school reading assignment. I think this may be a good book for a more mature audience but even the teacher was surprised at the content once I talked to her and she pulled it off the third grade book shelf. I gave it 2 stars because I believe it is targeted and marketed to the wrong age group. The school description says it is designed for boys age 10-13. I think a lot of parents of 10-13 year old boys would want the discussion of suicide to come up in another way rather than as a book assignment. Obviously advanced 8-9 year old readers in the school are being target with this book as well. Teachers and parents need to know the content so a serious topic like this can be discussed with kids rather than introduced in a book without any discussion.
