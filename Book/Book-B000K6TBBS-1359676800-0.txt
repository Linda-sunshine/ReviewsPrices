review/summary: Business as usualreview/text: This was a good Jack Reacher but not the best I have read. Child used too much, in my opinion, contrived misdirection to keep the reader quessing. I say contrived because they really added nothing to the story but to throw the reader off the scent. The sections about the mysterious person in the pentagon is my main point. Other than that it was a good read and held my attention to the end but has made me a little reticent to jump right into the next one.
