review/summary: The Only Required Read I was Glad I had to Readreview/text: It's true, when I was in school To Kill a Mockingbird was the only book that I was ever grateful my teachers made me read. Of course we had to read Catcher in the Rye, Of Mice and Men, Grapes of Wrath, etc, but none of these books ever spoke to me the way that this one did. I fell in love with the characters, time period, the conflicts that arose from wanting to do what is right when everyone is telling you to do what you know is wrong, and the perspective of this turbulent time in history from the eyes of a young girl named Scout. It's truly a classic that will never die.
