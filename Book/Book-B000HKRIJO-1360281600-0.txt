review/summary: I truly didn't know what to expect.review/text: I have had this writer and several of these books on my 'to read' list for decades. A health issue, which was misdiagnosed, made reading nearly impossible for the last twenty five years, though life has it's own way of taking up time in any case. I didn't know if these were novels, theological texts, apologetic tomes, or... just what to expect. The first book I read was Screwtape Letters. What a kick. My first book in 25 years, and a great one.Having converted to Catholicism, I did have some wonder about that. No, I am secure enough not to have been sidetracked or such, I just wasn't sure... if I would be... having to revisit too many old notions. That turned out not to be the case, and from what I have read, I would have no problems suggesting these to any Christian. Some things are simply... without origin, to a degree, and common to all. Actually, I would recommend these to all, save recalcitrants who might... learn somethings I would rather they not learn. :p
