review/summary: A Classic Talereview/text: I reread this in anticipation of the feature film, it is indeed more marvelous then my recollection. As an adult, having read the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, I find a new perspective on this classic tale. May we all be as heroic as Tolkien 's protagonist.
