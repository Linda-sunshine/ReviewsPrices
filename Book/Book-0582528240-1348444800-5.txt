review/summary: Hucks planreview/text: The most well known parts of this book are the parts where Huck and Jim are journeying down the river on their big raft, but as a Criminal Justice major I have to say one of my favorite parts of this books happened at the begging when Huck fakes his own death. I think this part really shows how smart Huck is for his age and how well he is able to come up with an elaborate, workable plan with the few items he had on hand to use. He showed amazing perseverance and dedication to hard work in cutting out a hole big enough to squeeze through with the small rusted saw blade. He showed clear thinking when after making it out of the house he did not just run off into the woods where he knew he would soon be followed probably caught. After deciding to fake his own death he paid great attention to detail in not only covering the hole in the wall back up, hacking the door to pieces, and adding the pigs blood but also in thinking to drag a bag of rocks all the way to river to help explain what happened to the "body". Then to top it all off he throws the dead pig in a different part of the river so it's not found by mistake. I really enjoyed reading how this young boy planned out this huge deception all on his own!
