review/summary: I figured out what "School & Library Binding" is!review/text: I bought this to have a hardcopy of this book for my personal library as I love this book and will read it again and again.The "School & Library" binding is something like a lightweight hardcover glued to the outside of a paperback. The overall size is slightly larger than the paperback, and the typeface is just as small. It will certainly hold up better than a paperback and it is a bargain for a hardcover but I can't say I'm impressed with the quality here. It will certainly wear well with me, but I'm not confident it is tough enough to last long circulating at a library.
