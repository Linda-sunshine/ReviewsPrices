review/summary: Amazingreview/text: I read this book as a child and when the new movie came out I wanted to read it again. Purchasing it on my kindle was easy and quick and I was instantly transported into middle earth. J.R.R. Tolkien is one of my favorite authors of all time and The Hobbit does not disappoint.
