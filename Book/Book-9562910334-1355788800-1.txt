review/summary: Great book, Great Price, but not so great formattingreview/text: I loved this book, but to be honest, I didn't read it in this form because the text was tiny and it was thick and unapproachable. I would get a different publication of this book, because it is a great read, but I don't like this one. I listened to this one as an audiobook, and it was AMAZING--get the one read by Frank Mullins if you like audiobooks, it was fantastic. Loved it, and recommend that version over this one.
