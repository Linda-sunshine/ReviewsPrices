review/summary: 3 STARS for actually forcing me to buy itreview/text: Having been in several "discussions" on Rand's "philosophy" and confused as to why she has so many supporters I felt obligated to buy the book, since my research has been limited to her life and NON-fiction.My critique of what I know of her is she was a bitter woman who screwed up her love life and died poor.... her ramblings have been picked apart by some youngsters calling them 'philosophy' at a time when our country was just beginning to show signs of what it has currently evolved into....the very same totalitarian society Ayn grew up in, and just as her philosophies have been called "angry", so are our youth today.In Nathaniel Branden's piece "The Benefits and Hazards of the Philosophy of Ayn Rand: A Personal Statement" he says, (EXCERPT)Later as I conducted more lectures and seminars, I met literally thousands of people around the country who described themselves as students of objectivism and admirers of Ayn Rand's books, and while I saw the great benefits and values her work offered to their lives, I also saw the dark side, the difficulties, the feelings of guilt, confusion and self-alienation that clearly seemed related, in some way, to the impact of Ayn Rand's work. Perhaps the evidence had always been there -- I think it was -- only now I was freer to see it because of my own growth and emancipation.Essentially what Nathaniel is saying here is young 'impressionable' minds, can be negatively affected by reading Ayn Rand, unless they keep it in the realm of FICTIONPsychopaths are born of too strong of a anti-societal belief...(Paul Ryan who said her books were required reading in his office is a perfect example)Mad Angel on FB
