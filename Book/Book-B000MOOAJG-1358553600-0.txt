review/summary: PROFOUNDreview/text: I have just finished reviewing another of Ayn Rand's books, THE FOUNTAINHEAD, and can only say how profoundly the meanings of these books have affected me. As I have mentioned in my other review, her books should be required reading in universities across the country. The heavy weight of the book might be a deterrent for some, but if a Kindle version is available that would solve the issue.&#34;WHO IS JOHN GALT?
