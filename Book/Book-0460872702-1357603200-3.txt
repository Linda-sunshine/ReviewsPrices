review/summary: The Mediocre Gatsbyreview/text: I read "The Great Gatsby" in high school, and now 20+ years later. I still don't get what makes this book so highly acclaimed. As a Christian, I do not condone the adulterous affairs portrayed in the novel, one character beating his girlfriend, nor the rumored illegal means by which Gatsby earned his wealth. Perhaps if I didn't care about those things, I would have felt more favorably about Gatsby and the other characters.I did find the narrator, Nick Carraway, somewhat likable. Nick observes all the immorality around him, and he seems to keep himself from being sucked into the abyss; however, his being seeing as an outsider was likely due to his modest means compared to most others in the story. I was happy to see Nick had a sense of honor about him and his chosen profession of selling bonds. It seems his independence separated him from the filthy rich, but he was friendly enough that people entrusted him with their secrets.
