review/summary: A Magnificent Story - Superbly Enhanced with Art (Finally)!review/text: I have read this story many, many times since I was 16 (and am now re-reading prior to the Hobbit movie release at the age of 50) and I continue to enjoy the story's depth, intrigue and mystique.While Tolkien was no slouch as a conceptual artist, the story this time is beautifully enhanced with the amazing art of Alan Lee. Throughout the book artwork is included at the beginning of each chapter, on multiple occasions within each chapter and especially at crucial moments of the story. For first time readers and children especially (Tolkien wrote the book for 8-10 year olds) this significantly aids in the interpretation of Tolkien's succinct and masterfully crafted descriptions of characters, the landscape of Middle Earth and the action scenes too!Tolkien fans and Lord of the Rings (LOTR) Movie fans will know that Alan Lee and another artist were selected by Peter Jackson and used as the principal 'conceptual artists' during the production of the movie trilogy, because he loved their art work and how they had accurately and creatively adapted Tolkien's words to portray his world and mythology. If you have the LOTR 12 disc box set - in the extras DVDs of the LOTR you will see that Alan Lee embraced the movie production beyond what he was employed for and has a true love of all things created by Tolkien and of Middle Earth itself. Alan Lee is a master conceptual artist and with a few quick pencil or brush strokes (e.g. sitting down in the 'proposed set' for the Hobbiton township) he quickly and accurately depicts Tolkien's vision of words into a picture or scene for all viewers to enjoy.This book has a significant number of detailed pencil sketches and superb water-colours of key events, characters and action. I have read this book on my IPAD which allows you to 'zoom-in' on each sketch and colour drawing (I presume the Kindle Fire has the same functionality) and you can interrogate what's happening or what Alan's trying to portray to the reader, in even more detail. Superb reading and enjoyment. Cannot recommend it enough.I also have Alan Lee's 'LOTR Sketchbook' compiled during the production of the LOTR, again another masterpiece of conceptual artwork; I hope as he was employed again as the conceptual artist for the Hobbit Trilogy that he will produce a 'Hobbit Trilogy Sketchbook'.
