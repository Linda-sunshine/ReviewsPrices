review/summary: A real classicreview/text: I had never read Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, although I was familiar with the story. I was very impressed by her use of emotional appeals and dialogue, especially after I learned that she wrote this book when she was only 18! The ending was rather far-fetched, but I found it to be a very interesting read.
