review/summary: Great Readreview/text: I have read this book many years ago, and enjoyed it then. Now that the movie has come out again I wanted to see the movie, but as always with this trilogy I wanted to read the book first. It is a great read. I highly recommend getting the audio book, just to hear the many different voices used for each character. That makes it all the more enjoyable.Joe B
