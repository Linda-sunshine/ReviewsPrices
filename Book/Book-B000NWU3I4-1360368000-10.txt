review/summary: A wonderful adventure for all agesreview/text: I read this book many years ago when I was a teenager. It became one of my all time favorite books. I've read it to my children, and now my grandchildren have enjoyed it as well. Professor Tolkien was an amazingly gifted and brilliant storyteller. His sense of adventure, humor, wisdom, and joy shine through his writing.
