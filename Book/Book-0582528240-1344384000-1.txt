review/summary: Incredible Adventurereview/text: Mark Twain is a genius! He took a supporting character from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and transformed him into an amazing main character and narator of this book. Huck Finn's feelings of his surroundings in the book are relatable to everyone, as we have all had to deal with a phony, a friend who is in trouble, and reuniting with an old pal. Twain uses history of life on the Mississppi River and a great story to create this unforgettable book.
