review/summary: Jane Eyrereview/text: This novel descends through such a passage if time, society and religious bounty that it never ceases to surprise me at how poignant it is. Love and human connection of so many a variety root this novel into deep soil that will always remain relevant. This was a refreshing re-read, and an excellent version for the kindle.
