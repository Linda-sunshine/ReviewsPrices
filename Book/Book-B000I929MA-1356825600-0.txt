review/summary: The Handmaid's Talereview/text: I can't add much more to what has already been said by all of the earlier reviews. But for me the story of Offred was disturbing and compelling reading. I felt fear for Offred in such a restrictive and suppressive society, where all moves and thoughts were monitored and viewed with suspicion.It's heartbreaking reading at times, but Offred's spark of rebellion shines through, she isn't completely cowed. Offred has her memories of her past her, husband and child although she doesn't always know their fate for certain.I was glad for the spark of hope at the conclusion, because it would have been a very bleak tale without it. A haunting book and difficult to put down.
