review/summary: Keeping Faithreview/text: I generally like Jodi Picoult. This one was pretty good but I've read some I liked a lot better. She is a good writer and writes about characters that you feel you have some empathy with and others not so much. This one stretches the imagination in the spiritual realm. I had to keep telling myself it was just a fanciful story from the figment of Picoult's imagination. At the same time it has something to say about children caught in the middle between parents in divorce.
