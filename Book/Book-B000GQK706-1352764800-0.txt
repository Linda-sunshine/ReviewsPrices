review/summary: AUDIO BOOK review. So bad.review/text: I love LOTR and have since I was a child. I also drive a lot for work now, so I listen to a lot of audio books. This LOTR audio book is the worst audio book I've ever listened to. In fact, it is actually painful to listen to. Many of the voice actors are either bad or annoying. The voice actor for Frodo sounds like a bad high school drama student reading a script. The sound effects seem to be made by someones Casio keyboard. Also, the sound level is so low on these discs that you have to crank up the volume then get blasted when you eject them. No matter how much you like LOTR, I cannot recommend this awful recording. I have the Hobbit and Silmarillion on audio book, and they are both much much better.
