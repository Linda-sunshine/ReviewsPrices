review/summary: Call me boredreview/text: Improve my reading material, I said. Expand my knowledge of the classics, I said. Might need the knowledge if I'm ever the Phone A Friend on Who wants to be a Millionaire, I said. Free on Kindle I said. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. Never a word or sentence used where ten - or twenty - will do intead. Achingly long and tedious, and downright boring (sorry Herman), the author refers to whaling voyages taking three years. Take this book with you, you might just get it finished.
