review/summary: Good readreview/text: This was a good read and I recommend it to those who enjoy the Bronte sister's work. I gave it 4 stars because although it is a good story, I found the characters themselves frustrating. This book is not meant to be skimmed for the character names overlap and it can become confusing if not paying attention. Also, I found it hard to relate to since we do not marry our cousins nowadays. That being said there are parts of this book I enjoyed immensely and there are some great romantic quotes.
