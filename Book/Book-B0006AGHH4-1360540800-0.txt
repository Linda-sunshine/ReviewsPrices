review/summary: Beautifully writtenreview/text: Harriet Beecher Stowe does an excellent job of connecting the reader to each of the characters. Her style of writing transports you into the story. This is such a beautifully written book that clearly defines what it means to be a true Christian and what our role needs to be. It is hard to read and imagine the awful horrors of slavery, but it is important to never forget.
