review/summary: I've always LOVED this bookreview/text: I have to admit this is not my first time reading this book, I've read it before AND seen the TV movie on it. And always loved it. Since I have not read it in over 10 years and had partially forgotten the story, I decided to download it and read it again. I had forgotten how wonderful and witty the writing style is.I took off one star because it is written as a play, in three acts, not as a novel. I find that makes it slightly harder to read. And because it was so short, 58 pp I believe. I could have wished for it to go on and on. I just find the writing style wonderfully done. Quite a funny book. Just written in a very witty way. I am a fan of this book and its writing and always have been.
