review/summary: The Hobbit Or There And Back Againreview/text: Meet Bilbo Baggins just your ordinary little ol hobbit that keeps to himself then one day is asked to go on an adventure with alot of dwarvs and a wizard follow along with bilbo in this amazing journey in the hobbit. this book was alot better than lord of the rings and alot easier to read. don't get me wrong lord of the rings is good but i liked the hobbit better. and now i can't wait untile the movie comes out on 12-14-12. it will be good. this is a awesome book. if you have not read this book then i recommend you do
