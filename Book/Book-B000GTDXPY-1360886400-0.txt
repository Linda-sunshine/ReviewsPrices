review/summary: Cute, Quick & Easyreview/text: Thought this was a really cute book. I like the characters and the snarky remarks back and forth between the Townsend men and Tressa. There were parts where she droned on in her head a bit too much, but overall it was a cute book. I will read more of Calamity Jane's adventures.
