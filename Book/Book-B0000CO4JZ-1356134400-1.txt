review/summary: A great book? Really?review/text: I am utterly baffled by the reputation this book enjoys. Fitzgerald seems to assume (rightly it would seem) that the mere evocation of fantastic wealth (shiny automobiles, lavish parties etc) will be fantastically interesting to his readers. A triumph of content over style if you ask me! Admittedly there are a few very brilliant passages, but overall I find the book's much-vaunted prose to be like iridescent steam, vapid and affected. There is precious little complexity of thought, and more of what I would call `sentiment' than genuine emotion. The symbolism is laughably trite (to take just 3 examples : the green light on Daisy's side of the bay, characters in white, and - last but not least - the celebrated Valley of Ashes (Oh come on now ! Give us break!)). The characterization struck me as hollow, and the dialogue stilted and unnatural. Very rarely was I able to hear real men and women. I could go on, but after reading what other readers have said I feel like a voice in the wilderness...
