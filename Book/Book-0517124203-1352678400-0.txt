review/summary: Alice in Wonderlandreview/text: THE weirdest book I have ever read in my entire life! It is wack! I know people rave about this book, but I really don't know why. It gives me a headache. Only reason I gave it Three stars is because, I'll admit, it is very interesting, but it's weird factor is WAY too high for me.
