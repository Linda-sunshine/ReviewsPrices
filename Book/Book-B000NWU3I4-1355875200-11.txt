review/summary: Awesome book!!review/text: I love this book!! I really didn't know what to expect, I just wanted to read this book before I saw the movie. I guess I was expecting a guy's book, but I'm fourteen and a girl, and I loved it!! It deserves five stars! I think this is a great book for people 11+, boy or girl.I wrote an earlier review before I saw the movie and I just wanna say the hobbit an unexpected journey is an awesome movie!!! Can't wait to see the other two!! &lt;3 LOVE!!
