review/summary: If you can read just one book in your life, this is itreview/text: I doubt there's any insight I can add to Ayn Rand's magnum opus "Atlas Shrugged" that hasn't already been said since its publication 55 years ago, but that won't stop me from expressing praise for this masterpiece.Ms. Rand said in 1963 that "the action of Atlas Shrugged takes place in the near future, about ten years from the time when one reads the book." This prescient comment suggests that the events in "Atlas Shrugged" are always symbolic of what could be the near future. Despite being published in 1957, the economic and philosophical arguments stated in this book are as relevant as ever.I was taken aback by the deep philosophical lessons in the book, including a 60-page monster speech by one of the characters that is a daunting yet enlightening read. However, "Atlas Shrugged" wouldn't be "Atlas Shrugged" without this heavy focus on philosophy, and is presented extremely well alongside the economic lessons that are the foundation for the storyline. The 1,168-page storyline may be intimidating, but the pages will fly by.In contrast to other entertaining novels you may have read and have promptly forgotten, Atlas Shrugged has important and influential lessons underlying the story that will stay with you for many years. Ayn Rand's classic is one for the ages.
