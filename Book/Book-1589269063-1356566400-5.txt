review/summary: Run, Dick, Run for Marriages!review/text: Who knew it was this simple? Dr. Chapman's idea of the five love languages is so simple, you'll wonder why you never saw it before. It explains so much. One note of caution: I made the follow-up purchase of the book for men, but it is really the exact same book. The differences are not worth the additional purchase. So, get this one or get the one for men (if that's what will make you more comfortable), but get one of them. Great ideas well presented.
