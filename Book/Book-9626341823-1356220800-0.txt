review/summary: Hated itreview/text: My bookclub was reading this book so I figured it was a classic and free so I would go ahead & "purchase" it on my Kindle. From the very beginning I was having trouble with the writing style. I trudged through thinking "this is a classic, everyone loves this story, it must get better". It never did. I only finished it for the bookclub. Otherwise I would've given up after the ghost of Christmas past.You would have to appreciate this writing style to enjoy this book.
