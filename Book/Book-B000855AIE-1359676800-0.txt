review/summary: Competent little book on how thoughts affect your lifereview/text: I purchased my Kindle version in 2010, and couldn't find the original product page, so this review speaks to the content of the version I read, not this particular edition.I know that this book is famous many times over, and so it feels a bit strange to give fewer stars than the hundreds of other people who rated it higher. Nonetheless, I do. I just don't think this is a 4 or 5 star book for its kind.There are many good statements in the work that are obviously true, but there are also more than a few statements and claims that are obviously just not true. I suppose if you paraphrased his words a LOT and said "Well, he really meant something like X, and the spirit of X is true, so his words are true." But then, you wouldn't be using his words, would you.All in all, it's a book worth reading, but for a higher star experience, I recommend you look elsewhere (egFranklin's Autobiography (Eclectic English Classics)orA Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy, or another book from my reviews).
