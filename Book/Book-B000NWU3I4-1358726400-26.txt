review/summary: Great adventure storyreview/text: This is the first Tolkien story I have read and I am very impressed. The Hobbit is a great book and I recommend it to young and old. I am not big on fantasy novels, but this one held my attention. I really grew to love Bilbo and his character. All together, great read!
