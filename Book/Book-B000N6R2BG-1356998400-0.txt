review/summary: Did not like any of the charactersreview/text: I felt the main character was too whiny and her ex is too self absorbed, just couldn't connect with any of them. I will try another of her books though as she does write well. I know that sounds like a contradiction but I can see her talent, just didn't like her characters.
