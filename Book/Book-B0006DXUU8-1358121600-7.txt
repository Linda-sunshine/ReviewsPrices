review/summary: A Christmas Carolreview/text: As far as Christmas traditions go, this is one of my favorites. Its primary theme of redemption of the soul gives hope to us all, and all who feel the weight of greed and commercialism during the holidays should read this to lift their spirits. Let us all toast Ebenezer Scrooge with a Merry Christmas! And God bless us everyone!
