review/summary: JACK REACHER - WHAT A GUY! WHAT AN ADVENTURE!review/text: Over time many of us have chosen a few fictional characters that we particularly enjoy - we look for the next book featuring one of them very much as we would look forward to a visit with an old friend. We know who he or she is, we're familiar with that person's personality quirks and ideals. Jack Reacher is a favorite with millions.For me, it all began with The Killing Floor and I was hooked. Thanks to British author Jim Grant who writes under the pen name Lee Child I met Reacher, a stoic tough guy who has several uncanny abilities, such as knowing exactly what time it is without referring to a clock. He's a former U.S. Army Military Police Major. He's a terrific fighter with an immense technical knowledge of weaponry and prefers being alone.A movie was filmed late last year based on this novel starring Tom Cruise. My problem with that is I know Reacher is 6' 5" tall, weighs about 250 lbs, has blondish hair and ice blue eyes. No offense to Mr. Cruise but decided I'd simply listen to Dick Hill's compelling narration. What can I say, Hill (yes, the actor with a mantel-full of awards) has narrated 8 Reacher novels - he simply is the voice of Jack Reacher.One Shot is aptly named - six shots have been fired but only five fatalities. Well, the cops are on top of these slayings and within hours the shooter is behind bars claiming his innocence and hollering for Reacher. Well, Reacher knows this shooter and doesn't hesitate. Did I mention Reacher's intelligence? Not only does he know the shooter but is aware that the man is a trained military sniper and would not have missed a shot.One Shot is another pulse-pounding trip to an explosive finish enjoy!- Gail Cooke
