review/summary: Review from my 9.5 year old sonreview/text: My son's school book club chose this book and he did not want to read it. (He just read the first Seekers book and didn't enjoy it. He felt this would be similar.) He LOVED this book and can't wait to read the next in the series. I think I will give it a try based upon his review!
