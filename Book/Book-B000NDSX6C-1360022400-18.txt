review/summary: Lighter than Lord of the Ringsreview/text: I re-read this recently (after seeing the film) and enjoyed it. It was indeed a bit &#34;lighter&#34; though no less exciting that Lord of the Rings, and though I recall reading this by itself as a young person, I can see now that it serves well as a backgrounder for the epic trilogy.
