review/summary: Unclear if this is abridged or notreview/text: I read this book in my school library back in the 70's and my daughter seems to like the LOTR movies, so I thought I'd get at least the first book. I seem to remember a much larger book with smaller print, but it could be me. I looked at all the info inside the book, but it doesn't make clear if this version is unabridged, edited down, or what. It IS the entire Hobbit story (Unlike the current movie, being split into 3 parts), so I can't complain about that, but it would be nice to know if this version is the unrevised, unabridged version or not.
