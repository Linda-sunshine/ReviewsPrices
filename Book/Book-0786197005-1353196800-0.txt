review/summary: Fun, quick read - complete escapist adventure from Edgar Rice Burroughsreview/text: Edgar Rice Burroughs is best known for his Tarzan series of books. When I was in college I read just about all of those, and I then moved on to the Princess of Mars series.Earlier this year Disney released the movieJohn Carter. I went to see it, enjoyed it, but couldn't remember how faithful the movie was to the original books, so I was thrilled to find "Princess of Mars" available as a free download for Kindle apps.I sliced through this book in a handful of sittings. John Carter is a man's man, and real action adventure hero - like Tarzan.One thing that I find to be a shortcoming of the storyline is how John Carter gets to Mars in the first place...but once he's there the story rolls along nicely. The book and movie follow a similar story line in many ways, but differ in others.When the movie was made the writers had to devise a way to get Carter to Mars in an explainable way, which they do. Once Carter gets there in the book he meets Woola, Sola, Tars Tarkas, Deja Thoris, Sab Than, and so on.I thoroughly enjoyed the read, and may continue reading the rest of the series again.While this will never be considered great literature, it is a worthy addition to the world of early 20th Century Sci-fi.4 stars for writing, 5 stars for fun.
