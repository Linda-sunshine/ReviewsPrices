review/summary: Whew! It's a long read.review/text: I don't read very fast, so this took a real commitment. It's really scary how this book reads just like today's headlines, only written 55 years earlier. Rand writes a good book, but sure goes to the extreme in &#34;describing&#34; things. Adds a lot of fluff. Enjoyable read.
