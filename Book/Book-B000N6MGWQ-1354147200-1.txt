review/summary: Beautiful storyreview/text: I believe everyone can learn from Albom's book, The Five People You Meet in Heaven. You learn that tomorrow is never promised and you should tell your loved ones how much they mean to you. Without knowing it, we all make some sort of difference in many people's lives.
