review/summary: Loved It!review/text: The Kindle version I read didn't have the illustrations that some reviewers have mentioned, and it obviously didn't have the wonderful binding, but it did have the story the way Dickens wrote it, and that was a joy to read.I've watched many film versions of the story down through the years, and I'd expected to be so familiar with the story that I'd be bored reading it, but the opposite actually happened -- I loved it.I sometimes found myself noticing bits I'd either never seen in the films, or, if I had seen them, I hadn't paid them much mind. Reading the book allowed to take things in at my own pace: if I wanted to pause and think about a particular wording, or if I wanted to back up and re-read something, I did, and it took the experience to a whole new level. Rather than an abbreviated, two-hour video, I got to enjoy the entire thing and spend as much time as I wanted savoring morsels the video would have glossed over.
