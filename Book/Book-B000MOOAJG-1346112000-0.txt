review/summary: A brilliant pamphletreview/text: This book bothered me from the moment I picked it up many years ago. Why? Many reasons. It's poorly written, in a simplistic, abrasive style. The characters are just NOT believable. Ms. Rand's personal hangups and peculiarities percolate every page. It's repetitive. The narrative - what narrative? Philosophy? Only an ignorant American could call it one. A great business book? Are you kidding me? The author is a failed Hollywood writer. And speaking of the author - have you ever seen an interview with her? Abrasive like her prose, and spoke with a terrible accent. /sarcMy point is made. Your Berkeley literature professor will hate this book and have good reasons to do so, in a technical sense. So why is this book so important? Why do so many people keep reading and discussing it, 55 years after its publication? Who is John Galt?He is VALIDATION and he is HOPE. Validation comes as you realize that what you have always suspected deep inside may indeed be the case, disturbing as it might be. Hope comes as you read about the death of a corrupt order and the rebirth of something new and pure. Hope comes from the picture of humanity shaking off the chains of oppression, as the Moses figure leads it out of the darkness and into the light.Atlas Shrugged appears to be a book, but it isn't. It's a political and religious pamphlet, the relevance of which grows with every passing year, as we watch the accelerating process of systemic rot. Ms. Rand didn't live to witness the liberation she anticipated. We can pray and hope that the current generation will.
