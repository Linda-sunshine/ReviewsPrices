review/summary: Online Publisher-low qualityreview/text: I was surprised to find that this book was missing the copyright/publishing information usually found on the first page. I looked on Amazon and determined (after I had already received the book) that it was printed-to-order by Lulu publishing, an online single-copy book publisher. There printing was low quality: there were no page numbers, the font was too small (maybe a 9 or 10 pt.) and it has weird formatting. None of this actually prevented me from reading the book. I just finished it and enjoyed the writing style and story. But, the printing style was just annoying. I will be more careful in the future, when buying paperbacks from Amazon, to only buy from reputable publishers.
