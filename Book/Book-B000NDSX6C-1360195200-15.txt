review/summary: There and back again...review/text: When one sets out on an adventure it is always helpful to have a hobbit along.Reading The Hobbit on my Kindle was a true joy. I have loved this story since my child hood and the kindle version did nothing to change that love. I am glad that the motion pictures have reawakened a love of Tolkien's classics.If you read only one book about hobbits, dragons and gold this year... make it The Hobbit
