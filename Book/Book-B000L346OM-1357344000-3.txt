review/summary: Outstanding!review/text: I have previously read this book in hard-cover years ago. Having been interested in the human condition and psychology and philosophy for my entire life, this book is extremely interesting on all levels. It is a true story of Viktor Frankl's own internment in the Nazi German concentration camps brought to the world as a first-hand account of the experiences and conclusions of a learned and brilliant psychologist, who went from respected professional to holocaust prisoner to holocaust survivor. He has turned his brilliant mind to analysis of the experience from a perspective that no other mere researcher could ever achieve.It is moving, horrifying, and educational. Well worth reading, and I bought it for my Kindle so that I could read it again and have it with me as a reference. We must never forget either the lows or the highs of which human nature is capable.
