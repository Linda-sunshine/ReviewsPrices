review/summary: Old classics are understandable on E-Booksreview/text: One thing I appreciate about reading old classics on e-books such as the Kindle, is the ability to immediately look up archaic words within. Plus the fact that along with this ability, these old classics are available for free (at least for the most part).(Spoiler alert)I would say that with a few of the old english titles now under my belt, the authors of the time leave a lot to incredibility in order to advance their plots. In the case of Jane Eyre, this came up with a majorly coincidental meeting of a man and a letter in the town of Maderia (or some such spelling). Also, of a rather psychic lament being heard by the story's protagonist. Also of a chance meeting of the protagonist, on the verge of dying of starvation and privations; finding herself on the doorstep of some long lost relatives.Guess they had a lot of faith back then that God's will, will out. Otherwise it did make for a nice story. Just a bit too much of "Deus ex machina" for my tastes.
