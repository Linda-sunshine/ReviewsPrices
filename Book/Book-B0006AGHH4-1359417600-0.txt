review/summary: Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowereview/text: Well worth the time to read. This book was published in 1852. The word usage and the 'black' talk would have made the story difficult to fully grasp . So I downloaded the audio from Librivox and then read the words while listening to the audio. The book and the audio were perfectly synchronized. This made the book very enjoyable and a real treasure. This was an important book used to awaken the folks in the North and the South to the slavery issues. Quite dramatic at times, but it fit in to the scope of the book. A great way to understand our history is to visit it as close to the source as possible using books written at the time. If you can find it, I suggest you read &#34;The Land They Fought For&#34; by Clifford Dowdey. This is the story of the South from 1832 to 1865, another great book.
