review/summary: The Pre-Fantasy of Fantasiesreview/text: With the advent of Peter Jackson's coming films, I recently reread The Hobbit to refamiliarize myself with it. Surprisingly, it was much simpler than I remember, or at least its prose has a simpler, much more folksy writing style than I recalled, and was certainly breezier than the denser pre-LOTR works (the Silmarillion, and so on). Nevertheless, the book is a lovely entryway to Tolkien and his Middle Earth, offering plenty of marvelous characters and lots of adventure.All the usual suspects are here as a precursor to Lord of the Rings: elves, dwarves, goblins, trolls, wargs, enormous eagles, dragons (very interested to see what Mr. Cumberbatch does with Smaug in the film version), and of course the timeless Gollum. The book is a much smaller companion piece to each book of the later trilogy (it weighs in at around 250 pgs usually). All in all an epic tale for a lovely and mystical evening of reading.
