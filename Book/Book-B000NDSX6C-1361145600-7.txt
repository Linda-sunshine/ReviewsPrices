review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: Do you like fuzzy footed people? Bilbo Baggins a hobbit with some fuzzy feet, has always wanted to go on a adventure, so when Gandalf the Grey with a group of 13 dwarves come to his hobbit hole door he does not know whether or not to go with them or to go with them. When he makes the decides to go with them and goes to defeat the evil dragon Smaug. In the tale they find many troubles with trolls, witchcraft and a creature nearly as old as his stolen ring himself. Gollum is the person that Bilbo found when the troop is lost in the Orc Kingdom when Bilbo found the one ring to rule them all. Along the way they meet many new and old enemies.I think readers should give this information to every one they know. I love this book because it gives the right word choice for the era like " That was a good pull my lads" or "The sun was shining brilliantly ". It also gives a very good prologue to the new Lord Of The Rings series that can give the reader much satisfaction .It explains much of the new fables. It also shows to get out of you comfort zone because Bilbo did not want to leave his home but he did. he also saved the group many times with only himself. What would you be with furry feet?
