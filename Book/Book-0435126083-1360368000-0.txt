review/summary: Glad I read itreview/text: The engAging though somewhat dismal story of " love" unfulfilled between Catherine and HEathcliff. Although she claims to marry EDgar with Heathcliffs interests in mind; he is never able to come to terms with the loss and spends the rest of his life seeking revenge through abuses inflicted on both his and Catherine's family members. Does Heathcliff truly love Catherine ? What causes his great change of heart? The reader is left pondering those questions at the end of this enjoyable read.Ppl
