review/summary: Don't miss this onereview/text: Loved this book. Raised three of these blonde Calamities myself. They do think like that. Loved the tongue in cheek humor. Plenty of action to keep me interested. Characters so real you wished they were your neighbors. Held my breath, laughed out loud, tucked it in, and said OH NO--don't do that. But Calamity came through. Very good read. Just to short. Please keep them coming.
