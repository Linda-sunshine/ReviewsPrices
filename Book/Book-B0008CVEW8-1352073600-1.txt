review/summary: Not the story we all know.review/text: I don't like the five star rating system. I want to give this one a 3.5 star rating. Why can't we use a 1-10 scale instead, it give much more granularity. Anyway. . .As I'm finding more often is the case, the story is not what we have all come to know from Hollywood depictions. Normally that is a good thing, but in this case the Hollywood versions are better. The ties between Long John Silver and Jim were much more tenuous in this book than in more recent portrayals and I think that's not as fun. Because it is a well known story it also lacks the excitement of something really new.That said, it think everyone should read it. It is a fun, short book, easy to read despite some old English and it was a blast to see from where the quintessential pirate and pirate story originated. Plus I read it near International Talk Like a Pirate Day, so I had fresh fodder for chatting with my fellow scurvy dogs. Arrrrr!
