review/summary: A book that takes us on a compelling adventure.review/text: The Hobbit is a fine example of an adventure novel. The entire movement of the fantasy genre in our modern day all come from this book. The story of the littlest creature in the universe making a difference, and making the other more powerful characters successful is one that resonates through all of time. The story also works well to introduce the ring into the lexicon of this universe.This story is so ubiquitous now that some see it as cliched. However, I like the book as an introduction into the fantasy genre. This book also brings into focus many of the races that become important in later areas such as dungeons and dragons. The quasi-pagan universe is one that builds as one goes through this story and also the installments of Lord of the Rings.I teach this book to Freshmen in High School English class. I think they enjoy it, and I like it as an intro into this new exciting world. Special thanks should go to Peter Jackson for making this book into a new film this year.
