review/summary: A must read for everyonereview/text: I was first introduced to this book by Master Dog Trainer William Meisterfeld. I am a dog trainer myself and now offer this book to all of my clients. Why? Because dogs and animals in general have "sense perception" and it is important to have a positive thought process when working with your dog. Moreover this is a great read for anyone to improve their attitude and positive thought process. A short read and is a book you can pick up and read one chapter at a time. Highly Recommended!!
