review/summary: I finally read it!review/text: I'm usually not much for science fiction but when I read Mysterious Island and it made mention of Captain Nemo, I decided it was finally time for me to read that classic I've heard about for over 50 years. I found the book interesting reading until it delved into the detailed sea creatures found all over the globe. (I skimmed through those sections because I've never been much into science or botany or biology.)I enjoyed reading the book but the residual effect for me is that now I am left wondering if something like that could actually have occurred in the mid 1800's.
