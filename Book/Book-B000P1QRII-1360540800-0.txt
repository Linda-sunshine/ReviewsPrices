review/summary: Brilliant! A Must Read!review/text: I first read this book 5 years ago and I just finished it again. It was as good now as it was then. Lois Lowry is a perfect example of a compelling and proficient YA author.The story is about 20 years old and still one of the best YA dystopia's out there. I haven't seen a young adult or children's dystopia that has met or surpassed The Giver in both quality of writing or as an interesting, appealing and thought-provoking storyline.I suspect the ambiguous ending might have been a bit of dissatisfaction for some people but it never was for me. I was fine with the ending, yet, I was very pleased to learn there were sequels to this book! Quartet actually! I have yet to read the last book in the quartet (Son) but I highly recommend the second and third books 'Gathering Blue' and 'Messenger.' They are also very well done! A must read!
