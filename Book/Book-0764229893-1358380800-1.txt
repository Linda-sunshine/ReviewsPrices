review/summary: Spell-binding fiction from the Old Testamentreview/text: This was just an incredible story. I can't believe how Lynn Austin took such a short segment from the book of 2nd Chronicles and built a whole novel around the story of King Ahaz and the rise of King Hezekiah to the throne. I was drawn into the plot from the first moment - I could see the scense in my head as I read the book. And more importantly, it spoke to me about my faith and my relationship with God today. The Old Testament is not dead.
