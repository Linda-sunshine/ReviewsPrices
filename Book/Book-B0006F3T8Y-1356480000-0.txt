review/summary: Just what is neededreview/text: Some will say that LM Alcott is too openly preachy, but her unabashed devotion to all the tried and true virtues is refreshing. The story, which I have read many times, is sweet and sentimental. I last read "Little Women " as a teenager, and now that I am a 40-something year-old mother and wife myself, I am frankly shocked by how touched I was by the effect that re-reading it had on me. The little words of guidance, maternal advice, and quiet examples of virtue and self-sacrifice take on new meaning and seem to reflect even more timeless wisdom now that I have some years of life experience myself. I believe stories such as this are exactly what is needed to help guide a new generation of girls toward a happier and more peaceful adulthood.
