review/summary: The Handmaid's Tale, Margaret Attwoodreview/text: As always Margaret Atwood captures the future in a very credible way and makes the reader see the possibility of her stories through things happening around the world today. As with other books by this writer I found it hard to put down and was then disappointed to have finished it so quickly.
