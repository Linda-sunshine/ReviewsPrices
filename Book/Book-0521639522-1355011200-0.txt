review/summary: The Importance of Being Earnestreview/text: This is an incredibly amusing story of Wilde's, describing some upper middle class relationships and lifestyles. He relates some peculiarities, social controversies and funny personality traits using his smooth sense of irony and intelligent humor. Quite enjoyable, dynamic and thought-provoking in any shape or form indeed, i.e. in a movie, play, book or kindle.
