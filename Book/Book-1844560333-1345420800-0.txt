review/summary: Great classicreview/text: This book was so interesting! I sat reading and could hardly put it down. It has great suspense which I truly enjoyed. I am a romantic and anything that ends in true love is great. However most of the language (old English) can be challenging to read initially but you eventually get used to it.
