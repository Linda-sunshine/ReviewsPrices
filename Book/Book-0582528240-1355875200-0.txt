review/summary: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: My Reviewreview/text: Again, Mark Twain's writing style is brilliant. But nothing really happened in the first 3 or 4 chapters (I need a book to get going by page 3) so I gave up. And what did happen I couldn't understand-are a bunch of kids talking about going around murdering people as a pastime? Might try a re-read sometime.
