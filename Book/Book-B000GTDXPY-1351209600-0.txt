review/summary: Laugh out loud mysteryreview/text: I thoroughly enjoyed my introduction to Tressa Jayne Turner aka Calamity Jane (CJ) as she is known by friends, family, police, and townspeople. I had many LOL moments as I went along on the ride to murder and mayhem with CJ. I look forward to reading the next book in the series.
