review/summary: Love this onereview/text: Not only is J.K. Rowling's story amazing, Jim Dale does an incredible job with each character's voice. I have since listened to all 7 books and he maintains the integrity and quality to each character throughout! I have also read all the books too, but it is a good way to pass the time on long trips with a nice English accent!
