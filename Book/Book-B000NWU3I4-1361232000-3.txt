review/summary: Excellentreview/text: I had forgotten how well-written this book was. Nice use of foreshadowing. Very evocative descriptions of nature. And Bilbo was much smarter and helpful than I had remembered. People sometimes think of hobbits as comic characters, but they are really &#34;Everyman&#34; and Tolkien obviously wanted their virtues to be emulated. A book enjoyable by both children and adults.
