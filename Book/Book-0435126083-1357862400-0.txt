review/summary: One of my favorites!review/text: This is a great classic. Many, many years ago when in high school, this book was approved and on the reading list. I read it then and loved it, but had to read it again because it had been 50+ years since my high school days. I loved it as much the second time as I did when I read it when I was just a teen. Times have changed haven't they.
