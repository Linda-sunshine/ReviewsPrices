review/summary: Excellent bookreview/text: I give it 5 stars but could not get 5 stars to light up. I love the Harry Potter series. This is the first digital book I have read on my new kindle. I have read them all before. J.K. Rowling does a wonderful job of creating a magical world that is so believable. A wonderful story of a young boy discovering his true identity.
