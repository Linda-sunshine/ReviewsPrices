review/summary: Bilbo a bit too chubby, but otherwise excellent artreview/text: I bought the graphic novel version for my kids under 10 years old to introduce them to the Hobbit. It gives a good summarized version of the story with good drawing. The only exception would be Bilbo seems a bit too heavy and round to make a convincing adventurer. The drawings of all other characters: Gollum, Gandolf, the dragon, the dwarfs were more true to what I envisioned from the book.
