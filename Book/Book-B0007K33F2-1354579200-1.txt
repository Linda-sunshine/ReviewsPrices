review/summary: Revenge has never been so sweet!review/text: I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!!!! That may seem incredibly overboard and over-dramatic, but honestly, when a novel is about the intricately plotted revenge of a man who escapes one of the toughest and unforgiving prisons after being falsely accused for thirteen years, then I think I have the right be be a little over-dramatic. To me Dumas never gets old, his writing is always meticulous and sweeping and he never misses a beat when it comes to plot. Everything is so perfect and with all the identities that Dantes takes on throughout the novel, it's so important that the audience understand what is happening and who that English Gentlemen or Sinbad the Sailor really is and Dumas does it with style.If Dumas was alive today and I somehow finagled the chance to meet him, I would probably swoon and faint on the spot. He's amazing. His writing is SUPERB! READ THIS BOOK if you haven't already, and if you have read it, read it again and again and again because it's never the same but it's always delightful
