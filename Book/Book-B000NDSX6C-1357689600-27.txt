review/summary: Lots of inforeview/text: Lots and lots of information about The Hobbit and JRR. I was surprised by the illustrations by Tolkien. I didn't even know he did that. It would have been nice if more of the illustrations had been in color but I think maybe they were originally in b&w. Fascinating book.
