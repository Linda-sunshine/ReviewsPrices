review/summary: Truth to live byreview/text: I first read this book at age 20 and kept it with me all these years, reading it over and over. I changed my way of thinking as suggested in this book and achieved more than I dreamed. At age 52, I can look back at points in my life that required much sacrifice but ultimately reached my goals. I still aspire for calmness and a serene life, so I continue to read this book. I treasured it then and treasure it now. I think James Allen achieved more in this little book than all the motivational speakers we have today.
