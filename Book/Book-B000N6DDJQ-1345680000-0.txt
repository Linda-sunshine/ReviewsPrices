review/summary: Classic for my Kindle Firereview/text: How dare I review a classic? I have loved this book for many and many a year, and now I have it on my Kindle Fire. I love the thought of classic delivered wirelessly to this cutting edge product. Somehow like Pocahontas wearing Ray Bans. The juxtaposition tickles me. The book is a classic for a reason. If you haven't read it, I recommend you do, in any form. Enjoy!
