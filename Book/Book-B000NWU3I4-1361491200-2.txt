review/summary: Great for Good Tween Readers and Upreview/text: The Hobbit was written by JRR Tolkien after The Lord of the Rings. However, it is a prequel. (Minor spoiler follows, I hope minor, anyway!) Set back when Bilbo was a young adult (in Hobbit lifetimes, that is!), it tells the story of how Bilbo traveled with a group of Dwarves (Tolkien spelling) -- and occasionally a grey wizard named Gandalf -- across the wilderness, mountains, and forests of Middle Earth to reclaim the Dwarves home Erebor, located in a mountain called the Lonely Mountain.During the trip, they have a variety of adventures. The story does not end with the reclamation of Erebor, but I will avoid mentioning anything after to try not to spoil it too much!It is an epic tale written with younger readers in mind than The Lord of the Rings, but still full of the adventure and the true neither-completely-good-nor-completely-evil good vs. evil battles Tolkien is so great at writing. Enjoy!
