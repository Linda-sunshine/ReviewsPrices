review/summary: Kindle Bookreview/text: Although I still prefer reading novels in their more physical state, with ink and paper and more of a presence in one's hands, every now and then I do not mind reading on the Kindle (especially when it is the middle of the night and you just finished reading a book and want the next in the series, but there are no stores open, and you can't wait.)
