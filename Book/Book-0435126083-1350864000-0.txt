review/summary: Better late than never!review/text: Believe you me just read this magnificent book. At the ripe age of 74! An uncompromising writer able to define her characters in vivid strokes. The solitude of those times concentrates emotion to an almost unbearable extent. For those who have not read this classic I say please do so now!
