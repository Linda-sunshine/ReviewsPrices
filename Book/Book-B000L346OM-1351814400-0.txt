review/summary: Man's Search for Meaning Reviewreview/text: I am not a very avid reader and find it difficult to complete a book. I loose interest after first few chapters. However Man's search for meaning has been a different experience. After reading this book I have become self-critical of any activity that will take up a lot of my time. I now ask myself "is this or will this be meaningful to me?", and if the answer is "no", I will not do it. This book has influenced me to consciously live a meaningful life, to place a great value on the journey and not just the destination, while knowing that "meaningful" doesn't always mean "enjoyable"
