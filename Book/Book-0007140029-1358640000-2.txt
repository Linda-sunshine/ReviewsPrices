review/summary: Warriors #1: Into the Wildreview/text: Into the Wild is a book about a house-cat, Rusty, joining the wild cats living in the forest. Rusty has always dreamed of living in the forest and sinking his teeth into a fresh mouse. He was thrilled when he was asked to join Thunderclan and become an apprentice. He takes on a new name, Firepaw, and goes on to training to become a brave and loyal Thunderclan warrior.The book was really great and I think Erin Hunter did a really fantastic job of telling the story from the cats' perspective. I like the way the author describes everything from the feel of the mossy ground under their paws to the scent of fresh prey in the cool morning air. But sometimes it could become a little repetitive when it comes to Firepaw's thrill when hunting and the cats sharing tongues. In some places the book was kind of slow when all Firepaw did was wander around the camp. Lastly, I did like the creativity with the names. As I noticed, apprentices had the word &#34;paw&#34; in their name and Clan leaders had the word &#34;star&#34; in their name.I would recommend this book to anyone because it really gets you thinking about the secret lives of cats and what I think is the author's purpose, to inform us how we're impacting the environment and what we're doing to these sweet animals.Hope my review was helpful-serenity
