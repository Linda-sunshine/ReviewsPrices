review/summary: interesting, but couldn't finish the seriesreview/text: I liked this book okay. It's another series about a dystopian society, but not nearly as clever as the Hunger Games. The characters started to annoy me after a while. I finished the first 2 or 3 books of the series, but wasn't interested enough to finish. Although to be honest, I don't read alot of fiction anymore. If you really like books like Hunger Games, Matched, etc. then you'll probably enjoy these books, otherwise it might be a waste of time.
