review/summary: A re-read for mereview/text: I managed somehow to never read this book as a youngster but corrected that when I was in my 20s. Since it had been so many years (about 30) and I was getting ready to readMarchby Geraldine Brooks, I wanted to go back and re-read this first novel.As many other reviewers have said, this story starts off quite slowly and I was initially disappointed. It wasn't the book I remembered. Deciding to stick with it, I kept going and it picked up steam as it went along becoming the book I enjoyed previously.I wonder how young girls react to this now when "The Hunger Games" and "Gossip Girl" seem to be the norm and are so vastly different from this. The early stages are sugary sweet and there is quite a bit of preaching on religion and morals throughout that might make the younger ones roll their eyes a bit. While it has largely aged well, it must be read for the time period in which it was written.I am very glad I re-read it as an adult.
