review/summary: Uncle Tom is NOT who you think he is!review/text: Please read this book & spread the word that Uncle Tom is a wonderful, selfless, kind person. He is the best Christian character in all of literature. His struggles & trials were truly Job like, yet he never lost faith & should be truly admired. His name should be reveered not disdained. Uncle Tom was truly a hero.
