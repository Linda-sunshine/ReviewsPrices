review/summary: The Only Book My Parents Like That I Likereview/text: My parents get mad it me when I call this book old but, I'M 10 YEARS OLD! This book is old! It is an amazing book. I absolutely love it even though I watched the movies before reading it. I read this book in about a week, which is fast for me. Usually I switch from reading to playing video games on my tablet but this book was too interesting. I think it was better than the movie. I think everyone should read it. HARRY POTTER ROCKS!
