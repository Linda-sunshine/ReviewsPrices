review/summary: Be aware of the book small (pocket) sizereview/text: The book dimensions are appriximately 4x6 inches. The small font makes it difficult to read for both adults and children alike, and the small illustrations loose some of their charm. In my view, the convenience of having such a tiny book size does not justify the negatives.
