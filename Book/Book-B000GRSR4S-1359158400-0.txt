review/summary: Slaughterhouse Fivereview/text: This book is bizarre, but very interesting. It tells the life of a man who has been taught to time travel to different points in his life, as he experiences life. Is he insane or did the aliens really abduct him and teach him these abilities? I would recommend this if you like unusual reading or science fiction, or war stories. Based on a true WWII event.
