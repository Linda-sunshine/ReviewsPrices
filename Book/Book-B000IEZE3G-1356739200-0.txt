review/summary: Beginning of an Odysseyreview/text: Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived.Although the intended audience of this first book is undoubtedly children, it is also a really entertaining read for adults. In this first installment we meet many of the characters that make the series so...addictive. At times Harry Potter is shown as too much of a "perfect boy" but it is his flaws that really make him someone special.Nowhere near as long as the later books in the series, a great book to dip your toe into the Harry Potter world. Whatever your age or literary taste, I doubt it will be the last Harry Potter book you read.
