review/summary: I will nevr get to the end....review/text: I must say that if I wanted an education in whales and whaling, this would be the book to choose. However, Herman Melville belabors the point and confuses the issue with many words and repetitions. The story line, if you can find it, is very interesting as is the education but it goes on and on. What should be a few paragraphs goes on for pages.
