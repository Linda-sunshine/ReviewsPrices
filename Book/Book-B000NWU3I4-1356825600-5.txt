review/summary: Tolkien is on any best of lit list for a reasonreview/text: I read &#34;The Hobbit&#34; first when I was about ten and have reread it about annually since. It's an old friend for the same reason that Dickens' &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; and Pratchett's &#34;Guards! Guards!&#34; always end repeatedly up on my reading list. The settings are interested enough, the character development is adequate, and the prose is satisfactory. But these authors have a wealth of personal knowledge of language, metaphor, and/or the human condition that makes the reading not only fun, but an adventure in satire, sociology, semiotics, history, and philosophy. Granted, of Tolkien's works, this is the most childlike; however, that also makes it the most accessible, and perhaps the closest to the heart. Top ten in my all time favorites list for good cause.
