review/summary: A Disturbing Book!review/text: I am thankful for the kindle dictionary. I have gained some new vocabulary for sure. Once I had discovered the darkness of the book, it was too late to stop reading. It is a compelling story. How do I give a book that has endured so many years less than a 5? I give it a 3!
