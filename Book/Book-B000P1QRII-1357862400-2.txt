review/summary: I can't believe I had never read this until nowreview/text: I really enjoyed this book. Yes, I wish the ending would've been a little more clearer but I can't change that. This is a really good book and the themes and messages in our are so strong and relevant. I can't believe it took me this long to read this but better late than never!
