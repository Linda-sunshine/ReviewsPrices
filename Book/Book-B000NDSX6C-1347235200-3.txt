review/summary: Bilbo Baggins: The charm of a Hobbit, the heart of a Lion!review/text: The movie will be out soon. However, there is still time to do the right thing and read the book first! From what I hear, the movie is going to be outstanding. But even if our collective hair stands on end, the earth shakes beneath our feet, and a magnificent rapture proclaims us saved for all time...well, I digress. Anyway, my point is, it would be nice for audience members to acknowledge one of the greatest works of fantasy ever put to paper before they see the movie. So if you are debating whether to read the book or wait for the film, let me promptly put an end to that discussion: READ THE BOOK!!!Why is The Hobbit so great? For me, it has always been the character of Bilbo Baggins. He is lovable yet flawed, brave yet frightened. He is, for lack of a better description, very human!Like so many that toil through work days, constantly fighting through the challenges and sorrows of life, Bilbo finds himself thrown into the cross-hairs of evil and injustice. While we face the daily barrage of family problems and feuds, enemies, disease and the general unfairness of life, Bilbo also finds himself on a similar battlefield. Instead of a sinister real-life boss, Bilbo matches wit with the manipulative Gollum. Instead of a gang of criminals, Bilbo battles spiders. No matter what the fictional representation may be, the same code of honor all righteous men hold dear is manifested in Bilbo's duty to do the right thing.After all this time, Tolkien remains the ultimate master of placing the reader front and center in this remarkable fantasy. Tolkien makes us relate to the main character because Bilbo is just like you and me. Bilbo is every man. He is the reluctant hero kicking and screaming his way through the avalanche of predicaments that sooner or later pay us all a visit. His triumph is our own. In my opinion, The Hobbit is a testament to this truth.
