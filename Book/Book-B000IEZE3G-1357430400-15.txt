review/summary: Magicalreview/text: I saw the movie before I read the book and was so intrigued that I picked up the book the next day. I was amazed on how close the movie reflected the book. I read the book in a couple of hours, because I could not put the book down.I loved how you learn about the wizard world through Harry's eyes. This way you do not feel left out, but even closer to Harry. You take the journey with him and can marvel at all the things in this new world and feel as excited about it as Harry does.A magical start to a truly amazing series, which I couldn't wait to finish.
