review/summary: First time Reacher readerreview/text: I came across this book having never heard of the Reacher series. I poked around and found out that this particular novel has been optioned to be made into a movie, so I thought, why not?This novel begins with a mass killing at a government building which results in an almost immediate arrest. The suspect will only say, "Get me Jack Reacher." Enter our protagonist.I won't say anymore about the plot because it's just too easy to give away the rest. I'll just say that I had no problem jumping on with this novel even though there are 8 books ahead of it in the series. Reacher at this point is a former MP living his life off the grid. I don't know how he got there, but I don't really need to know. I just know he's an experienced detective with a past who wants to get to the bottom of this mystery. The only thing that doesn't come across in the narrative until after it becomes apparent is Reacher's physicality. I was picturing a much more anonymous-looking character until he was suddenly described as being 6'3" and 250 lbs. Reacher's a big guy, so it's amazing he manages to stay as off the grid as he does. He's hard to miss.In any case, if you want a good mystery, but you're not sure if you want to get involved in one long series, this book stands just fine on its own.
