review/summary: The Beginning of Fluencyreview/text: I study communication, that's my gig. And I thought I was pretty darn good at talking to people, particularly my fiance. Matter of fact, I knew this theory existed and I knew the basics. When I read this book, though, all the way through? Turns out all I knew was the equivalent of how to count to ten in Spanish while living in Barcelona. Oh, what an eye opener? Sure, there are moments where it's a little cheesy, and a tiny bit dated, but the meat of the book is so well worth getting through those parts! I give it my highest recommendation to anyone looking to carry on a Godly relationship--with anyone! You can even extrapolate some of the theories and methods described in this book to other non-romantic relationships such as with parents, children, and friends. I know there are books specifically for those categories but if you're a quick study and looking for one book to get the basics down? Start here....and then go get the others anyway, because I have been humbled and educated about my knowledge of interpersonal communication once before, so it can and most definitely will happen again.
