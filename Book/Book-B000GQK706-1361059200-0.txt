review/summary: Not what I expectedreview/text: I guess the fault was mine in choosing this product. I didn't notice that it was a dramatization. I thought I was purchasing the complete Lord of the Rings trilogy read word for word. I think the product may be OK for those wishing a dramatized version of the trilogy, but I must warn that much of the content of the book is lost through this dramatization.
