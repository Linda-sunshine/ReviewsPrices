review/summary: An amazing book. One of the best I've ever read!review/text: This book was so good, and it has taught me about being thankful for what I have now. I loved that there is always something about to happen to Brian. I didn't really like the ending how it just comes at you and automatically just happens. Thank you Gary Paulsen!!!
