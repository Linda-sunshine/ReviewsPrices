review/summary: An all time great love story...review/text: As the author ofThe Rain Began To FallI can really appreciate this author's character development, plot and style. He defines the power of love poignantly in this story of Allie and Noah; that the heart knows no bounds and is always true - despite class barriers, time and distance - and will yearn across the decades for the one who holds it.There is such a depth of tenderness in this story, and it touches a special place in the receptive soul.
