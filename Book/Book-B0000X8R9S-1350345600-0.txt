review/summary: Hatchetreview/text: Brian Robeson, a 13-years-old boy, must survives alone in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but a hatchet. Brian was the only passenger on a small bush plane when the pilot died of a heart attack and the plane crashed into a L-shaped lake. He must face challenges that most stranded people must face. He needs to find shelter, food, water and multiple other things to help him survive. While facing the outside wilderness, Brian also thinks about his difficulties of his parents' divorce. I completely recommend this book to all the people of all ages that like action and suspense
