review/summary: The Perfect editionreview/text: We all know the stunning and captivating tale of, The Lord of the Rings. We are all familliar with the masterful exciting narrative. So I won't bother boring you all with a repetitive, review of the thrilling tale. Instead I will give a review of the Alan Lee illustrated edition of Tolkiens' masterpiece. Alan Lee's artwork is pure sublime & brings the characters and world of Middle Earth to life perfectly.The Blue edition (as it is known) is a hefty volume and its a workout for the arms while reading it, buit it is a beautiful edition and, well worth every penny spent on buying it. The illustrations are pure artistic genius and the care and detail which Lee had put into these pieces of art shows.I have prviouslt purchased the 50th anniversary edition which is alsoa n impresssive edition too, except with no art work bar the pull-out maps etc...So if you are thinking of buying a copy you won't go far wrong with the Illustrated edition a perfect addition to any Tolkien fans Collection.
