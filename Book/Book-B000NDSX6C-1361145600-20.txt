review/summary: Still a wonderful classic!review/text: I first read The Hobbit 30 years ago, in 4th grade. Absolutely loved it -- many of the lines have stayed with me ever since. I later read it twice more over the years, and now once more!I have not yet seen the new movie. I'm excited about it (loved Jackson's film adaptation of Lord of the Rings), but hate having to stop in the middle of the story. So I'm waiting for the trilogy to complete before seeing it.Just have to say there's something very special about this book. So delightful, familiar, and entertaining at any age, even after multiple readings. Try it again sometime, you're sure to agree!
