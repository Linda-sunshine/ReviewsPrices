review/summary: best book everreview/text: I love this book! i tried to read it when i was younger but couldnt understand it and when i read it all the way through a few years ago i feel in love. this book is so beautiful and hopeful even through all the darkness. Ray Bradbury is an amazing author and knows how to bring a story to life.
