review/summary: A timeless classic!review/text: I know you probably already read this point at some point in your either distant or not-so-distant past, depending on how long you have been out of high school. So did I (I'm in the distant past category). I liked it then, I loved it now.Beautifully crafted, this book celebrates doing the right thing even when it is not the popular thing. Fighting a losing battle for a worthy cause. And parenting through example.To Kill a Mockingbird tells the tale of a white lawyer defending a black man accused of raping a white woman in 1935. But before Atticus Finch can defend Tom Robinson, he must first protect him from a public lynching in this Southern Alabama town, where the most crooked white man is still perceived as more credible than the most honest black man. But can Atticus protect Robinson from legal injustice? And what price will his two young children pay when he tries?Told from the viewpoint of Atticus's eight year old-daughter, Scout, this book leaves lasting impressions on topics of racism, justice, and parenting.As I re-read To Kill a Mockingbird this time, I found myself wondering if this celebrated novel would even get published in today's cut-throat publishing world, where readers are looking for some serious conflict and mayhem by the end of the first chapter. Instead, Harper Lee takes the time to introduce the characters and setting, making the Maycomb, Alabama come alive with all of the players typical of a small town. I grew up in such a town so I recognized the trueness of them.Like many books, this book was difficult to put down. Unlike any other book, it made me want to be a better parent . . . and a better person.
