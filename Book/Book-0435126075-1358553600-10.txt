review/summary: Amazing love storyreview/text: I was a little intimidated at first when I began this book, afraid I wouldn't be able to understand the old English language and terms. But it was easy to read and such a welcome change from all the empty, shallow writings of today. I wish I hadn't waited so long to read it!
