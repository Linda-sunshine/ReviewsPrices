review/summary: Why did I like it so much?review/text: I've deeply enjoyed this classical novel of Charlotte Bront. It is the first book I've read in english,(being spanish my language) since I left school, 52 years ago.I loved the main character, Jane Eyre; her bright intelligence, her moral values, her determination to get the better of life's challenges and the way she loved without expecting anything in return.II find that it answers to the expectations of truth and right of people of any time.
