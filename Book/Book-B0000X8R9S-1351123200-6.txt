review/summary: Hatchet Book Review, It rocksreview/text: Brian Robeson, a 13 year old boy, is lost in the wilderness left only with a hatchet. The characters mentioned in the story are; Brian, Brian's mom, Brian's dad, and the pilot. The setting of the story is in the Cessna bush plane and the Canadian wilderness. My favorite part of this story was when Brian got sprayed in the face by a skunk. This book is a very great book. It has many literary genres such as adventure, fiction, and drama. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and excitement.
