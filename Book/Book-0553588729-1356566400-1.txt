review/summary: Helped save our sanityreview/text: I bought this during a late night crying fit with my infant daughter when my wife and I were at our wits' end with the crying. Some babies are easy. Ours was not. I paid more for the overnight shipping than I did for this book, but it was worth it. Karp's insight into why babies can be fussy was helpful for new parents. It turned out all our daughter needed was a good swaddling and she was happy as can be.
