review/summary: Jane Austen as still reigns supremereview/text: Jane Austen has yet to let me down. I was introduced to her with Northanger Abbey and was pleasantly surprised with the humor; this book had humor of the same type but it was refreshing to see it coming from a female protagonist. Two thumbs up (and more if I had them!)
