review/summary: Great topic, but a bit boring.review/text: I am a MFT and one of the couples I saw mentioned this book. The idea - that how we express, and experience, love - is very personal and not the same for all of us, is an important idea for everyone to understand. Not particularly well written, and since the ideas were not new to me Its not a favorite. But I know that for my client couple that first discovered these ideas it was an important book.
