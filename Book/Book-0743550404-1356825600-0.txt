review/summary: The Colorado Kidreview/text: I love how different this book is! It makes you think and draw your own conclusions. The fact that SYFY was able to create such an awesome show off of this book just makes it all that much better. I am glad my hubby got me this book for my birthday, even though I had already read it, now it's part of my library!
