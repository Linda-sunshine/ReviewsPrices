review/summary: Vivid and thought-provoking readreview/text: I'm probably the last of my generation to read this book, but I had to get to it eventually. Getting into this book proved a bit difficult and at first I suspected I wouldn't like it. As with any story, growing used to the jargon and understanding why characters behave the way they do is often a challenge. Still, this book proved to be a very emotional and vivid journey for the main character, Jonas. Other characters that stood out in particular were Asher, his best friend, Jonas's father, and, of course, the Giver.Most of the time, I'm a solid ending type of person, so I would have liked to see a more concrete resolution, especially since this story doesn't continue in a series. If it did, I probably wouldn't mind it. A lot of questions weren't answered, and that bothers me personally, but some stories you have to just assume that's the way things are. Because it was not shown how the Giver's plan worked out, I doubted that it did. I couldn't picture the community being anything other than what it was, and doubted disturbing the equilibrium would do anything to change what it had become after so many years (perhaps even centuries). But maybe that was the point--it couldn't change so the only way out was to escape and hope something better existed out there. Which, while I would like to believe so, was not confirmed.Loury's writing and storytelling reminded me a lot of Avi's work, whom I greatly admire. It definitely made me appreciate the brilliance of the outdoors and how we take the simplest things, such as color, for granted.
