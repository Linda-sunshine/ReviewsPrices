review/summary: Fun story from the free ebook listreview/text: I have this as a paperback but didn't want to dig it out of storage before seeing John Carter of Mars. I wanted to refresh my memory of this fun story. It is a dry narration of John Carter's experience. As I was thinking, the movie butchered the story. I originally read this story in junior high along with the entire series. This is a storystory best read and not seen at the theaters. I've also read the Gor series which has a similar storyline.
