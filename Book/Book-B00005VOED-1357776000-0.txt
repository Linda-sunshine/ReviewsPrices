review/summary: Loved the sardonic wit and deadpan absurdityreview/text: What's the point of writing a review about this book, when there are something like 1200+ other reviews. It's clearly a great book that just keeps on selling-and-selling and is probably heading towards that rarified status of contemporary classic. If you haven't read it, do it now, or at least check it out on the Kindle edition!
