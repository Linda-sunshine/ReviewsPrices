review/summary: Classic for all ages!review/text: This is the first of seven novels in the Harry Potter series! This book introduces readers to Harry Potter, an 11 year old wizard that does not know he is a wizard, living with his aunt and uncle after the death of his parents almost 10 years ago. When Harry finds out he is a wizard, he goes off to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. During his first year he meets his two best friends, Ron and Hermione, and begins his wizarding training. However, he begins to learn about his past and how his parents died at the hands of an evil Wizard, Lord Voldemort. He learns about the sorcerer's stone and wants to begin to uncover the mystery of the stone. Along with his friends, he goes through the year undertaking a series of adventures while growing up, learning to become a wizard, and find the stone! A heart felt tale of loyalty, friendship, and growing up, this story is a classic for all ages! I grew up reading this series, "growing up" with Harry and his friends. As an adult, I still enjoy reading these stories! I would recommend this series for young teens up through adulthood. Full of magic and wonder, the books bring to life characters and story!
