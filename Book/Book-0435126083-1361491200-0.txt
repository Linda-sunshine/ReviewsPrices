review/summary: A story of miserable people living miserable livesreview/text: I know this is a &#34;classic&#34; but I got about a third of the way into and realized that I was forcing myself to read it just so that I could say I read it. Since I'm not in highschool anymore, there is no need to subject myself to such misery.
