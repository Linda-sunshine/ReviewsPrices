review/summary: A Hero, a Damsel in Distress, and Martians (Literally)review/text: Where to begin? This story is amazing! Captivating, enchanting, and utterly engrossing. I couldn't put it down once I started reading. Ok, maybe it helped that I was on a plane for the first 75% of the book, but still, I would've easily fallen asleep had it been boring. John Carter is our valiant hero who is transported to Mars and finds himself with astonishing strength and agility, neither of which can save him from capture by hostile Martians, but both of which help him survive his captivity. The classic story of a hero, his unusual sidekicks, and the beautiful damsel in distress. From the development of the different cultures and races on Mars to the explanation of how they survive the atmosphere, the story was plausible, albeit whimsical. Usually when I read sci-fi, it seems contrived and all-too-convenient, but this book is well-planned and masterfully told. It's free - read it; there's a reason it's a classic.-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman
