review/summary: STILL a great classicreview/text: This was one of the first classic novels I ever read, at age 12. "Dracula" started within me a lifelong love of literature, and good story telling, ( and left me sleeping with the lights on for a week afterward.) Bram Stoker does not romanticize the vampire, which may not sit well with younger readers. This story does not make a person long for the wretched existence that his undead creations experience. His vampires neither "sparkle" nor burn in the sunlight, but they are stronger at night. DRACULA does not fall in love with his victims. He is not wanting to reunite with the reincarnated soul of his long dead wife. He is only seeking to expand his "territory" as he did in life. DRACULA practiced necromancy in his human life in an attempt to extend life beyond the death of his human body, and succeeded, but as a changed being. He infects his prey, and a dead victim becomes a lovely killing machine - a predator, devoid of humanity. These Fledgling vampire creations lose most of their personality, along with their empathy, and their immortal soul. As vampire lore goes, these demonic creatures are infinitely creepier than the sexy, appealing "True Blood" and "Twillight" vampires, (who retain a sense of self.)
