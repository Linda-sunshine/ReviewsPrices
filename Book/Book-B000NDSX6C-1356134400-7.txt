review/summary: (Kindle Edition) An excellent read!review/text: There are a ton of posts that will laud the book so I'll skip that. If you've read &#34;The Hobbit&#34; before you know what you're getting - if you haven't this is the place to start.Having said that I want to comment on the formatting of the kindle edition. Generally speaking the edition is spot on but some pagination issues arise when you come across artwork. You may find yourself a bit disoriented when a large blank space appears, the next page is an illustration, and then the story picks up again. It's not a major issue but it's something eBook editions need to be more mindful of.
