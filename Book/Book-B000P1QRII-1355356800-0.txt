review/summary: A Brilliant Bookreview/text: I first read this book when I was in middle school and I absolutely loved it. It was nothing like any other book we had read. It was a book that made you think about society and conformity. I recommend this book to my friends and have book several copies to give to them as gifts. It was one of the few books that stood out from all the books I ever had to read in school, along with Fahrenheit 451. Please give the gift of The Giver.
