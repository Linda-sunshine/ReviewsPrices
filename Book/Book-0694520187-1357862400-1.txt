review/summary: a firstreview/text: this is first book I purchased for my new Kindle(a Christmas gift)and I am enjoying both....the Kindle is a great way to read, maybe easier on the eyes than real paper and Moby Dick a great novel to begin my adventure...Ishmael paints a good picture of life around him and is signing up for his first whaling voyage...great book
