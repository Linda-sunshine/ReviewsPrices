review/summary: inspiring workreview/text: "I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do."A society in which courage is still identified with a man/woman with a weapon in hand, above thought by Atticus/ Lee is a definite way, not a fragile hope for peace. The book not only touches upon the problem of racism Americnas were dealing with at that point of time, but also touches upon the fundamental values of a man. And that is why i feel the book has been acclaimed globally.The book is as much about how a society should acknowledge existence and dignity of all its people as much it is about probing what are fundamental human values a person should pursue. The values of Atticus are so fundamental for humans that the book would continue to exist on the shelves of book stores (online or otherwise) because the values would continue to exist. Well, i do not want to insinuate French revolution here, but the simple words which can be chosen for the values the book brings forth are: freedom, justice, equality, fraternity, and compassion.Thanks and regards,PravinOnce upon a time in the land of Jasmine Revolution and some short stories
