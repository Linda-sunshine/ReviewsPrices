review/summary: DEFINITELY Worth it!!review/text: I checked out several books from the library on the subject of colic, calming crying and sleep training for my newborn. This was our first child and we found ourselves mostly lost on what to do when he cried and all his needs were met. Our son is not colicy, but I was worried about him becoming so. I was also worried that I couldn't calm him when he would cry. Well let me say I've since bought this book to have on hand as it is the BEST method and works like a charm! My son recently had his 2-month immunizations and that whole day he acted colicy. He would fall asleep after a feeding and then wake up inconsolibly screaming. I immediately applied the Five S's in the methods described in Dr. Karp's book and it calmed him almost immediately EVERY time! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has a newborn or will have a baby soon. It doesn't matter how many kids you have had, this will help tremendously! I've recommended it to every Mom and mom-to-be in my support groups and friends. Thank you, Dr. Karp, for writing such a profoundly honest, easy-to-read and intelligent book that actually WORKS!
