review/summary: Over priced but interestingreview/text: My daughter loved it and recommended it to me. I was surprised that it cost $13.99, the equivalent of an arm and a leg in the eBook market. And it was short! Not much bang for buck! However I bought it and set to. An interesting read with some valuable insights but more like a self help book than a novel.
