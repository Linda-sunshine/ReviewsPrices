review/summary: Excellent! Couldn't put it down..review/text: I'm an avid fan of biblical historical fiction...I love the way she brings this story to life and keeps you in suspense. Details are clear and accurate....beyond that, you're drawn immediately into the story, the character's thoughts/emotions/motivations/lives, and hoping they choose to follow God. My biggest acclaim for a book in this genre is having read it that i find myself loving my God even more, seeking harder after Him, understanding just a little more, and wanting more of Him! My faith is encouraged! Definitely recommend!
