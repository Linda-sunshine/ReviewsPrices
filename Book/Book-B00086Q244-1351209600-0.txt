review/summary: Required reading for LIFE 101. Practice the principles and you will see your communication skills greatly improved.review/text: The funny thing is that I thought I had read this book years ago when I first started in sales; however, reading it now made me realize while I practice much of its common sense advice, I still found it refreshing as you can never focus too much on bettering your communications with others professionally or personally. I had not expected the actual fun of reading it. Besides being a foundational book for anyone who communicates with people (yes, that pretty much includes everyone!), it is also offers a glimpse into American History as Dale Carnegie utilizes politicians, businessmen and historical figures most relevant to his era to illustrate stories of effective and in some cases ineffective communications and their outcomes. I consider this book to be required reading for life. It is a classic for a reason. Read it, give it as a gift.
