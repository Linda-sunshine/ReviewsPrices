review/summary: About the 1-star reviewsreview/text: Many of the 1-star reviews revolve around a certain theme; that "the book is outdated because people are different now". What we're actually talking about is that the United States, nearly 100 years after the book was written, is now firmly in a state of decline. In a society in decline the people are going to be hopeless, dissatisfied and isolated. No amount of insight into communicating with people is going to help you. You are dealing with an external problem; you can't change these people and you can't change nature and the fall of a society. It is a natural part of the life cycle, it happens. You can however buy a plane ticket instead of a book.
