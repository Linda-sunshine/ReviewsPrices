review/summary: A moving story about a brave family!review/text: I was delighted when I saw that this book was available for Kindle. I like to read good books/stories over and over. This book is about a time we all need to remember. Remember how blessed we are to have the freedom we now have. Corrie and her family are symbols of Christian love and selflessness. Corrie Ten Boom and her family were imprisioned for one crime only- helping Jews during WWII. They hid Jews and helped some to freedom and safety. For this Corrie and family were imprisioned (her father died a short time after his arrest- he was in his 80's!). Corrie and her sister Betsie were then taken and put in a concentration camp. They were not Jews but they believed in their Bible and assisted God's chosen people however they could. They paid dearly. This story is one that everyone should read. History has a distressing way of repeating itself. Could this happen again? Corrie survived her ordeal and spent the rest of her life helping others and spreading God's word. What an incredible story about an incredible family.
