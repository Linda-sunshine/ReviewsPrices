review/summary: Fabulous! Get it, Give it for Valentine's dayreview/text: Truly explained so many behaviors for me. Personally am NOT a psycho-babble fan, but this book gives concrete examples of how to really love your spouse, family members and friends in ways that can appreciate. Just one question. Where's the chapter on FOOD as a love language???
