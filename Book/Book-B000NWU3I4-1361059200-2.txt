review/summary: 4.5 stars for this fantastic classic!review/text: AboutSet in a fantasy and alternate reality, this story follows the life of little hobbit, Bilbo Baggings, who is usually reserved and unadventurous. He suddenly finds himself tangled in an adventure to find gold accompanied by thirteen Dwarves and Gandalf the wizard. To get to the gold they must go over the mountains and through the dark forests that lay far away from the little hobbit's house. It becomes a long and treacherous journey that Bilbo regrets even joining. With a lot of wit and "burglar"-courage Biblo ends up surprising himself, since he never imagined he possed those characteristics.What I ThoughtI really enjoyed this book that has grown to be a classic in English Literature. I did, however, found it really challenging to read by the second half. I felt like the book got a little slow and almost stuck, and was hesitant to continue reading. I made myself finish this book and was really happy I did because I thought it had the best ending. It was filled with the right amount of cute comedy and heart-warming friendship.Also, Bilbo surprised me at the end because he ended up not being as greedy as I thought he would be.I Loved...The fatness, clumsiness and crankiness of Bofur.I was also completely captivated by the Dwarves' names: Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori,Nori,Ori, Fili, Kili, Gloin, Oin,I Disliked...The scene where they are lost in the woods. It was so long, and I felt like it dragged on.
