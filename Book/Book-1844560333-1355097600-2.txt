review/summary: Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudicereview/text: Admittedly, I'm a Jane Austen fan. That said, I think Pride and Prejudice is the best book she ever wrote. The characters are well-drawn and internally consistent, and the story line flows with a sense of inevitability. Oh, yes, I read everything Jane wrote, and almost all of it with pleasure, but I return to reread Pride and Prejudice every year or two for the sheer pleasure of doing so. And what better way to do it than via Kindle?
