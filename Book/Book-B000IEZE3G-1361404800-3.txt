review/summary: Great book!review/text: I read the entire series over a couple of weeks. Rowling is exceptionally talented and keeps the reader coming back for more. I'm currently re-reading the series and enjoyed it as much the second time as I did the first. Just read it! Could say more, but I'd rather you find out for yourself.
