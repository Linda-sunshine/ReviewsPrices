review/summary: A very nice readreview/text: I have seen and read so many parodies and spoof on this story that I finally decided to read the original story. I was worried that it would take me a while to read because I've heard the story so many times and older books are usually a slow read for me, but I was pleasantly surprised. I found myself finishing this in a day and wanting to give other Charles Dickens books a read. Loved it. :)
