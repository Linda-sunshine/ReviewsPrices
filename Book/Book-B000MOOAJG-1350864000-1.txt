review/summary: Atlas Shruggedreview/text: Fantastic insight and writing. I nearly filled "my clippings" from all of the meaningful statements. Hard to believe this level of understanding was written so long ago, as it can be closely connected to some of what is happening today. Great story, that challenges one to be a productive member of society.
