review/summary: Great Bookreview/text: The most difficult part of the book is the 289 times the "N"word is used. If you can handle that, you will read funniest book I have ever read. But not only is this book extremely funny, it has a very strong message about doing the right thing even if it is wrong in the morality of the time. I believe everyone should read this masterpiece of literature. You will not be disappointed.
