review/summary: Tremendous Stuffreview/text: I read this book in school as an assignment - I hated it. I decided to give it a read 25 years later - I guess it takes an educated eye to see - I found this book so so insightful and awesome. if you were like me and read this as a school assignment and viewed it as a laborious read - give it a second chance.
