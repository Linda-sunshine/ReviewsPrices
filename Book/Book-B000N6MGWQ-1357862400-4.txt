review/summary: Touching, but unrealistic view of Heavenreview/text: "The Five People You Meet in Heaven" is a short, and I feel unrealistic view of the Biblical Heaven. The story is told through the life of Eddie, an old man who feels like he didn't do anything worthwhile with his life. As the title suggest, Eddie meets five people in Heaven, and each has a lesson for him to learn based on what happened on Earth.I was a bit torn on the rating for this book. On one hand, Eddie cannot do anything more to change his life -- he's dead, in Heaven, and this is supposed to be his time for understanding. On the other hand, I guess I'm supposed to glean things from Eddie's stories and apply them to my life for this book to have significance.The biggest reason I rated the book down is I don't feel Albom paints a realistic view of Heaven. I don't think it is going to be about me, although the idea of understanding everything is appealing. I think Heaven is going to be about being the presence of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. 1 Corinthians 2:9 "However, as it is written: `No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him'" (NIV)
