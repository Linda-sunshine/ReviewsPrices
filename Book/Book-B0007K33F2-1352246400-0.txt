review/summary: One of the Most Powerful Booksreview/text: I didn't think I would add another review to the already 8,000 + out there. But, while reading the final pages of this book, I found myself overcome with emotion. When a book can do that, it deserves a little notation.Most everything has been said about this towering classic. I particularly liked Joel's review, complete with pictures. However, when I picture The Count, it is a mix of Edmund Blackadder and Orson Welles.In any case, what I have taken from this book is a lesson in the law of unintended consequences. While everything (sort of) falls into place for the Count's well-planned revenge, one cannot escape the myriad of tendrils that effect so many other people. Edmond realizes that perhaps he had gone too far in his scheme, but yet those guilty parties most likely deserved their comeuppance.Other lessons are learned through these men (Danglars, Villefort, Mondego, and Caderrouse). One cannot escape one's sins forever, greed has no happy ending, and desire for power will rot your soul. Though the style of this book, and of the time, is one of exaggeration and over-the-top emotions, the story is timeless. When we step on the backs of others to reach the top, is it not inconceivable that one of those broken bodies will rise again and pull us from our pedestal?Davis' translation is wonderful and the notes are extremely helpful in understanding the time frame of the story. I can only imagine Dumas' readers, waiting expectantly for the next installment, talking in cafes excitedly over the latest "episode."There isn't much more that I can say that will add to the discussion, except that this book should be required reading for everyone.There are very few books I re-read, and this will be one of them.
