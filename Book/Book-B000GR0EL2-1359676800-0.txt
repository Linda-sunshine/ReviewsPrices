review/summary: Good insight to a Jewish worldreview/text: I thought it was a good read about what the Jews went through during WWII, It showed that people had strength, courage, and love when times were very bad for them. Its showed that know matter what the circumstance that we face in our lives if we can keep positive we can get through anything. Its good for middle school age and up to read.
