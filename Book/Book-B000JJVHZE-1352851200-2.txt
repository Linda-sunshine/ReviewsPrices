review/summary: A classicreview/text: I read this book in my 11th grade English class and enjoyed every page. It's a great story involving Atticus, Scout, and Jem as the main characters and even the complicated background of Boo Radley is very entertaining. I would recommend everyone, no matter how old you are, to read this book.
