review/summary: Brilliant Prose: My Favorite Classicreview/text: I remember really enjoying this book in high school, but now reading it again six years later, I enjoy it even more! Fitzgerald's prose is absolutely beautiful and I found myself highlighting several parts that were exceptionally brilliant (don't worry, the highlighting was on my Kindle). I could barely put the book down, and I hadn't realized how much essence of the story I missed while I was in high school. Definitely worth a read or two, as it is not only a great representation of the way writing should be, but also an enthralling account of fiction. (Besides... you should read it before the movie comes out in May :))
