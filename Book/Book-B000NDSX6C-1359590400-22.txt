review/summary: Enjoyable Readreview/text: I wanted to re read this book because the movie trilogy that just came out to see what I remembered and what not. The first time I read the book, I was in middle school and I loved it. 10 years later, the book is still pretty good! I wasn't entrenched in it like the first time I read it, but I still enjoyed it for what it is.
