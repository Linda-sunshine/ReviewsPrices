review/summary: Classic Tale of redemptionreview/text: I watched the BBC movie and wanted to reread this classic. I was moved by the redemption and the section in which Brownlow talks about the Communion of Saints.&#34;After musing for some minutes the old man walked, with the same meditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there, retiring to a corner, called up before his mind's eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years.&#34;&#34;He wandered over them again. He had called them into view, and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them. There were faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to its power, still dressed in thier old freshness and beauty, calling back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to Heaven.&#34;Reunited in the Communion of Saints.
