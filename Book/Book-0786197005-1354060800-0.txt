review/summary: Rice is still greatreview/text: I hadn't read this book in a long time. But, after seeing the latest movie I had to get it and re-read it. The movie was good, the book can't be beat. If you never read Burroughs you need to. If you have read his books you can go wrong reading them again. He's still a master of science fiction.
