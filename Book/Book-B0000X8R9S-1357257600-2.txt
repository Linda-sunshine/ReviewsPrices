review/summary: very entertainingreview/text: Brian had me guessing 'til the end. I had to keep revising my educated guess about the final outcome. There was a lot of solid information too. No plot holes. Good, accurate, well thought out setting, not cheesy or fluffy, few or no grammatical mistakes.
