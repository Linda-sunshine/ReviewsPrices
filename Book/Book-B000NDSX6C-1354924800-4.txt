review/summary: Must Read Before You See the Moviereview/text: Before you see the movie, read the book. I am hoping the movie will follow the story line closer than LOTR did. I first read this book in High School and I have read it many times since.Who should read it?Anyone that has watched LOTR and is wanting to watch the new movie. People that are into fantasy with a great story line.Who shouldn't read it?Not sure.
