review/summary: It came exactly as it describedreview/text: I had bought other books on Amazon before, all of them calling it 'new' and 'unused', but when it came, there was always some slightly broken spine edges and it had engravings in the cover, as if someone had written on the book.This time, the book came completely new, no marks, no broken edges, nothing. The only reason I wouldn't rate this particular book a five star is because it's not exactly the one I was looking for. I've been reading this book in school, and the one we used in school was slightly more durable looking, and included definitions of some confusing parts in the book. This book didn't have those footnotes, and in fact it also didn't have chapter titles, so it may get a little confusing for you to navigate.But other than that, it was perfect. Thank you for being so cheap, only $0.45, but with the usual $3.99 S+H, it was almost five bucks. It's still a great buy and a really great deal.
