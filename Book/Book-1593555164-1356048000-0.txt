review/summary: One Shotreview/text: Out of all Lee Child's unputdownable Jack Reacher novels, I can see why they made One Shot into a film, although I am surprised the film producers did not retain the book title. Not only is Reacher beyond cool, his two lead female characters, bewitching, the story is instantly gripping and tight as a drum. As the author of A Darker Gold, I have always been very impressed by the sheer grit in Lee Child's work.A Darker Gold
