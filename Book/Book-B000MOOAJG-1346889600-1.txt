review/summary: sharalyndreview/text: Look into this book if you want a must read book. Totally awesome. A book for today and such a reality check that I cannot believe I had not heard of it before now. This novel is a great book club book to discuss and would love to listen to everyone's comments that have read this novel. I must encourage my grown children to read this for a family discussion about values and commitments.
