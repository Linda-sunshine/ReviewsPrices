review/summary: A classic piece of literature at any age.review/text: Tolkien is the ultimate story teller. I know there is a lot of hype about this story because of the movie out in the theaters right now, and rightly so, because the movie is great. But... this book is so much better than the movie. The journey took me on a path of pure adventure. At times when I read this, I felt like the 15th dwarf. Great stuff.... the best part was the dialog of the dragon and Bilbo. This is a must read for everyone.
