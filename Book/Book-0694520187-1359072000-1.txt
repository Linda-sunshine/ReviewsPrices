review/summary: I almost feel embarrassed, but ....review/text: I'm sure that this is a good book and that it is so famous for good reasons. And I do like reading classic authors and long-winded novels. But this one was soooo boooring! I tried and tried and tried, but eventually, after 200 pages or so, I gave up. Maybe too much testosterone ...
