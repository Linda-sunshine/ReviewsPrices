review/summary: Frankenstein by Mary Shelleyreview/text: The writing level and style in this book is fabulous! The story is intriguing and very unlike the old movie renditions I watched as a boy. Ms. Shelley's description of the learning curve of the creation, animated as a full-grown adult, was incredibly imaginative and captivating. The story is quite short, the book arrived very quickly; I highly recommend the seller and the book.
