review/summary: A classic that modeled the restreview/text: After reading A Princess of Mars, I realized that it is the model for science-fiction/fantasy. The story is still fresh, and Burroughs captured the ideas of inventing alien or fantasy cultures. Some authors have taken the concept further (e.g. Flash Gordon, Star Wars) and others have made a mockery of the model (e.g. Chronicles of Gor). The sensuousness and adventure of this book cannot be denied. It is one of those stories that must be read, as no motion picture or other medium could quite do it justice.
