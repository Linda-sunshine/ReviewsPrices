review/summary: Watch the DVDreview/text: I'm giving this book five stars because the author is a lifesaver, but I watched the DVD version first and honestly, it's the same information in a lot less time! Plus you actually get to see the magic happen. And it is magic. Works for us, anyway.I definitely recommend watching the video or reading this book *before* the baby comes. Those first few nights can be rough, and your newborn is bound to respond well to soothing methods that remind him of the womb.
