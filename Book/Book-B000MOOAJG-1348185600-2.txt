review/summary: Good book but too long.review/text: The book was engaging. The story line was different and interesting. The author Could have made the book about half the size if she didn't explain her theories from so many different angles and perspectives. Seems like she was afraid that the reader would not understand her theories with simple examples or explanations. For example, John Galt's speech really does not need to take an entire chapter for the reader to understand his philosophy. Even after wading through all that, the book was still a good read. Have high hopes for the second part of the movie. The first part was well done and entertaining.
