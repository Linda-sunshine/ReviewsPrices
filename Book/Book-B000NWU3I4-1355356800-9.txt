review/summary: A Classic Readreview/text: The book was just like the original. The only question in my purchase was whether I should purchase the hardback or the Kindle version. I was worried certain things would be left out, but the few original illustrations that were included with hardback are also included with the Kindle version.Overall, a very nice addition to my Kindle library.
