review/summary: I love it when my kids beg to read another chapter!review/text: I love it when my kids beg to read another chapter! It makes me feel successful as a parent when they are experiencing the love of books. This isn't a book I dutifully read to my children either, it takes a lot of self-restraint to keep from reading ahead once they are in bed, and I often agree to read another chapter, and then another one, and even allow bed-time to be pushed back a little bit.
