review/summary: Dovestar here.review/text: Hi I am totally loving this story!! I am Dovestar of Birchclan. I am a queen, with four young kits. But despite that, I lead Birchclan quite well. This is a good story. The elders told me it. That elder was Silverfire. But then Lizardpelt started yakking about the old days. Uh oh, my kits are crying. Bye!!
