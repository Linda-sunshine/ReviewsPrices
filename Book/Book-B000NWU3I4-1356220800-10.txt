review/summary: Still a great storyreview/text: The first time I read The Hobbit it was such a chore to read it that it took me months. Having now read (and watched) the Lord of the Rings, returning to the Hobbit has gone much more smoothly for me. I think I was bogged down in details, before, and now I think I know which details are more worth paying attention to. I'm enjoying it much more, this time.
