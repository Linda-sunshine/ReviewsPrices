review/summary: Brave New worldreview/text: What I found most interesting about this book which was written in 1932 but is set some six centuries in the future, is the limited imagination Huxley had in regard to modern gadgetry. It starts out with the students still writing with pencils and paper! It is only eight decades into the future and already those items are obsolete. What would he have thought of the internet?
