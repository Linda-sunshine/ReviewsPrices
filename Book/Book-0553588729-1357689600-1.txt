review/summary: Good basics bookreview/text: We got this book upon a recommendation from another parent and a therapist with a newborn. It was a fast read and many folks have since to just watch the DVD which is on netflixs. The book is a fast read however, and I will probably refer back to it, so I don't mind having spent a bit more money and time to have read it.The book is well written and straight forward. I'm not sure he needs to sell the method as much as he does in the book - after all, you're reading it because you are interested in what he has to say. Overall, makes a lot of sense and hopefully will give us a different and healthy way to bond with baby when she gets here that will support her continued development and transition to life outside the uterus.
