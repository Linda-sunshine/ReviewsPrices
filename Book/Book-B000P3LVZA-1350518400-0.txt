review/summary: Somewhat datedreview/text: Although artfully written, the work is a bit long winded for shorter novel. The references are dated and take a little bit to get into the correct mindset to enjoy. It plays out better in your head than it does on " paper ". The story though makes up for any shortcomings and leads the reader along an intriguing story of a world in which social happiness trumps personal independence and starts the thought prices of " is there to much of a food thing".
