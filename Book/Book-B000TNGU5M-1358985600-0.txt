review/summary: changed me foreverreview/text: I hardly ever write reviews..but I just finished Night (actually, The Night Trilogy which includes Night as well as 2 short stories...Night is more of an autobiography of sorts, while the other 2 are works of fiction)...but this book changed me!!! I was born under a Nazi government (Apartheid South Africa) and came to Canada when I was 13. I hadn't even heard about the Holocaust until then (under apartheid there was no freedom of speech/infomation etc). But of course once I came to Canada I learned all about the atrocities of Nazi Germany. But Night...is different somehow. It's so scorching, so personal, so powerful that my heart shattered for all eternity on every single page. Dr. Wiesel writes with such clarity..I could smell the smoking crematoria, hear the children cry and feel the absolute terror and misery of these over 6 million souls. He asks questions that there are simply no answers to..."where was God at Auschwitz?", what is the meaning of this, why did he survive? on and on. And I started asking those same questions of myself. how he was able to survive this and not go completely mad or lose his faith forever is beyond me. It is important that we read this..that we bear witness to wahat happened...that we never forget and never repeat. One of the things I really gleaned from this book was how the Nazis had so methodically created industrialised death factories. They produced the most number of deaths with the least ammount of effort...that's what they were in the biz of doing...producing death. Even though I was taught all about the Holocaust in high school...it just never hit me until I read this book. I knew the numbers and the death camps and the pictures and footage...but this book made it personal. a must read for everyone. this is part of our collective history...why did the world turn a blind eye and allow this happen?
