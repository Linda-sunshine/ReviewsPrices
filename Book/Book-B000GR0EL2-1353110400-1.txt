review/summary: Incredible book!review/text: Where The Diary of Anne Frank tells the story of a Jew in hiding, this book tells the story from a different perspective - Christians who were hiding Jews and their time in concentration camps after they are discovered. It is an amazing story of courage and faith. I highly recommend this book.
