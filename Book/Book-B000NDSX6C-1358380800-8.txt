review/summary: A Classic Tale for All Agesreview/text: I have always loved any of Tolkien's works but I think the Hobbit really has a special place in my heart because of the childlike innocence that is not as present in the Lord of the Rings.Much of the story is told rather light-heatedly and much the way a grandfather might regal a grandchild sitting on is knee with a story of a far away place and fantastic creatures. The plot and characters are not complicated in any way, and if you are looking for a novel that is dark, and grim, with complicated characters, than The Hobbit is really not for you.There is not much more that I can say that other 5 star reviewers haven't said. I do have the Kindle version and there are no formatting problems and the illustrations are clear and very pleasant. I've had trouble with older books that are later added to the Kindle, but I had none with this version of the Hobbit. A great and fun read.
