review/summary: Timelessreview/text: The title alone could build an entire life, and at 53 pages, every word is profound and timeless and there's so much packed into it that you feel like you read a full-length book. Truly a masterpiece. Plus I downloaded it for free on Kindle. And I think it's still free. What are you waiting for??
