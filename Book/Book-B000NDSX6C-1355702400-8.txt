review/summary: Never has there been such a good book!review/text: Enter 1 Hobbit and 13 dwarfs + 1 aged wizard and you get an wonderful adventure! If you are like me and watched the movie before reading the book then you will be pleasantly surprised on the number of times the script matches this book. J.R.R. Tolkien is brilliant with words, he sets the scene so amazingly in words that you can visualise it as you read.Highly recommend to almost anyone, although if you are not used to the genre then you may find it a little odd.
