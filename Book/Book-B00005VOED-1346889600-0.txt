review/summary: A Confederacy of Duncesreview/text: I have bought this book a total of 4 times. Kept lending it out and they never brought it back and so I'd buy it again. Love the characters, they are people we know. Anyway I now have a hard copy and just recently bought it for my Kindle to make sure I have it, cause every now and then I like to read it to just laugh. Highly recommend it. Linda
