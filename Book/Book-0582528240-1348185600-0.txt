review/summary: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finnreview/text: This book is an honest, down home critic of slavery 100 years ago. Mark Twain uses the observations of a young, homeless boy to let the reader know that African Americans are the same as white people. He has Jim, a slave, travel with Huck on a raft into the southern slave states. During their adventure, they meet a variety of crooks and very hypocritical people, including con men who pretend to be kings and dukes from Europe, a rich Christian family involved in a bloody feud, and many Christians who own slaves. I think Mark Twain is not only an great writer for his time, but also for any time, because he makes the reader see people as they really are. His open criticism of society is humorous and yet all readers get the message. I would recommend this book to all readers who can read the many dialects used in the book.
