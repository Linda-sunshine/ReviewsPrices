review/summary: recommendation for THE HOBBITreview/text: I really enjoyed this book. Since it was well written and a believable fantasy it ended up being a quick read for me as I couldn't seem to put it down.Of course if one isn't into dragons and dwarves it would probably not hold their interest as much as it did mine. I do highly recommend it to anyone remotely interested in that genre !!!!
