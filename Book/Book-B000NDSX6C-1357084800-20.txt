review/summary: Tolkien is the master.review/text: When it comes to literary long fiction with a short story feel, there is no one better. The Hobbit is, according to us hardcore fans... The "middle beginning". And also the best place to start the Lord of the Rings saga. Much history there is, before this book, but the story of unlikely hero Bilbo Baggins is the best place to start. Do yourself a huge favor and read this, you won't regret it.
