review/summary: great moral storyreview/text: I remember watching the movie when I was younger, and had the movie in my head the whole time I was reading... waiting for all the climaxes of the book. I think that is why I rated okay instead of one star higher. The older language does make it a little longer of a read, not as easy to just read through. A great moral story, especially when you are or have gone through those moments in your own life. There is a little of everything for every girl/woman. Not a page turner, but definately lightens the heart.
