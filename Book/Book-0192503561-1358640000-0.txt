review/summary: Persuasion Jane Austenreview/text: Always a fan of Jane Austen.Though Pride and Prejudice may be considered her best work by some, Persuasion is my favorite. Maybe it's the older heroine that makes it more relatable to me. Enjoy the journey through this book . It's not about getting to the end. It's a book that I've enjoyed reading again and again.
