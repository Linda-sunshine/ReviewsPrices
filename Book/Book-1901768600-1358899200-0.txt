review/summary: Always a pleasurereview/text: Watched the movie 10 or so times before reading the book. Just finished second reading. The humanity of it is so engaging. Misunderstandings and assumptions abound. People hiding their true feelings and fearful of speaking up. How true in our lives as well, making the outcome even more satisfactory.
