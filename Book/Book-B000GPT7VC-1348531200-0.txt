review/summary: Uncle Tom's cabinreview/text: I had read this book as a teen. I knew it would be a good book.It is such a great reminder that there is not a superior person or group of people.It is also a reminder of the cruelties on group of people inflicted on another and hopefully if we look at history this kind of thing will never happen again.
