review/summary: God almighty, this is boring.review/text: I love this story; I hate those times when people were so judgemental about just anything (I guess we haven't changed a lot), but this book was boring. Just couldn't get into it. It would be fine if it were written in the 17th century, but this is a 19th century book, then why is it written in such an uncomprehendible style? I know people talked like that back in the day, but it was not just the dialogue, it was the book that was almost unreadable for me.Still, as I said I like the sotry very much. Shows what kind of spoiled and hypocrite creatures humans really are.
