review/summary: It's obvious why this is a classicreview/text: I was skeptical of this book at first, since I tried multiple times to read the first Lord of the rings boom multiple times but couldn't get into it. I fell in love with little Bilbo and his world, and look forward to reading the series now. This book was a great introduction to Tolkien.
