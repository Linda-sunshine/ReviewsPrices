review/summary: I read it with my hair standing on end...review/text: lots of suspense. Please note that the cemetary by the sea, where Dracula lands, has recently (1/2013) had a landslide!Nevertheless, I think that Bram Stoker had a very strange idea about the uses of Holy Communion. I wish the characters had investigated the true use of the Sacred Species -- It is to be consumed by the Faithful! Evil is best combatted within ourselves, don't you think?
