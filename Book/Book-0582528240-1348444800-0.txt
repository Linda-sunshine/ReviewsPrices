review/summary: HUCK FINNTASTIC!review/text: I must start by saying that although I do have a passionate love for literature, I am much more in tune with modern day epics than classics. I have recently finished Huck Fin for the second time, the first being my freshman year of college. This time around however, I enjoyed and understood it much more. I believe that although the language is a little rough around the edges, and at times slightly distracting to me, this book is an amazing tale of friendship and growth. The two boys go through a tremendous amount of change and learning experiences that most people can only hope to endure in a lifetime. I think that the first time I read this I was put off by the excessive use of the "N" word and couldn't see through to how, in spite of a few 'stereotypical' images that twain paints of Jim, wise and mature he really was. All in all I think it's a good read and Twain is an amazing Arthur if you simply open your mind to what he's trying to do with this novel!
