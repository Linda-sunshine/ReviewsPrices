review/summary: The Classic Comes to Lifereview/text: Tom Parker is a masterful reader and proves that one can improve upon a time-worn classic. I listened to the novel to refresh my memory, as I had assigned it to be read and followed-up by over 45 high school freshmen. Even though I was to have read it in high school and college, I had never read the entire novel from start to finish. That mission is now accomplished!
