review/summary: a gripping readreview/text: Wuthering Heights is a different type of story. It follows the developments of two generations of families and the family dynamics within from the point of an outsider being told the story. It almost reads like a family history if not for the love story thrown in. For the time period, the portrayal of certain scenes was quite graphic, and it's interesting to try to gain that perspective from our current time period, where violence and sex are pretty much societal norms.A great book! I would suggest making a family tree as you read; it does get a bit confusing!
