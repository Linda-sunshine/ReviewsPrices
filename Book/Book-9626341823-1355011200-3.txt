review/summary: One of the best ghost stories everreview/text: I would have given this book a good rating before I even bought it, having read the story and had it read to me decades ago and a re-reading simply confirmed it - five stars. The language is old and the descriptions go on a bit, but thats what people enjoyed then. Besides there is poetry in it.Tedward
