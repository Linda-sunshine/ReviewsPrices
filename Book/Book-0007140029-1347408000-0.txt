review/summary: Must read! But not for those of us who cry easily...review/text: I admit, I have been reading Erin Hunters books for a long time, about since they came out. Actually, since back when "Erin Hunter" was only two people writing the books, and not four. Personally I believed they were a bit better then, but they are never-the-less still my favorite books to read. Unfortunently, just about every single Warriors book I have read makes me cry; in fact, I can't even think about the series without wanting to cry. However, I would definitely recomend this series to anyone. These are the most interesting books I've ever read, and even if they do make you cry your eyes out, you will fall in love with each character; and not be able to put down the book until the very end.
