review/summary: Classicreview/text: A testimony to great writing. This has everything between two covers. Love, hate, sincerity, disgrace, utter sadness, pain, insanity cruelty, madness, and a type of heartache that is indescribable. A great love turned into a wrenching torment. Best book I have read in years.
