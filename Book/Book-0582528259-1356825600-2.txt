review/summary: A Great Readreview/text: Though there were a few minor changes in this version, it definitely does not alter the spirit of the great narrative, nor does it inhibit the reader's comprehension. Given the fact that it is a free edition, this is a fantastic vessel toward familiarity with a true classic.
