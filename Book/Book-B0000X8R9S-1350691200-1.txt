review/summary: The ONLY book my 11-year-old son has read with excitement.review/text: I can sympathize with any parent that has a child that hates to read. Our son has struggled with reading from the get-go, AIS, tutors, ADHD, the works! There is such a huge emphasis put on reading in elementary school and this becomes a nightmare for the parents whose child refuses. I am happy to say that this book took all the stress out of reading. My son, who just started 6th grade (first year of middle school), actually read on his own with no prompting from us, and did it lightning quick. He is now asking to download the sequel--music to our ears! If you have a child that is into this type of story, this book is very well written for child that doesn't love reading. It kept him turning the page. Other than the Wimpy Kid Diaries (which I consider "comic books"), this is the first book our son has read with huge interest.
