review/summary: Excellent classic novelreview/text: Sadly I never read The Hobbit until this year. It is truly a classic piece of literature. While not as enjoyable to me as The Lord of the Rings, it is true that you really can't have one without the other. It was truly an enjoyable and easy read and I love how Tolkien spoke to the audience throughout the book.
