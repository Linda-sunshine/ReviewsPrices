review/summary: Classic!!! One of a Kind!!!review/text: This book have a world pool of valuable information on human relations (what can be more valuable than that). Not the kind of book one would just read, put down and forget about it. I haven't finished it yet, I'm about half way through it (cause I'm reading each chapter twice before I go to the next) but I'm pretty sure its gonna just get better. I'll write a final review when I'm done.
