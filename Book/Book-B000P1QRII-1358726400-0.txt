review/summary: The Giverreview/text: This book is interesting, but I do not recommend it to anyone who is squeamish. This book talks about some very hard concepts that become frighteningly real. This master piece brings to life the horrifying concept of not being able to chose or to be an individual. I love this book but it is sad and inappropriate for a young reader.
