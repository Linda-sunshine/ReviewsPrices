review/summary: Great book, inside and outreview/text: The book itself is a timeless classic. This is easily one of my top 3 books I read in high school English class and remains one of my favorite books ever. The 50th anniversary pages that look handmade are a really nice touch that helps this book stand out even more in anybody's collection.
