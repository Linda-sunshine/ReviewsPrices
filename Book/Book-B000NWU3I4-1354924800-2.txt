review/summary: A Classic On Many Levelsreview/text: I recently re-read J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit for the first time in probably ten years. Once I got past the older and awkward narrative viewpoint (in Tolkien's defense, the omniscient point-of-view was in vogue back in 1937, especially for what was considered a children's book), I was reminded of how rich and wonderful the story is. I also realized how classic the tale is on so many levels. Not only is it a prototypical journey tale, but it incorporates all the classic archetypes of fantasy fiction. I'll look forward to reading the novel again in a few years time. It is part of the bedrock of the genre, and every time I read it, I discover something special.
