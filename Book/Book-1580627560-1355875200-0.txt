review/summary: Very shallow bookreview/text: I bought this book out of curiosity after reading all its favorable reviews, and unfortunately, I find it very disappointing. I think Agrove tried to write a manual for women to train a man. Relationships are much more complex than the book suggests, and I don't believe that men should be trained like pets by using the carrot and stick method. I find this book very shallow, simplistic, and targeted to apply to the masses. Also, I don't like the title of the book. The author could call "bitches" "strong women" instead. Both "bitch" and "doormat" seem to be derogatory to women, and men are depicted as silly puppies that can be easily manipulated by the "stick and carrot" method. I do not recommend this book.
