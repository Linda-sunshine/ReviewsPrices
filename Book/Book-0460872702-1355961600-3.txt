review/summary: Read it for book groupreview/text: It was fun to re-read this book after so many years (won't get into how many years)! Our book group read it now since the newest version of the movie is due out in early 2013. Re-reading it now plus having recently seen the 1974 version (with Robert Redford as Gatsby) helped clarify so much of the book that I missed when I was younger. It makes it clear why it is considered an American classic.
