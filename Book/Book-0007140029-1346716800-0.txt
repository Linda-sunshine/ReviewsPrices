review/summary: Read Into The Wildreview/text: Being a kid myself I know some kids [like my cousin] don't like reading much. I am in 6th grade. My friend Emily showed me the Warrior books. I went to Barns and Noble to get the first book. This morning I charged my kindle and I searched for the Warrior books. They Are great books. Emily, Emma, Shelby, and I love them. They brought us together like a Clan's shareing togues.
