review/summary: Huckelberry Finnreview/text: I recently made a trip to Hartford, CT where I toured the Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe homes. Both were wonderful examples of life in the late 1800's and in both houses we got a picture of those author's lives and how they thought.I may have read Huckelberry Finn in high school, but if I did, I completely forgot it. Now I am reading it and realize the potent political messages Twain was sending about the life of the slaves, even after the Civil War, and the mentality of those from the North who were exploiting the people in the South, both whites and blacks. Written through Huck's eyes, it is a telling and explicit picture of life along the Mississippi during troubled times. I like this book and realize now why it is such a "classic".
