review/summary: thought provokingreview/text: this was an incredible book that was thoughtfully written. the author gave personal accounts and feelings that make you examine your own life. so often we sit back and ask what' s in this for me, the author encourages the reader to look outside of that and think of those around you. I highly recommend this book!
