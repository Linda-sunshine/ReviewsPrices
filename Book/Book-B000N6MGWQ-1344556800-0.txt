review/summary: 5 stars all the way!review/text: This was one of the best books I have ever read! It makes you think about the people that come and go during your life and the possible meanings behind their appearances and their exhits from your life. It's a heartwarming book. It is very well written and thought out....it's a book I could read over and over again...from an author that has written heartfelt stories more than once!
