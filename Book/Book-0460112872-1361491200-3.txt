review/summary: One of my favorite storiesreview/text: I love Charlotte Bronte's &#34;Jane Eyre&#34;. This is a great story of a young woman that overcomes obstacles and challenges and rises triumphant in the end. Very much worth reading not just for the story itself but also for the wonderful insights at which Bronte arrives throughout the tale.
