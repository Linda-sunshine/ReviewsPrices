review/summary: Wonderfulreview/text: This book was astonishing. I had an assignment in school to read the book of " Alice in Wonderland". At first I didn't wanted to read it cause i had seen the movie. Later on that day i read the first sentence of the book. It was different from the movie. For example, in chapter one it says Alice was in her sister's bookstore and in the movie it showed she was outside studying. The other example, in the book it seemed she was taking forever falling in the hole and the movie she fall and then landed. So I kept on reading it and in my mind, it wasn't picturing how it is in the movie. I got into more and more each day.There were some big words I won't say or understand. But I reread the sentence and picture how it says it. This is such a wonderful tale to read. Children and adults will enjoy reading the book.
