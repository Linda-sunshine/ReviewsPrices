review/summary: Enjoyablereview/text: I considered this book a classic read. Having been written over 100 years ago you have to expect it to be different to books we read that have been written recently. I enjoyed reading the book but did find it to be a little tedious and far fetched in places. However, I am glad I have read it. Stevenson writes well and I would certainly like to read other books he has written.
