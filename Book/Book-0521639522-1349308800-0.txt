review/summary: An absolute CLASSICreview/text: This is one of the CLASSICS!I remember acting in this at school, I've seen it in professional theater and recently heard the audio book presentation.Very funny, even more so when you consider it is now 100 years old, and was probably the scandal of the day when it came out. It ages not at all, it could have been written yesterday and would be just as funny.
