review/summary: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.review/text: 1. I read this as a kid and never "got it." Now that I'm 60, I do. I cried several times during this reading. If you have not read it for a long, long time. Do so. You will finally, "get it."2. The kindle version has crummy illustrations. I don't know about the print version. However, I love reading on Kindle and would still buy it this way--electronically.3. Hey Amazon, your pictures are crummy. Clean up your act. I bought this on Kindle despite your pitiful pictures.
