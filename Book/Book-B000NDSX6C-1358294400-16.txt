review/summary: A++review/text: Book is easy to read on the kindle. There's links in the book u can click on that will take u to the map or to the runes translations etc. And then will take you right back to where you were reading. This is one of my all time favs. A classic story that will tickle your imagination. If you've never read the hobbit I recommend you do!
