review/summary: Best Book I've Read in a Long Time!!review/text: This book was absolutely fantastic! It is such a page turner. I highly recommended this book to any child over 10, or whenever they get the hang of reading chapter books. By the way, Charles Dickens writes the best books if your looking to read another book by him.
