review/summary: This is a timeless classic about good and evil and the triumph of good.review/text: I suspect that what Dickens was to the 19th Century, Tolkien will be to the 20th century. I know of no other writer who captures with such imagination and clarity the distinction between systems of domination and enslavement and those of liberation and freedom.
