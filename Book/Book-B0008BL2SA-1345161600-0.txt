review/summary: Wonderful!review/text: This was delightful! I have wanted to read this book for many years and finally got to it, and I am SO glad! It is a wonderful story, full of charming characters, emotions, and situations which are amazingly relevant to todays world. I was truly surprised at how much the various situations in the book written nearly 150 years ago mimmick the same situations of today. For example, I laughed at the March girls getting ready to go to a dance, with all of their primping and preparations, burning their hair with a curling iron, etc. I could easily remember my own primping for school dances and picture my daughter and her friends getting ready for theirs. I was afraid that the language used might be quite stuffy or antiquated, given it is quite old, but didnt find that to be the case. I thought it amusing how often Alcott says they will have a "capital time". Obviously, the use of this phrase has not stood the test of time, but then again I wonder which phrases we use now will die with time too. The family goes through joys, troubles, and near tragedy, just as in real life. I cried when Beth was ill. I laughed at many of their antics. I loved the kind and quite manner of Mr. Bhaer. Laurie is such a treat and gives a nice balance to the girls. This is by far the best book I've read this year, and after reading it I only wish I would have read it sooner. I wanted the story to go on. I loved it!
