review/summary: Wonderlandreview/text: In all honesty, the only reason I read this book was because it was for free for my Kindle but I am very happy I did. Yes, this book can be read by all ages and you pull something different out of the tale every time you read it. I read part of it when I was younger but it confused me too much so when I saw it on Amazon, I decided to give it a second chance. Lewis Carroll does a great job of displaying curiosity and the unknown adventures in a child's dream world. You can choose to analyze this book (drugs, imagery, different meanings) or just enjoy the uniqueness of it all. Either way, it is an interesting, different story and an easy read, too.
