review/summary: Outstanding!review/text: Lee Child never disappoints with his Jack Reacher! I recommend any book by this author. Child has what it takes to keep you interested, puzzled and thrilled with what is going to happen next. Man, wish I had a Jack Reacher friend!Lee Child is probably the very best author I've ever read in the mystery/thriller genre. Now you have to like &#34;justice&#34; and be of the mind set, that when others start things, you will finish them. I am... and the vicarious thrill of seeing the bad guys get their just desserts is just great! Don't hesitate to try any book by Child, each is well worth the money paid.I prefer to actually have the book so if something happens to my Kindle, I can still read these gems again. So I have both! Does that say enough about how highly I recommend the Reacher books?
