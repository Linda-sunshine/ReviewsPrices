review/summary: Simply amazingreview/text: If you are a person who loves the themes or periods like you play most of the time in D&D you will love this book. I originally saw all of the Lord of the Rings movies first, along with the new Hobbit movie that came out this winter. I do have to say, the movie isn't as good as the book but it was pretty darn close. Tolkien uses his words in a way to intrigue the reader while making them think in a different patter and just sucks you into it. I loved it, and I do recommend reading this book.
