review/summary: number one in one of the best series of books.review/text: Have read this series a number of times and I still love it. And am still learning new things each time I reread it. Nothing like reading the series,then listening to the audio books (Jim Dale) does a superb job. Then watching the movies. J K Rowling wrote a wonderful series! Kudos to her!
