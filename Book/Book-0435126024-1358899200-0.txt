review/summary: Who can do it better?review/text: I read this in my youth and have recently read and enjoyed many authors especially Francine Rivers. My daughter who is 41 thought I would enjoy Jane Eyre and she was so right. This historical romance novel is beautifully created and of relevance today. I would recommend this book for all ages.
