review/summary: Only read one book in high school. This was it!review/text: The Great Gatsby is still one of my favorite books. I decided to buy the very well priced Kindle edition so I could read it on some flights. I'm preparing myself for the movie is coming out. It was actually even better than I'd remembered.
