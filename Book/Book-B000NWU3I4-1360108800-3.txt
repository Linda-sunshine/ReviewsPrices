review/summary: A classic must!review/text: Well what is there to say, JRR Tolkien is a genius!I bought this book for like the 5th time and i would be more than happy to get it again!This is not LotR do not make that mistake, this book is more written towards children. but it is a great read even for adults if you have the right mind set!The book is an amazing adventure of Blibo Bagins, who is not one who likes adventures.It is filled with Epic moments and great interesting characters!It is an absolute must if you are a fan of fantasy fiction / Adventure!
