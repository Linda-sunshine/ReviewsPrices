review/summary: My 5 and half year loves this editionreview/text: I have an early self taught reader in the household and grandpa was the one who figured that she was at &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; level. I went looking and stumbled across this edition. The pictures are absolutely fabulous. The stories combined with the pictures rivets my daughters attention. She can now visualize what she reads. from the wonderful pictures. Every night - we read - 2 - 3 pages and I explain many of the words and phrases she's hearing for the first time. Even if it is late and way past her bedtime - skipping bed-time reading results in tears and tantrums. That is how much she loves the material. We review the previous days reading before continuing with new pages. I feel this is the only real education she is getting when at public school she is being taught the letter &#34;T&#34; at the moment..
