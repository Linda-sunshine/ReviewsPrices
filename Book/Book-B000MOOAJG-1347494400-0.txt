review/summary: Atlas Shruggedreview/text: This was an outstanding book which should be read by everyone. The story line moves quickly and is very relative for today's economic and polictical problems. This book should replace "The Catcher in the Rye" as a cliassic piece of American Litature within our High Schools.
