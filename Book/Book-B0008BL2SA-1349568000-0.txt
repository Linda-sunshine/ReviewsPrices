review/summary: Lots of spelling errors.review/text: I realize this book was free -- good deal! But, I selected this book to read outloud to a woman in a nursing residence who cannot see good enough to read herself. Her hearing is also an issue. Therefore, I read loudly. The errors in spelling make the flow of reading aloud difficult. Otherwise, it gets the point across. My mom read this book to me when I was little, and therefore wanted to share it.
