review/summary: Jane Eyrereview/text: I enjoyed the book very much even though it was written in what I call old english language. I believe the book would be enjoyed by adults in my age group more than by the younger generation. I had to read some sentences several times to get the meaning. (I was born in the forties.) I couldn't put the book down, I wanted to read it through to the end.
