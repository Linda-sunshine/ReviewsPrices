review/summary: Great book, but pre-read before presenting to childrenreview/text: I really enjoyed this book. It is a great coming of age story, but I felt that some of the topics were inappropriate for my 12 year old daughter for whom I was pre-reading the book. Though some topics were difficult, they were presented well and within a context that would give an opportunity for learning new perspectives without a loss of innocence. It is a book that I will recommend to my daughter, but I will wait another year or two. I read the Kindle version and had instant delivery with no problems whatsoever!
