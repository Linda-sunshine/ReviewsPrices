review/summary: Another Worldreview/text: I love Tolkien's imagination. He built a complete world that is sometimes beautiful and sometimes very evil. I probably fear spiders more than any other creature and he seems to always put these awful spiders into his scenery but then that's the evil part, right? I love the hobbits and their way of life.....wish I could visit the shire......I think it would be a warm, comfy place.
