review/summary: review of Man's Search for Meaning by V. Frankelreview/text: One of the most significant books I have ever read. Not only was it interesting from the viewpoint of his story of life in a concentration cam, but also in the way he shared his views on the lessons taught by his experience. These lessons are able to be applied immediately in one's life with success. I only wish that I had read it as a young man intead of at this advanced age. The lessons to be learned are immdiately applicable to one and all. Reading this short book carefully is a life changer.
