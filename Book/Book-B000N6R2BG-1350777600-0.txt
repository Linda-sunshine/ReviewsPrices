review/summary: excellent storytellerreview/text: I have recommended Keeping Faith to classes of adult students for its intriguing mix of current family dynamics, spiritual possibilities, and problem solving strategies. Ms. Picoult fascinates me and my students with real life characters who could be neighbors, but who experience life in ways that push the imagination. No problems getting assignments finished - everyone is spellbound and full of questions and opinions.
