review/summary: Still good after all these yearsreview/text: I read The Hobbit for the first of many times over 25 years ago. I devoured it and the Lord of the Rings trilogy multiple times. But then I tried to get through The Silmarillion and haven't really touched the books for over a decade after that. That's kind of a shame now, because I missed getting my kids into this wonderful story earlier.Who doesn't want to go on an adventure?Okay. Most hobbits don't, but most children do.I would encourage everyone to read this book again before seeing the new movies. As visually spectacular as they are, they do deviate from the story in the book in odd and seemingly unnecessary ways. It's fun to see and notice them.I am not a fast reader and it took under seven hours to read The Hobbit. I am a little shocked that the three new movies will be longer in total time. Read the book before seeing all three movies!
