review/summary: A Must Read For Every Woman!review/text: This book literally saved my life. A few years ago,it happened to catch my eye in the bookstore, right as I was heading to the checkout counter. The guy I was seeing at the time was very dysfunctional and borderline abusive, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to bring it home and do some self help work. I read this book from cover to cover that very night,and realized that I was guilty of everything she spoke of; letting people walk all over me,tolerating blatant disrespect,etc. Needless to say it was just the wake up call I desperately needed to pull my head out of my ass and end the relationship. While this is not by any means a substitute for counseling or therapy,Sherry Argov offers some great advice that is given in a very casual,humorous, and yet no-nonsense manner. Regardless of whatever your relationship is like, definitely make it a point to read this. It can help get you out of a less-than-ideal situation, or prevent unhappiness in the future.
