review/summary: Read it long ago.review/text: I was not excited to read Uncle Tom's Cabin mostly because it was written by a white woman. However, it has come to be one of the most influential books on the treatment of blacks that I have read. The most influential book: Uncle Tom's Children by Richard Wright. Both are highly recommended
