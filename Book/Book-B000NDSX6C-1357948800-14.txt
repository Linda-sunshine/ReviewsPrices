review/summary: Great book, I didn't find it as much of a child's book as reviewedreview/text: I never read The Hobbit when growing up and knowing that the movies were going to be released I decided to read the book. I agree that the Dwarves part in the first chapter was a little bit overdone but once you got through this initial part of the book I thoroughly enjoyed the story. I would not discourage anyone from reading the book simply because of the first chapter, after the initial chapter the book goes rather fast.
