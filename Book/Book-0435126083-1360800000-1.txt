review/summary: Great Classical Readreview/text: Wuthering Heights is a pleasant read if you enjoy classics.I enjoyed the unexpected twists as well as the absurdity of the characters.Without giving away too much, its a tragic romance which doesnt just affect the main characters but those around them as well. I enjoyed it.The old phrases and jargon are quite a bit to handle, so if reading on the Kindle, its great with the built in dictionary!
