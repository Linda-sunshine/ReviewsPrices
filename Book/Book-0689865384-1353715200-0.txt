review/summary: Female heroine, Male voicereview/text: What I love most about this series is Westerfeld's voice through his characters. The characters are different than those written by women and it shows in many of the personalities. For example, while most books in this genre have in depth detail about the way the girl feels while a boy is holding her hand, Tally seemed to have a stereotypical males take on the world. She wasn't giddy while daydreaming about her next kiss. She was more about action packed scheming and uncovering the truth, and she used her relationships to further her own agenda. I love this personality in a heroine as its quite refreshing.
