review/summary: OMG-BORING!!!!review/text: The language is so Old World, I found it difficult 2 understand. I read about 35 pages & decided Y waste my time on something so "Drawl". It was written in the early 1800s & I just have a really hard time/the social ladder instilled during that era. I honestly don't understand Y it's getting such high * ratings.
