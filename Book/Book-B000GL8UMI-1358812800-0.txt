review/summary: Fahrenheit 451review/text: This story is a warning against reliance on media and entertainment and government for information and leisure. The Parlors are symbolic of modern man's addiction to TV and the internet. The vapid importance of American Idol and such are lamented by Montag at the house party. When Montag is being chased by the hound, the network goes live to cover it - very much like today's coverage of police chases. As Neil Peart of Rush said; "Hidden camera coverage from the crime scene to the courtroom." These warnings should still be heeded today.
