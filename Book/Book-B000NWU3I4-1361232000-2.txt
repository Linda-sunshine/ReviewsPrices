review/summary: An Excellent Youthful Introduction to Middle Earthreview/text: J.R.R. Tolkien is a fantastic writer and he creates complete worlds. This is a nice introduction to the world he created for the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, it is light, jovial, and a quick read.The story follows a straight journey from a to b with some excitement in between. Some of the things I did not care for was who ultimately paid the price and killed the villain of the story. Also the final battle could have been expanded more and I can not remember one strong female character in the entire book. Thus four stars.
