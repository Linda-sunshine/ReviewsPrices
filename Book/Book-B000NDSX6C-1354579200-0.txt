review/summary: Very Slowreview/text: I have to admit this is the first time I've read The Hobbit and I wanted to read it before I saw the movie. I really wanted to love this book, but I just couldn't. And I know that so many Tolkien fans will think that that is just blasphemy!First of all, I thought it rambled too much and I had a really hard time getting through it. I can usually read a book in a couple of days but this one took me over a week; and it's not that long of a book. I thought the characters were a lot of fun and Bilbo is wonderful little hobbit. However, some of the descriptions of the journey were a bit tedious.Overall, I'm glad I finally read The Hobbit. I have already read The Fellowship of the Ring and I tried to read Two Towers, but I think I'm done with the Lord of the Rings. I gave it my best shot. It's just not my cup of tea.
