review/summary: Pity about the book coverreview/text: I liked the book but I hated that a picture of Tom Cruise was on the cover. It totally spoilt the image I had of Jack Reacher and my image was nothing like Cruise .... There are much better actors out there who could represent Jack Reacher more realistically.
