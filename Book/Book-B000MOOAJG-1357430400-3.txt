review/summary: Atlas Shrugged - Ayn Rand Fanreview/text: Atlas Shrugged is one of the best books that I have read in 50+ years of reading and hugely impacted the way I view the world and it leaders (this is coming more and more true, this book that was published in the 1955 is more relevant today than ever). This should be a must read before you able to graduate from High School.
