review/summary: THE ONE TO READ AND/OR STUDYreview/text: I've read MOBY-DICK before but never have I understood many of the underlying messages Melville attempts to impart until this critical and absolutely necessary edition. There are many footnotes and only a few are obvious padding; understanding Melville's inside jokes, asides and biblical allusions make this edition actually fun to read as opposed to just reading it straight through without any distractions. And yes, sometimes the footnotes will interrupt the flow but this is such an immense undertaking that it is like reading a whole new book with blinders off. We see Melville's taking jabs at religious orthodoxy and realize this is not a book just about whaling; it's about man's relationship to God in all it's guises. But there is alot to learn about whaling, man's relationship with different cultures and power structures. Many of the negative reviews see this as a long, boring book forced on high schoolers who never grew up to be adult readers. It is a book for mature audiences and should be savored like a fine wine or a single-malt scotch. There is much to indulge in after the text of the novel; whaling terms, drawings of whale-ships, lots of commentary and period and contemporary reviews, etc. to immerse yourself in. This is the most complete and authoritative edition I've come across and anyone trying to "get" the greatest American (and one of the top 10 international) novels ever written can't go wrong here. If this doesn't do it for you, nothing will.
