review/summary: Enjoyable readreview/text: I don't know if I'm the best person to review this, as this is my first Kurt Vonnegut book. I read this due to all the wonderful hype I have heard about throughout the years.I read the book with no foreknowledge of what to expect and I'm glad I did. It was a delightful read. Easy to read and understand. Vonnegut also does a good job of describing the characters and surroundings which help you lose yourself in the world he has remembered and created.I'm looking forward to reading more of his work.
