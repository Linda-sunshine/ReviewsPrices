review/summary: A Christmas Carolreview/text: Very intriguing, psychological, deep and didactic indeed. Notwithstanding, a lovely and classic story that provokes a thorough reassessment of personal values and human integrity. Dickens's lively narrative and writing mastery would certainly not leave you cold, regardless of your age and social status, allegedly.
