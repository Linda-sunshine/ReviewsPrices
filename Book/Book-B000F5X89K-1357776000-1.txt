review/summary: Frankensteinreview/text: Yes I did give it two stars. I really don't get what everyone sees in this and it reminds me once again that "classic" really just means old book. Also I remember just how much I dislike the writing style of that era. So much waffling. The book could easily do with a good trimming.Frankenstein is one of those characters that really pisses me off. He is a whiny piece of s*** and I could not find any redeeming qualities in him at all. He caused the whole issue through his own pride and arrogance and instead of dealing with it goes catatonic instead. He then proceeds to gambol around and inflict his invention on those he loves all the while crying "woe is me" like a pathetic teenager.The only interesting part of the book for me was the monsters tale. The book really picked up at that point and I was hoping the rest of the book would be as intriguing. But no after that we're back to Frankenstein's moping.I was glad to see the end of the book and it really proved the point that just because something is popular does not mean it is good.
