review/summary: Great Toolreview/text: Everything in this book makes common sense which to me means it's got the right answers. Me & most other people seem to brush aside common sense communication practices, but this book will bring them to light. It's easy to read; I read in about 2 days. Great read if you're single & looking or married.
