review/summary: Great playreview/text: I found this book very entertaining. It is funny and witty, but I found that it was not what the characters said that was funny, but the situation that the characters were in was funny. While I was reading the story I could just smell the trouble brewing. Keep in mind that this book is not for everyone, so make sure that you like reading plays before you read this, or you probably won't like it. Overall I enjoyed it, and if you like funny plays, you will too.
