review/summary: An American Classic.review/text: After over 2000 other reviews there is probably little new that I can add, except to say this book is one of the great thought experiments of modern American fiction. The entire process is set to show the barbarity of the Jim Crow system, and it succeeds. All students in school should be made to read it.The writing of the novel is brought into further relief by the acting of Gregory Peck in the movie of the same title.The reason for the four star rating instead of five is the characters of Aunt Alexandra and Miss Maudie. To me they blend together too much. But the book does bring out varied levels of the human condition. I first read the book in the eighth grade. I now teach it to freshmen in high school. A great piece of fiction.
