review/summary: Great Book!review/text: My 8 year old daughter LOVES this book and is completely hooked on the series now. She loves reading and loves cats so this is a perfect fit for her. She keeps talking about how interesting the characters are and how she is "so into" the story. As a parent, seeing your children being energized by reading is a special thing and this book has taken her to the next level. Can't wait for her to get the next book!
