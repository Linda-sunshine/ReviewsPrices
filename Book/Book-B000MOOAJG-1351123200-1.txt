review/summary: Dangerous Ignorancereview/text: I was an Objectivist for a few years when I was young. The fundamental flaw with Ayn Rand's philosophy is the basis of this book: The idea that CEO's are somehow supremely gifted superman, irreplaceable and far superior to weak, ordinary mortals.The Big Lie is that if all the CEO's vanished our world would be in shambles. Here's what would happen: Just like when a drug dealer is arrested, someone else sees an opportunity and takes his place. #2 rises to #1. #3 rises to #2.ALL human beings have drive and ambition. What we all do NOT have is opportunity: rich parents - a chance for a good education - health. Also, businessmen are generally not Creators. At best they manage creators, at worst they just control a big chunk of power and other people's money.If all the CEO's in the world shrugged, the world would shrug back.This book is far worse than inaccurate though - it has brought the USA to the brink of disaster, by removing any pretense of morality from business, and giving justification and arrogant righteousness for selfish, sociopathic greed, to the people smart enough to understand it, but not smart enough to think past it.When our civilization falls, we may just have Ayn Rand to thank for it.
