review/summary: It's Tolkien- What's not to like?review/text: Heard about &#34;The Hobbit&#34; since I was in high school - that was when dinosaurs roamed the earth freely and coal was still green and leafy- and yet had never read it. Then the movie came out and in order not to seem to far out of the main stream read the book.I really liked it. The plot was straightforward and easy to follow. There were some surprises. What did surprise me- and what did not translate into the movie- was the clever, convoluted and crafty writing style J. R. R. Tolkien used to capture the reader's imagination and unleash the power of the mental image. Would it be pretentious of me to say that it is more how the book was written than what it had to say that fascinated me? If so, forgive me. It's the truth. If for no other reason one should read 'The Hobbit' to see how effective the older style of writing can be.
