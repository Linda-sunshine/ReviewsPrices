review/summary: A classic worth readingreview/text: It might be a classic, and &#34;old&#34; book, but really interesting to learn about past times and a very particular society.beautifully narrated by Jane Austin, in my opinion on of her best books. If you have never read a Jane Austin book this would be a good first book to introduce yourself in her world.
