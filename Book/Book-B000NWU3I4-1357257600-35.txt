review/summary: Awesome bonus contentsreview/text: This is the first copy of The Hobbit that I actually own, and I should say I am pretty satisfied. I downloaded this book on my Kindle for Mac because I hate having hard copies. They get damaged over time, are sometimes too bulky for my wrists to read for an extended period of time, etc. I did hesitate at first because I was not sure if the maps would be included in this digital version, but after downloading a sample, my question was answered. The digital version comes with all the maps and writings. Most importantly, the table of contents is pretty thorough that I could jump between chapters or go back to check the maps. The only problem with the Mac version is that I could not listen to the audio of Tolkien singing and narrating the chapters... That was a huge disappointment. I bought this particular version because of the promise of audio contents from Tolkien himself. Oh well, it was still less than $7. It is still worth the price.
