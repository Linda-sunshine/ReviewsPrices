review/summary: Love it, live itreview/text: I purchased this book along with several more marriage, love, respect, and communication books when my husband and I got engaged. I was determined to make sure our marriage got off to a good start with communication being the key (love and respect too, of course). I started reading this book to myself at first but less than half way through it I called my husband (fianc&eacute; at the time) into the room and I stared the book over and read it out loud to him all in one sitting. We both talked about the book along they way. At the end of the book there is a quiz to determine your personal love language(s). I do recommend taking the quiz "First". We both agree it would've helped us understand or tie things together more during the reading.Before this book, my husband would buy me presents all the time to show me he love me, however, that wasn't what did it for me, him spending quality time with me showed me his love for me. Until we read this book we didn't realize what our own love languages were and that day we were able to identify them, talk about them, and start nurturing them. From that day on, my husband and I started really trying to "fill each others love tanks".4.5 years later, we are very happy and very much in love. We attribute a lot of the success in our marriage to our wonderful ability to communicate with each other and "The Five Love Languages" helped us with this.We purchased 12 copies of this book and gave it to all the couples we know in our immediate circle for Christmas. Every one of them have said they took something good away from this book. Highly recommend.* I also recommend the one for children!
