review/summary: A literary classic of the highest orderreview/text: "To Kill a Mockingbird" is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a literary classic on many levels. The book was a landmark work written in the context of the burgeoning civil rights movement. Harper Lee was a born and bred Southerner and she provided detailed descriptions of what is was like to grow up in the South. Her analysis was not autobiographical, but she clearly explained the peculiar mores, religion, academic institutions, and social norms of the era. Her detailed descriptions had a great deal of authenticity.She described the pervasive institutional racism of 1930's Maycomb County, Alabama. Tom Robinson, a black man, was falsely accused of raping a white girl, Mayella Ewell. Atticus Finch was the lawyer who defended Robinson at the trial. Robinson was convicted despite spurious evidence and contradictory, inaccurate testimony on the part of the defendants. Scout and Jem finch were Tom's children. The story is written from Scout's perspective. She was a young grade school girl who came of age. Scout and her brother were forced to learn the sad reality of inequality and racism of the time.Lee was a talented wordsmith who described the setting and characters with intricate details. She was able to maintain suspense throughout the novel, especially regarding the recluse neighbor Arthur "Boo" Radley. The story was always coherent and even minor characters in the book were memorable.In short, this book was a masterpiece of the highest order. It is a compelling tale from a narrative perspective. The social implications of the book are as relevant in the present day as when it was written. This is a tale about how children come to the realization that the world is not always fair and there are people who are victims of discrimination and violence. This is a phenomenal book, one of the very best and most significant novels I have ever read.
