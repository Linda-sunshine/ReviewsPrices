review/summary: Keeping Faithreview/text: Keeping Faith was a story that at times brought tears to my eyes and at others showed the good in all involved. As the story developed, I was drawn to keep reading. Faith, a young girl, is in the middle of a divorce when she seems to be hearing and talking to an imaginary friend. This develops into much more as Faith is involved in situations where people are healed if only for a while. It is how all adults around her deal with Faith that makes this such an interesting read. I would recommend it.
