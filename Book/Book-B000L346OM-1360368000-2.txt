review/summary: Man's Search For Meaning by Victor .E. Franklreview/text: As classics go, this not typical. The reason? Well classics frequently attract readers who have every intention of reading timeless literature, yet alas, they occupy space for a generation and the glue backing is brittle and splits the book in half when it is finally cracked open. The Ipad storage story? Ask me in a generation's time.Now Victor Frankl's &#34;......Search For meaning&#34;: Man's that is. It is a classic and a bloody good one to actually read. Why? Because it is classically meaningful and it makes classical common sense. If things are bad enough, how do you live without hope? Well if you are resident at hotel Auchwitz in the first half of the forties, you don't: unless you recall classics like Dostoyevsky. (spelled differently in Frankl's script but the same bloke I assume) You will learn that suffering is within the human condition for all of us. Therefore we can get meaning by being worthy of our suffering. To be unworthy is the real suffering. You may even die to be a worthy sufferer like that because it is better than turning into an impulsive unprincipled animal. Good people die in Frank's book but they lived with meaning until they were dead. How about us? Just because we don't live in concentration camps does not mean we do not suffer excruciating struggles. Frankl gives an analogy of a bottle that fills up with gas, meaning our lives fill up with challenges that pain us wherever we are. The second part of the book is a technical and professional rationale of what Frankl told us about in the first half. Why don't you just read it and see if you find principles to find some meaning in?
