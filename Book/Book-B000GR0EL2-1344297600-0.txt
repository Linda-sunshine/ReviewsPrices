review/summary: Surprisingly Captivating!review/text: I had been hearing about this title for years and finally decided to give it a try. After visiting Amsterdam and the home of Anne Frank some time ago, I'd decided Nazi oppression wasn't something I would enjoy learning more about and much less enjoy reading about...hence my hesitation in reading this book. But, Corrie Ten Boom's name kept appearing on my radar too much for me to ignore, so I finally surrendered and read The Hiding Place.I had the preconceived notion that this would be one of those preach-y books that in the end made me feel inadequate in my relationship with God. But I discovered something far different. The details of Ten Boom's early family life were so enjoyable to read, kept my attention and had me thinking about the story even when I wasn't reading it. It was far from preach-y.The story unfolds beautifully as a narrative of Ten Boom's experiences. I love the raw honesty and that she was far from perfect in her responses to people. Much can be learned from this rich, historical approach to her experience.This book would appeal to anyone with an interest in history, families, trust and faith. But even if you aren't a Christian, this book is worth your time (and wouldn't be time spent resisting the feeling that the author would like to convert you!).Highly recommended!
