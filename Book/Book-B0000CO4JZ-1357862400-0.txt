review/summary: Haunting and Wonderulreview/text: I'm actually reading this book as a sophomore, a year before I'm required to. I enjoy reading and I usually don't like books like this but in preparation to see the movie I decided to read the book beforehand. This book is simply amazing, a haunting message about a man who has everything but is not content, and a women who is only content with having everything.
