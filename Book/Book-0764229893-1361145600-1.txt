review/summary: Really good!review/text: These Chronicles have really opened my understanding to that part of the Old Testament which these books discuss. The story line keeps going from one book to the next with amazing attention devoted to the truth of Scripture - even though these books are fiction and certain things are added to make it all one story. As one reads it is very easy to see in your mind what happened, how and when.The research and knowledge of Lynn Austin is impressive and much appreciated.
