review/summary: Where it all startsreview/text: I read The Hobbit when I was in High School, but I doubt that I had the cognitive ability to actually appreciate Tolkien and his amazing story. The Hobbit is a classic, a true gem in literature. The Hobbit was more amazing than I ever remembered and I loved revisiting this classic story.
