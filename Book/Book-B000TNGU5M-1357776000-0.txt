review/summary: Great read and well taken care ofreview/text: Most have read the summery on Wikipedia so I will not waste time writing about what I have read. What I will say is that it is a great book that will change your perspective on the inhumanity proclaimed in the name of humanity. This is one of those books that will keep you up at night reading and then thinking about what you have just read.I should also note that the book was very clean and well taken care of (besides the sticky notes left inside) and was exactly what I expected.
