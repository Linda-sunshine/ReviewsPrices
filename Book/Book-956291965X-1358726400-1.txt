review/summary: A book review of Dorian grayreview/text: I thought this book was really creepy and haunting. It was incredible, though, even though the style of writing could get a little boring at times, with its long descriptions. The lengthy descriptions were really the only things I disliked about the book. I would not read this book if you have a short attention span- I found that if I skipped a part I found boring, I would miss something important, and have to go for it later.
