review/summary: A Must-Read for Everyonereview/text: "A little learning is a dangerous thing...shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, and drinking largely sobers us again." - Alexander PopeCuriosity and learning were foreign concepts to Montag, a book-burning fireman. But that was before Clarisse, before the books. No longer able to stay blissfully ignorant of the wrongs of the society around him and the misery of the people so engrossed in their technology, he begins his journey for knowledge. But how far is he willing to go?Ray Bradbury sobers us with the world he creates, leaving us to wonder - could our future be heading down the same path? With odd and many sided characters, such as Mildred who calls television actors her family during the day and downs sleeping pills at night, the book refuses to be put down.In his book, Bradbury proves that knowledge lives on long after it is created; even when the source is gone, things can still be remembered and often still ring true.Within a single novel, hard to find in this day and age, a story that transcends time is found, one where you hope and worry for the protagonist. Is there any chance of success against government as a whole and is rebellion and knowledge worth it? That's for you to decide after reading this book. For we are taught that, though knowledge sobers us, we must be sober to be ourselves.With an unpredictable ending and realism not found in most books today, you will regret it if you miss this book. But wait until you are ready to decipher it, because symbolism is found everywhere, from salamanders to people.
