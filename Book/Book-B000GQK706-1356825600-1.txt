review/summary: I will not buy ANY edition of LOTR from Amazon!review/text: Hardcover, paperback, Kindle - you name it - I won't get it here. Why? Because it's difficult to figure out what kind of product you're getting since they lump reviews of different editions together. I've been an enthusiastic Amazon customer for years, but this just makes me angry.I'm going to make an old-fashioned trip to a number of old-fashioned bookstores and enjoy the process of hand-picking that special edition for myself. Devote a day to it. Because Tolkien is worth the effort.
