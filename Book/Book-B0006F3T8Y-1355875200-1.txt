review/summary: Little Women stands the test of time!review/text: I re-read L.M. Alcott's Little Woman as our book club's (On the Same Page Book Club) December/Christmas pick-of-the-month (we decided to choose a light, beloved book from our childhood). I first read this book when I was 8 years old (I'm now 68) and I fell in love with all the characters. I've seen all the movie adaptations and also loved them (especially the Susan Sarandon, Winona Rider version, although K. Hepburn was a "capital" Jo!) I occasionally had a bit of a giggle about some of the sentimentality, the over-the-top language, (especially Amy's) and the dated mannerisms (so glad I didn't live back then ~ I'd be a social outcast!) On the other hand, the story is so heart-warming and charming, I soon was able to overlook the fact it was written more than 150 years ago. It is surely a CLASSIC and will remain so for generations to come!
