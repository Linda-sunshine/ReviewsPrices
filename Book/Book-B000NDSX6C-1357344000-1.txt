review/summary: Bought this for my son, he carries it everywhere with him.review/text: My son is seven and is really into reading and most recently really got into The Lord of the Rings so I thought he'd like this. The illustrations are beautiful, and the dialog is Tolkien's original writing. I think it's a great introduction to Tolkien for my son because, although The Hobbit is technically &#34;a children's story,&#34; my son is still in the beginning stages of reading where illustrations still help out a lot. Also, from an adult fan's perspective, it's just a need piece to have.
