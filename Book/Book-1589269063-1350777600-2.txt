review/summary: Great Insights Into Effective Communicationreview/text: I really enjoyed the Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman. The book provides great insights into how people communicate and feel love for one another. It was really cool to look and see what my and my girlfriend's "love languages" were. It made a huge impact on our relationship and the way we relate! I have been finding new and creative ways to express myself, which I never would have considered before reading this book.Another book that had a great impact on my life and relationship is Ariel and Shya Kane'sHow to Have A Match Made in Heaven: A Transformational Approach to Dating, Relating, and Marriage. It is an inspiring book, which can support you in having an amazing relationship. It includes video clips of the Kanes interacting with the people discussed in the book, which was really helpful, as I could see the ideas expressed in the book come to life. I highly recommend both the Five Love Languages and How To Have A Match Made In Heaven if you are interested in the possibility of having an extraordinary relationship.
