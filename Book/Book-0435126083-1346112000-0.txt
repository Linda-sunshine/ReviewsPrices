review/summary: dissapointingreview/text: I wanted to like this book. I love classic historical fiction/historical romance, and I was hoping to find the same thing in this novel that I had found in Pride and Prejudice, and Jane Eyre (written by Emily Bronte's sister, and way better). I really don't get why so many people rate this as one of their favorites. For me, there needs to be at least one character that I care about. These characters are all unlikeable. That's not to say the book isn't worth reading. it was interesting, and well written, but it could have been so much better.
