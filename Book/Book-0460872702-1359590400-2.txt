review/summary: The orgastic futurereview/text: &#34;It eluded us then, but that&#8217;s no matter&#8212;tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And then one fine morning&#8212;&#34;What can I say about The Great Gatsby that hasn't been said before? I love this novel. The people are flawed. Jay Gatsby's realization of what Daisy has become is tragic. I want to yell at Tom, shake Daisy, tell Nick to do something more. When you can fall into the world of the story and think your voice is loud enough to change the inevitable, you've made something powerful.I'm sure a lot of people will watch the movie when it comes out. Maybe it'll be accurate, maybe it won't. I encourage you to read the book first.
