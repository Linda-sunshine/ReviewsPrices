review/summary: Read it, NOW! (5/5 - Excellent)review/text: This book is excellent because ANYBODY can appreciate it. Of course, a lot of this is common sense, but you see it here ORGANIZED and PRESENTED in a way that is easily "referenceable". If you can't appreciate this book, you are jaded and sad.
