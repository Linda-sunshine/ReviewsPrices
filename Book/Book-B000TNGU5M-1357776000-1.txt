review/summary: HISTORICAL JOURNEY.....review/text: I CHOSE THIS BOOK AFTER SEEING ELIE WIESEL ON OPRAH'S SUPER SOUL SUNDAY PROGRAM. I HAVE A PASSION FOR THE HISTORY AND ITS SURVIVORS OF THE HOLOCAUST. MR WIESEL TELLS A VERY SAD BUT IMPORTANT STORY WHICH ALL HUMAN BEINGS SHOULD BE MADE AWARE OF. AS MR WIESEL STATED "TO LISTEN TO A WITNESS IS TO BECOME ONE." WE MUST NOT FORGET....
