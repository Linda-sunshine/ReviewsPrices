review/summary: Powerfulreview/text: I have read a fair amount of Holocaust literature over the decades, but for some strange reason had avoided "Night" until I recently picked up the audiobook from the library.Powerful is the most simple word to desribe it. Wiesel does an awesome job of pulling the reader into the terror, disbelief, agony, starvation, pain, and isolation of the Holocaust experience.I can see why this little volume is on so many "must read" lists. We need to be reminded that this should never happen again. And Wiesel also reminds us that neutrality is victory for the oppressor. We cannot stand innocently by if we see injustice happening.
