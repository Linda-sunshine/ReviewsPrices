review/summary: I liked this editionreview/text: It is The Hobbit so no wonder I liked it. The Kindle version was formatted great. I had a free copy from Google Play store and it was not formatted correctly for Google Books on iPad. Nor would the audio files play. With Kindle for iPad, I had none of these problems. My main plus for this edition was the inclusion of the audio files of Tolkien reading parts of the book. My only complaint is that there was not enough of that. Overall, happy I went ahead and repurchased on Kindle.
