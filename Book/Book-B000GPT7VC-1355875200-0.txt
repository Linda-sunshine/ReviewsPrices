review/summary: Kindle Version is Formatted Wellreview/text: This review is only for the Kindle version. A lot of old public domain books have misspelled words and bad formatting. None of those problems here.The book itself is a classic and an amazing read. Had no idea how evangelistic it was. Reading the slave dialect is really annoying but it is what it is.
