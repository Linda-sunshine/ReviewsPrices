review/summary: Classicreview/text: I bought this for my son for Christmas and had it put on his Kindle and although my son has yet to read it, it's a classic and I know he is going to love it as much as I did/do.I looked at physical copies and other online options that were The Hobbit but ultimately decided on this one which I am glad I did so he will know that The Hobbit came before The Lord of the Rings.
