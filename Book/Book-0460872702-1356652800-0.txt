review/summary: Turning Schoolkids Off of Books for Generationsreview/text: "The Great Gatsby" is one of the books assigned to me in Junior High School, which literally made me think that reading was not for me and that books were so boring you couldn't keep your eyes open long enough to make any progress through the pages.Recently, now that I've been an avid and voracious reader for decades, I've been revisiting some of my old paperback nemeses and seeing if I was really feeling what I thought I was feeling back in the day.Now that I've made it through this one, I simply can't understand why any teacher or school board would torture modern children with this over-fluffed, treacle-encrusted marzipan of word-sludge as opposed to ten thousand other books of higher literary value, that the youth of today could identify more closely with and learn something from.The avalanche of nails-across-the-chalkboard metaphors in the early going of "Gatsby," the author of which -- from his pompous and aloof style of pointless word-slinging -- apparently mistook himself in real life for the offspring of Goethe and Charlotte Bronte, drip on our heads like slowly- melting icicles in a recently refurbished igloo where wizened Eskimos ponder their evening blubber like Franciscan Monks who have lost a rosary bead in their sourdough muffins.But slogging ever-onward through wordy and pretentious descriptions of landscapes, lawns, shorelines and mansions, and also slogging through some tedious back-story pages, a plot does begin to emerge which is not totally without some merit and actually encorporates some ACTION!!In the short 180 pages of the book, a lot finally does happen, most of it towards the end, where mercifully the author had apparently gotten as sick as the rest of us of his metaphorical vomitations and settled down -- at least slightly -- to the meat and potatoes of his tale.....or should I say, the pheasant under glass and truffles of his tale.I guess I'm glad I know what's in this book now, just because everybody seems to think it's so important -- for what reason, I'll never know.
