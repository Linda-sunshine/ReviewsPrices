review/summary: Wuthering Heightsreview/text: This is a classic book. Emily Bronte has taken a love story and put her own twist on it. If anyone had studied the book in High School will tell you, the irony is simplistic. I loved it back then, and after reading it again I loved it even more. There were things I didn't understand back then that made more sense. Since I've been married for 20 years now, I understand the meaning of true love. Read it again if it has been so long, reanalyze it and decide for yourself.
