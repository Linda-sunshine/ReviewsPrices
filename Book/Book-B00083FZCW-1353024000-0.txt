review/summary: OMG BEST BOOK EVER!!review/text: OMG! I love this series! My friend suggested I read the book, & I did! From page one, I loved it. The Maximum Ride Books are a page turning series! This is about mutant bird kids who are 98% human and 2% bird. Scientists created them (Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Angel, and the Gasman) at a lab called The School. They are running (well, actually flying) away from the scientists, who want them back at the school. Maximum Ride ia action-packed and a great choise for teens. I am not a teen, but I'm an advid reader, and way above my grade level skill. Overall, this is THE BEST BOOK EVER YOU HAVE TO READ IT!!!!!
