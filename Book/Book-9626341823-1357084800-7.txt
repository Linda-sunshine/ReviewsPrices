review/summary: Still a good read after all these yearsreview/text: I have watched various adaptations of this Dickens classic and wanted to read the story as an attempt to gauge which movies were the closest to the original text. As it turns out, the 1951 version with Alistair Sim is truest to the original, although some omissions were made there as well to adapt it to the screen... as you would expect with a book adaptation. Still, the original story is a joy to read and the 1840's vernacular is quite entertaining, if thought-provolking at times. A good read.
