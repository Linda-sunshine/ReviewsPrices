review/summary: As wonderful as expected!review/text: (Don't worry, so spoilers)So I have been wanting to read this for a while (after reading LOTR--amazing), so when the movie came out, I thought it was time before I saw the movie (which I still haven't....). I heard this book was great, and it was nothing less that that! It is a wonderful adventure and I couldn't put it down until the end. If you are any part a LOTR fan or just a fantasy genre fan, you MUST read this magical book!
