review/summary: Harry's first outing is still his most magical!review/text: I first read this novel about ten years ago. Last week, I decided to revisit the world of Harry and his wizarding companions, this time in audio format while I was going about my workday. I was delighted to find that this book is just as magical and engaging as I recalled. I've read through the entire series previously, and this first adventure has always been my favorite of all the Potter books. In Harry's debut, the world of Hogwarts and the adventures of the children is presented in such a manner that it truly captures the imagination, and it is full of inventiveness and pure FUN - something that the series went away from as time progressed, and Rowling decided to tackle more serious subject matter.In my second reading of "The Sorceror's Stone", I had an even greater level of appreciation for the efforts of Rowling. Not only is the story remarkably fun, but it's also a first rate middle grade mystery. The way by which Rowling cleverly inserts clues throughout the novel is quite brilliant, and the payoff toward the ending is fantastic (though the climax is a bit muddled). The characters are also very well drawn, creating true empathy in readers for the bespectacled protagonist and his loyal friends, as they struggle through the challenging world of magicking. Though I don't agree with the more depressing tone that the series took as time went on, there's no denying that Rowling has a brilliant knack for children's literature, and for triggering the imagination. Likewise, it's no wonder that the story of Harry has become the largest reading phenomenon not only for this generation, but quite possibly any previous one, as well... Muggles, rejoice! Harry Potter is still fun!
