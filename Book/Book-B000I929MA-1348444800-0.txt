review/summary: Read the "Historical Notes"!review/text: I have to admit that this book took almost 150 pages before it grew on me. I only kept going, because the book has such a good reputation, I figured it must get better. I did have a hard time with the books writing style, however, the final chapter of the book, which masquerades as a "historical notes" appendix put everything into its proper perspective. I have seen a few people suggest that they didn't read this final section, and that is a huge shame. This final chapter is the thing that ties everything together. Suddenly, the book that I had felt was a little bit stilted came alive. In hindsight, it is an amazing read, and I have a feeling that I will give it another read through sometime in the future. Overall, a very interesting book, stylistically AND thematically.
