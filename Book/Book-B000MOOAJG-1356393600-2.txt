review/summary: Over-rated, nice plot, but I don't share the philosophical premise.review/text: I started reading this based on a co-workers philosophy/infatuation. I found it very engaging at first, and tugging at the emotion of those who feel the system is taking advantage of them. After awhile I became largely bored, but driven on by the hope of some very important message. Overall I liked the expression of thoughts, but I don't share the same ambition to have the pendulum of society swing in this direction. I have a hard time correlating this with all the positives of the society I have been blessed to be apart, and I don't feel that the extremisms of this philosophy have a long term benefit to the human condition.In the end the message was based on a search for a Utopian society that so many before have espoused. I can't predict the future, but as times change and become pregnant with new ideas, I pray for a less narrow vision of humanity is embraced by society.
