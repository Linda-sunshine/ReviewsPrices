review/summary: Pleasant fantasyreview/text: A classic in its own way. One must keep in mind that Tolkien was making a political statement concerning the current time. His opinions were strongly affectded by his WWI combat experiences. With that in mind the book has more depth and perhaps more meaning in today's environment. I hope that my re-read will not ruin the movie.
