review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: The book is beautiful! (50th Anniversary Edition).First off the cover is marvelous, it feels soft to the touch and feels like it is covered with leather/sued. The pages feel like you are touching silk. The pictures and map are fun to look at.The shipping was alright, the box was beaten and bruised. (You can't blame amazon and the book was fine)It is a very nice book and it includes Fellowship of the Ring, Two Towers, and Return of the King. It also includes a map, appendices, introduction, 50th anniversary special writing, and some lore. I have not read through this book yet (this one that I have just ordered).Once again Beautiful Book. You won't regret buying it.
