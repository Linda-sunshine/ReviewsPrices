review/summary: Uncle Tom's Cabinreview/text: Since getting my kindle I have started reading some classics I should have readi in school, but never did. After reading Uncle Tom's Cabin I can understand why it was so controversal in its day. It was a very easy and pleasurable bookto read and the price was right.
