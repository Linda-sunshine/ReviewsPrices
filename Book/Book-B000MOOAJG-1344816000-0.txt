review/summary: Reviewing the book & not the author...review/text: A book review should be about the book & the story told, not just all about what the author was thinking or reading between the lines or that it is a cultural manifesto or some such nonsense...even if those things may be true, carrying on about all that still isn't reviewing the book is it?I originally read this book about 35 years ago & reread it recently...looking at it as just a pulp fiction novel, I found it to be a pretty good read over all. There were some rather dry parts that maybe went on a bit too long about something, but Ayn wove an interesting tale about an alternate &#34;what might have been&#34;.I enjoyed the thought provoking aspects of her spin on society & would recommend this to anyone.
