review/summary: Summaryreview/text: While reading the hobbit, I encountered not only excitement and became very anxious to see what would happen next. This book is definitely a page turner. The illustrations are printed very clearly, and with very good notes on what they are. And then the annotations-useful engaging and very well done. You will WANT to read these. we discover how the book was written and what was changed between editions. There are fascinating tidbits about tolkens life and the experiences that made their way into the story.To further describe The Hobbit, Bilbo is a reluctant member of an adventure that will forever change his life and the lives of those around him. He accompanies 13 dwarves on a mission to reclaim the gold and mountain kingdom of their ancestors from the dragon, smaug. they have many adventures and mishaps on their journey to the lonely mountain including the climatic battle of five armies. Bilbo finds a magic ring along the way which leads, not only to a rise in his stature, but alos an new adventure for his friends in "The Lord Of the Rings"."Here is beauty that cuts like a knife and burns like cold iron" - C.S. Lewis, in the first review of the hobbi.
