review/summary: Great digital version of the best fantasy story ever writtenreview/text: I think this is the fourth copy of LotR I've owned - I've had individual copies of the three volumes, a paperback single volume, the red leather-bound single volume, and now this one. I love the look of the leather one, and for casual reading I still prefer a 'real' book, but for reading in bed, on the go, or in low-light conditions the Kindle app on my Android phone can't be beat. This is also a great deal, as the individual volume Kindle books add up to quite a bit higher cost.
