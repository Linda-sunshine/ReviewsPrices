review/summary: The Handmaid's Tale - Ugh!review/text: I was disappointed with the style of Atwood's writing. It felt as though she was trying to find the biggest and most obscure words to describe the environment. I am not the strongest reader, but love to read. I found this book to be one that I had to force myself to finish.
