review/summary: Shelly's original edition of Frankenstein is a masterpiece.review/text: Mary Shelley;s Frankenstein is a masterpiece. Thus it has stood the test of time and is taught in schools even today. The story is profound with themes of bravery, adventure, unrealistic human aspirations and fundamental questions about good and evil. The most amazing thing to me, however, regarding the book, is that it was written decades ago by a teenager who was stranded in a house during a freezing winter is Switzerland. The book was actually written on a dare, "While we've nothing else to do, let's write a ghost story, the best one wins." (I'm paraphrasing of course). But essentially this is what happened and the result was this profound, spiritual horror story about the aspirations of a man trying to be God with an inevitable but interesting Shakespearean ending of tragedy. There are lessons to be learned from this book. Profound lessons, and how a teenager, especially a female teenager could create such a masterpiece establishes that the human capacity for imagination and teaching in the context of a novel is something that simply can not be denied. It's sad that modern literature seems to lack this soaring imagination, originality of form and inevitable conclusions of right and wrong which beam brightly from this outstanding work of fiction. This book should be required reading for all English speaking people and perhaps for all people across the world. I give it the highest recommendation possible.
