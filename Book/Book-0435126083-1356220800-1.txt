review/summary: Slow to get startedreview/text: I try to read some of the classic must read novels every now and then and I have to admit that this book was challenging to read at start. I found the language and accents of some of the characters difficult to understand at first but as you read further into the book, it flows and the plot thickens. I thoroughly recommend reading this book, I won't give away the storyline but I think you should persevere if you find it difficult to take in at first.
