review/summary: Who loves the Benjamin?review/text: Written by the Founding Father himself, how could this be anything but great? Views on life, love, sin and virtue, and how to survive on a pittance. One caveat: this book ends well before the Revolution. It hints at what is to come, but never touches on the war, Washington, Jefferson, etc., at all.
