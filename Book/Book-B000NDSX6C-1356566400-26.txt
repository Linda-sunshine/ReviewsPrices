review/summary: Gorgeous Bookreview/text: I had recently saw the movie and was intrigued to find out how the story ends so I bought the book. I'm not a big reader and have never liked paperback size 4 font books and this was def an excellent choice for me. Its an easy read and the bigger spaced out font just makes it more enjoyable to read for an extended amount of time. Its absolutely gorgeous and will look great on the bookshelf when I'm finished.
