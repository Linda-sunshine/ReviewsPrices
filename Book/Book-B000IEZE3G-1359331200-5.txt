review/summary: A Classicreview/text: There is not much to be said here,that hasn't already been said by many before me. This is the first volume in what has become, arguably, the most significant Fantasy saga since the works of Tolkien. It has the exceedingly rare quality of not only being tremendously popular but also, very,very good indeed. Witty, inventive and exciting, it was a delight to re-read. Most of the later books (with the exception of "Chamber of Secrets",) are better than this book, but they are all of superior quality.
