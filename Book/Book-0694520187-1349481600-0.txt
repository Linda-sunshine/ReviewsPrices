review/summary: Never to late for a classicreview/text: It was years before i picked up this book and read it. I just didn't believe the hype. When I finally picked it up in the summer of 2010 I was hooked from page 1. Melville was at the top of his game while writing this novel. And while i don't care for the whaling history chapters it doesn't detract from the sheer genius of Melvilles writing. His portrayal of a hysterical Ahab is brilliant and insightful!!! get this book and read this book!!!! and witness what it truly means to be driven by some "inner urge"!!!
