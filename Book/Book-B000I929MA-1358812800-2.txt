review/summary: 100 books to read before you diereview/text: My Book club is reading this book for the month of January 2013 and I just finished. This portrayal of an entirely different way of living makes me thankful for the democracy we currently have, but also wary of how easily and quickly change can happen to create something entirely different. I hope this type of society never comes to be in our world.
