review/summary: classicreview/text: It had been a very long time since I read this book. It was well worth a re-read. We all know the meaning of the scarlett letter. We know that Hester commited adultry since her husband was away and she became pregnant. But do we remember the father of the baby? I didn't! Do we remember why she didn't tell who he was? I didn't.It is not only a good read but an important statement about where this country has come from! Knowing what happened when the religious were in charge of laws and punishment should give all of us a wake up call. Had I been alive in those days I would have probably been burned at the stake. Scary!
