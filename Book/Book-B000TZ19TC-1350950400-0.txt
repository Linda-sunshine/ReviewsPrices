review/summary: Still Underestimatedreview/text: Fahrenheit 451 populates most "Best Books" lists and yet it is still somehow under appreciated. I think some of this stems from critics focusing much of the attention on the censorship of books, which, while certainly an important aspect of the novel, is not necessarily its most compelling point. The most devastating scenes are those where it is clear that this society has lost its soul. In commenting on the war that wages around them, Mrs. Phelps states, "It's always some other woman's husband that dies." Montag, the protagonist, is married to a woman who has attempted suicide multiple times, who can't remember where she met her husband, and who doesn't care about...anything.The images that Bradbury can call forth during the book's climatic moments are heart-wrenching. Books die like slaughtered birds. Bombs fall like seeds scattered by the hands of God. Sparks dance like fireflies.Yet, in the middle of all of the carnage and waste, there is hope. Hope that we will not forget the past and the lessons it teaches. Hope that even in an age where the iPods, massive television screens and casual violence that Bradbury predicted 60 years ago exist that we will not lose our humanity.This is a beautifully written book that has never been more relevant.
