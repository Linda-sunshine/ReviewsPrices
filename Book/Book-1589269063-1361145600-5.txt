review/summary: Great book for everyone!review/text: I have been told for years to read this book, but didn't until just recently. It really inspired me to think of others and their primary language...whether it be with my husband, family, or dear friends. We are all different. After I figured out my husband's love language, I started applying some of the idea's the author gave, and my husband has been a much happier man...thus, giving me what I need as well. I highly recommend this book to those who may be struggling in their relationships or those who are not.
