review/summary: LOVE IT!!!review/text: This is the real deal. Charles Dickens wrote the story like this. It's the classic story of a man named Scrooge who hates Christmas and is somewhat mean to his employee. On the night of Christmas Eve, he is warned by the ghost of his former co-worker that three Christmas ghosts will visit him during the night. That's enough about the story for now. I recommend this book to everyone who... that's it. This is the perfect story, especially for this time of year. It will warm your heart and make you smile. The best part is, it is FREE!
