review/summary: A guide for everybodyreview/text: This is a great book,it takes the time to point out to us all what we miss by not living life to it,s fullest.The only thing I can fault this book is some of the words in the book are not used today so some of the meanings are lost .I know the words used were common for the time but for the average Joe today it detracts from the story.
