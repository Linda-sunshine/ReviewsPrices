review/summary: Outstanding just as good as the moviereview/text: I enjoyed this book and surprisingly it wasn't too far off from the movie or vice versa... I still don't think I could have imagined half of that stuff if I hadn't watched the movie first but I am a truly a Harry Potter fan to the end...
