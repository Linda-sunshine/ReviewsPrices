review/summary: Gospels from Ayn Randreview/text: I don't believe in God but this book supposedly coming from a woman who valued reason and rationality above everything else is nothing but an insult to intelligence. It's neither literature, nor philosophy. Unfortunately the number of rave reviews that this book receives confirms my suspicion that literacy for masses may not be always a good thing. Did people really need to go through over 1000 pages of small print that are hammering down their throats the axiom that rich people are better than poor people? Did they have doubts that this book helped to dispel? I don't think A. Greenspan and other Rand "fans" among high-fliers ever saw this book as anything but pseudo-intellectual twaddle coming from a deranged graphomaniac, however they wouldn't be where they are if they missed to see the value of this book for keeping masses of semi-educated half-wits at bay - just as Roman Church once used the Bible and communists - the Manifesto. Beyond that the book is only good as a paperweight. If it was printed on toilet paper I would give it 2 stars for innovation.
