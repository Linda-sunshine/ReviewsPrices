review/summary: Thought provoking book, very good read.review/text: &#34;Fahrenheit 451&#34; is a smart, and possibly propheticbook on people's growing lack of interest in learning throughcontext found in literature. A dystopian novel, Ray Bradburyhas excelled in painting a scene where books are burned ona daily basis, and people haven't a care in the world, contentwith spending their time listening to media devices to learn the barefacts of...well, anything. This book really makes one reflect onpresent day youth losing interest in literature, and whatpossibilities that may bring for the future.
