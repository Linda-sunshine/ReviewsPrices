review/summary: thd five people you meet in heavenreview/text: My take on the book is it is from the prespective of other people whom the protagnaist meet in life. Many times we meet poeple whom we treat with little signifance and I believe the point of the book is that all people are of importance. Sometimes it is the insignificant folk who affect our lives and make it worse or for the better
