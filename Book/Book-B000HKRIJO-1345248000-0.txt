review/summary: Sooo good! My, Can this even be possible???review/text: Clive Staples Lewis' Mere Christianity.My gosh. Talk about an eye-opening read... more than a read actually, a revelation that is so interesting to unfold. Never has theology been so intriguing, so mesmerizing and what surprised me the most was how this work (written nearly 59 years ago) was able to resonate with someone of this generation like me. I found myself nodding my head off, laughing (the guy had wit!), reflecting, studying... this is not the kind of book you read page after page. Sometimes you have to read one paragraph twice before you move on to the next, just to fully grasp- and savour- what C.S wrote.This is for everyone: those interested in theology or not. I believe you'll understand, because Lewis wrote in an understandable manner. (Never mind that at the Preface I had to use the dictionary after every two words..)I'd like to end with this. I agreed with many of the things C.S said, but I'm also questioning some others. In my opinion, this is -or was- the opinions and thoughts of a very intelligent man.Undoubtedly, an excellent work!
