review/summary: Stephen King at its weirdest!review/text: Unless you are a die hard fan of Stephen King, you will not like this story. I feel I have to give everything he writes a chance. I am never disappointed, because good or bad it is always interesting, and it entertains me. I may have to read this particular story one more time to really get it. So I probably will.
