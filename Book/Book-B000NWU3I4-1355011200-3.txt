review/summary: My favorite childhood bookreview/text: Does anyone need to know what The Hobbit is about? If you have a kid in third grade, you MUST buy them this book (paperback, though, cause I wouldn't trust them to haul around an e-reader). Every kid deserves to have The Hobbit as part of their childhood.
