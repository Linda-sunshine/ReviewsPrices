review/summary: That's how a love story should be written...review/text: This is a classic English literature, so it has a fairly complex vocabulary and indirect way of communicating that is not quick to read. I certainly expanded my own vocabulary in reading it. The story itself has sufficient twists and turns to be quite enjoyable.I definitely enjoyed this story. (And you can share it with the kids, as there's no sex or profanity in it. Whether they'll understand the nuances of phrase or not is a separate question...)
