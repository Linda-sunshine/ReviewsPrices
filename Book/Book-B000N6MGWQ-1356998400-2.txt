review/summary: Great book!review/text: This is an amazing book. Not usually the type of thing I read at all, and I really thought it would be extremely religious oriented. I'm not sure why I bothered with it, but I'm very glad I did. You will not find anything preachy about it at all. This is an amazing story about how 6 people impacted the lives of others. From those he didn't know to those he knew only too well. It's a lesson on how we impact others, even when we're not aware of their existence or our crossing with it. I only just recently read it and I want to read it again already. It really makes you think about how you may have impacted others and who are the five people you would meet in the afterlife. I think this really transcends a specific religion and can be applied to most afterlife scenarios.This is the second book I've read by this author and I think the reason I "bothered" with this book was because I had read one of the author's others. Whatever influence me to give this very unlikely read (for me) a chance, I'm extremely glad I did.
