review/summary: A Rollicking Good Classicreview/text: Can't believe I had never read this, not even seen a movie based onthis book! How shocking. I had no good excuse not to get it, as it was freefor Kindle at the time. Oprah also has this on her book list.I really found it very interesting and was caught up in the storyline very quickly. I love historical romances anyway. This is not really a romance, though there isa complicated love in the main character's life. This book reminds me of the broodingclassics like Heathcliff. That seemed to be the thing back then.It will not hurt anyone to read it, and you might even enjoy it!
