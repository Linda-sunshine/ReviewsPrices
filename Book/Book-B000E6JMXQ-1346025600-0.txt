review/summary: A Great readreview/text: This book was an amazing book that I could not put down after I started reading it. If you like adventure and a little bit of fictional history you will love this book. In Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea there are lots of great adventure scenes. I also like how Jules Verne describes everything in such detail. I would definitely recommend this book.
