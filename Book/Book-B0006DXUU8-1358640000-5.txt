review/summary: Great Readingreview/text: Mr. Baker does a fine job of bringing life to the characters. He does read at a brisk pace so I might have a print copy of the story on hand the next time the family listens to it. Good, clear sound. However, while listening to it in the car we almost had it at full volume because Mr. Baker's would read so softly (and quickly) at times we could barely hear him. We haven't listened to it at home so it might be a different experience.
