review/summary: Eerie and Engagingreview/text: I am not one for horror stories, but I loved this book! The story is well-crafted, and I enjoyed the way it uses several points of view to show the reader what is happening. The events are eerie and unsettling, but there is nothing put in there merely for shock value. I would definitely recommend this book!
