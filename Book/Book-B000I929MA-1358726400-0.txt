review/summary: Timely story...review/text: Written long before it seemed like a possibility, this is a frightening view of what could be. Atwood is such a phenomenol writer, of course, but this is visionary.Early in the story, I found it a little bit confusing but once I understood the where and a little of the how, it fell into place.A must read.
