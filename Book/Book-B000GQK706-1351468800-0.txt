review/summary: Excellent Excellent Readreview/text: Tolkien is an excellent writer. This is a great edition of the novel because you get all of the books in one. Excellent Excellent Read. I couldn't put it down. Loved the Kindle edition because you could click on the chapters and be taken right to that spot in the book from the index. GREAT BUY!!!
