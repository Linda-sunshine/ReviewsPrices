review/summary: ONE SHOTreview/text: I found this to be one of his best yet. Very detailed, kept you guessing in each chapter. Although it may not have been necessary, it would have added some value to knowing what the dollar amounts were that were being split between the Police Detective and the other bad guys. The story did not really tell you who the HEAD guy was. Maybe I missed it, but I couldn't tell if it was the police guy or the others.
