review/summary: Great reading, makes you look inside yourselfreview/text: This is by far Mitch Albom's best book. While I already own it in paperback, I choose to add it to my e-library as it is a book I like to revisit every so often. Great story line that provokes reflection on our own lives, experiences, & relationships. Highly recommend!
