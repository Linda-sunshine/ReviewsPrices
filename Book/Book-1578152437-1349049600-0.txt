review/summary: Oliver Twisterreview/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the intrigue and excitement of the novel because I had expected such a famous classic to be like the many insightful, yet dull "masterpieces" I've read thus far. Laced with suspense, temptation, and adventure, the story line retains the full attention of readers while depicting life in Victorian England. Charles Dickens proves his high literary caliber by using myriad complex themes and symbols embodied in the story of a simple boy of simple means. He brilliantly exemplifies the societal imbalance and hypocrisy of the middle and upper classes through a young boys' story.Moral standards are put into question in the novel. Oliver embodies the meaning of innocence and purity, even though he is considered filthy to the superior classes. While the whole world, starting from the orphanage and ending with the pick-pocketing gang, attempts to tell Oliver the meaning of purity, he remains true to his morals. This is a statement to readers about the hypocrisy of society at the time.Dickens uses relatable characters and humor to capture the audience and portray the setting and circumstance of the time in an interesting way. Although he illustrates a sad, depressing situation, his use of Oliver's spirit and tenacity render a hopeful impression on the reader. I found myself rooting for Oliver as he confronted individuals who intervene his mission for righteousness and love. I would highly recommend this book because it gives insight to Victorian England and the Industrial Revolution in Europe during the time through a young, noble boy's soul.
