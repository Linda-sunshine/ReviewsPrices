review/summary: A great read!review/text: I'd heard of 'Atlas Shrugged' decades ago and had always intended to read it. Am so pleased that I finally made the time. Ms. Rand's style and her skill at bringing the characters vividly to life had me hooked after only the first two chapters. Atlas Shrugged is a compelling story and a remarkable lesson. Move this one to the top of your list!
