review/summary: Definitely not funny.review/text: Front to back terrible. I bought it because I wanted a book that was funny rather than boring old serious and a friend recommended it, but it really just isn't actually funny. To be fair, if you find yourself often saying, "Oh that is too much!" or "Oh that is clever!" then you might be exactly the kind of person who will force yourself into finding this stack of toilet paper funny.
