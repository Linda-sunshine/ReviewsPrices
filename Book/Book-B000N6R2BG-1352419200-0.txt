review/summary: Much more than anticipated !review/text: This book turned out to be such a pleasant surprise. I went into this book totally blind, I hadn't read any of Jodi Picoult's books, let alone one of this subject matter. I downloaded the sample of the book onto my kindle and as soon as finishing it ordered the book immediately. Jodi told the story so beautifully I had to believe it. I have recommended this book to many of my friends. Very touching and hard to forget.
