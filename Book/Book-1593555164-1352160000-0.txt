review/summary: Book is Excellent.................NO hope for the moviereview/text: I have loved every one of the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child.He is the ultimate investigator and good guy gunslinger.The only thing that is wrong is that they have picked Tom Cruise to star in the first movie. I don't know how Lee Child could have allowed this to happen.This will kill it for any Reacher fanatic.Jack Reacher is quiet, unassuming and 6'5" tall and weights 250 pounds.How the heck is Tom Cruise at 5' nothing and 145 pounds going to measure up to that. He can only stand on a very large box for so long before he falls off.I for one love the books and I will stay away from the movie.This is kind of the same thing that killed the Bourne Identity movies for me.No relation to the book what so ever.So sorry Hollywood has to do this.
