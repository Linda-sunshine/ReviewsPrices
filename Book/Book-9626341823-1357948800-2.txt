review/summary: An awesome book!review/text: If anyone saw a movie adaptation of the Christmas Carol, or even if you haven't, this book is a must-read. Charles Dickens uses lots of humor in the book, and it has a wonderful story and set of characters. I recommend this book for anyone looking for a good long read.
