review/summary: Pride and Prejudicereview/text: I have read thid book at least three times before. I enjoy it each time I read it. I sympathize with Elizabeth having to deal with her silly mother and two of her sisters. This novel gives the reader insight about what it was like to be a woman in England at the time. The main focus of each young woman's life is finding a good marriage. It makes me greatful that I don't live in this time period.
