review/summary: Read this classic before seeing the movie.review/text: A classic fantasy book that you most likely have read. It's worth reading again before going off to see the movie. My one small complaint is that some of the maps are oriented the wrong way, so when reading with the kindle upright you have to turn your head or try and maneuver the kindle so that you can view the map in landscape without causing it to rotate.
