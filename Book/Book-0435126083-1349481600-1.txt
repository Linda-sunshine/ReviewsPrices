review/summary: Emotional roller coaster ridereview/text: If there is a list of one hit wonders in literature, at the top of that list would be Emily Jane Bront's magnificent novel Wuthering Heights.It is a dark, brooding book that never really answers the questions it leaves us with. Why did Mr. Earnshaw bring the boy Heathcliff home with him? Was Heathcliff his illegitimate son? Why does Catherine Earnshaw marry Edward Linton and not her true soul mate Heathcliff?As an English teacher, I am always reminded that sometimes the great novels of classical literature, like Wuthering Heights and to Kill a Mockingbird, would not get past the inquiry letter to the literary agent stage today. Why? Because both books have horrible beginnings. The reader must persevere in order to get to the meat and bones of the story. In the case of Wuthering Heights and to Kill a Mockingbird it is worth it.Catherine and Heathcliff are undoubtedly selfish human beings, but their love for each other is so powerful and damaging the story is a must read.
