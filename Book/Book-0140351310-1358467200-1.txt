review/summary: 19th century gothicreview/text: Jane Eyre is a 19th-century classic, and certainly worth the reading. On the other hand, if you worry about spending the time to read a Victorian &#34;three-decker&#34;, better spend it reading &#34;David Copperfield&#34; or &#34;Nicholas Nickleby.&#34;
