review/summary: A true American classicreview/text: Review of the Audio book performed by Thomas BeckerI cannot believe that I had never read this classic of American literature before.There's plenty of adventure and near misses for any reader in this wonderful yarn. Huck and the runaway slave, Jim, encounter scalawags and kind strangers, as well as a few friends on their adventure down river to find their respective freedom. I like how Twain has both Jim and Huck think on their situation and converse about the right thing to do, exploring the standards of the day and whether they were truly "good." Becker's performance of the audio is wonderful, though he is poor when voicing the women, but that doesn't diminish the genius of Twain's writing.
