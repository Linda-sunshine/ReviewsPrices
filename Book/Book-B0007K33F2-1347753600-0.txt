review/summary: a novel at its best!!!!review/text: I read this novel a little over a year and just realized ai never reviewed it. The version I had was the free amazon. I read another review stating that this version is a repackaged version of the gutenberg version which would be the way to go since it is unabridged and free. You can save yourself the. 99 cents if that is the case.The book itself is by far one of the best I have ever had the pleasure to read. The story revolves around Edmond Dantes and his multiple personalities (the Count of Monte Cristo to say the least) and how he embarks on a personal vendetta against those who had him falsely accused and imprisoned for some 20-30 years of his life.Even the part when he is in imprisoned is crucial to the story as that is what really sets things in motion as he realizes the true reason behind why he is there.If you have never read any classics this is the one to start with. It is a lenghty book but one well worth the experience. If possible, get the book directly from project gutenberg as it is free. Amazon's free version is jo longer available.
