review/summary: If you're looking for a heart-stopping thriller, look elsewherereview/text: Somehow I managed to read this one cover to cover, but only through a monumental effort. I found this book to be the driest I have ever read, and that includes Great Expectations, War of the Worlds, and Moby Dick. The only reason I forced myself to get through it was because I felt that in order to properly critique modern versions of vampires, I needed to know the appearance and abilities of the original.Dracula is undoubtably a beautiful example of the period's writing, but when it comes to horror, the story falls flat.
