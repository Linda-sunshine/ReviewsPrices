review/summary: Changed my life foreverreview/text: Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is the greatest novel of all time. Its intense story will keep you on the edge of your seat, its compelling philosophical statements will keep your mind working, and your curiosity will keep the pages turning. This is the world's greatest story of romanticism, individualism and heroism.
