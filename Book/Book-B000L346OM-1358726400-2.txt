review/summary: love your neighbor for they are your lightreview/text: Everyday one seeks meaning in their lives as they walk their journey in sunshine or through a wilderness of chaos. Meaning may be framed as giving purpose to our endeavors to understanding personal suffering. Meaning is as unique to each creation of God. Their are no easy answers or textbook formulas to follow in this search for meaning. As grace and faith are gifts, so is intuition a gift from the holy spirit that leads us to recognize a pattern in our lives that exemplifies a spiritual meaning. What is valuable from this meditation is the realization of 'who am I' - both tangible and intangible. Others are present in our lives so we can see ourselves in their reflection.I pray that I may open my eyes, ears and heart for the answer to be found.
