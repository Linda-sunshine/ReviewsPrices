review/summary: Running Blindreview/text: I cannot be impartial, because I love the character Jack Reacher, and I really enjoy reading Lee Child. He knows how the human mind works, therefore he knows how to keep his readers interested and somewhat involved in a realistic adventure from the beginning. Running Blind is no exception, and there is no disappointment in this book, or in the performance of the main character, from beginning to end. I recommend it.
