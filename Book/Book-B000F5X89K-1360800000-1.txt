review/summary: An Emotional and Empathetic Classicreview/text: Although I have read Frankenstein once before in high school, I was not mature or alert enough to realize what a gem I was reading. This novel, if you haven't yet learned, is nothing like the various incarnations of Frankenstein movies you may have run across over the years. None of these pop-culture references can prepare you for the monster within the novel. You will not find bolts in the monsters neck, nor will you find some illiterate creature. What you will find is an abundant amount of sadness and emotion.The story, which takes form in a frame narrative, Frankenstein is not actually told by Victor Frankenstein, or by his created monster, but rather a third party who is as interesting as the title character.When Victor's tale begins, we are introduced to a young man whose thirst for knowledge leads him to give life to biological inanimate objects. After a successful experiment where these objects are transformed into an eight-foot-tall creature, Victor allows his monster to escape his laboratory. It is important to note that, this is where most people I talk to feel a certain level of disgust for Victor. What follows can only be summed up as a cat and mouse game between the monster and Victor.One overlooked and important part of the novel is the amount of emotion that is involved in the story. Without ruining anything, I feel that this is easily the most interesting aspect within the story. As I mentioned before, this is not the illiterate monster that you may have been told about. When the monster first confronts Victor about life and human interactions, it is truly a remarkable moment in literature.There are many moral lessons to be learned from this novel, including the importance of compassion and empathy. Similarly, it can easily be identified as feminist literature, which teaches lessons in it self.I give this novel five out of five stars.
