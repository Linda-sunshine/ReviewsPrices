review/summary: The Original and the Bestreview/text: To me, Bram Stoker's Dracula is scarier and more troubling than any modern vampire story. Today's vampire franchises rely on gore, violence, and sex to tell derivative stories, and they miss out on the mystery and creepiness of the original legends. In my estimation, current vampire tales are largely soap-operas for young adults.You'll not find over-the-top Hollywood silliness in this book. What you will read about is a creepy, twisted monster, centuries old and capable of hideous acts.For me, a low-key approach is much more realistic than a double-barreled shotgun blast in the face of the fantastic. Most current vampire stories are hard to believe because every event is so out of proportion with what most people know as real life. I much prefer a story that builds and unfolds slowly to reveal layers of intrigue. Dracula is a consummate example of that approach and it deserves the title of &#34;classic.&#34;
