review/summary: Classic! Must read for everyonereview/text: I read this book in high school but when we decided to read this in my book club I realized I forgot almost the whole story line. I loved reading this and looking at the characters from a whole different perspective. This is an American classic and a must read for everyone. I think this shows that money does not always produce happiness.
