review/summary: The Lord of the Rings One Volume Reviewreview/text: The book is amazingly written. It's been fun to compare the written works with the movie series. For the most part, the movie has followed the actual story very closely. When I've noticed differences, they have been minor, but I enjoy finding them. Love the movies, love the book. I'm 68% finished with the final book The Return of the King. Upon completion, I'm going to by The Hobbit and read that one as well. :-)
