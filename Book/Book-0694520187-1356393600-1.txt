review/summary: Not as good as I remembered itreview/text: Hadn't read this since high school (30 years ago). I recently read The Art of Fielding, which features a Melville loving college professor who thinks this is the greatest book ever written, -so I was inspired to re-read it. Definitely not the best book ever written.The story itself is great, and the characters (Ishmael, Ahab...) are classics, but you've got to wade through hundreds of pages of minutia on the history of whaling and everything you always wanted to know about whales, but were afraid to ask, all of which is quite tiresome. I would definitely recommend the abridged edition if you decide to read this one again.
