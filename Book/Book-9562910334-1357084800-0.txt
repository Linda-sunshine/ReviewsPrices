review/summary: Intruiging!review/text: I can see why this is a classic. A very original tale, quite spooky. I really enjoyed it. It was interesting to read this in 2012, I can see that a lot of the writer's predictions about the future have come true, which is scary!! It may not be as overt as the book, but overall I think this is a worthwhile read and an eye-opener!
