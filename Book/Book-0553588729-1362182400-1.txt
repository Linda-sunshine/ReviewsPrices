review/summary: Helping me help my twinsreview/text: I recommend this book to all new parents. I have spent plenty of time around nieces and younger cousins, but it is completely different when you watch them for a few hours occasionally 24 hours all the time. My son was born the easiest baby on the block. Even in the NICU nurses would gush on how handsome and sweet he was. My beautiful little girl was born with respiratory problems. You would never know by how she could scream. At 34 weeks they weren't ready for this world. A week after their due date my little girl only got more upset. Through this book we found she has a lactose sensitivity (like my husband), but that only calmed her through the day, starting at 6 pm without fail she would be screaming again. She doesn't need all five s. But swaddling and swinging you can see that switch flip on. When I do the first four in order (she refuses to suck unless she is breastfeeding) she is truly a happy baby! My only suggestion is writing for those with twins. I don't even want to imagine if they were both colic.
