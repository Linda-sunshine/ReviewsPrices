review/summary: Brilliantreview/text: Hi Jayne,I recently reread "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" and as I closed the back flap of the well worn cover, I wondered why I hadn't sooner. This book is at the top of my Book List of Favorites and is perhaps one of the greatest books ever written.I don't want to spoil even one page of this miraculous novel for the new reader, so I won't divulge any particulars. (I find the less I know about a book, the more charming and surprising it's potential is.) I will say it is a young adult novel about a girl and her family in the poorest of New York neighborhoods around the turn of the 20th century. Mrs. Smith parlays feelings of innocence, yearning, grief, love, loss, hope, beauty, joy, childhood, family dynamics and how it feels to live in poverty so deftly, one can never forget this book.In our current "recession culture" this book is more timely than ever. Families are being ripped apart and children are growing up faster than before due to economic strains. While this book is set almost one hundred years ago, and some of the situations seem slightly archaic, the feelings are all still the same. The ability to protect a child and provide them with a happy and safe childhood is every parent's aspiration and the inability to do so is devastating. But as with any good book, it shows the the dark and light sides of any situation. Simply put, what doesn't kill us, only makes us stronger.Read this book as soon as you can. It is the bitterest of sweet and sends the message that hope, as symbolized in the tree, sprouts eternal.
