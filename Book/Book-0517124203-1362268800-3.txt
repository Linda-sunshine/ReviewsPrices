review/summary: Rereading the classicsreview/text: It had been years since I last read &#34;Alice.&#34; I reread it to prepare for seeing the ballet as performed by the National Ballet of Canada. It was wonderful to visit an old friend again. This was one of my daughter's favorite books when she was a child. We read it several times, so this reading evoked those wonderful memories. The humor is as fresh as if it had been written yesterday.
