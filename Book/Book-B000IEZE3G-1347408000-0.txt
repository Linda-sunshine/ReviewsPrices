review/summary: It's a Children's Book!review/text: I'm not writing this review because I love the books, although I do. I am writing this review because many people reviewing it seem to be forgetting something when rating the book: it's a children's book. If you're an adult reading the book for the first time, then of course it's going to seem less complex than it would have if you'd first read it at the age of eight. On it's own, the first book is not incredibly complex. This is because JK Rowling planned all seven books at the same time. If you want this series to have any complexity at all, you have to read all seven books. Why? Because there is information within the first book that is linked to the other books in clever and complex ways that you cannot possibly know without reading the other books. Harry Potter and the Sorceress Stone is the baseline for a fantastic children's series. Complexity increases with additional books and repetitive reading. I should know, I've read them all twice, some of the books three or four times.When I was little I loved these books. I'm in college now, and I just reread the first book. Would I consider it amazing literature for an individual that reads college level material on a regular basis? No. Do I consider it fantastic and clever for an individual who is in grade school? Yes. Can I still enjoy them? Yes, but only if I think about what it was like to read them as a child and let that inner child come out. Otherwise, I understand why you aren't hooked after the first book. But in my opinion, all of the adults who gave this book a one or two star rating are just that: adults. You have to review from the perspective of a child, or even a parent or teacher, but otherwise, you're totally missing the point. Some adults enjoy these books, but like me, most of them started reading them when they were less than 10 years old. Keep that in mind when you pick them up!
