review/summary: TRULY TITLED,TRULY BAFFLING!review/text: I'm usually pretty good about figuring out who the perp or bad guy is in most novels as well as the outcome, most of the time by the half way point of the book. Not so for this masterful mystery/suspense &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; novel by Lee Child! I was so hooked by the on the edge happenings that the completely twisted outcome had me &#34;running blind&#34; til the very end! Superbly written & brilliantly laid out, this one will have you guessing as much as Reacher was in the novel!
