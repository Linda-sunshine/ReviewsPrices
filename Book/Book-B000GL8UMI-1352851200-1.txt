review/summary: Sheer genius and brilliancereview/text: Whenever I first read this book it scared me because of the realism and how relevant it was to how American society is and where it is going. Even though I was much younger than I am now when I finished it (I'm 20), I was still able to realize that the future Ray Bradbury portrays in this wonderful work of fiction is entirely possible. I absolutely love to read, a bibliophile if you will, and when I first realized that the world in this book takes pride in BURNING them AND the people who read them I remember thinking, "God help us". What made me say that is the realization that many of my fellow class mates all throughout school (K-12) did NOT like to read one bit but they did like to burn and destroy things. Society, in the story, values everything that destroys knowledge and wisdom so that those in charge are able to stay in power and keep everyone under there thumb. Turning people into mindless sheep. Many of the technological "advances" (I consider them more of a step back then a step forward) include only a few hours of school with nothing actually learned, destruction parks where people can go smash and destroy everything there, insanely fast cars, and (in my opinion the worst one) the ENTIRE room dedicated to television. This book is an extremely accurate portrayal of where American society is headed if we do not do something to stop this trend. We must value knowledge and wisdom above all else because those two things are what primarily separate us from all other animals. I absolutely loved this book and author and I hope you will pick this up and give it a try.
