review/summary: More Timely Than Ever, I Believereview/text: In the tough times we live in, people seem to focus ever more on themselves. This book is a wake-up call as well as a practical blueprint for living the life well-led. Oh and yes, you probably will be more successful and beloved. But the book's core messsage is: Focus on others and their needs, whether or not you gain anything. It really is better to give than to receive.
