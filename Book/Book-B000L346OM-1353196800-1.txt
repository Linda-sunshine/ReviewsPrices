review/summary: my bible...review/text: This book should be read and re read everytime one needs inspiration, feels down and out or just plain looking for meaning and light through dark moments..This book will teach you how to go through challenges in life with more then just instinct for survival but rather a real zest for life and what you chose to make of it, and how you chose to live it.
