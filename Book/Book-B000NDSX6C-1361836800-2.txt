review/summary: Are you kidding me!review/text: This book was great. The movie emblishes alot and leaves out just as much too. I was so excited to get this for 10 bucks! After reading this book I fell inlove with it, and the quality has me pleased as well as the book itself.The story is wonderful and if you are reading this review... read this book! You clearly have an intrest in it!!!
