review/summary: Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Randreview/text: In an entirely fictional environment Rand illustrates what happens when a liberal mindset (mid-fifties version)gets control of the nation's industrial activity. Like '1984' she is a half century ahead of reality but we are still seeing the trend toward the socialist environment that she envisions. She illustrates arguments for objectivity vs. subjective ideology. The book is definitely an interesting read from this perspective.
