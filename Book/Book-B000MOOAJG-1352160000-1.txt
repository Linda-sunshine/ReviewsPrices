review/summary: Prophecyreview/text: This book is prophetic.. (As George Orwell was so talented at doing.) this book is not a difficult read. It has a story line that made me keep coming back to see what/how the next event will happen and how it is dealt with. Maybe a little slow in the beginning, but hang in there! Its worth reading. My new favorite book.
