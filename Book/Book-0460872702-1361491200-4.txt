review/summary: Fab as ever, but microscopic print on this one!review/text: I am so surprised that no one mentioned that you need a magnifying glass to read this edition of an amazing classic. I have 20/20 vision, but opened this and was shocked. This review has nothing to do with the story -- a true timeless masterpiece -- but this edition is not for the sight-challenged.
