review/summary: The Great Gatsby - so compellingreview/text: ISBN-13: 978-0-684-83042-1"A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling-and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea"(24). As you can see, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is descriptive and the author's words flow smoothly which made me happy while I was reading this book.Although I enjoyed reading this book, I did not like all the emotional issues the characters portrayed. Furthermore, they were not satisfied with their wealth which contributed to the surprise ending. I think the author is trying to tell the readers that everyone wants to have a successful life, but some people may have to work harder than other people to obtain a successful life. Also, there are a lot of people who started with poverty but still succeeded in life. The book taught me not to focus only on money but to focus more on healthy relationships.It did not take me a long time to finish this book. It was so compelling that I could not stop reading until I was actually finished with the book. I strongly recommend this book.
