review/summary: Biggest ripoff in Americareview/text: The book Running Blind is just an old Reacher book that was written years ago. I almost bought the thing because the date next to the book on Amazon was Feb 5, 2013.Sure looked like a new release to me! The only way I discovered it was an old book was by going to the chronological list of Reacher books. This is sleaze at its worst. Gentlemen- you should be ashamed!
