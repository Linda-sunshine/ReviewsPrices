review/summary: happyreaderreview/text: I am so glad I found this book on my Kindle. It's hard to believe it took me so many years to read it. I enjoyed it so much. I can't explain how I felt reading this, it was so up-to-date. I would recommend this to anyone with eclectic taste in reading. Thank you.
