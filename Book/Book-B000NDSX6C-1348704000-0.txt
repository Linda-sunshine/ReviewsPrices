review/summary: A great classicreview/text: This book is an instant classic in your memory. It lies there with the other buried treasures of your childhood, no matter at what age you've read it.The situation is so elemental, whimsy and funny - it is impossible to put down or to forget. It will always be a great book in my mind.
