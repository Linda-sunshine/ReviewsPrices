review/summary: I could not put it downreview/text: I learned so much about the Jeruasalem while I read this book. To take a novel approach to a Biblical story is risky, but this was brilliantly done - especially because this is a very difficult story to tell. Lynn Austin's other book, While We're Far Apart, is also fantastic. She is extremely good at telling thought-provoking stories. I would definitely recommend yhis book.
