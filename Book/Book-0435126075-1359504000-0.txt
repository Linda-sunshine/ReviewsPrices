review/summary: Classicreview/text: Jolly good read - deservedly one of the most famous novels ever - can't believe it is now 200 years old - although the word pride does not carry the same opprobrium today as it did then and prejudice is probably a greater evil today as it was then- probably worth thinking if it as Arrogance and antipathy
