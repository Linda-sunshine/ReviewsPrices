review/summary: High quality books!review/text: I love them. Being brand new and nicely illustrated by Alan Lee. This edition of the trilogy is a fine one, and sturdy as well. Definitely worth the price considering these hardcovers used to cost twice as much even a long time after the initial release. If you're a fan, you won't regret it.
