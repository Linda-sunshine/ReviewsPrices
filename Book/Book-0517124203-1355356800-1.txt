review/summary: Crazy confusing but still worth the readreview/text: As most people may know, Lewis Carroll was absolutely freakishly high off of LSD and in reading this book you will have undeniable profit that he was crazy. Very confusing and strange book as well as a anti-climatic ending still a fun read if you have extra time
