review/summary: The story is fine. It&#8217;s a one-time fast read.review/text: This is a simple story with a bunch of elaborated mythology, it doesn't have a big plot or a big un-expected conclusion. Some characters could have been used to give more action but they were just there and that&#8217;s all.It&#8217;s very easy to read but at the middle of the book I still felt like the story hadn't started at all. If you are a LOTR fan you might like it, because of the places it describes and the creatures but not for the main story.
