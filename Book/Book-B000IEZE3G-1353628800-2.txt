review/summary: I love it!review/text: It's not my first time reading this book and surely it won't be the last. I just wish the movies based on these novels could have been done even closer to the books. However, I do have all the 8 movies which I also enjoy now and then. Hopefully J.K. Rowling will soon be putting together a "Harry Potter's Series Encyclopedia" for even more delight to the readers. I'm looking forward it!
