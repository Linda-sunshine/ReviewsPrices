review/summary: Audiobook not sync'd on Kindle Fire HD 7"review/text: This review is not about the novel, it is about the product for sale. I have purchased both the Atlas Shrugged Kindle book in this listing and the audio book in this listing. The claim in the offering and the claim after I made my purchase was that I could open the book and find a prompt to "play" the recording starting at any reading point. Alas, there is no such prompt and I cannot find a way to sync the audio with the book.I am able to read the Kindle book; I am able to listen to the audio book. But they are disconnected, they have a different number of chapters in Part I, and they have different "cover art." So I think they are not the same version of the novel, despite both being listed in this product offering, and despite a prompt on my Kindle Fire HD that the audio book I had just purchased would sync with the Kindle book.UPDATE: I believe the problem I am having is that my audible.com account has to sync with my amazon.com account, and use the same password. I can't get that to work on my own, and haven't had time to work with the people at audible.com to get this rectified.-DougInNC
