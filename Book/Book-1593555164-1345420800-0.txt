review/summary: Pretty good, even the second time around...review/text: I have been reading my way through the Reacher series from the beginning, and One Shot was one I had previously read. I would give this one a 9 on the engrossing scale, even the second time around. There are many twists and turns in the plot, and there is no more than the usual Reacher level of violence involved. The connections (and reconnections) Reacher makes with people "feel" real, and the entire story, while a bit farfetched, is believable.
