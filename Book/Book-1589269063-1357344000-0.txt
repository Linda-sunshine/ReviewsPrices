review/summary: Nice way to understand othersreview/text: One thing human-kind has a challenge in is understanding each other. Communication is important, but the most important part of that is understanding what is being communicated before responding. By focusing on the message received before reacting, we are capable of giving a better response, thus avoiding many otherwise tumultuous relationship issues.Thank you for this description of life and love.
