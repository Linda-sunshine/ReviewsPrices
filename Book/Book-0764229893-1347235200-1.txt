review/summary: AWESOME BOOKreview/text: This book and the entire collection of the 5 books are incredibly faith building! If you love old testament stories it is a MUST read! I could not put the books down once I started! I have a re-invigorated AWE of God and a fresh understanding of the Torah and all that went on in the Temple. I can see more clearly the purposes of the sacrafices made and the horror of idolitry. I can also read the book of Isaiah with better understanding of the times of that day. Thank you Ms. Austin and Thank you LORD for giving her the anointing to write so beautifully!!!
