review/summary: Just catching up with a classicreview/text: I saw recently that Peter Jackson, the director of the Lord of the Rings movies is releasing "The Hobbit" around Christmas time. since it has been a bunch of years since I read it, I decided to buy it and have another go.. Just as good as I remember...
