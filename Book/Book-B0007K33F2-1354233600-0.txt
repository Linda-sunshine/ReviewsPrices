review/summary: One of my favorite novels.review/text: I'm going to start out by saying that this is one of my favorite stories ever and it has had many adaptations and given inspiration to many more in all sorts of media. I've seen the anime, the old 1975 movie and the newer 2002 movies, I've even read the abridged version. I'm just now getting around to reading the full unabridged version and regret not having done so sooner. After a quick glance at a few different reviews I discovered that this was the most faithful translation of the original, though I have no way of truly knowing for myself since I can't read french, but either way this is an absolutely amazing book. Getting the full story is much more fulfilling than getting the watered down unabridged version.To elaborate on the story for those who don't know it, a man named Edmond Dante's has everything he can ask for in life when it is all taken away by a few other men who were jealous of his success. He is then thrown into prison and after being trained in many aspects by his cell mate he manages to escape and that's when the true journey starts of him dedicating his entire life to exact the ultimate revenge on those who had robbed him of all he held dear all those years ago.
