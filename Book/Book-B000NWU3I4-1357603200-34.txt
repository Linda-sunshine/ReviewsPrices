review/summary: A must Buyreview/text: This is a particularly nice copy of The Hobbit, bound in green leather or something like it. Personally, I've never been quite sure why a single book would be in a box, but I suppose it does protect the lovely gold embossed cover with Tolkein's runes all over it. The full page color reproductions of Tolkien's watercolor illustrations also really added to the quality of this edition of the book. Some of them are very pretty, and were not present in my smaller copy of The Hobbit. This is definietly the collector's edition, not the small portable copy to read in waiting rooms.It had been a while since I had read The Hobbit, so it was nice to refresh my memory of the story before seeing the movie. It has a little introduction in the beginning, which may have originally come from the Lord of the Rings, explaining dwarves and that orc and goblin are interchangable terms. I would say this edition is well worth the cost for an enthusiast willing to wait for it to come out of backorder. If you haven't read The Hobbit before, you should, whether you buy this or another copy, but be warned: there is a lot of singing and other poetry. Even the orcs sing at least once, which is odd, even if it is about torture and cannibalism and other orcish topics.
