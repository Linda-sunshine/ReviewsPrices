review/summary: meh...review/text: I am aware that when I review this and say I strongly disliked this book am in the minorty. The plot of The Hobbit was good and interesting. However the author was very wordy and overly desctiptive and after a while it got annoying. reading this was like chewing cardboard, flavorful cardboard, because of the interesting plot, but cardboard nonetheless.I read the unabriged edition and so the abriged vertion may be less wordy and therefore better.
