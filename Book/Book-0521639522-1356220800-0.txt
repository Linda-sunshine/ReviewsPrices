review/summary: Stellar example of too much hype, too little satisfactionreview/text: Mother once told me &#34;Strawberry shortcake is such a wonderful dessert...&#34; but when I tried it - it was just strawberries and whipped cream on angle food cake.I felt the same way about Earnest. I'd always heard it was a really wonderful play, but halfway through I still had no idea who was whom and what was going on or what they were going on about. Perhaps I'll try it again, later - but I doubt it.
