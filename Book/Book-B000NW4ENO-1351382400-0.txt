review/summary: Nothing like any other classic I've readreview/text: My sister recommended this book to me, saying that "it was the best book she has ever read". I knew that this book was amazing, judging from what my family has told me for so long, but I didn't want to read it for one reason that reason being, "the book is over 1000 pages!!!" So it's been lying on my shelf for more than a few years until I finally decided to read it. It took me 2 weeks to read (whereas it took my sister 5 days) it and boy, did I have an amazing time reading about Scarlett, her family, Tara, Captain Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, and every body. I especially enjoyed the Southerners points of view about slavery. After readin historical books, all from the Union's point of view, I realized that I've been missing out on a lot of info on the Civil War. I've always thought that Southerners treated their slaves with cruelty, based on what I've read from other histocial fiction books, but after reading this one, I found out that slavery wasn't all about whippings, beatings, and any other kind is mismanagement.Scarlett has to be my favorite character. She is headstrong and stubborn, yes, but she fights for what she believes in and does everything to save Tara, even if it meant hurting family members. This books was dramatic, however, such as whatever someone gained, someone else loses something that is very dear to them but I guess that adds more "zest" to the whole story.This is, "the best book I have ever read in my life". Well at least in my 14 years of living. If you have the slightest interest in reading this wonderful, enchanting classic, go ahead. I did and I don't regret it.
