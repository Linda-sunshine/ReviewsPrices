review/summary: It's a Classicreview/text: WHAT IS THERE TO SAY ABOUT A CLASSIC. I LOVE THE LANGUAGE, THE MANNERS AND THE RULES OF SOCIAL LIFE. IT'S SO DIFFERENT FROM TODAY'S SOCIETY THAT IT'S LIKE VISITING A FOREIGN COUNTRY IN ANOTHER AGE WHICH IS PRECISELY WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT. A GOOD GETAWAY FROM NORMALITY IN THE 21ST CENTURY.
