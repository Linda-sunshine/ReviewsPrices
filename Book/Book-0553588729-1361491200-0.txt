review/summary: Repetitive but useful and logical info that I plan to usereview/text: I watched the DVD and am now reading the book. I agree with other reviewers that this book is quite repetitive, but I'm still learning a lot from it and I'm definitely planning to try the techniques when my baby arrives in a few weeks. The concept of a "4th Trimester" makes a lot of sense to me, as do the ancient and Eastern traditions of keeping baby close to mom/dad for most hours of the day. I'm glad someone told me to look into this book and DVD -- I'm certain they're going to help me when my baby is inconsolable!
