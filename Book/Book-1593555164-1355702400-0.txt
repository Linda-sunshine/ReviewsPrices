review/summary: Hot One Shot!review/text: One of the best Reacher novels I've read for a while. Really enjoy the suspense Child creates from page to page and this is no exception. Always want more of Reacher due to Child's ability to keep you engaged and interested in both the character and the plot as it unfolds. Looking forward to the next Reacher experience.
