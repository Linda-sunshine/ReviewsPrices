review/summary: Book and pics are great! Audio, not so muchreview/text: The book and artwork are phenomenal obviously. I bought this particular edition because of the bonus audio content, assuming it would play on my audio enabled Kindles. The audio will not play on them though :( However, the audio portions play fine on the Kindle app on my my iphone 5! Unsure if they will play on all iphones/ipad or other smartphones though. Cool extras regardless, and for the current price, worth the risk in my opinion.
