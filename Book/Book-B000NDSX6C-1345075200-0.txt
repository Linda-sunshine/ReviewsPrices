review/summary: The Hobbit - Kindle editionreview/text: I had to read this book for my literature class and I was really excited. My high hopes and expectations were not in vain. This book is going to my list of favorites. I loved everything about this book, the story, the plot and all its twist and the characters. Tolkien's writting transported me into Middle Earth in an extraordinary way. I could see, hear and feel what the characters did. It was trully a magical expirience. Bilbo's quest to find the dragon guarded treasure stolen from the lost kingdom of the dwarves in the Misty Mauntain along with a band of dwarves wanting to rebuild this kingdom is very excitting though overall this book is not as dark and dangerous as the LOTR trilogy. It is also written in a slightly different way though this by no means makes it inferior to LOTR. It is simpler and better suited for kids who are not ready for Lord of the Ring but still want to read Tolkien's works. Once again I loved this book and would definitely want to re-read it in the near future as well as lend it to my younger sister so she can enjoy it as well.
