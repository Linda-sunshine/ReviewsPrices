review/summary: Does this really even need a review?review/text: One.of.the.best.books.EVER. Ok, I don't know when we started writing like that, but Tolkien's writings still remain some of the most vivid ever. This was actually the first &#34;grown up&#34; book I ever read, at the ripe age of 5, and it STILL holds me entranced, in my 40s. I love all of his writings, and I'm so glad to see so many others still appreciate him as much as I do!
