review/summary: Beautifully written, absorbing, and enchantingreview/text: This is the classic tale from Tolkien -- the one that started it all. Not only is the read essential fiction for lovers of fantasy, it is also essential for lovers of well written plots, characters, and development.Keep in mind that it was intended as Childrens Lit back in the day, and it's still better written, with a superior vocabulary, than many adult fiction novels today.It is engaging, captivating, and mesmerizing. If you are able to suspend disbelief at all, you will find yourself immediately drawn into the story.Tolkien paints his surroundings vividly, with excellent characteristics, appropriate details, and a historical lore that tells you these people are real, they have existed for ages, and they are not to be trifled with.
