review/summary: Cute and cleverreview/text: This is a cute story, great for the season. I love all the various film adaptations too. My only comment is that the author goes off on a lot of tangents, and sometimes the tone is a bit preachy. Not one of my favorites by Dickens, but very clever work overall.
