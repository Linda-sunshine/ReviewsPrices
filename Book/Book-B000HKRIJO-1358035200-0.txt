review/summary: The Complete C.S. Lewis Signature Classicsreview/text: I had always wanted to read C.S. Lewis' work, but hadn't found a one-volume tome that contained them all. I was rooting around on Amazon, when this product popped up. The price was fantastic and I'm excited to have his works all in one place. I haven't read everything yet. His writings take thought to sift through and get at the true meanings.
