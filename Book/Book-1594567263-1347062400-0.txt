review/summary: Elegance in Writingreview/text: Oscar Wilde is one hell of an elegant writer. He focuses a lot on beauty in his writing, and it really shows. The Picture of Dorian Gray is about a narcissistic man, only to fall in love with a a beautiful painting done of himself. He says aloud that he wishes he could stay young and beautiful, like in his portrait, and lo and behold, his wish comes true. He never grows old, but the man in his portrait (himself) does instead. He hides the portrait in the attic (his dirty secret), because he doesn't want anyone to see him growing old in the picture, and the story pretty much goes from there. This book is poetic in its writing, has a lot of witty commentary, and is a must for Wilde fans. All in all, I gave this story 4 out of 5 stars, only because I enjoyed his play much better... The Importance of Being Earnest. Regardless, if not for the plot, read it for the experience in exceptional writing.
