review/summary: Amazing. . .review/text: This book she be included with some of the great sci-fi books of our time. It shows a scary dystopic future in which fundamentalism is allowed to flourish here in America. It is a great warning tale about the subjugation of women under such fundamentalism as that in the Western Judeo-Christian tradition when taken to extremes.
