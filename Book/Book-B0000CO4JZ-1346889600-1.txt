review/summary: The Great Gatsbyreview/text: Not quite finished with this book but it is well written and quite readable. Have enjoyed it and consider it a classic. I am on a mission to read more of the classic books and just recently re-read Gone with the Wind.All of my books are now on the Kindle reader from Amazon.
