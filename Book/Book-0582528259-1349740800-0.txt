review/summary: Jane Eyerreview/text: This is the 3rd time I've read this book. As an over 50 yr old female I enjoyed Jane Eyre in a different way to the times I read it earlier. Basically, the plot is a bodice ripper without the ribald sexual description (thank God).There is something contained, passionless and distant about Jane that disconnects as you read from the larger narrative,none the less I recommend this book as a good read - just don't expect Wuthering Heights
