review/summary: Who doesn't love Jane Austenreview/text: This classic became available for free on my Kindle. I had read the book twice years ago and was excited to be able to add it to my Kindle library. There's something amazing about this love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth that I could read again and again.
