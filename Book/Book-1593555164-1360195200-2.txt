review/summary: JACK REACHER ONE SHOTreview/text: I bought this book after seeing the Tom Cruise movie JACK REACHER; wanted to see if it followed the book or as so often happens was almost a different storyline. I wasn't aware of Lee Child or Jack Reacher until I saw the movie but enjoyed both and will continue to read the Jack Reacher series. The novel I read ONE SHOT was enjoyable- easy to follow, enough action to be exciting but not so much I became bored with it. Character description was enough that I felt like I knew them, although having seen the movie I may have imprinted my own thoughts. I'm looking forward to more enjoyable reads from Mr. Child and will then see what his little brother, Andrew Grant, does with his hero.
