review/summary: Great readreview/text: I've become addicted to Reacher novels. They have a viewpoint that is very refreshing, and a main character that is well defined. He sees everything from such a different - and very human - perspective that it makes for a very good read. The action, the strength, are all there, but the character and the situations are truly unique. I highly recommend it.
