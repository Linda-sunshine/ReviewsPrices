review/summary: An Excellent Large Print Book!review/text: It is always so difficult to find inspirational large print books. Keeping Faith: A Novel is one of them. The author makes us care from page one. The young female character is believable and vulnerable and honestly written. Other large print books I enjoy include "Christmas Cowboys, Mistletoe Diner and Other Short Stories(Large Print)", both books have romance, heart and spirituality.
