review/summary: Wow! Amazing. Terrifying, cruel, yet hopefulreview/text: Wow.&#34;The Giver&#34; is one of the most terrifying, cruel, yet hopeful books I've ever read.Twelve year-old Jonas lives in a world of Sameness. Every need is taken care of, everyone is employed, being educated, or being taken care of. It's a world of uniformity and plainness. &#34;Family units&#34; consist of a set of parents, one boy, and one girl, each assigned to the adults when the children become Ones. There are no surprises, nor pain, a little emotion.Soon, however, Jonas realizes there's more to life than he ever thought possible. He is chosen as the Receiver. His training includes learning things only one other person in the community knows. And that person is the Giver.My 13 year-old son, who had to read &#34;The Giver&#34; for school, encouraged me and my wife to read it. It's a quick read, which is why I'm offering very little in terms of plot. But is brevity is packed with many emotions.
