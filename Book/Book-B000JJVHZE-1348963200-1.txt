review/summary: Absolute Classicreview/text: I was assigned this book in a Political Science class (yes political science) and assigned to write a paper on the social change that occurs from the verdict. While I was supposed to read it in high school, I maybe read the first chapter and used Sparknotes the rest of the way. However, I am truly thankful that my professor assigned this book again because I absolutely loved it. The story, symbolism, and literary devices are all there and it is truly captivating. I can't say that I've ever been so hooked to a book considering I read it faster than most books. I think the older you get, the better the book gets and despite it taking place around the depression era, the story is still a good one and a significant reminder of our past. I will say, I think it does no justice to the book to have high school students read it because like Atticus might say, they are too young to understand.
