review/summary: Favorite book of all time!review/text: Gone with the Wind is a classic I read during my teenage years yet I had to purchase it in physical form since when I read it I had burrowed it from a library. For all of you who have not read this novel, it is a historical fiction romance novel about a girl who had it all, lost it all and had to learn to stop being so vain. It is a story that will never come out of the line of favorite books to read so one must read it at least one in our lifetime!
