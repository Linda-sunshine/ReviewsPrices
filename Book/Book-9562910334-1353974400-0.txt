review/summary: Timelessreview/text: While this book seems to be fairly standard fare in high school, I managed to avoid it and read the novel as an adult. I'm glad it took me this long. I don't think the teenager in me would have fully appreciated it as much. The novel describes a totalitarian society, ruled by the iron fist of "The Party", and where even dissident thoughts, and not just actions, are considered a crime. The plot follows thirty-nine year old Winston Smith, who struggles with accepting the seemingly immortal regime. Much of the literature and other media that deals with totalitarian society owes its elements to the ones developed in Ninety Eighty-Four, and sometimes it's hard to recognize that that which has now become clich&eacute; was still novel at the time of publication. I think this contributes to the first part of the novel feeling quite slow. However, one thing to keep in mind is that while some plot elements may seem predictable, the reader should be prepared to be pleasantly surprised. One major flaw in the work, in my opinion, is that the narrative grinds to a halt about two-thirds of the way into the book. Orwell introduces what is essentially a treatise on the society he constructed. While fascinating at first, I found that it detracted from my overall enjoyment of the work. The last one hundred pages, however, make it completely worth it. The psychological elements here are terrifying, and even the reader begins to lose hope in this frightening but always possible future. Orwell sends a stark warning to future generations with this novel, which makes it plain to see why it has become such a classic. I would recommend to anyone to re-read if they had read it in their youth.
