review/summary: Hard to put downreview/text: This is the second Jack Reacher book I've read, and the storytelling style is identical to the previous one - fast-paced and un-put-downable. However, the plot in this was very clever with very satisfying conclusion. I read both this book and the previous one in two long, consecutive sittings (easy when you are obliged to rest to recover from a minor injury!) and it was entertaining, undemanding and enjoyable. But I am NOT about to rush out to buy the rest of the Reacher series, it would be too exhausting! (And I'm back on my feet.)
