review/summary: Simplisticreview/text: Easy to read. Don't agree on all. Basically makes sense. A little preachy, but it could be helpful in understanding how your partner views your loving gestures since we all don't agree on how to show love.Gifts may mean a lot or may mean nothing. Partner may prefer some quality time vs some flowers or jewelry. Makes you reevaluate how you're showing love to others and be more accepting or understanding how your partner is showing love perhaps by doing things for you, acts of service rather than say nice things to you or physical touch. Unfortunately, we may not always understand how others demonstrate their love. This book may help sort it out.
