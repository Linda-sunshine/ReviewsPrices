review/summary: Rereading Atlas Shruggedreview/text: I read Ayn Rand when her books were published (I'm 81)Didn't think much of her books. A second rate (third?) John dos Passos and I almost fully forgot her.For the last two years or so, I've noticed that Ayn Rand, and particularly "Atlas Shrugged" has become a bit of a cult icon as so many special effects films do, particularly with younger people. This has become almost fashionable mainly in the economic fora where I am active.So, I decided to reread Ayn Rand again. Maybe I was too young and unprepared when I first read her.I went for her cult book in the Kindle version (with my poor eyesight, paper dazzles me now).I was terribly disappointed. It's even worse than I remembered. She is to dos Passos what the Beach Boys are to Beethoven to confine to popular musical tastes.Nothing to do with ideology; I'm not far from what she advocates although she's a bit too radical for my moderate opinions.But Good Heavens! Good literature is good literature whether you support the ideas therein or not. I hate the cynicism and perversion of Marquis de Sade, but no one writes more elegant French; I'm strongly opposed to just deceased Hobsbawm ideas, but nobody beats him in social analysis.So I'm afraid I'm not an enthusiast of poor Ayn Rand: business was never conducted the way she describes it, technology even less; politics dominated by economic ideals are too shallow, and psychological portraits are too sketchy, too stereotyped.If she's becoming an icon of modern business thinkers, poor world.Please go back to dos Passos and Sinclair Lewis; I agreed far less with their ideas but, heavens above!, they could write.
