review/summary: Mind set changingreview/text: Excellent story that brings to light the shortcomings of socialism and the nanny state. This one book helped erase many of the guilt laden ideas inserted into my being through public education, pop culture and media. This should be a required reading for everyone that wants to be a useful addition to society, especially those in business and government.
