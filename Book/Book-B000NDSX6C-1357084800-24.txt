review/summary: A fantastic read for kids and adultsreview/text: This was read to me as a child and I'm now reading it again before I see the movie. I've enjoyed it just as much as I did before as it provides a backdrop for the Lord of the Rings series. A story of courage against all odds, this is a great read for all ages.
