review/summary: An awesome book, not just for kids.review/text: Alot of people think that the Hobbit is the 'childs' version of the Lord of the Rings, the gentle prequel. I think that it's so much more. The Hobbit really gives you your foundation and footing in Middle Earth that makes the Lord of the Rings, &#34;Worth it&#34;.Great book. If you don't have it, you should get it instantly. I've multiple versions and now the electronic kindle one.
