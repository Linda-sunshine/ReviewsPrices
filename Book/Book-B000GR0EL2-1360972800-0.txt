review/summary: Wonderfulreview/text: I've read this book so many times, and yet I can't seem to stop reading it. I actually visited her home in 2004 and saw the actual hiding place, hidden in the wall. This book changes you as a person (or it SHOULD), and makes one realize how much we can all help each other. Even if we don't share the same ideals. It's wonderful, truly. Great book. I wish I could have met her.
