review/summary: Puts your mind in vivid viewreview/text: I loved the audio version of this book with the use of different readers reading the different characters in the book. I loved the accents each reader has that makes the book that much better. They are able to read with such feeling and anunciate the local dialect with such ease that i actually could understand it better listening that if I were to read it myself...struggling trying to understand what some of the characters in the book were saying. I would recommend this book highly to the classic horror reader to sit back and enjoy while being read to.
