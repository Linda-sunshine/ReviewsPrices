review/summary: So beautiful and so vilereview/text: Dorian Gray deserved to die a lonely, bitter man. What fascinates me about his story is the way in which he was hammered on by Lord Henry and yet found no room for the good influence of others. Fascinating tale. Skipped the tedious descriptions of Dorian's collections. Ugh. I just couldn't bring myself to care about the diversion.
