review/summary: Great book to read aloud to my 6- and 7-year old sonsreview/text: When I saw the number of 5 star reviews I added this book to my cart right away. Then I did my customary check of the 1 star reviews and decided to check this out from the library. I'm glad I did. My 6-year old still insists on books with pictures most of the time but does not complain about listening to this at all. My 7-year old and I are riveted and having quite the bonding experience over this. Many of the reviews complain about confusion with the names but both my sons know exactly who is who, even when their names change with their rank (Firepaw the apprentice becomes Fireheart the warrior; leaders end with the suffix "star" and we've looked ahead in another book and see Firestar mentioned so we know Fireheart will one day become a leader). Even characters that have only popped up once or twice are easily recalled by the boys, which I think is attributable to the engaging quality if the story. We will read the whole series if the other books are anywhere near as good as this one.
