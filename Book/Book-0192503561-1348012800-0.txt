review/summary: My favorite Jane Ausren novel so farreview/text: Although a genius in providing commentary on her time, I have often struggled with the way Austen reveals the inevitable love interest in early in her novels. This is the most suspenseful of her books that I have read thus far, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
