review/summary: An old favorite revisited...review/text: I hadn't read this since I was in school. I remember it as a great adventure story, but as an adult the irony and social aspects come into play, which make it even better. Amazingly, Mark Twain wrote of his time to those would come after that time. That's not to say it wasn't germane to the era it was authored. Maybe, best of all Huck and Jim's adventure is still that, an adventure for many ages to enjoy.
