review/summary: Going Back in Timereview/text: Lynn Austin has done an amazing job with Gods & Kings. She has breathed life into her characters: wicked King Ahaz, his son Hezekiah, Shebna, and all the others. I was there, watching this cast of characters become living, breathing, human beings who were not just names in the Bible. I felt their pain, their sorrow, and their joy. You won't be able to quit reading until you've read the entire series. God has gifted Austin with an amazing writing ability.
