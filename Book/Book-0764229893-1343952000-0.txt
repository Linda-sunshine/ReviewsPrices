review/summary: Amazing seriesreview/text: This series by Lynn Austin is one of the best that I have read. I was completely fascinated with it and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good historical fiction book. One piece of advice- order the others in the series as well because you won't want to wait for it once you finish this book!
