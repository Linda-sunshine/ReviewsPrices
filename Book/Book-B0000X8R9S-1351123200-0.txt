review/summary: Justin Time 2review/text: Hatchet is a phenomenal book. It is about a twelve year old flying over the Canadian wilderness to see his dad. The pilot has a heart attack and Brian crashes onto land. He has to live by himself and supply food and water for himself. Will he survive? I recommend this book for kids ages ten through twelve.
