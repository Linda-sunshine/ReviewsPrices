review/summary: First book read on my Kindle...review/text: This was the first book I read on my Kindle. I have always read paper books and was not so sure if I would like it. Not only was the kindle an awesome way to read a book, but this book was also awesome. If you have seen the movie and loved it, you need to read the book. The book is so much better and full of surprises.
