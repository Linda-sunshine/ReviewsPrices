review/summary: Well written!review/text: I have read a ton of historical fiction novels but never one from this time period. Although I'm not well versed in the Old Testament I was skeptical if I would enjoy this novel but loved it! I plan on reading the others in the series.Gods and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings #1
