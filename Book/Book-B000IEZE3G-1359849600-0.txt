review/summary: Not Compatible with Kindle Free Timereview/text: This is not a review of the book (which is GREAT), but a warning for parents who use Kindle Free Time to control what their children can access. Amazon will link you to the Pottermore site to buy the Kindle version of this book, and your purchase will be added to your Kindle library. But, it is impossible to add it to your child's Free Time library. So, if you want your child to be able to read this book, you have to let them exit Free Time. Since this is a CHILDREN's book, you'd think Amazon might warn you that it is incompatible with Free Time before directing you to an external site to buy it. (By the way, if you are a Prime member or thinking of becoming one, Kindle won't let you put the books borrow borrow in your child's Free Time library, either. So, there is basically no way to read this while using Free Time. Since this is some of the best children's literature ever published, that is a real shame.)
