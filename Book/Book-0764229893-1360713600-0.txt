review/summary: Inspired my Bible readingreview/text: I really enjoyed this book. After getting it for free on Amazon, I had to give it a chance. It so happened that I was reading through the Bible at the EXACT location that this book takes place around. Though some of the details were obviously implied and imposed by artistic liberties, it was believable and not too far fetched or blasphemous. I would give a 5 star, but the writing was a bit elementary. It was a great read, though, and kept me interested for sure!
