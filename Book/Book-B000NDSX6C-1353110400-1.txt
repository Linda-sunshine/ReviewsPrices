review/summary: This was my first time reading The Hobbitreview/text: I knew from many people that this book was going to be good. I didn't expect to quite love it so much though. I fell in love with all the characters and was seriously sad that the story ended. I laughed and cried. Yup, I teared up. Don't judge. Ughh I am such a nerd.I expect to read it again very soon!Wow this has got to be the worst review of The Hobbit ever. I am too emotional after having just finished it. Maybe I will edit this later.
