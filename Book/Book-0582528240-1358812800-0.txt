review/summary: It's Mark Twain's bestreview/text: Others have written more eloquently in greater quantity than I can produce. It's Huck Finn. Read it.Note that this is the written in the vernacular of the American South in the 1800s. If you cannot accept a story told using words that have different meanings today, you should skip it and miss the mastery of the first three quarters of this book.
