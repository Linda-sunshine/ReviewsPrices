review/summary: all the racist babble just goes on and on ad nauseum...review/text: It's an ok story until after the war and then how they turn on the poor old masters and blah, blah, blah... pure southern womanhood all a-fearin' them free black men going around crazy raping... oh come on Margaret, where did you do your research?Just too much of it... and I'm not really so sure Scarlet is so bad, she seems the only one capable of doing the work it takes to get the whole family out of all the scrapes they are in... so what's wrong with that???Well, must consider when it was written I suppose... next I'm reading &#34;Uncle Tom's Cabin&#34; to get the bad taste out of my mouth.
