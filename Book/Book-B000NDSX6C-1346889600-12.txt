review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: The book is a very good read I was very happy with it!There is a lot more action in The Hobbit than in LOTR and it doesn't have you reading pages of less interesting information.Great story line and written extremely well by a very capable authtor.Amazons ebook copy of it was really good too. Almost no problems with it except that the pictures (such as maps) were a bit small. But other than that I couldn't have asked for more.
