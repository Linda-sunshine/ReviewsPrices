review/summary: How can you guy wrong?review/text: This is a classic, a favorite among my family and peers and a story that never gets old. In a time when being proper was taught, and social standing was what you were born into somehow true love sometimes prevails. Jane Austen, although never married, can write with the soul of a true romantic. She uses wit and twists on what was considered &#34;normal&#34; in her time period and made a masterpiece that lives on through the ages.This is a love story about a girl named Elizabeth Bennet, who lives in a less than grand social stature with her sisters, her father, and her outspoken mother. She is witty, lovable and in a word headstrong. Although she does not realize it, the love of her life, Mr. Darcy is fighting with his own sense of propriety and moral guidelines to put a halt to the love he feels for this young woman.Engaging, with characters you love and in some cases cannot help but love to hate bring together a truly remarkable novel that will be hard to put down,
