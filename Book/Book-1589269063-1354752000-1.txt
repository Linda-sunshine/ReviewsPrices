review/summary: Very helpful book - but there's morereview/text: There's a lot of truth in this book, and I'd recommend it to anyone, whether they're married, or looking for love. Chapman's 5 love languages make sense, and the stories he uses to introduce them are engaging. This book led to a lot of conversation with my wife, and our marriage is stronger for it. It's a good starting point. There's a Ladies' Mag style "test" in the back to get a feel for your love language. We cheated and did that first.The only reasons I'd take off a star are:1) Several of the languages are dealt with better elsewhere. As I read a couple of the chapters, I couldn't help but think that some of the languages were dealt with better in How to Make Friends and Influence People, though not in the specific context of marriage.2) Feeling loved and being able to express love are #1 in a marriage, but there's more to making a marriage work, most notably conflict resolution. A book like 10 Great Dates goes much more into nuts and bolts of making a marriage work.If you're looking to make your marriage better, by all means, read this book with your spouse, but by no means stop there!
