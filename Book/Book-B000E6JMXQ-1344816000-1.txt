review/summary: Loved it!review/text: I want to read it again! This is a awesome book. I like this better than Journey to the Center of the Earth. It's a little long but its worth the time it takes to read it. An exciting journey is waiting for you with in the pages of the wonderful classic book. My fave parts are when they; visit Atlantis, go hunting underwater, and go pearl diving. However, I still want to know more about Captain Nemo. The book didn't answer all my questions about him. God bless ya.
