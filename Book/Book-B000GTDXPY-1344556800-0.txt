review/summary: Well worth the readreview/text: I got this book as a "why not" book when it was on the free best-sellers list. I finally read it and was pleasantly surprised. After earning a nickname of "Calamity" Tressa just wants a little respect and proceeds to try and solve the mystery of a murder that no one saw but her. Being, as she describes "unusually unlucky," hilarity ensues. She is made into a believable character that is just trying to get ahead in life. The things she does and the things she says; even when speaking to herself; are things you could imagine yourself saying or doing. Can't wait to read the rest of the series. Great Job Ms. Bacus!
