review/summary: The Beginningreview/text: Another great Kindle Edition at a good price!I first read this tale many, many moons ago - at the recommendation of my 7th grade English teacher. I have read many, many books since then - some great - some good - some just ok... but I can easily say that none of them have I read more times - nor loved better than this one. Bilbo's story is the classic fantasy yarn. The quest, the surprising courage and wisdom that comes in most unexpected packages - the sheer magic of it all - makes it a pleasure to read every single time. As the movie(s) are getting ready to come - and a wider world and audience will see Bilbo and Company's great adventure - I hope there are still some 7th graders (or younger and older) out there who will pick up the book for the 1st time and watch Middle Earth unfold on the movie screen of the mind! For my money it's still the best one out there.
