review/summary: The Heroic Hobbitreview/text: I wish we had a cozy place with a fireplace to sit before, while reading classics on cold winter nights. But at least there are treats like this, meant to be shared aloud to fully savor Tolkien's delicious alliteration, his pleasure in story-telling enriched by his knowledge of the deeper meanings of language. His gifts as a writer can be overlooking by the glitz of a contemporary lens, but these treasures lay in wait to constantly be rediscovered."Still more suddenly a darkness came on with dreadful swiftness! A black cloud hurried over the sky. Winter thunder on a wild wind rolled roaring up and rumbled in the Mountain, and lightening lit its peak. And beneath the thunder another blackness could be seen whirling forward; but it did not come with the wind, it came from the North, like a vast cloud of birds, so dense that no light could be seen between their wings" (pg 302).And the journey just gets better withThe Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the Rings, also best appreciated whist read aloud to fully savor Tolkien's poetic use of language. To further understand the creative spirit of Tolkien, I highly recommend Humphrey Carpenter's excellent works, such asJ.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography, as well as Tom Shippey'sThe Road to Middle-Earth: How J.R.R. Tolkien Created a New MythologyandJ.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century.
