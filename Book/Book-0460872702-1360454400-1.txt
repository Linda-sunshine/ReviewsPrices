review/summary: Good classic to reread quicklyreview/text: This is a great classis to reread quickly if you've read it years ago. It's very short - which I had forgotten. Because of that, the price should definitely be lower for Kindle. I would recommend getting it at the library or buying a used copy from a book sale or half-price book store.
