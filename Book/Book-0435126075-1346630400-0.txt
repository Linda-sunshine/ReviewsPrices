review/summary: Lovely words, awful charactersreview/text: This has not survived the test of time. While it's easy to see why this was a popular story from the 19th century up to the 1950s, reading it now is like listening to cat negotiating its way out of a tangled quilt cover, amusing yes, but ultimately awful and frustrating.The motivations of the two central characters are purely woeful. I won't spoil anything but you don't want anyone to get the outcomes that they desire, not the protagonists, not the antagonists, no one.I can't say don't read it as it is so very ingrained in the pop culture of today, however I can say you should read the book trying to identify any part of it that wouldn't be made better by the introduction of zombies.
