review/summary: Better than I rememberreview/text: First read this almost 50 years ago. The one and only time previous I had read this. Read the 'The Lord of the Rings' each summer, for ten years after that. In preparation for the movie, picked up this and read it again. Not as bad as I remember. The scope of the story is there, the verse is that omnipotent third person used in fairy tales, not as off putting as it was back then. I enjoyed it.
