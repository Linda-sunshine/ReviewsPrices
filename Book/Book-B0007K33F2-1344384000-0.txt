review/summary: The Count of Monte Cristo (Oxford world Classics)review/text: Thoroughly entertaining and timeless read. Makes one reflect strongly on the emotions and ups and down of life. I wish I had realized the cross references were present at the end of the book as it may have clarified a few things. All in all I found it to be a book that I did not want to put down. I read reviews that recommended the unabridged versions and I am glad that I read it.
