review/summary: probabely the best ever written lovestoryreview/text: Neither you have to be in love, nor you ever had to be in love your whole live long, to fall in love with this amazing story of a wonderful and precious and especially self conscious woman, fond of a rigid but tender man. It's an adult fairy tale, but one that can come trough, and for that lucky one, life will never be the same .....again, at least thanks to Jane Eyre, the one and only lovestoryteller
