review/summary: Just as good as the first time I read itreview/text: I remember this book from high school and loved it. I took the time 4-5 years later to re read and I still love it! Its a quick easy read that you cant put down. You are instantly transported to this future world and the fascination to be pretty. Looking forward to delving into the next book in the series, Pretties.
