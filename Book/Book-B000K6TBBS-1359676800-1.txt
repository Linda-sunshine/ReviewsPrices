review/summary: 2nd. to Killing Floor.review/text: IMO this was second only to the first book , The Killing Floor. I always find inaccurate comments in firearms=EX-Glock's do not have safties that &#34;click&#34;. He is Brit, though. Standard very good character substance and interesting. They are pridictable, but always a fun read. I try to buy one a month, I have a difficult time not reading in 2-3 days
