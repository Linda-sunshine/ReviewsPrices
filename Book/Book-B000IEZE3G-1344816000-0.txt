review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: With all the hype about Harry Potter, I thought I'd give it a whirl. The more I read, the more I admired Rowling's fantastic imagination. I was upset to hear the book was geared towards the 12-13 yr. old group. I'm a grandparent and am thoroughly enjoying reading about Harry.
