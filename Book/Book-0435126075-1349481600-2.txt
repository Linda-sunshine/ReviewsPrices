review/summary: Great Classical Literaturereview/text: This is one of my all time favorites. I have read it three times. I like it because it really is a book about the folly of being judgemental.Elizabeth Bennett observes her sisters as being a flighty and air headed. Yet they all seem to find husbands and happiness before her. All of them except poor Mary, she kind of reminds me of myself actually, she's the nerdy one.Elizabeth judges everyone, her mother, her father, her sisters and especially Mr. Darcy. In fairness, he deserves the harsh judgement, no one calls Elizabeth Bennett plain, no matter how rich he is!It is written in high prose style, but don't be put off by it. Pride and Prejudice is a beautifully written book and well worth reading.
