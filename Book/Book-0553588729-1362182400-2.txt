review/summary: Happiest Baby on the Block: A good source for a new mom and dadreview/text: I actually purchased this book for my daughter who just became a mom for the first time and It is always within reach. I think the best part of the book is that it not only gives you helpful insight as to why an infant my be behaving a certain way, it addresses if you should be alarmed, tips to try for different problems and encouragement if techniques don't always work the first time. I will always purchase this book for any baby shower I get invited too. My daughter's pediatrician recommended it and we bought it on kindle on the ride home.
