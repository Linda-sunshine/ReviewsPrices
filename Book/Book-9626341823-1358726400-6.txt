review/summary: A classic in Kindlereview/text: There's nothing like reading an unabridged classic. Scrooge is uglier than any T.V. rendering but that makes his salvation even more remarkable. The introduction explains how the original story was published and why it has &#34;staves&#34; instead of chapters. Even in the Kindle form, the illustrations are beautifully rendered.
