review/summary: Great version or edition of The Hobbitreview/text: We like The Hobbit (and LOTR), wanted a new copy, preferably hardcover to treasure vs a paperback or electronic version, and this one, while obviously having the book text like all editions do, also has illustrations by the author (more Tolkienesque) and a price lower than many of the movie-associated or hyped anniversary editions. A better version at a lower price in hardcover - - works for us!
