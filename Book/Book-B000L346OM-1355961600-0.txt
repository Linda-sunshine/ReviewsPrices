review/summary: Read more than once.review/text: This is the 3rd time i have purchased and read this book. Just the 1st section on Frankl's experience in the death camps is full of inspiration. It is somewhat disturbing to be faced with the inhumanity we all have potential to act out. But the lessons Frankl learned and that we can learn from today are worth the book at twice the price. The 2nd half of the book is less exciting but eminently profound. Reading about Frankl's method of therapy is very instructive for anyone's life. This is a life changing book if the contents are thought about deeply.
