review/summary: A Christmas Traditionreview/text: What can I say about the masterpiece of a genius such as Dickens? I have read A CHRISTMAS CAROL for ten years running on the five nights before Christmas. This edition with it's beautiful illustrations is terrific for setting the mood of that most special Holiday!
