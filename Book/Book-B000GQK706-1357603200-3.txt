review/summary: LOR boxed set - 2002 Edition - disappointing print ink qualityreview/text: The books themselves are excellent quality but the printer ink on the glossy pages is light gray at best - not even close to black ink. Combined with the glossy paper, it would be a nightmare to read. I am so disappointed with this set. Was looking forward to another read through but it sure will not be with this set - do not want the eyestrain!
