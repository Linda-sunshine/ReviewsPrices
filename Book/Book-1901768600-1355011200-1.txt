review/summary: Mature Autenreview/text: Great character development in a work with some light-hearted or humorous scenes, but in general more serious than Emma, Pride and Prejudice... Austen presents a very strong heroine in Anne Elliot, whose only false step in life seems to have been her allowing a trusted friend to persuade her not to marry sweetheart Captain Wentworth. When they next meet, years later, he has made his fortune in the wars, and she has become the official spinster of the family, deeply regretting her decision not to marry him. What happens next is enthralling not so much for the plot, but the detail with which Austen describes the turbulent emotions of the outwardly calm, collected and staid Anne Elliot.
