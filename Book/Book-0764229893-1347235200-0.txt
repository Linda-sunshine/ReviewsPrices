review/summary: God's and Kings:Chronicles of the Kingsreview/text: A very interesting read. The historical content was excellent as it came to life. I could not wait to see what would happen next. Makes you reflect on what values are really important to you and how easily you can be sidetracked and never get back to the place you should be in some instances. On the other hand with some perseverance you can get back on track and be in good standing.
