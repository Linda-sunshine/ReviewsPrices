review/summary: I read this book over and over and still find it an inspiration.review/text: Only 2 or 3 books that I love so much that I've reread them and still get excited when I turn the pages to see what's next. How Corrie lived through the things she did just amazes me but even more, I'm her age now in life and to think of doing even a fraction of what she had accomplished is just incredible. Wish my faith was as strong and my life was a help to others as her's has been to thousands.
