review/summary: A paperback of this length is not worth buying.review/text: I can not recommend the paperback version of the book. Spend a little more and buy the hardcover. A softcover binding is just not strong enough to handle more than four or five hundred pages. I would discourage anyone from buying the softcover version of any book of this length. After one reading the spine is beginning to crease and the plastic layer on the outside is peeling off. I doubt it will survive more than three readings.
