review/summary: Joey Hreview/text: The Hobbit is about a group of dwarves, a wizard, and an unsuspecting Hobbit who go on an adventure. It takes place in Middle Earth, a fictional land sprawling with all kinds of mythical creatures, lush scenery, and dark secrets. The main character of the story is Bilbo Baggins, an ordinary, unadventurous hobbit who one would never expect to be the hero of a story. He is kind and clever but not very courageous at the start of the story. However, he grows to love adventures and gains courage along the way. The wizard who travels with him is Gandalf, an old but spry man. He is the wise and pushes Bilbo to join them on the adventure. He serves as a kind of guide to Bilbo. They adventure into mountains, hunt for treasure, fight a dragon, and Bilbo finds a mysterious ring and meets a peculiar creature named Gollum. I enjoy reading about Bilbo because he is not your normal hero or adventurer. He spends most of his time at home and doesn't know the first thing about fighting, but he manages to make it along the adventure and uses his wits to get him out of trouble. I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of many things. The characters were interesting and likable, especially Bilbo who was a great example of character development. One of my favorite quotes is "Please don't cook me, kind sirs!...I'll cook beautifully for you!" this is said by Bilbo as three trolls discuss how to cook and eat him. The book has a good resolution even though it is a prequel to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I give it 5 stars for great characters, story, setting, and the dialogue is witty and enjoyable. The only reason I could see people not liking this book is because it can be slow at parts. With that being said, it makes up for it with incredible detail.
