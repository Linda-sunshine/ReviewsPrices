review/summary: Great Story!review/text: I read The Lord of the Rings trilogy almost a decade ago and recently decided to read The Hobbit. The story was engaging and fun. I was disappointed that the story did not go more in depth regarding the elves, Beorn, and the lake people. I was also expecting the men of the north mentioned in The Lord of the Rings to make an appearance. I suppose this isn't a fair expectation because The Hobbit was written first, and I only hoped for these things because I read The Lord of the Rings first.
