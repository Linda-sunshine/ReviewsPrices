review/summary: Beautifully writtenreview/text: Tolkien writes beautifully, we all know that. This book, of course, is no exception. A warning to those who read to their children, the sentence structures are sometimes convoluted and extensive causing a need to read them to yourself before reading them to children. The sentences sometimes ramble and lose their thread when read aloud if you are not fully aware. That being said, my kids loved this book, loved the adventure and the beauty of the imagined surroundings. Highly recommend.
