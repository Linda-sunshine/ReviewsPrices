review/summary: Very well written. Will work on people that need outside validation.review/text: First, I'd like to say it is a very well written book. It will work on a lot of people. However, it will not work on people who do not feed from other people's validation.Before reading How to Win Friends and Influence People, I always believed that people are secure and happy on their own. I do not feed my happiness from other people so I thought everyone is the same. While I agree with Dale Carnegie, it also shows how sad the society is in general.I am beginning to think most people no matter what their station in life, (I dare say 90%) do not feel good on their own but feed from other people. In short, to feel good, they need other people to make them feel good. Am I the only one seeing how screwed up that is? It means most people are insecure on their own unless someone reassures them, which to me is scary. This means many people are open for `plucking' which is why we as a society is so easily swayed by advertising and consumerism. This also means many people will do anything just to satisfy that craving for outside acceptance and validation, which is also scary.
