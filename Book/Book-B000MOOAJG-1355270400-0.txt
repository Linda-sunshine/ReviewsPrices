review/summary: Best and most important book ever written for the American way of life besides the Bible.review/text: I have read Atlas Shrugged a few times and I bought this version as a family heirloom. I have inscribed it for all my children and grandchildren as well as future grand children. America built on free enterprise - something that will vanish soon in America IF our elected officials aren't so power hungry. What is happening in our time today is written in this book!! How prophetic Ayn Rand was.
