review/summary: This Is Part Of A Seriesreview/text: I must confess, I bought this book to test out my Kindle's ability to play talking books. I must say for this book at least, the audio is abysmal. There are a female and a male voice, and neither has any inflection at all. Well, I know the audio works, but don't care to use it.As for the book itself, it was quite good. It is about a society where the highest aim is to be like everyone else, dress like everyone else, eat what everyone else does, and except for occupation, to do exactly what everyone else does. And you don't pick out your own occupation or your own mate or your own children; the state does it for you. Communism on steroids.Sounds dreary and it is, for a while. The young protagonist starts to see things most don't, starts to feel uneasy about it, and in the end, he goes off on his own to try to find a better place. There is a lot more I didn't tell you, and it IS a good book.
