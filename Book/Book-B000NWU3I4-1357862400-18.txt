review/summary: This is a fantastic and classic story, love it!review/text: This is a story that I have read over and over for many years and each time I have still enjoyed it every time. It is a story that is wholesome as in you are happy for your children to read it and has adventure and excitement but leaves you feeling pretty good. I am always sorry when I get to the end.
