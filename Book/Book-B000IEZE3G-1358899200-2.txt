review/summary: Pleasantly Pleasedreview/text: I resisted reading this book, having seen all the movies (which I loved.) It's easy to see why it became such a hit with young readers - easy to read, but not childish. Great imagery. Obviously the beginning of an epic story. I'll plunge in and read the rest!
