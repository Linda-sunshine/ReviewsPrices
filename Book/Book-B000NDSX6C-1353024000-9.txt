review/summary: Not Dante, but still a classic Catholic readreview/text: I love Tolkien, especially the Hobbit. His books work at so many levels. Yes, Tolkien was a Catholic and LOTR reflects a very Catholic sensibility and view of good and evil. Ultimately it's just a great read that never gets old. I first read the Hobbit in the 6th grade and fell in love with it immediately. Although it's a far cry from Dante(my favorite foray into other worlds that I just wrote a book on), this book is timeless.
