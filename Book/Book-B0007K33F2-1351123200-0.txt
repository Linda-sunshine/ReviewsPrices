review/summary: The only book I have enjoyed enough to read 8-9 timesreview/text: This book has it all. It is set in the early 1800s and involves ambition, humility, envy, love, power, poverty, education, travel, and many other subjects of life. It is a great read for travelers and adventuresome people. I have read a lot of books, but find that this is the only book, classic or otherwise, that I have read 5-6 times over the past 20 years. Highly recommended!
