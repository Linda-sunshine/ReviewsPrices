review/summary: Must Read for YAsreview/text: I read this for the first time when I was 11 or 12 and I absolutely loved it. We had quiet reading time in my English class the year I read it and I recommended it to other kids I knew. I remember distinctly looking across the room one day to see one of my classmates reading it staring at me with an "Oh My GOD" expression on his face. Ha ha.I have gone back to this book and read it as an adult and it holds up. It's just a really solidly written, interesting book and GREAT absolutely great for young people who are just starting to get into that mode of curiosity and rebellion. :D
