review/summary: Love the interesting, detailed charactersreview/text: My first impression of Persuasion was that Jane Austen writes some interesting and detailed characters. Right from page one, Sir Walter was my favorite character. He's a jerk, yeah, but he's hilarious. I don't know that the characters in this book are as modern as they are in say Pride and Prejudice, but the author's brutal honesty, especially about the less appealing characters, is always entertaining. The whole story made me really think about how much other people influence our lives and whether or not that is always a good thing.And can Jane Austen write a romance. The flirting, the dashing hero that you want but can't have, and that beautiful love letter! I do have to say that there was one major climactic scene that just felt cheesy to me. Oh the horror! Other than that, it was refreshing and fun to read a Jane Austen novel that I didn't even know existed until a few years ago.
