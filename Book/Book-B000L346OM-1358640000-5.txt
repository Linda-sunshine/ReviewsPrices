review/summary: Man's Search for Meaning.review/text: This book is life changing. I found my meaning reading this. To go through the horror of the holocaust and be able to explain how is mind boggling, This is a must read for everyone to learn to see how important it is to live life and always have courage and hope in everything you do and go through. There is so much to learn from what he teaches. You will never think or act the same way again.
