review/summary: Something of worthreview/text: This was an audiobook I picked up out of the discount bin at a local bookstore. For three bucks I got more than my money's worth. I'm a fan of Stephen King's body of work and while this story didn't pack the punch many of his stories do, there was something of value to the story. For me, it was very much a mental connect-the-dots sort story and I enjoyed trying to make those associations.
