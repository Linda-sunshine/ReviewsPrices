review/summary: Brings Back Memoriesreview/text: I read this book with my dad as a kid. I reread it as a precursor to seeing the movie coming out in December. Reading it again brought back great memories. I think the storyline is quite original and keeps the reader engaged from start to finish. I could hardly put it down. A great read for many ages.
