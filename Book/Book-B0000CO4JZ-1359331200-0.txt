review/summary: Finally understand this is everyone's favorite storyreview/text: I'm not going to try to compete with more detailed reviews. I'll just sum up by saying I grew up reading a lot of great literature and my husband is not a reader at all, but he said this was his favorite book so I finally read it and get why everyone has always raved about it. It's very smart and apparently accessible to a wide range of ages as my husband read this when he was in grade school.
