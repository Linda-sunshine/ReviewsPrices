review/summary: Bradbury Ahead of His Timereview/text: I read this out loud with my high school student. It was her assigned summer reading. I remembered reading this a long time ago or watching the movie. One remarkable thing about the book is how Bradbury describes the future where we are locked in houses and tied to a community of media devices. Because it was written at the dawn of television, I find it facinating that Bradbury would predict a world so similar to life now.The language in the book is very dynamic. It is a great book to read out loud. There is wonderful tension in the plot as the fireman turned rebel tries to escape the nazi-like government.This is the book about book burning. I was in Split, Croatia last summer and our guide pointed out where the Nazis burned the books in the town square. It sent shivers up my spine. You will feel that when you read this book, a book that cautions us about totalitarianism and social isolation.
