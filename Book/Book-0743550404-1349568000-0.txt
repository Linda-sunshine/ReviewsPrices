review/summary: The Colorado Kitdreview/text: This was a book of Stephen Kings that I had never read before, but with the TV show Haven, that refers to this book, I thought I would give it a try.I thought the book was very much a Stephen King story, giving you answer and more questions while moving you through this Story of the Kid. You end up thinking about the TV show and the troubles and how the Kid was involved.
