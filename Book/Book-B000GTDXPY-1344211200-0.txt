review/summary: Glad I didn't give up on this one.review/text: The beginning struck me as a book written for teens. Then this little mystery picked up speed and I ended up enjoying it very much. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the first person style refreshing. Don't expect a best seller but if you want a light-hearted romp with well developed characters and an unexpected ending, this is a good choice. A fine "free" summer read.
