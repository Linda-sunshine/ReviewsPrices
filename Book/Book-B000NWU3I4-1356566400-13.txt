review/summary: Read the *&%#ng book!review/text: I read this, for the first time as a teenager.... many moons ago. I've re-read it several times since. Having seen and enjoyed Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy, I looked forward to the new movie(s???) based on this book.I think J.R.R. Tolkein, for all his foibles, would most likely not enjoy Mr. Jackson's current offering. I realize that MGM has now taken a stake in Mr. Jackson's films.... and with the current trend of making "franchise films", I should have known something was amok when I learned that "The Hobbit" was to be a two-movie offering. The embellishments on the original story, the addition of "bad guy" goblins and a whole battle scene that doesn't occur in the book had me wondering from the first half hour of the movie, if it would get back to the story as Tolkein wrote it. A character mentioned ONCE in the book (and just in passing) has two whole scenes devoted to him.This is not so much intended as a review of the movie as it is the book. Read. Forget the 3-D.... forget the IMAX.... forget the silver screen altogether! Read the book. Simply put: It's better.
