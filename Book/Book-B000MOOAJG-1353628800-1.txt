review/summary: A literary masterpiecereview/text: I don't read many novels because I generally don't like fictional writing styles. This book, however draws you in immediately, and it's tough to put down. Not for the faint of heart but should be required reading for all students who have bought into the &#34;I'm owed and privelidged because I am an American&#34; mentality. Rand pegged our current social climate 50 years ago. Too bad she was right and it's coming to pass.
