review/summary: Amazingreview/text: This book is nothing short of. It stimulates new thought processes and really offers new perspective. Frankl uses powerful examples from his experiences but does not use this book detail the WWII horrors. He uses them as proof of will and explains the psychological side of those horrors he does share.
