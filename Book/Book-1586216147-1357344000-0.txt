review/summary: Not as great as I expectedreview/text: I'm a person who usually loves a book more than the movie version, but in this case the movie was SO much better than the book. Unfortunately I watched the movie before the book so I was incredibly disappointed when I read this, it just didn't get into there past and how they fell in love enough for my liking. It's still a touching story, I just didn't enjoy it.
