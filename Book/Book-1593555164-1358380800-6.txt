review/summary: Totally awed by Jack Reacher - I want to be him.review/text: I've read all the Jack Reacher books and 'One Shot' is just one of the range that is both exciting, gritty and very hard to put down. One paragraph 'pulls' you in to the next one. Anyone looking for a good read whilst you're travelling for more than an hour, this is one you should purchase before your journey.
