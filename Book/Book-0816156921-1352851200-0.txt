review/summary: Not Hollywoodreview/text: I have seen the movie dozens of times. And, recently went to the play. So in the spirit of halloween I thought I would read the book. I enjoyed the book so much more than the Hollywood version of the story. The love story always seemed out of place. Also, the detail and depth of the book was so much more complex and compelling.
