review/summary: The Giverreview/text: So you want to live in a perfect world without poverty, crime, disagreement and worry? What does it take to create such a utopia? The Giver by Lois Lowry is a chilling example of how one such world is structured. Such a perfect society may not be what it is thought out to be. Freedom, individualism, and emotions are sacrificed in order to create this utopian world.Lowry leads her readers on a journey through the highly structured life of twelve-year-old Jonas. Given a special role in his community, Jonas slowly begins to learn how his world differs from what it used to be. He sees events and experiences feelings he has never encountered before. Jonas is left wondering if the freedom to experience these emotions, good or bad, is really worth it. Is freedom to experience pain, love, happiness and sorrow better than structure in a sterile environment?I highly recommend The Giver as it will influence the reader to ponder the structure of society as well as the freedoms our society allows. This book may be considered a book for younger readers, but it would greatly benefit any adult reader as well. Lowry creates a piece of literature that evokes thoughts and emotions comparable to Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. The Giver is a book that should not be overlooked.
