review/summary: Not library binding, small printreview/text: This review is not a review of the novel, but a review of the product itself. This book is quite small, subsequently has small print, and is not library bound as it says. While the size is definitely listed in the particulars, I simply didn't realize it would be smaller than my hand. If you are expecting a good stitch binding, you will be disappointed, as this is apparently a paperback simply glued into a hard cover, which wouldn't last long if available for public use. Additionally, there appear to be some issues with the formatting, with varying margin widths and chapters that begin mid-page. Not having read this book yet, I don't know if that is part of the intended format or not. If none of these things are issues for you, then this book is probably fine. At any rate, I'm returning this one, and will be looking for a larger print version with proper binding.
