review/summary: Amazingreview/text: By far my favorite author, this is a great read. I however would only recommend this if you are able to get through some fairly long descriptive passages with very archaic wording. I read this on a kindle so i could highlight and define words not used anymore, but other wise have a dictionary handy. If you can get past that though, a great book.
