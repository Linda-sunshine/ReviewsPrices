review/summary: Love Storyreview/text: I love old famous literature. Jane Eyre is one of those books you hear about for years and finally read. There are many surprising events in the book. I love the way Jane upholds her personal standards in spite of temptations to do otherwise. We can all learn from her to value love over riches.
