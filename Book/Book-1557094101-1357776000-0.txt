review/summary: Holiday keepsakereview/text: Love it! I already have the book for my 6 year old grandaughter ( I actually purchased it when she was four.) She now reads it to us and constantly tells me how much she loves this book, especially the animotion illustrations. I recently purchased it for my 10 year old grandson who also loves having this book. We all talk often about the fact that my grandchildren will read this very book to their children one day and pass it on. It is well made, and a perfectkeepsake. I wrote a little something on the inside cover of the book for each of my grandchildren.
