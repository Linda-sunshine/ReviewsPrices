review/summary: Horrible, badly writtenreview/text: I have been trying to read Atlas Shrugged for over an year and am strill struggling. I'm about halfway through and can't just go on. Ayn Rand's characters are not even two-dimensional. They are black and white. And incredibly naiive. The language is poor. Story progresses awfully slowly. I do not even know why I am trying to finish this.
