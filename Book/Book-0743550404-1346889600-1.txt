review/summary: Do not expect the "voice" of Stephen Kingreview/text: Mystery fans will pick up this book because it's a mystery. Stephen King fans will pick it up because it's Stephen King. Of the two sets of readers, the mystery fans will be the once more likely to enjoy themselves.The Colorado Kid is a quick-read mystery, nothing more and nothing less. Don't expect the supernatural; don't expect the in-depth characterization contained in King's longer works. If you read the author's afterword, you'll discover that this book delivers exactly what King wanted it to: a light read with darker undertones, a shorter piece of fiction that inspires more questions than it answers. From that standpoint, the broad strokes King uses to "paint his picture" deliver masterfully upon the book's simple promise.From my review so far, potential readers might assume I did not enjoy the book. Actually, I enjoyed it very much. It was fun, fast, and fascinating. I appreciate seeing one of my favorite authors trying his hand at a different genre, and I think he executed it well. Once I realized that I shouldn't expect "typical King," I settled in and just let the story be what it is. For Stephen King fans, this might be the key to appreciating the novel.I give The Colorado Kid 4 stars instead of 3 because it kept me reading and questioning. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because, although the framing story (2 older reporters telling the tale to a newbie) is neat, I suspect that seeing the tale unfold "in real time" would have been more interesting.
