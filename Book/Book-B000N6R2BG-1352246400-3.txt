review/summary: Had me searching for time to keep reading!!review/text: I haven't read too many books by Jodi Picoult but am definitely going to check out more of her books after reading "Keeping Faith". This book was hard to put down; kept my interest; and had me searching for time to continue reading. She kept me wondering how this story was going to end!!
