review/summary: Nice,satisfying,fun readreview/text: Loved this book,also the characters.a few of them worked my nerves,but I still love how well written they are.Elizabeth is my favorite because she is headstrong,independent and outspokenWith so many intricate lives and plot lines interwoven,it kept me completely engrossed and it made wanting to know the fate of each character!!I loved her Austin's writing style,this book not only observes the social hierarchy of the times in which it was written,but also human natures and personalities that are eternal.I recommend this book for everyone of every time and place.
