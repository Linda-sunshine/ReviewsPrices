review/summary: Generally OK, but suffers from contemporary usage blightreview/text: A good translation from the nineties, but a definite product of the intellectually stilted academic elite, i.e. the translator takes pains to correct the "benighted" errors of the author by inserting common vulgar usage such as (and here I am quoting from memory) "We were surprised by him answering us," "...he or she" rather than "his" as the gender comprehensive, "...as if it was" (rather than "as if it were..."). I guess we all can be thankful for the translator's avoidance of the awful "their" as the gender comprehensive.I found the annotations in the back surprisingly difficult to work with, considering the fine annotations extant in the other Penguin editions of Dumas. The weakness here is that the annotations are by chapter heading rather than page number, hence making their lookup much more difficult.A good read overall, however.
