review/summary: Inspiring bookreview/text: This book is written in simple language and its descriptions of family life in Holland of the 1800's is beautiful and romantic. The acts portrayed in the book are inspirational from the perspective of ordinary people who chose to be decent, generous, and kind in the midst of fear, betrayal and ruthlessness. I recommend this book to anyone, but specially to those with Christian values and beliefs, since the book is a great illustration of how those values and beliefs provided strength and encouragement in dark hours of trial.
