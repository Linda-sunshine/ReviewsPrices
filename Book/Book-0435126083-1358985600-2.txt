review/summary: Not at all like the movie or PBS mini-seriesreview/text: I've seen the movie Wuthering Heights several times and recently watched the PBS mini-series. The tone of the romantic movie is nothing like the book, and the series is much closer only if you've read the book and can fill in the blanks in your mind. That said, the book is much more dense and dark than either and would appeal to modern audiences much more than the rather frilly movie and disjointed series. In the book, Catherine Earnshaw is self-centered and could easily be termed as mentally deranged and Heathcliff is a sadist. They mentally torture each other and are cruel and thoughtless of everyone around them. Bronte's book isn't the grand love story it's made out to be in the movie. Catherine and Heathcliff are more obsessed than romantic, and there's really not much of anyone to like. The setting is grimy, not grand. The characters are hardscrabble in a bleak, brutal world. I can imagine that it would be shocking in its day, but in the era of slasher movies, it's merely a pretty good read.
