review/summary: The book I would give to a Martianreview/text: If a Martian landed on Earth and wanted to understand humanity, this is the book I would give them. Twain comments on every major aspect of human society in "Huckleberry Finn;" if he missed anything, I didn't notice. Saying that Twain was "ahead of his time" here is trite - he's ahead of our time as well. Fast-forward a thousand years into the future, to the unimaginable cyborgs that will be populating the Earth then, and Twain will be ahead of them as well. It's unfortunate that he didn't anticipate future sensitivity to the N-word, as his liberal use of it throughout the book is understandably offensive to many people. It should be clear from his treatment of the "Jim" character that Twain's intention was to demolish the philosophies of racism and bigotry of his time."Huckleberry Finn" is one of those rare books that one may reread many times, from childhood to old age, and find something different in it each time. This isn't just because we change - our society evolves as well, and each time we will read it within a different context, as in Borges' "Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote."Maybe I would give the Martian "The Brothers Karamazov," but that would probably make them want to exterminate us. If they learn about us from "Huckleberry Finn," they might allow us to live.
