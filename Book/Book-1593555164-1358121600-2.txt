review/summary: Can't quite imagine Tom Cruise playing the role.review/text: Enjoyed &#34;One Shot&#34; but found myself trying to picture Tom Cruise as Jack which kind of ruined the image a little bit for me. I like my Jack as the big barrel chested tough guy. Looking forward to the movie and cant imagine how Jack (Tom) will be able to crush the bad guy in his arms toward the end of the story or will that be omitted??? Am sure the movie will be great either way.
