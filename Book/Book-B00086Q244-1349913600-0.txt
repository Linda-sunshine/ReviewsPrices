review/summary: Excellent bookreview/text: While taking a graduate level marketing class, I picked up this book as it was recommended by the professor. I honestly thought that it wouldn't be that interesting and probably quite outdated. Boy, was I wrong! Not only did it keep me reading well past my bedtime, but the information presented was so relevant to today. As a marketing student, the only other book that I have read which I liked so well on this topic wasAttitude - Your Best hope for Happiness. Whether you want to grow your circle of friends or just be more influential in your community and job, this is a great book to point you in the right direction!
