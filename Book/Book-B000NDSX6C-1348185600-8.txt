review/summary: A Magical Talereview/text: I loved The Hobbit. It was a fun, delightful read. Tolkien was obviously the narrator, and he had a way of inserting little quips that would make me chuckle. The story moved along quite nicely, as it was short, and you ended the book feeling like the story had come full circle. I would recommend that everyone should read this - it's a classic!
