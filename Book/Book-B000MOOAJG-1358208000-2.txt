review/summary: Fantastic book that is extremely relevant to today's political scenereview/text: I'm in the middle of the third book and so far it's a very engaging book, even moreso given the relevancy. Socialistic society increasing taxes, taking from the rich and successful and redistributing all of it to the worthless masses. An interesting examination of how the extremes of socialism and industrial titan-ism/capitalism interact on the same playing field. Our world isn't quite to either extreme (yet) but you can draw plenty of parallels.
