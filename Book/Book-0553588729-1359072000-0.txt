review/summary: book reviewreview/text: I've just finished reading this book in preparation for our soon-to-be-coming bundle of joy (just in case he turns out to be a crier!). Although I won't have a chance to try out the techniques in the book for a few more weeks, I really wanted to comment on the author's "history lessons". I was surprised to read how frequently Dr. Karp refers to "cavebabies" and such... so much that I found it laughable! I'm not going to go on and on, I just can't help but to think he sounds somewhat ignorant whenever this creeps into his book, especially when he suggests that babies have learned to cry louder and louder over millions of years. Imagine that, newborn babies can learn such a thing while still in the womb... silly and inconceivable. While I find his techniques valuable and thorough, this book could have been just as thorough without these references.
