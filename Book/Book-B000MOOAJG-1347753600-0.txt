review/summary: SENSATIONALreview/text: This is perhaps the best non-fiction (or is it?) I have ever read! I'd double the five star rating. Pertinent to todays's news. It shows what can happen when a government becomes too powerful. What a concept. And exactly what do you think would happen if instead of the unions, the best business leaders, entrepreneurs left their businesses and went on strike? Powerful and thought provoking.
