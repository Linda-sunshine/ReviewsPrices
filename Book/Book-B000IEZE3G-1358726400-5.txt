review/summary: Harry potter seriesreview/text: I have read the Harry potter series 2 times, and I have read Harry potter one 4 times now. It has such great emotional power. I still cry at some parts when I read different books of this spectacular series. It also has such gripping power, from when Voldemort killed Harry's parents to when Harry potter kills Voldemort! This is an amazing series!
