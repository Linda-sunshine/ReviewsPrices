review/summary: This is classic literature for a reason!review/text: Great story. A little hard to read because of the 19th century England English and many slang terms that are unfamiliar to our conversations. Add to that the style of writing differences and you have a challenge; however, if stay with it long enough to get to the story (a few chapters), the mystery and situations are a rewarding experience. The theme being that good wins over evil although evil presents many difficulties for the good. If only we had more literature and movies with this theme today, we would be striving for much more lofty goals than money, recongnition and sex which is so evident in our current cutlture.
