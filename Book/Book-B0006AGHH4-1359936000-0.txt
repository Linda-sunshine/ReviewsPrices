review/summary: Excellent readreview/text: I think the subject/history was presented in a manner that would provoke the reader to examine their deepest moral and religious beliefs and to consider, had they lived in that period of history, where they would have been on these history making issues. Also, made me seriously consider many controversial issues of today.
