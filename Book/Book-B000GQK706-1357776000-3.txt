review/summary: This is a really nice editionreview/text: I have to say this is a really nice edition of the Lord of the Rings. I have been wanting to get this edition for a while to go along with my illustrated edition of The Hobbit. Alan Lee is a wonderful artist. His drawings have a realistic look to them which is why I would prefer this edition above all the other ones. I see a lot of people try to compare the 50th anniversary edition and the illustrated edition but I can't really say the same as I don't own the 50th anniversary edition. Maybe in the future I'll purchase that one. I've read that one has a map of Middle Earth that folds out in the back of it. But I don't think it has illustrations. Nonetheless I'm still happy with this illustrated edition. It's the nicest copy of Lord of the Rings I've owned so far. My only complaint about it is that the one I bought didn't have the blue ribbon bookmark attached to it. Which is curious because I bought it brand new straight from Amazon and the ones I've seen on store shelves in the past had the blue ribbon bookmark. I didn't even see any sign of one that could have been ripped off or something. I don't know if there were some made without it or what because any reviews I read about it before described the blue ribbon bookmark as well. It's not really that big of a deal if mine doesn't have one. But at the same time I was just a little disappointed because I was expecting it to have it on there. So now as I close this review I will be returning to another adventure in Middle Earth (it's been a few years since I last read Lord of the Rings) in this very nice edition with Alan Lee's masterpiece illustrations. Once I'm done though I will also be getting the illustrated edition of the Silmarillion.
