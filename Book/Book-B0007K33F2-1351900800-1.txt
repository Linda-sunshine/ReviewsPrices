review/summary: My third time and STILL couldn't put it down!!!review/text: This is my third time reading my favorite novel, The Count of Monte Cristo. It was an easier read, I think because of the translation as well as because I paid more attention to the characters in the early part of the book because I knew they'd be playing their roles again later. The first time I read it, sometimes it was a strain to remember later who had done what back in the beginning.What was interesting was to see how my feelings about some of the characters was different with this reading than in the past. I could see how I have evolved as a person and in my philosophy about life as I reacted differently to how the book unfolded. That was unexpected, and it was satisfying.I bought this to read on my Kindle. Was going to get the free version but saw another review that said this translation was better. So I read the first three or four pages of each edition free online, and easily saw the difference in the translation. It's worth paying a few bucks for this translation.The story is as gripping as ever. Whether it's your first time or third time, prepare to be mesmerized!
