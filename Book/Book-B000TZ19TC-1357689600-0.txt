review/summary: Reviewreview/text: This is a great story story predicting our grim future where books are banned and only electronic entertainment is allowed.I found this story absolutely mind blowing and a classic Ray Bradbury book. It is scary to think about what the future will be like. After reading this, I want to take some sort of action to save our books and knowledge. This was an awesome, quick read!
