review/summary: Not so far-fetchedreview/text: Already a dystopian classic, THE HANDMAID'S TALE is particularly impressive in the way that Atwood reveals the details of the repressive Christian theocracy of Gilead. Narrated from the point of view of Offred, the tale moves at a deliberate pace, allowing the reader to piece together from small details and events a nightmarish puzzle. Given that the author predicted an Islamic attack on the West and given the current predilections of the religious right, a coup by Christian fanatics is not out of the question today. If Obama wins a second term, some of these fanatics' heads are going to explode. The Old Testament subjugation of women in the novel is right in line with their thinking.
