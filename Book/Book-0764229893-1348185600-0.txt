review/summary: Gods and Kingsreview/text: This was the first of Lynn Austins books that I have read. I loved how she gave the scripture references from where she took her storyline. For me it was a book that was hard to put down. I enjoyed the second book in the series as much as the first, also the third book. I am now on the fourth book and my only disappointment is that Amazon does not offer the fifth and last book in the Kindle edition or paperback.
