review/summary: A Great Read project for Wilmington, NCreview/text: I read this book in college but picked it up again because I wanted to take part in the &#34;great read&#34; project here in Wilmington.I enjoyed reading this book again for the vivid picture it creates of the roaring 20's and of the people who populate this story. F. Scott was a true master of the written word.
