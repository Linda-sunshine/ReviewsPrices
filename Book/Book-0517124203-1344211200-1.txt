review/summary: The finest edition of Alice's Adventures ever plublishedreview/text: I already owned this book, along with Through the Looking Glass, but I just had to get this wonderful edition after seeing the YouTube trailer for the book: (...). Go ahead and watch it. I'll wait :-)Awesome, right!? I'm a complete sucker for nice clothbound books, and I love contemporary art, so getting this really was a no-brainer.The illustrations are amazing and they compliment the story perfectly, transporting adults into an imaginary world that's rarely available to those over two feet tall. For a story that's been visually adapted time and again by Western illustrators and filmmakers, it's refreshing to have a completely re-imagined view of Alice's adventures by this wonderful Japanese artist. In fact, the one problem I had while reading the book was trying to forget the movie adaptations I'd seen (particularly the Disney one) and instead allow myself to imagine it with fresh eyes. It took a little while, but I love the new vision that Kusama took me on through that timeless rabbit hole.In regards to the story itself, I was so impressed with how cleaver and imaginative Carroll is. None of the movies really do the story justice. I'm pretty sure that Carroll must have at least been an amateur linguist because of all the ways he plays with the language. Actually, thanks to my former life as a linguistics major, I got so much more out of reading this than I probably would have otherwise. While this is undoubtedly a children's book, this is a story for all ages.Whether you're a kid or an adult, this is a fantastic edition of a classic story. Rarely does a book make me laugh out loud, but Alice's adventure in Wonderland did just that - page after page. I can't wait to share this with my (as of now, nonexistent) kids someday!
