review/summary: Who Is John Galt?review/text: A classic book, not for its literary merit, but its story and message. Ayn Rand is easy and entertaining to read but I don't regard her as a great writer. I do regard her as a great thinker and rebel.The dialogue is the best part of the story. At first I thought the antagonists in the book were a little over the top, but then I noticed how closely their words and attitude are to real headlines, conversations and things some of my friends say that I used to just roll my eyes at and notice only in passing. It's scary. Essential reading for any libertarian, conservative or open-minded liberal, progressive or independent who wants to get inside our head and see from our eyes.I bought this book used in "good" condition but it arrived more "like new." So that's cool.Buy this book and read all one million pages of it. (More like 1200.)
