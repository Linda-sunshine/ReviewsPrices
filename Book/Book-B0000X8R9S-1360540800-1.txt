review/summary: Hatchetreview/text: I thought this was an interesting book but seemed to me to be written for younger kids, maybe in fifth grade. I read it very quickly (in half an hour). I didn't feel like I connected with Brian though. I felt that the characters weren't what made the story interesting.
