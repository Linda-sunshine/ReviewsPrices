review/summary: The wrong problems with wrong curesreview/text: Ayn Rand makes up an impossible (idealistic) world and then lists the problems with the ideal she has carefully defined. She then expects (or prompts) the reader to make links from this fantasy world to current culture, and then suggests equally idealistic cures for her ill conceived fantasy world while leading the reader to surmise that the same cures can and should be applied to the real world. This is irrational and dishonest but since you are presented with the straw-man world she has created, what choice do you have except to put the book down and go on within your real world.For those who continue with the book (you'll never get this time back), you find that all the characters that are not selfish enough for her are killed off in a literal train wreck that mirrors the figurative train wreck that is this book.For those who agree that the world will go to hell if all the movers and shakers went on strike, I wonder if they have considered the Lord of the Flies world these beautiful people have moved to.In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is King; and without other Kings, we will get along fine without the richer Kings.We poor employed people just can't live without our employers.Hey, did you hear the one about . . . If you, put all the creative, rich people end to end . . . that would be a good thing. Yuk, yuk.
