review/summary: Shoddy prose and abysmal "philosophy"review/text: It has been a great century for philosophy, we have had Frege and Russell and Wittgenstein. We have had the naturalistic fallacy and there is great work on ethics. However, Ayn Rand, having completely ignored these achievements and the achievements of other great thinkers such as Hume specifically, decides to dish out meaningless rubbish, poorly defined and meaningless. Unfortunately a large proportion of the human race cannot come to grips with the problems of belief and existence and of life and cannot accept the complex nature of morality and existence and conscience and the lack of an all encompassing theory and instead dogmatically follows this crappy doctrine of s***. It appears even the rulers of colony of America have succumb to it, one can only hope the natural strength of the British can stop this plague encroaching upon our shores.Moreover the book is horrendous. It is too bloody long, the prose is bland and the characterisation dull and bias. Foolish 99% protect yourself from this dogma!
