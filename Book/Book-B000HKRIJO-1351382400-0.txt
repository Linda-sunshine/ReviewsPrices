review/summary: Mere Christianityreview/text: One of the all time classics, this is a great book for group study by Christian groups of any denomination or persuasion. The term "Mere Christianity" means "the beliefs that ALL Christians agree on. This is probably the best defense of the faith from the 20th century. It is written is simple language that anyone can grasp, yet Lewis' reasoning is astonishingly clear and, to many, convincing. He makes no appeals to the bible or the church tradition, but relies on everyday observation and reason. This might also be a good starting book for someone who is not a Christian but want's to learn a bit more about it.
