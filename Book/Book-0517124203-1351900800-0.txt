review/summary: Very imaginativereview/text: There is so much imagination and fantasy. Lewis Carroll, the great author of this book, is actually a mathematician. This book has so much creativity and deep meaning. It explains the transition of Alice becoming a grown and mature woman from a young child. This book is a perfect book for all ages, preferably seven years old and older.
