review/summary: A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickensreview/text: Free Kindle version of the classic holiday tale. Easy to read -- only drawback of course is the free version contains no images/drawings. But if all you want are the words as a reminder or something to check a quote, then this version is perfect. I find when I have time to re-read some favorite passages from the classics and the free Kindle version works well for that.
