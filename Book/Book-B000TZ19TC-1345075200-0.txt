review/summary: I regret not writing this review while he was alive...review/text: This was one of the only books I was forced to read as a child in school that I truly loved. I love to read but I find I often hated the books selected by schools for children to read. Considering how dull most of the literature is that children are made to read in high school it tends to make me wonder how I, and others, maintain our love of literature.But Ray Bradbury's world and his writing style kept me hooked and made me a fan over fifteen years ago and I am still a fan of his work now. I am saddened that he is gone now but his writing will love on forever as he was our generation's H. G. Wells.This book was surprisingly accurate to the world of today, to political correctness run rampant, to the opressiveness of censorshhip, and to our shallow obsession with better technology. This is one book that will never truly be antiquated. Read it, understand it, and appreciate it.
