review/summary: Great Clasicreview/text: This book is just chalk full of fantastic principles and great advice on how to be a good person. Many of these things one should or might already know, but hearing them again is always great. It's not a terribly long read and all the individual examples of people for which and how these principles have worked is very enjoyable. It's a classis, has been around for decades and been translated into many languages. Catch up and read it already! =)
