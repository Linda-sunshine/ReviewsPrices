review/summary: Will warm any heartreview/text: I really enjoyed this book. For some reason I've put off reading it for years, and now that I've read it, I wonder why. It was a delightful tale of the joy that Christmas can bring to our lives. Scrooge is well depicted as a grumpy individual, but the transformation that the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future bring about will warm any heart. I'd recommend this book to any and every reading person!
