review/summary: Classic Booksreview/text: This has long been a favorite trilogy of mine. I have the set, but I need to read it in larger print now. The Kindle is the perfect way for me to read it again and again. This Old English scholar and critic is a master writer and the books deal with ethics, imagination, philosophy, theology, and themes that are universal. What chord resonates more in the hearts of man than an adventure quest. After all, this is the stuff of life itself!
