review/summary: Decor not Functionreview/text: This book serves better as a decoration piece than one you want to spend time passing around to friends. Not that the content of the book isn't worth reading, you just don't want to ruin the aesthetic quality of this book.If you are buying the book to simply read there are cheaper versions out there. But if you want to add quality and smart decor to your home this is a great purchase.The cover looks better in person than online. Quality product.
