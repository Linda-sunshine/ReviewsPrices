review/summary: Beautiful illustrationsreview/text: This review is for the hardcover. Wonderful new illustrations pair with an old classic story for a must-have addition to your home library.The hardcover version begins with Carroll's opening poem, "All in a golden afternoon," accompanied by a beautiful illustration of anthropomorphic animals rowing a boat. I had only seen the Disney version as a child and as an adult desired to read the original, then decided to purchas this version because of the illustrations. I was not disappointed. Having been down a rabbit hole or two myself, I greatly enjoyed this nonsensical, imaginative tale. Although pinned as a children's book, the story is equally as enjoyable for the young at heart. Camille Rose Garcia's vibrant, haunting style perfectly compliments the dark whimsical story by Carroll. A full page illustration begins each chapter, numerous small illustrations are interspersed throughout the text, and there is also a two-page beauty in the middle of the book.Would love for Camille Rose Garcia to illustrate Carroll's sequel to this.
