review/summary: honestreview/text: Ten Boom is unflinchingly honest, whether telling of her loving father protecting her from the sin engulfing her native Holland, her disappointment in love, time in a concentration camp for hiding Jews, loss of her sister and father to the camps, her unforgiveness and eventual mercy toward those responsible, her brother's slow descent toward death after the war ended, and her ministry based on the prophetic words of her sister as she lay dying.Reads like a modern saint reminiscent of those listed in Hebrews 11.
