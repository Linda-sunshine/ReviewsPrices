review/summary: Packed with thrillsreview/text: I must admit, James Patterson gets a well round of applause on filling this book with high anticipation and major action. With that being said, I just couldn't get into it as much as I would've liked. Patterson has written a series that does seem hugely interesting, as you meet all of the family members that now live outside of the horrendous school they were once held captive in. Going along the Maximum Ride journey, you will eventually meet all of the characters individually which I love. The problem I had was that there was a little too much action. I love to see my characters at their best, at their worst, and everywhere in between. I felt like there was not a calm moment and I just wanted to see the characters a little more relaxed.We first get to meet Max. She is very compassionate about her younger siblings and guards them as if she is their mother. She would do anything for them, as long as they never return to that school. It's just plain cruel to implant aviary genes into a human mother, only to experiment with the outcome. Even if the outcome is a human. The majority of their DNA is human, with just a touch of bird-like features. That little bit is enough to keep them on the run forever. Max's family can never settle down and get too comfortable. Erasers are always on the lookout. Big, fur-like creatures that resemble werewolves if they choose to. Who couldn't be frightened by something like that?
