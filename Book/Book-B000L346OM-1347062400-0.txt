review/summary: Man's Search for Meaningreview/text: I love the book. That's why I ordered multiple copies for a Sunday School Class study. And at $6 a copy, what could go wrong? The actual books are practically pocket-sized, however, and the print is very small. Besides, the shipping and handling was another $5 per book. So I ended up paying $11 for each of the $6 books. Despite the quality of the contents, maybe not such a good deal this way!
