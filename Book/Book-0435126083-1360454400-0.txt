review/summary: Intriguedreview/text: I didn't think I would finish reading it but my curiosity would allow me to quit. The movie version of Wuthering Heights was deceptive in regards characteristics and behavior of the characters. To love someone can be a beautiful experience but to misuse it like Heathcliff did was horrible and mean.
