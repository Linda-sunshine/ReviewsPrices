review/summary: Keeping Faith is a good readreview/text: This book does a great job of explicating the varying religious and anti-religious perspectives that are currently alive and well in American society. Beyond that, however, as usual, the author humanizes (and avoids demonizing) the various perspectives so that you feel empathy for the characters whose faith journeys may be different from yours. Kudos to Jodi for another great book!
