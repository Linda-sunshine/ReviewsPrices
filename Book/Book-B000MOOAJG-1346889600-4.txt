review/summary: Sounds like todayreview/text: It is interesting that Ann Rand has described the situation as it is today....Obama's re-distribution of wealth, together with his concept of leading from behind, with his emphasis on the 93% of the country as opposed to the 7% who create the jobs and wealth of this country...She was very perceptive.
