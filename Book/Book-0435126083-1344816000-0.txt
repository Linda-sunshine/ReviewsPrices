review/summary: Classic Literature Piecereview/text: After having read Wuthering Heights, I watched the movie. Although the movie was really good for a classic black and white, I must say that the book (like a lot of other book-based movies) was better than the movie. However, the movie did follow the storyline fairly well, unlike most other books. Furthermore, as somber a setting that this book outlines, it is a classic that I will read again. I loved the story, and definitely would suggest this as an educational literature piece.
