review/summary: Sad but Truereview/text: I was glad to be able to read this on my Kindle. We,ofcourse, were to do so in Junior high but yours truly simply read summaries and made up the rest for book reports(sadly). I have learned to enjoy reading of late and my Kindle has a lot to do with it. This is a sad but real depiction of the times and we should all understand from where we've come. The cruelty should never be repeated.I would recommend this book to anyone imterested in the classics and our History. Harriet Beecher Stowe flows and it is easy reading.
