review/summary: So-Soreview/text: If you're looking for a mindless tale of silly adventures and mistakes, this book is for you. However, if you're looking for a book in which you want to find a motive and meaning, don't read this one! Sure, the book is entertaining, but other than that this book is pointless. So for a way to pass the time, choose Huck Finn.
