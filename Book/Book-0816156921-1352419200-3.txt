review/summary: Vaguely enjoyablereview/text: I found this to be, at times an engaging read, but, by the same token, at other times, quite tedious and cumbersome. Bram Stoker's descriptive writing is incredible, however, at times when dipping in during an entry by a character, it was nigh on impossible to decipher which character you were reading from because of a lack of differing registers amongst the characters.All in all, it was enjoyable, but I would advise caution to readers that are easily lost and would have trouble with the older style of language used.
