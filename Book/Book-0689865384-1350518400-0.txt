review/summary: Boring but interesting enoughreview/text: A bit slow but the premise is really interesting. There wasn't much action until the end. There were just a few bits of excitement here and there throughout the book but for the most part I felt most parts went on and on for far too long. I will say that it ended interestingly enough that I want to read the second book.
