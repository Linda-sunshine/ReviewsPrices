review/summary: Wasn't what I expected!review/text: I had heard much about this book but had never (unbelieveably) read anything by Fitzgerald. Decided to start and because of the movie (I plan on seeing) I decided to start with this one. The story was great, the writing spectacular and the outcome unexpected.
