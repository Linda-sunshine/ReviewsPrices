review/summary: Completely Charming to the Very Last Pagereview/text: This book was so heart-warming! It feels as if you know the characters as soon as they are introduced. I love the easy-going and true friendship that Harry, Ron, and Hermione develop as the story continues. The magical events that go on at Hogwarts are thrilling and more than enough to pull me from my own reality into an adventurous, touching, and creative world. I was pulled in immediately, and felt that way until the Very Last page.
