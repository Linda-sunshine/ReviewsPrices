review/summary: classicreview/text: I read this after watching the Disney film and was not disappointed. Enjoyed it immensely a novel well ahead of it's time and gives the reader an even broader perspective of the main character &#34;John Carter&#34;Having never read &#34;Edgar Rice Burroughs&#34; I never knew what I was missing. &#34;SUPERB!&#34;
