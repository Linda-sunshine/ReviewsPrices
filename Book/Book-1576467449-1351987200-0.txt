review/summary: Good, but longreview/text: I am thirteen and chose to read this book from a list for school. The story is good- but the writing is in really old english style and it takes forever to read. I barely got it done in time to get my report finished by the due date (finished sunday and the report is due tuesday. I had three weeks!) However, the story line is really good and it comes together in an interesting way at the end. There were also a couple of exciting parts and unexpected twists to keep you somewhat interested.
