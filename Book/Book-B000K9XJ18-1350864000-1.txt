review/summary: Suspenseful at times but so very easy to solve...review/text: I'm not going to give anything away, but I had this one solved very early in the book. How could the great Jack Reacher and the FBI not be able to figure out this mystery? Honestly, it felt like Lee Child phoned this one in. I hope number five is better.
