review/summary: LOVED IT!review/text: I've seen the movies, read the comics, heard the legend. But never had I read the story. This book was EXCELLENT. I can't believe how the 'hollywood' interpretation and the actual book's story differ. It does drag a little about 3/4 of the way through, but I was completely satisfied when it ended. Excellent.
