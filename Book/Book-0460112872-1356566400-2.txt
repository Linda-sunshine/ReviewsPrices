review/summary: Decent and heartfelt bookreview/text: I think the reason this book is such a great read is the fact that Jane is an amazing and quite easily remarkable character. I chose this novel as an independent reading in my lit class this year and feel that it was a great choice. The book speaks to readers and makes you feel as if you are actually in the story.
