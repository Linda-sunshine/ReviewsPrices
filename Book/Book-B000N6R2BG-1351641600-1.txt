review/summary: My favorite author, but not my favorite bookreview/text: I've read several Jodi Picoult books and consider her one of my favorite authors, but I just didn't enjoy this book like some of the others. It gets bogged down in the middle with religious detail. I understand the need to have it in the story but it just seemed to go on and on. The mother-daughter relationships were very good, as was the relationship between Mariah and the atheist. I was drawn back in before the end, but I did a lot of &#34;skipping ahead&#34; through the middle.
