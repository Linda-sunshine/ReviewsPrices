review/summary: THe Five People You Meet in Heavenreview/text: The Five People You Meet in Heavnen is a very thought provoking book. I liked it a lot. It was read by my book club and the discussions we had at our meeting were very interesting. The book shows how people you knew and also those you had never meet influenced your life It was very thought provoking. Makes you wonder who are the five people you will meet in heaven when you first arrive.
