review/summary: Gone With the Windreview/text: Truly a classic by Margaret Mitchell. This was one book I read and loved since high school days, and that was forty plus years ago. The literary style with its vivid descriptions is excellent - the unforgettable civil war of the late 1800's,the rebuilding of the beautiful Tara estate, and of course the emotional stirrings and passion of both Scarlet O' Hara and Rhett Butler. All these and more bring us back to the good old days and the lessons that we have learned to value through the times.
