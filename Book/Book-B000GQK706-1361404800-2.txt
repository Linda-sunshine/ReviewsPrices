review/summary: LOTR Reviewreview/text: The Lord of the rings books obviously have an allure to them that is garnered only to a certain set of books and authors. I had read the series previously when I was in junior high but I don't think I was able to get as much out of them as I would have liked. I was to young and a lot of it went over my head. I chose to read them again because I wanted to pick up on these details and I had also just read the hobbit. As for the story Tolkien writes a masterpiece, a volume of books that are cherished with good reason.even when there are like in the action, Tolkien 's prose keeps the reader actively engaged.
