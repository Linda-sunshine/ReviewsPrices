review/summary: Makes you thinkreview/text: I really liked this book, so much that I read it in 2 days. I wouldn't say this book it well written in terms of literature but I have to say the content of it really makes you think about life and heaven. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has the belief that there is something more to life and wants to read about another's opinion. Really nice read.
