review/summary: for reluctant readersreview/text: I thought this was a book just for middle schooler males. I now use if for reluctant readers at senior level. That is, right after I convince them the newspapers are written at sixth grade level for those of us who are in a hurry, or get bored easily. There are a lot of lessons in life besides wilderness that come out of this book.
