review/summary: Interestingreview/text: Growing up with Oscar,I had read this as a youth and seen the film, but obviously the original book was much better. The concept is fascinating as a man's cruelty shows only in the face of the painting, while he retains his youth. This version is shorter than the original, but still maintains the grist of the story. A quick, but enjoyable read.
