review/summary: READ DESCRIPTION CAREFULLYreview/text: i really really liked this book when we had to read it for school back in 10th grade. we only had to read the abridged version (which was kick ass) so i went for the unabridged to see what it was all about....long story short i'm never going to know. this thing is longer than a dictionary. as in over a thousand pages. an amazing story but if i re-read it i'll go with the abridged version. ive never heard of a book that had me thinking "yeah, i'd read 1100 pages of that"
