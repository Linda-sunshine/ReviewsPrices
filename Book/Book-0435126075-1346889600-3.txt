review/summary: Pride and Prejudice Classicreview/text: Watched the pbs version of the book then watched the new version of the movie, so I figured I better read the book. The book keeps you entertained as you picture each chapter in your head. Normally when I watch a movie before a book I get disappointed when I get around to reading it, but in this case the book gives a lot of depth to the characters, which makes it one of the few books turned into movies where I would recommend watching the movie first.
