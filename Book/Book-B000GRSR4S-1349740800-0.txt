review/summary: Strangely compelling; vaguely misogynisticreview/text: This is the first Vonnegut novel I've read so I didn't know what to expect. Strange book but I'll say this--I read it in one sitting because it's so odd, it kept me curious to see what the author would do next. My main reading diet is thrillers and nonfiction--not much literary fiction. Slaughterhouse Five is an odd combo of literary fiction and sci-fi.Overall: fascinating; intriguing; keeps you thinking for a while after reading. On the other hand, this book has a consciously inflated sense of self-importance and a vague atmosphere of misogyny. It's billed as a compelling anti-war novel. Well, it is anti-war, I suppose, but the protagonist is so pathetic that his failure as a soldier seems to reflect his failure in life as a whole. If you want an anti-war novel, tryAll Quiet on the Western Front.
