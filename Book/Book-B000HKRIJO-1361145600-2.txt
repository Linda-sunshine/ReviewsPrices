review/summary: Thought provoking writingreview/text: This was the first C.S Lewis piece I had ever read, and it was compelling. He put a spin on the whole realm of Christianity unlike anything I've read before. Some of the chapters were a bit difficult to absorb, so I reread them and it started to make more sense. Lewis doesn't claim to know all the answers about being a Christian, but he certainly makes a good case for why we should all give Christianity a chance.
