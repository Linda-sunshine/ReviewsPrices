review/summary: Must-Readreview/text: The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts is a great book at helping to understand that we all express and receive love in certain ways (languages). This book goes into five different love languages that people use to give and receive love.I wish I would have read this book prior to my marriage. I would have been more likely to see that my wife and I were not communicating in each other's love languages very well.I will probably be purchasing this book again as I constantly have it out on loan to friends/family. I may buy several copies to give as wedding gifts and also for friends whose relationships are going through testing times...I strongly recommend this book for anyone and everyone. It helps in relationships other than romantic as well.
