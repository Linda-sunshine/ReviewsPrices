review/summary: My favorite read!review/text: Lynn Austin's books are ALL great but this series is my most favorite. It's exciting, scary, sad and biblical even though it is fictional. In fact, it drives you to the Bible to check out her historical facts. I felt all the emotions that the characters felt. I wish she would write more biblical fiction. She makes it all come alive!
