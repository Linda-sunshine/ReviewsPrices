review/summary: Capitalismreview/text: Dagny runs the family railroad. Government imposes control over successful businesses. Economic conditions worsen as a byproduct of gov control. Dagny and Hank, steel magnate, fall in love. Who is John Galt? becomes the sarcastic response to questions with no point. Society is reborn celebrating individual achievement and enlightened self-interest (i.e., without gov control).
