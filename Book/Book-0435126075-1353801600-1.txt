review/summary: best book ever!!!review/text: This is in my opinion the best book ever written. Having read the other excellent reviews here there is really nothing i can add except to say that i love Jane Austen and everything she wrote, and that Pride and prejudice is my favourite book of all time. I am an avid reader and i enjoy most genres, but Pride and Prejudice is the only novel i have read again and again over the years. Brilliant!
