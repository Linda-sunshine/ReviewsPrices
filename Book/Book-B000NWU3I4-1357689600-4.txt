review/summary: Delightful prelude to &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34;review/text: I read &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; first but wished I had read the &#34;Hobbit&#34; first. Altho &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; gives background as to how Baggins found the ring, the &#34;Hobbit&#34; gives a much greater in depth view to the whole adventure. JRR Tolkien has a fabulous imagination and the ability to bring his imagination to life in the pages. A wonderfully delightful book for kids of all ages.
