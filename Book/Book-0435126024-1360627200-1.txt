review/summary: Just One of Our True Classicsreview/text: I have to admit this is the first time I've read &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; although I've seen it on tv many times. If you haven't read &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; THIS IS A MUST. I have favored the 1800's setting in England for most of my reading literature and this book DID NOT disappoint me.
