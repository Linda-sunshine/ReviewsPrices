review/summary: Great read with lots of longevityreview/text: I started reading this book and was hooked. The character of Ignatius J. Reilly is like so many people I (have had the misfortune to?) know, and really speaks to readers... I did find myself becoming more irritable--but I think that's just because I was so inspired. A fantastic book, I highly recommend.
