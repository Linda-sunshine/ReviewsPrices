review/summary: Such an amazing bookreview/text: This classic is an amazing piece. Lewis Carroll managed to create a whole world of strange yet beautiful things with his quite brilliant imagination. Wonderland is such a brilliant place and I could feel myself there throughout the entire length of the story.
