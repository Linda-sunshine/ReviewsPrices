review/summary: Revisiting and old love.review/text: I first read &#34;The Hobbit&#34; in the early sixties - yes, that long ago. I loved it then, and just as much now. I especially enjoy having it on my Kindle, so I can maintain the contact. The Book is as good now as it was then. Unfortunately the artwork is almost invisible in the Kindle format, a great disappointment. Otherwise it would have got five stars for the beautifully crafted story, the heartfelt character development, and the wonderful scenery.
