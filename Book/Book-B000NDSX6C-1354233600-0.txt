review/summary: A classicreview/text: I bought this in anticipation of the upcoming movie because I heard that they are going to break it down into 3 movies. I couldn't believe that they were going to stretch this book into three movies. I don't want to be sidetracked so I'll keep the review to this book. If you read The Lord of the Rings this is a great pre-LOTR book that has the same adventure that you see from the trilogy.
