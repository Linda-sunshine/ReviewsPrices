review/summary: 1984... kind of depressingreview/text: I bought this book about 3 weeks ago and I'm still "trying" to read it. It's depressing and the theme is kind of old, so I'm not that enthusiast with it. I was born abroad and this was not a required reading material while I was in school. I'm just very happy that I've never lived in a place like that. Hope it gets better towards the end.
