review/summary: A timeless American classicreview/text: This classic novel by Harper Lee is about a young girl, Jean Louise Finch (nicknamed "Scout"), growing up in Depression-era Alabama with her widowed lawyer father, Atticus Finch, and her older brother, Jem. The story vividly describes race relations in the South in the 1930s. The novel describes how Atticus's decision to take on a controversial rape case affects the family's relationships with the townspeople in their hometown, fictional Maycomb, Alabama. The novel also describes Scout's struggles in growing up such as dealing with school and her curiosity about a mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley. One of the best parts of the novel was Atticus Finch giving the closing argument in the rape trial. Atticus states that, in the eyes of the law, everyone is equal. The novel was published in 1960 during the Civil Rights Movement. Harper Lee was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the novel, and it was made into a 1962 motion picture starring Gregory Peck.
