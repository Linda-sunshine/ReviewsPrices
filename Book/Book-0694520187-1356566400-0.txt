review/summary: Is this really one of the "Great American Novels"?review/text: The introduction to my edition says that Moby Dick is regarded as one of the "Great American Novels", along with Tom SawyerI wonder how many readers have actually completed Moby Dick which is extremely drawn out, with the first whale not even appearing until almost page 300.It gets off to a good start with its famous opening line - "Call me Ishmael" - and introduces the reader to the whaling town of New Bedford and the members of the doomed expedition about to set off in pursuit of the white whale, led by the insane captain Ahab.There are plenty of well-drawn characters and the tension between Ahab and his officers and the relationship between Ishmael and the harpooner Queequeg is convincing.Some parts are even quite amusing but, once afloat, Melville spends too much time sidetracking. He tells sailors' stories and presents dull factual detail in a documentary way about different types of whale, ships, ropes, harpoons etc.This interrupts and overshadows the flow of the narrative such an extent that I became impatient and gave up two-thirds of the way through.
