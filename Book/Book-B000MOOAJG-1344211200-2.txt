review/summary: The Philosophy of Capitalismreview/text: This book is a book about war.It's an action novel - a thriller, almost, with as many ups and downs and plot twists and romance as any good adventure story. And while the war is not a militant one, it endures as one that takes place on a battlefield of economics and ideals, values and work ethics, people and production. The characters are heroes and villains. There is good, and there is evil. But these never appear in the way that one expects when first diving in to Atlas Shrugged. And of course, there is the eternal mystery: Who is John Galt?Ayn Rand has created a hefty read, to be sure: 1168 pages of solid text. But the prose is like poetry; she transforms the sweaty, gritty workplace of steam and fire and coal into the masterful beauty of creation at work. The ideas are the embodiment of philosophical perfection; her interpretation of the true values of Capitalism would leave even Adam Smith breathless. Rand captures the romanticism of production at its purest, and then tears out your heart when the evils of the world raze that beauty to the ground.Overall, a superbly excellent read. Strongly recommended for the intellectual, the romantic, the economist, or just the curious reader.These characters and the story they tell will stay with you to your old age. And, if you allow it, Rand will renew your faith in capitalism - as it was meant to be.
