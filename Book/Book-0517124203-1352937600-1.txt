review/summary: Alice in Wonderlandreview/text: Despite the many films made from Alice's adventures this is one of those books that, adult or juvenile, can read periodically for the original story as well as seeing how well the language has been used. There are many references to English men and the foibles of the period but these do no harm to the story.
