review/summary: Timeless classic with timeless moralsreview/text: I remember reading this book as a child and I remember Jo as being my favourite. I can't believe I haven't changed my mind about that. It is stunning in that it has so many words I had to look up. Such a shame that novelists today are discouraged to use such language. It is easy enough to read and I would imagine it would be a great one to read to young girls piecemeal on holidays. I really enjoyed it.
