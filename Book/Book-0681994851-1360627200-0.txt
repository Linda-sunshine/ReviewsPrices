review/summary: Missing chapter 25review/text: While I love this book and have reread it many times, I had to give it a low rating because the ebook is missing chapter 25. My daughter downloaded it for required reading for school and luckily noticed the oversight. I pulled out my well worn paperback so she was able to continue but be aware if you plan on downloading this book.
