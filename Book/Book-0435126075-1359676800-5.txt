review/summary: Perfect depiction of social views & behaviours in the erareview/text: It's a classic, no two words about it. But most of all, it brings to mind the author (Jane Austen) who managed to intertwine her own experiences into this book (the movie 'Becoming Jane' is worth seeing on the occasion).Brilliant language, captivating dialogs and complexity of feelings.
