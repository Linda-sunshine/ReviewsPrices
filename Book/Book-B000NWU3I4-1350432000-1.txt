review/summary: My all time favorite bookreview/text: I love The Hobbit. I love the way Tolkien writes. I am rereading this book for the 4th time in anticipation of the movie. This edition of the book is great. It's sturdy, has great binding and is actually a lot more light weight than it looks. I have the same edition of The Lord Of The Rings in red leather with a red leather slipcase and that book is like a dumbbell. Granted, that book is a lot bigger in content and page count, but it's noticeably heavier than its predecessor. I like that the Hobbit is a shorter book and more light hearted in content than Lord Of The Rings. I loved the Rankin/Bass cartoon Hobbit movie, I just love the characters and the story. Traveling through Middle Earth to reclaim treasure from a Dragon is just a great idea for a book. It's so well written, the songs, the poems, the riddles in the dark. This isn't just a children's book as it was once originally thought of, this is a benchmark for modern literature and fantasy. So many pieces of fantasy that I have grown up with and been a fan of have borrowed from this book, and Tolkien's ideas and creations. And for good reason. This and The Lord of the Rings I think are two of the best books of the 20th century, and two of the best books ever written. The Hobbit is my all-time favorite book. If you haven't read it yet, you need to. This edition comes with great illustrations and a decent map to follow the protagonists on their journey to the Lonely Mountain to steal back the dwarven treasure from the great worm Smaug, the Dragon. This is my most highly recommended book to anyone who likes literature or fantasy writing. And this is definitely the best edition you can get, especially for the price.
