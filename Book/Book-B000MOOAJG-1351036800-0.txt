review/summary: Atlas Sruggedreview/text: This film looks like an abstract of World's bestseller of Ayn Rand "Atlas Shrugged". It is very actual at these time, when Americans have to understand how dangerous the Marxism's ideas which Obama tries to put into practice. Unfortunately,the love story was done very short.I'm waiting for the next parts of this move.
