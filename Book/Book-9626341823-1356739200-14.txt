review/summary: Great classic for Christmasreview/text: Until now, I had only known this story thru the Disney version. I'm happy to finally understand the full depth of Dickens' intent. This version was easy to read with only a couple typos or words I couldn't understand. No wonder this is such a classic, and forever will be!
