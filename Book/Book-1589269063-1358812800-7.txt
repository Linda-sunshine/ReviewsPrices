review/summary: This is worthy of a readreview/text: The author knows his subject and I would agree that if couples could learn each other's preferences in the way of emotional needs you could only be better together. There is no groundbreaking here, at the same time, I felt like the book had a lot to offer because it does focus on the importance of being in tune with our partner's needs.
