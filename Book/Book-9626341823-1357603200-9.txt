review/summary: A delightful classic for both young and oldreview/text: Written by the celebrated Charles Dickens, it regales the tale of the disagreeable and anti-Christmas Mr Ebenezer Scrooge as he meets the three Spirits of Christmas as they endeavour to correct the errors of his ways. Though it has plenty of challenging vocabulary, I highly recommend this book to eager readers ages 11 and above as a quick and enjoyable read.
