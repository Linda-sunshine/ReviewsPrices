review/summary: Loved this book!review/text: I didn't really know what this book was about when I started it but was desperately looking for a new book to read. Based on some good recommendations I tried it out and was not disappointed! Felt a little lost at first but once the story got going it was great. So interesting, and the ending has a nice twist
