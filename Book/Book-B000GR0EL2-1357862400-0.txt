review/summary: A must-read for anyone interested in historyreview/text: This was a great book. I bought it for the history aspect. Have always wanted to know the stories of those who were Christians and how they responded to the persecution of the Jews. I learned so much about how they lived their faith. It encouraged me as a believer.
