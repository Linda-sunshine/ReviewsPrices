review/summary: Still one of my personal favoritesreview/text: "Gatsby" is still one of my personal favorites. IMHO it is one of the great American novels, and one of the best American novels to tell the story of a particular class of people in any era out there. In this case, the era is The Roaring Twenties and the class of people that the novel deals with is the extremely wealthy. It was definitely an interesting era and "The Great Gatsby" is the novel that stands tall above all the other novels to deal with this subject matter.Jay Gatsby is a man of mystery and intrigue. Women fall at his feet. He supposedly went to Oxford. He hangs out with the man who fixed the 1919 Chicago White Sox World Series. Nobody really knows how he makes his money or how he made his fortune, but he apparently started from scratch. He throws outlandish parties that all sorts of rich and famous people who do not know him come to. People clamor to be on the list to his parties but do not know him.These people are portrayed as shallow, brittle, vain. They have come by their money, but they care not whom the victims are along the road or in the path ahead. Just so they can hold on to their claim to fame. Anything, so that they can maintain their lifestyle. Society is disposable, people come and go, they live and die. It really does not have anything to do with them, does it darling?What happens in the novel is really of no concern, also. This is profound, but it makes "Gatsby" the novel that it is. "Gatsby" is the first book in "The Big Read" for Wichita, KS. this year (2012). The contest for it is to re-write the ending in so-many-words-or-less. This, too is very interesting, because the novel could have a number of differnt endings. It makes one wonder how many possible endings F. Scott Fitzgerald had.Cam
