review/summary: This book gave me a touch of mental illnessreview/text: At first I had no idea how to rate this book. At first thought I wanted to say that I absolutely despised it . But that would imply that it was poorly written, which it was not. Or that it was tedious or slow paced which is also untrue. I tried to think of all the attributes of a bad book. Did it lack originality? Was it flat and factual, unable to illicit the pathos associated with a good novel? Was I unable to immerse myself in the world? To all this I have to unequivocally deny. So in point of fact by all acceptable standards this is a wonderful novel. Which I absolutely despised. I hated everything about this world. I wanted to go into this world with a hatchet and murder people. The utter humiliation of being a woman here stuck in my throat. Trying to type this over coffee on a tablet, I will not get into specifics. But I have spent a little over a day reading this and feeling sick with indignation . And a little bit depressed. And I could not put it down.
