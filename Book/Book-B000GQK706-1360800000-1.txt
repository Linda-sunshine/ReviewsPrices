review/summary: Beautiful, but flawed.review/text: Tolkien was always first and foremost a professor, so the fact that these books often feel more like history books is not surprising. They are nothing short of genius in the world they build, but the characters are often bland and hard to care much for, and the dialogue is often dull. They are great books, definitely, and basically created the high fantasy genre, but they are not perfect.
