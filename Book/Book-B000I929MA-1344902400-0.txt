review/summary: Disappointingreview/text: After reading the reviews I really thought this was going to be an interesting book. But unfortunately the story just didn't go into depth as much as expected. I kept on hoping that the story was going to take some unexpected turning, or something spectacular was going to happen.....but then it didn't. Especially the ending was really disappointing. It just stops... and you have to read in the prologue what might have happened or might not have. It had the potential to be a really good and interesting book. The storyline is fantastic, just filling in the storyline with a good story was disappointing.It just wasn't my cup of tea, I'm sorry for the people who liked it so much.
