review/summary: An edition worth keepingreview/text: I'll admit that I've had a hard time getting into.The Hobbit several times over the years. This is finally an edition that feels right. You want to bend the soft leather cover and crack open the pages with a hunger for both the atmosphere the design provides as well as the warm humor of this.treasured story. Ultimately you will forget all the times fans and teachers have tried to cram this classic down your throat, look for a toasty spot by the fireplace, snuggle in ,and lose yourself for hours in both the unassuming adventure of the story and the.delicious feel of the book.Indulge;)
