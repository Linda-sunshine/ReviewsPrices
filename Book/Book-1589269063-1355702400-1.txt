review/summary: Fantastic!review/text: This is a fantastic book for anyone struggling in relationships. It's completely change the way I see my wife and children. It sheds a lot of light on why we can't seem to effectively communicate with one another sometimes. My wife is just starting to read it now. I think it's going to make a big difference in our marriage. I highly recommend this book!
