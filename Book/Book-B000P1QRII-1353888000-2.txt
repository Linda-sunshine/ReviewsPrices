review/summary: Good book but definitely for young adultsreview/text: I first read this book ages ago, but we selected it for a quick read for our monthly book club this month. Somehow, I forgot that it was a "young adult" book so had to keep that in mind while I read it. It's a very short book, and very thought-provoking, but not incredibly engaging. Although I enjoyed the story and definitely recommend it, it wasn't an overly-exciting page-turner for me. I think it would be wonderful for a parent to read along with their young teenager. It reveals a very interesting societal concept and I think would open up quite a few channels for real-world communication for a parent/"child".(Would give it 4-stars for young-adult readers.)Good read - just make sure you remember its literary level and target audience while reading and you'll enjoy it!
