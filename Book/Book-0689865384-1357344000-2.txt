review/summary: Let me Downreview/text: This book's plotline was irrisistably appealing, yet for the amount of potential it held I was sourly dissapointed. The idea behind the story was pure brilliance, and of course I fell for the boy- how could I not? He led me through the novel and towards the sequel (which honestly proved itself to be equally unimpressive).The main character failed to move me, I usually take to girls instantly, yet something in her voice was frustrating, dull, and almost incomplete. I think it was the way all of her thoughts were so superficially oriented-the time it took for her to open her eyes was painstaking. Nothing was as deep as it could have been, and unimportant things were unnessicarily elaborated upon.I don't know&#8230;I really hate bashing a sucessful book, but the writing was in truth one of the greatest let downs I have ever encountered. Everyone's self orientation almost drove me to abandoning the book out of frustration. Unwillingness to accept that everything you grew up believing was a lie is understandable. Still, when someone continues their completely oblivious mindset even as truth stares them in the face (in the form of a cute guy)&#8230; as I said, its frustrating.
