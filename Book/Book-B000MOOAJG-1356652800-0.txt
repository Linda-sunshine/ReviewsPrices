review/summary: Atlas Shruggedreview/text: This book opened my eyes even wider to ideas I already held. While much of the technology is dated by the date of publication, it can easily be applied to todays political and social problems. I think that the story, while exaggerated in scope, points out the fundamental failing of our current welfare system, where the people have discovered that they can simply &#34;vote&#34; themselves a benefit, without concern for how that benefit will be funded. I am happy to be a 'maker' and not a 'taker.'
