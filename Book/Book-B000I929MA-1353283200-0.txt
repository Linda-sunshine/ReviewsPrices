review/summary: slowreview/text: I picked it up because of an article about it being banned for high school. The reasons it was being considered banned, adult content, I have not really found to be the case, but I do not think it is a good book for a high school student. Mainly it is very slow and boring. The main characters life is boring and the author does a good job bringing that across in the book. When you have nothing to do for most of the day you tend to day dream or fall back on old memories and that is what a great majority of the book does. It makes for an interesting read if you can get past the slowness and the constant flash back to a better time.
