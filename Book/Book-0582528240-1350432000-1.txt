review/summary: Just Okreview/text: I picked up this book as it's considered one of the most famous American Classic novels.I might say I'm a little disappointed in it, or maybe my hopes were too high going into the novel.First of all, is this book racist? well, it can go either way, depends on how you interpret it. I like the way Twain humanized Jim and goes in depth about his friendship with Huck. Yes, there are a lot of stereotypes in it, especially the way Jim talks and the over use of the N-word. We have to keep in mind that this book was written in 1885.My biggest problem with the book is the ending. I find the ending anti-climatic, or in other words boring. I would have given the book a 4 stars if it wasn't for the last few chapters. For me, it all started going downhill once Huck meets up with Tom Sawyer and they start scheming about getting Jim out.Regardless, this book is a part of American history and should not be censored out. I can definitely see how one would find it offensive and racist, but it is what it is.I think this book is worth reading as the book does have it's charm but definitely not one of those must reads.
