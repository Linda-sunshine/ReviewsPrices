review/summary: A Classic Must-Read for Christmasreview/text: This is such a famous and beloved story that there is little need to critique it. The Kindle version remains true to the original. There is not much sense in complaining about a free download, but it would have been nice if the table of contents featured the original five &#34;staves&#34; or chapters. Instead, you must start at the beginning and go from there. A great bargain!
