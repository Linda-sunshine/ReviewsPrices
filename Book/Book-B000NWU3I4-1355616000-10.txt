review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: The first time I read The Hobbit was many years ago, and I decided I would like to read again before watching the move. I didn&#8217;t remember much about it except that I quite enjoyed it as a young child. This time I also enjoyed reading it, but to a lesser degree.Perhaps the best thing about The Hobbit is that it sets the stage of how Bilbo Baggins came to possess the Ring of Power, relating the necessary background for The Lord of the Rings. My main issue with The Hobbit is that it was, as opposed to The Lord of the Rings, specifically written for children. The plot is very predictable and told in a fairly childish manner, and lacks the more mature style of The Lord of the Rings.
