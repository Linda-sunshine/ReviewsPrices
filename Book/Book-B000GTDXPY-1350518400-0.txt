review/summary: A Fun Readreview/text: At times I laughed hard enough to spill my tea. We've all had one of those days but the lead character seems to be having that kind of life. It was a great escape from the drudgery of daily life. I even read a few chapters while struggling through the drudgery of housework (Though, in hindsight, I don't recommend reading and vacuuming). A fun mystery with just enough red herrings for speed bumps and just enough nervous tension to keep you up past bedtime. I look forward to another offering in the future.
