review/summary: Most enjoyable, easy baby read so far.review/text: I am currently still pregnant with my first child, so I cannot comment on the effectiveness of the techniques in this book. However, I was so impressed with the writing and the presentation of the material in this book that I am going to give it 5 stars. I also hope that the baby-calming methods are as effective as the book was easy to read.This book (and its DVD companion) were recommended to me by my OBGYN, and friends with and WITHOUT children! I considered this book a must-read. However, I am a skeptical reader and wary of pop trends in baby care and parenting. This book is none of that - or if it is, it's because the methodology is popular because IT SEEMS TO WORK.The writing IS repetitive. However, I did not find this a minus in terms of really learning the methods in this book. Repetition means that by the time you've finished this book, you know by heart, for sure, what the 5 S's are, and how to properly implement them. For those of us with pregnancy brain, or for parents operating on little sleep, the repetition is necessary.My main criticism of this book is the goofy font that is used for the anecdotal stories. In the paperback version, it's a small point size, thick, and not at all easy to read. The illustrations are a little silly and somewhat hard to follow in some cases, but I imagine the DVD makes up for some of this. Otherwise, this is a well-written, common-sense book and I intend to keep mine - with dog-ears - until that fourth trimester is over!!
