review/summary: Loved The Book, Disappointing Dramatizationreview/text: No doubt The Hobbit is classic work of literature. Unfortunately, this dramatization (as with the related Lord of the Rings Dramatization) suffer from three problems:1. Recording Quality. This is a simple technical issue, but the audio mix is atrocious. Voice levels are unmodulated rendering many passages inaudible even with your volume set to 11. Much of the dialogue is muddy at best. Just hearing what is being said is extremely challenging.2. Dramatization, Not a Reading. This is not a book on tape, it is a re-written interpretation of the original. It relies almost exclusively on dialogue to tell the story. The original story is driven and paced by Tolkien's beautiful description of locations, thoughts, feeling and atmosphere, so cutting all that out is akin to selling a dramatization of the Mona Lisa under the verbal description of "a portrait of woman in the country" - it just utterly falls short.3. Gaps. Wow. They have simply edited out huge plot-line swaths of the story. Enormous chunks are neither alluded to or explained.To riff on Lucas - This is not the story you are looking for.
