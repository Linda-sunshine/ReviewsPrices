review/summary: Yet another positive reviewreview/text: This is the first of the Harry Potter books. I liked it when i first read it, way back when. unfortunately, I was grown before I read the series, and wish I'd have met Harry and crew when I was younger. Oh well.Great characters. I found this volume, perhaps, one of the weaker. It's villain is not quite as dark and scary as Rowling will provide us with later. But I really enjoy her jokes. And the completely consistent way she creates a fantasy world that interfaces with the modern Muggle world in a way that makes reality -- especially questions of good and evil, like being a good friend and questioning authority versus passively succumbing to the establishment.
