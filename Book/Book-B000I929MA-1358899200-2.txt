review/summary: One of Margaret Atwood's best.review/text: I love Margaret Atwood and The Handmaid's Tale is one of her best. She is a master of dystopian fiction. In the current political climate where we actually have elected officials &#34;redefining rape&#34; this book is a must read for everyone over the age of 16.
