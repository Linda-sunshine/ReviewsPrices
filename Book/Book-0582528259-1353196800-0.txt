review/summary: Rich and compelling, even for a dude!review/text: Jane Eyre is the story about a young daughter in England who lost her parents and was taken in by her affluent but abusive relatives. Jane Eyre is a curious, intelligent and emotionally volatile girl, who we witness grow up into a woman, seeking to make connections with the world around her. There are so many great elements to this story that, considering how long ago it was written, seem novel and suggestive of feminism. Jane Eyre does not take crap from anyone, and is very honest, candid and assertive about this. She is devoted to making a life for herself without anyone else's help. She listens to her instincts, and let them guide her through the course of her life, not matter what the perceived cost may be.I found this story compelling. Even though the subject matter wasn't gripping or exhilarating, the manner in which it was written was enough to keep me interested every page of the way. The word choice and flow were so well done that I feel like I'm floating down the stream of consciousness that the author expertly disseminates through her passion and skill. Very rarely do I feel so brought into a story principally through its substance. This book is well worth the read!
