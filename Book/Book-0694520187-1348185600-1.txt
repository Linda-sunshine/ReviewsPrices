review/summary: The novel of all novelsreview/text: This is the quintessential novel of fiction. Herman Melville invites the reader to plunge the depths into every facet of whaling, ships, mortal man, and beasts of the sea. Such details are found in no other novel. But, from the start, I know that I am routing for the beast, Moby Dick. The sea is his home first and foremost, and this most intelligent mammal will outwit man, in man's quest for revenge.
