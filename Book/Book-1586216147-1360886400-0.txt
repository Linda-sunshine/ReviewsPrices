review/summary: wow just WOWreview/text: The notebook is easily my favorite Nicholas Sparks book. He wrote about a passion that never dies and that you will always remember your first love, even if it was in your teens. If you've read any of his books already or just want a really romantic book that you'll probably read in only a few hours this is an amazing choice! The notebook is about Noah and Allie who shared a summer love that they never forgot. Days before Allie`s wedding she has to go back to see Noah before she can marry Jon, a very successful businessman, so she makes an unannounced arrival to visit Noah. Who will Allie decide to marry? She makes a riveting choice and she shares a life with the man she truly loves. I can guarantee that this story will stay with you forever. (And if it doesn't I'm sorry I thought this was a wonderful book and I know it will stay with me forever)
