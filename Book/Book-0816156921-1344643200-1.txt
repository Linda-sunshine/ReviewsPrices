review/summary: Draculareview/text: I was just after buying the Amazon Kindle and saw that Bram Stroker's Dracula novel was free on the kindle so i decided too download it as it was my first book. I am still reading it a the moment and so far it is a brillant book and would recommend it to anyone who likes reading that sort stuff.
