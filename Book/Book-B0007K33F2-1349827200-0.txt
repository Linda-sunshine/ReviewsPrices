review/summary: Loved it!review/text: This is beautiful writing. I absolutely love this book, and I love the story. I'm not sure which version I read, it had a lot of French in it, and it was not an easy read. But worth it. I might get an easier version and read it again.The writing style is like poetry.Edmond Dantes` is wrongly imprisoned from accusations made by people he trust. When he escapes, he seeks revenge, one of the best revenge stories ever written.I do have one complaint; I read this after seeing and loving the movie (2002, Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce). The movie didn't quite follow the book. I hate to say this, because it does not happen often, I liked the movie better than the book. But definitely a must read. If you haven't seen the movie or read the book, I suggest you read the book first, and then see the movie. I wish I had gone in that order.
