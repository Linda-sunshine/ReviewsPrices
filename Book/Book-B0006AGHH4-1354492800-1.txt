review/summary: Happy With This Find.review/text: This is a classic book and my cousin wanted to read it. He lives in a senior facility. I didn't want to spend an arm and leg to get this book for him. The book wasn't listed as perfect and it wasn't. Some of the pages were shorter than the rest of the book but it did not effect the reading because all the words on the pages were there. I was pleased with my purchase and the service from this company. My cousin enjoyed reading this book.
