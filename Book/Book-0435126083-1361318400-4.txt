review/summary: Breathtaking Contempt for Booksreview/text: After a years of putting up with Amazon's breathtaking contempt for books, I have to say something here. The reason there are "1,000" reviews of the Norton Critical Fourth Edition of Wuthering Heights is that Amazon is dumping all the reviews of any edition of Wuthering Heights into one worthless jumble. Note that the initial description of "the book" is actually a detailed review of an Audio CD version referred to as an adequate abridgement. If you click on the book image in hopes of at least looking at the table of contents, you are taken to "another edition," which turns out to be some high school class knockoff lacking even an introduction. Want to know what's inside the NCE Fourth? Too bad.It is routine at Amazon to not bother with copyright dates, so if you sort an author's work "by publication" you get the most recent printing, not the order of publication. Try finding a chronologically ordered list of a mystery series here. Would it be hard to create one? Of course not. But who cares? Not Amazon.Where this database slovenliness get criminal is when Amazon piles together British and U.S. editions of an author's work with no indication that a "new title" is actually the U.K. title of a book already available in the U.S. (Carol O'Connell's Magic Men is Shell Game, Find Me is Shark Music, etc.). The luckless shopper ends up with a duplicate title and shipping charges up the wazoo. Even worse is the conflation of prints of classic films, where a review of a blurry knockoff edition of Seven Samurai gets a top listed review that praises the sharp quality of the DVD and fails to mention that the review refers to the pricey Criterion edition. Buyer beware.Oh 20 words about WH: Bronte's novel is one of the greatest achievements of 19th C British fiction. Her use of the "unreliable narrator" is brilliant.
