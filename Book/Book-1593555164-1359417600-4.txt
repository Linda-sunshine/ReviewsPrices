review/summary: One Shotreview/text: As always, Lee Child outdoes himself, this is a great story with an excellent and twisted plot. It was interesting to meet some of his old flames and not so good friends. The legend lives on in Indiana, snipers and DA's and cops, not to forget the rookie lawyer.What I cannot understand is how Tom Cruise could be hired to act as Reacher in the movie? I mean how high are his built up shoes going to be?However that knowledge does not detract from the excellent plot at all.Look forward to the next in the series Lee!
