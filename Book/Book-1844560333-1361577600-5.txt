review/summary: Check it off the listreview/text: Must admit that I only read it so that I can say that it is done. I found this a bit slow. All character development and gossip and very little action. Some people love it, just not me. Side note: I read it using the kindle app on my iPad and didn't have any of the problems mentioned with font size and spacing that some others mentioned.
