review/summary: Worst. Book. Evah.review/text: I call this the worst book ever, but that's largely an assumption on my part. Perhaps an extrapolation. I have not read all of the books ever written. But this book is horrid.If you are a tween girl, this might be a good book for you, though. If your dream fella is one of those dark and broody types, the kind that seems mysterious but turns out to be just a basic kind of jerk. It's a shame that some people find this book romantic. The dark, disturbed guy in this book is called Garfield and he's a lousy person.If you like this time period for fiction, you should try Anne Bronte. She wrote two fantastic books. But avoid Charlotte Bronte. She, too, is a terrible writer.Full disclosure: I do not know Emily Bronte, nor would I care to.
