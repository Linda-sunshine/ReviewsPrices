review/summary: CLASSICreview/text: I find it rather funny, the reviewers who are compelled to recap this story in their reviews. If you don't know about the story of Bilbo Baggins yet, just buy the book and read it. You won't be disappointed. My mother read this story to me at bedtime one chapter at a time and it's been branded into my DNA ever since. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is fantastic, but my favorite story of the lot is this one. Just classic.
