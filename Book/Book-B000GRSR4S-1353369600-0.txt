review/summary: The older I get, the more astute this book is...review/text: I find the way it zips around in time to be exactly how my mind works, now that I'm over 60... I often can't remember which jacket to look for -- mixing up memories of jackets from years back, for example.Am I approaching Alzheimer's? I know they tend to remember past events more clearly than recent ones -- which is how this book is, as well. I don't think that was understood yet when he wrote it.
