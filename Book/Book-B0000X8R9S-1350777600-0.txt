review/summary: Survival Adventurereview/text: Can you imagine being stranded in the Canadian woods all by yourself? Well a 13 year old kid named Brian Robeson was in a plane crash and stranded in the Canadian woods. The reason he was there was because of his parents' divorce which made the two separate, one in Canada and the other in New York. The secret was what caused the divorce, even though his father does not know about the secret, Brian hopes to tell his father when he sees him. Brian was going to visit his dad in the Canadian oil fields on a plane and something happened to the pilot. While stranded Brian faced many challenges to survive in the dangerous Canadian woods with only his hatchet his mother gave him and his thoughts. This is a great adventure book and I recommend it to people who like adventures.
