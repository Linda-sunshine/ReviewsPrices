review/summary: An important readreview/text: I finished this book oh a train ride moving from New Orleans after staying there a year. I think living in the city made the book come alive for me. I didn't like the style of writing and I had a hard time picturing the characters, but it was such an enjoyable and important read. I don't know how to explain the importance of it other than to say it's on a personal level. I plan on rereading it another 1 or 2 times so I can find a better way of expressing myself about this book.
