review/summary: Real grab you and pull you in thrillerreview/text: Have to say that Lee Child is one of the best out there at the moment. His Jack Reacher hero is just the type of guy you want to read about. He's the guy all guys wanna be! You can start anywhere in the series with the Jack Reacher novels and they're all excellent. One Shot is a great read and really pulls you in from the start. Well done to Lee Child again. Just keep em comin and send Jack to Europe soon! The way you describe the US is spot on and would love to see your skill used to describe cities and landscapes close to home (yours and mine!).
