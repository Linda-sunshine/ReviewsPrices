review/summary: A beautiful, well written love story.review/text: I loved it. From the first page to the last. I usually don't read love story's but for some reason this one had something special to it that I didn't even get from watching the movie. It's a well written, beautiful novel that I really enjoyed. I recommend it to anyone who needs to read something that will leave them hooked from cover to cover.
