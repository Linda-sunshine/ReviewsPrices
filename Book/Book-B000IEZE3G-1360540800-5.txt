review/summary: Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stonereview/text: Have you ever wanted to be part of something magical?Well Harrys uncle, aunt, and cousin Dudley are really rood to Harry and all he wants is to find out about his real parents so one day he finds out about his mom and dad and turns out he's a wizard so he go's off to Hogwarts but his aunt and uncle are not happy about it so he goes off with Hagred and along the way he meets new friends Ron and Hermione. Harry, Hermione, and Ron wanted to find out about the sorcerers stone. But nobody would tell them about it. So they went to find out themselves. Then Harry didn't expect somebody late at night to be with him.What I always love about Harry Potter is that once you start to read it you can't stop because the author just gets your attention and pulls you in cause it has a bit of a mystery in it and lots of action. I think it's a good book for kids and adults.This book has all the big surprises and so does the series. Since .J.K. Rowling invited me into the exciting world of magic I bet she will do it to you to.
