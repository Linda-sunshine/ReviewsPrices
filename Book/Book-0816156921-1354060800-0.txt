review/summary: Uniquereview/text: I had seen Dracula movies all of my life but had never read the book. WHat I liked about this is that it was still good, despite having seen so many vampire movies over the years. I liked the unique way that the author told the story using ship logs, journal entries, letters, etc. Very well done.
