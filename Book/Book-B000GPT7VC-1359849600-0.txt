review/summary: As Powerful as When it was first Publishedreview/text: Uncle Tom's Cabin's depiction of the horrors of slavery seems as powerful and as moving to me today as when it was first published. Despite the book's overwhelmingly Christian reference, its appeal is universal, and its story resonates with people of all faiths and backgrounds. Despite the dated writing conventions that might sound strange to modern readers, Uncle Tom's Cabin is consistently well written and grippingly told. I needed to keep a tissue box handy -- it would be a hard person, indeed, who will not weep while reading this, especially knowing that the stories told are in no way exaggerated. If you have never read this book, or if you read it so long ago you no longer remember much about it, you should put it at the top of your list as a reminder of how far this Nation has come and how far we have yet to go to secure the human dignity and freedom of all our citizens.
