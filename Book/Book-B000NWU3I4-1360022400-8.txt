review/summary: Hobbitreview/text: I read this book to get ready for the movie (which I still have not seen--given the poor reviews not sure I will). I read the book many years ago when I was just getting into Tolkien and then the Lord of the Rings. This is an entertaining read and really a quick read that introduces you to the fantasy world of middle-earth, with hobbits, elves, dwarves, etc. Anyone who enjoyed the triology will likely enjoy this as well.
