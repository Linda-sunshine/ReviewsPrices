review/summary: Terrific book!review/text: I don't know why I hadn't read this book earlier. It is awesome!At the end of the day, it is but common knowledge what Dale Carnegie shares - but he puts it across in such great context and with so many examples and insights that it is a no-brainer that every suggestion - if followed, can do wonders to your personal and professional life.A must read book for everyone. It is not at all theoretical and lots of fun!
