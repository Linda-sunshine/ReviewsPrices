review/summary: My favorite book of allreview/text: I have read this book a few times, seen the movie 32 times, so I LOVE this book. I learn something new about the civil war and the customs of the time every time I read this story. It is so beautifully written. This particular edition I purchased is a true gem. It is beautifully bound and truly a book I can pass down through the years. It was every bit as good as the seller said it was!
