review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: This is a book that's full of adventure, from start to finish. The reader will enjoy heroism, song, and good vs. evil. The reader clearly imagines landscapes that are English of long ago in description.A journey ensues by the main characters, Bilbo (the reluctant hero), the Dwarves, and the wizard Gandalf. The characters pass through well described places such as Rivendell, The Misty Mountains and Mirkwood on their way to Lonely Mountain, in order to take back treasure stolen by the great dragon Smaug.One of the things I liked most about The Hobbit is that we can all find our inner-Hobbit; the part of us that wants nothing but an easy and comfortable life. But there is still something inside all of us that perks up at the thought of adventure and a journey into the unknown.The Hobbit is a book that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. I'm nearly 50 years old and have read The Hobbit for the first time; and now I understand why The Hobbit is such a long lasting favorite and fondly remembered by all who read it.
