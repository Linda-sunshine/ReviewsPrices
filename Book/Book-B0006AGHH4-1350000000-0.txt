review/summary: profoundreview/text: I have never read this book thoroughly until now and I am glad I waited because I don&#8216;t think this book would have affected me as much if I had read it at a younger age. Not only does this book offer a heart breaking insight into slavery but it also shows the strength and compassion of the human soul.
