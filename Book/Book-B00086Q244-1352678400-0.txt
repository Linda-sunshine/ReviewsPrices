review/summary: Fairly good book, a bit outdated due to the progession of peoplereview/text: Overall, very good points as well as a good read. Quite a bit of great ideas that will help one achieve increased success and happiness. However, as we have progressed, this book can be confused to be a walking doormat. You have to understand what will help you and what will not.
