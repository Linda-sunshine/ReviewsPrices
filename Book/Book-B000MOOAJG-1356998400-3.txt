review/summary: Heavy, heavyreview/text: I think it probably was a good read but it was so-o-o heavy that I just didn't enjoy it. When I read, it is for pleasure, not to &#34;study.&#34; Consequently, I didn't really enjoy it. Should someone want to plow through it, I'm sure they will enjoy it, just not me!@
