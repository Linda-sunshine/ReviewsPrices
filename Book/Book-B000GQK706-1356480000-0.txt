review/summary: A song to lift up one's heartreview/text: The Lord of the Rings by Tolkien is a prodigious feat of creativity. Tolkien's imagination encompassed whole peoples with histories and languages and his depths of invention included memorable characters and plot developments.If I could change only one thing in this book, it would be to cull the numerous long paragraphs dedicated to landscape description in detail. Do not these repeatedly bog down the story he tells?But, if so, such excusable detours and dull passages are like the chaff that farmers winnow. We are fortunate to find among the best harvests of grain in this work of Tolkien's lifetime.World literature has been enriched with the arduous quest of Frodo and circumfluent paths of the Fellowship of the Ring. This story is freshened and quickened by evergreen dialogue, battles legendary and conflicts profound.Further, at intervals, characters' voices are lifted in song. I shall remember Tolkien's own lilting voice as a writer for the rest of my life. As Siegfried Sassoon once wrote:"Everyone's voice was suddenly lifted;And beauty came like the setting sun:My heart was shaken with tears; and HorrorDrifted away ... O, but EveryoneWas a bird; and the song was wordless; the singing will never be done."
