review/summary: Awesome man. Awesome philosophy.review/text: I need to reread parts of it, but it's simplest idea is that it's not what happens to you that matters but how you choose to react. You can still be generous and helpful, if only in your intentions. You can be honorable. To me this means that we who live in freedom have much more ability and responsibility to put into action our principles.
