review/summary: The best novel of all timesreview/text: In my opinion, Jane Eyre is the best novel ever written. I read it every year or so, because I learn something new every time. It is poignant and unforgettable. It is one of the few novels wherein the author speaks to the reader as if he or she is a dear friend and this is a story she simply must tell. I love it. It is bittersweet, mysterious, and a little supernatural. I wish it had been required reading in high school.... thankfully, I picked it up and read it on my own. Highly recommend it.
