review/summary: very disturbing to me as a womanreview/text: The story is written as either a warning or a prediction. Very real and terrifying if you remember the crap the GOP's war on women has accomplished and/or tried to do. I have been disturbed by this book for years, and I have reread it several times since my first reading and it freaks me out each time. The story is so well crafted that the rooms, characters and scenarios become very real.
