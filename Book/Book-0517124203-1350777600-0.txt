review/summary: Hmmreview/text: I really liked this book, but I've got to say that the anticipation it created by being such a highly acclaimed book let me down a little.It's just really very silly, lovely too, but if you're looking for something to comprehend you're looking at the wrong book!Really liked it, glad I have it, very much something that takes you back to your childhood!
