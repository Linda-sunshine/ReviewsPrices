review/summary: Persuasionreview/text: Not quite as entertaining as Pride and Prejudice, but well worth reading. The language alone make an Austen novel worthwhile. Austen would have been quite at home in the Women's Lib movement. However, her books are a testimony to the fact that there have always been women who pushed the boundaries of their society.
