review/summary: Oscar doesn't age well.review/text: While Earnest might have been delightful 100 years ago, it becomes a chore to finish these days. All the synonyms for trite and stuffy apply. I was taken back to high school Literature days, when some of the assigned classics felt like punishment. Sorry Oscar, this one isn't timeless.
