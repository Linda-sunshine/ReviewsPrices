review/summary: The Great Bookreview/text: I began reading The Great Gatsby expecting it to be decent, to be sure, but not for it to be spectacular. I was wrong. It is the best written book that I have ever read, and it is one of my favorites.Fitzgerald's use of the english language is nothing short of amazing. His eloquence is jealousy inspiring.I would recommend this book to anyone.
