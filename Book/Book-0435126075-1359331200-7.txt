review/summary: Exhiliratingreview/text: An out-of-this world experience, especially for the missus who had studied the hard copy at school in her teens. Today is the 200th anniversary to the day of this novel first being published in the UK, so this review comes with all the stars it duly deserves. Congratulations for making it possible with modern technology.
