review/summary: Suspenseful Philosophyreview/text: I read a lot of books, but since a serious book is a major investment of a person's limited time and energy, I don't like to recommend books, or give them as gifts. Doing so is an impertinence: it's as though the giver knows better how the receiver should be spending his own time. For similar reasons, I never refer to a book as a "must read". I am quite weary of such over-hyped phrases, along with the word "genius", and such clich&eacute;'s as "breathtaking in its scope" and "makes you question everything you thought you knew".This is unfortunate, since those bromides are the only accurate way to describe Ayn Rand's novel "Atlas Shrugged". Ayn Rand really is the genius of the millennium. Her literary ability really is rivaled only by Shakespeare. She really does make you rethink your fundamental approach to life, particularly human morality. Ayn Rand's epochal ideas really will influence the future to the same degree that the ideas of Aristotle, Jesus, and Newton have influenced the past and present.What are those ideas in a nutshell? They won't fit into a nutshell until after you read the book and digest the ideas for yourself. But I can try to get her viewpoint across by saying that I think that Ayn Rand offers man a new way of life, a new vision of himself. I see her, not as an atheist (although technically she was), but as a secular theist. In effect, she views man as a god, whose life on earth is a sacred end-in-itself, never to be sacrificed. Atlas Shrugged is like a man-worshiping Greek statue put into words.You think that such heavy philosophy can't be a suspenseful read? With any other writer you might be right, but, in fact, Atlas Shrugged is an intensely suspenseful page-turner of a mystery story. You really will enjoy having your fundamental ideas challenged.
