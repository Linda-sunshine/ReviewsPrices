review/summary: Ridiculous, unlikely, feminist paranoiareview/text: Before reading this, you should know that this book is extremely anti-Christian, and full of nonsense. This is a future world where very few women are fertile, and "Christian" religious right men are in charge. Because so few women can have children, those who can are used as "handmaids"-essentially, they have babies for the men and their sterile wives. Now, there is no mention in this novel of why egg donors and implantation aren't used, or why fertility treatments aren't employed. There are also women used as prostitutes-those who are defiant about the existing order. This is a paranoid feminist novel, one completely unlikely to happen, and one that will piss you off to read. It isn't even a good story. I had to read this for school and hated every minute of it. There is no truth in it, just a rallying cry for NARAL. If you're conservative like me, skip it. It will only make you angry.
