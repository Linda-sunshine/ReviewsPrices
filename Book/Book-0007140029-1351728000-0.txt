review/summary: Very addicting!review/text: When I picked up the book for the first time, I couldn't put it down! I had homework, but I was like, no just one more chapter. The next thing I know its 3 am and I have finished the book. Great for any child above 10, because of the many challenging vocabulary words that I haven't learned untill 7th grade. Great read overall!
