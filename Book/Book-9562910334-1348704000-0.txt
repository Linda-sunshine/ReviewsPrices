review/summary: One of the first and best Dystopian futuristic fantasiesreview/text: Engrossing and well written, this dark novel about a futuristic fascist government, where individual freedom is a negative concept, has been endlessly copied, the concepts repeatedly utilized. But rarely have the successors been nearly as well told. Written in 1948, but still timeless and a great read. There is a reason this is a modern classic, while still a favorite among everything from the sci-fi crowd to the acolytes of horror, thrillers, and anyone into an intense vision of the future. One that is proving all too real.
