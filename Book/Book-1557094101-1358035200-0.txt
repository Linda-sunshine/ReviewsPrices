review/summary: Needs some correctionsreview/text: The idea was to have our 6 year old read the story to us as she is an advanced reader for her age. Apparently nobody proof read the book-there at numerous 'spacing errors' in the book within a word that can make a child have to pause on a word, then all of a sudden there's a page near the end that breaks the pattern and has only an illustration and no text at all.Just errors that should have been caught. The story is very accurate. NO REASON THAT ERRORS SHOULDNT BE CORRECTED.
