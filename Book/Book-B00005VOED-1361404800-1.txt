review/summary: A Confederacy of Duncesreview/text: This was recommended by someone in my writing group and it is a Pulitzer Prize winner. More than 20 years after being published, and more than 30 years after it was written, the story's humor still works. I know the difficulty in writing humor and view this book as both entertainment and an inspiration to that genre. This story will probably appeal to older readers. Younger readers or those easily offended by off color humor may not appreciate it as much.
