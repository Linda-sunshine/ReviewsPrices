review/summary: One of my favorites!review/text: I absolutely love this book. It is so inspiring and really makes me evaluate my attitude and appreciate all of my blessings (even the blessings in disguise). I recommend this book to everyone! Seriously, you can't go wrong with this book. Unless of course you hate courageous and moral people who make you want to be a better person. Then you might not like it. However, if that is your attitude then you need to read this and it might help turn you around. So, I guess I'm back to recommending this to everyone!
