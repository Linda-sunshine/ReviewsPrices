review/summary: I felt I should have this one under my beltreview/text: No doubt this is a classic--and one I've tried several times before and just could not finish. I understand why Melville had to write about whales and whaling as he did; it was a different era, but it was tedious. HOWEVER, there were passages that made me gasp with delight. Sometimes I wondered how any mortal could use our language in such sublime fashion, and as I looked for these passages, I knew I would finish the book this time. One example that immediately comes to mind is his description of pitchpoling. Was it worth the effort? Absolutely. Now I'd like to edit it for the modern reader and preserve that in which I felt such incredible joy.
