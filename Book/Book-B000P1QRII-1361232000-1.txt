review/summary: Great Storyreview/text: I've loved this book since middle school and have been desperate for a good read lately. I've read this book several times and have called this my favorite book for the better part of two decades, but have never owned it. It was just time. My only complaint is that it's too short! I wish this book would just go on and on. I realize it's for a younger audience and probably appreciated it length when I was a less experienced reader. I'm glad to own it now so I can read it to my heart's content.
