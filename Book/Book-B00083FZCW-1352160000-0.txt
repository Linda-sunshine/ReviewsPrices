review/summary: Amazing!review/text: Definitely the best in the series! It's one of those &#34;just can't put it down&#34; novels. I'm sorry to say that this is the best book in the series. After this one they slowly get worse and worse. I'm still sluggishly trying to read nevermore but it just doesn't hold my attention. I always find myself doimg something else.(In fact that's what I was doing when I came here.) Anyway, this one's great. Probably my favorite book by James Patterson.
