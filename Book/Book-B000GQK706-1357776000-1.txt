review/summary: Difficult to get to a particular pagereview/text: Overall, the book is good. I didn't see any print errors or anything like that. My biggest issue is the fact that since it is all three books put into one, navigating to a particular chapter or page is very difficult. It's basically just broken down into the 3 books themselves and then further broken down into the major sections within each book. Not broken down by each chapter the way I was hoping.
