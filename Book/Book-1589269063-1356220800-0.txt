review/summary: Informative with examplesreview/text: Somebody handed me the &#34;original&#34; book a few years ago while I was still married and it made a lot of sense. Unfortunately the damage was done. Being single again I purchased my own &#34;Men's Edition&#34; as an ebook to understand and correct my behavior before moving forward, and not repeat it. It isn't a dating book, nor will it help you with a new relationship. However if you have an existing relationship, are still communicating, and willing to adapt, I think it can help.Much of what is discussed is simple, sometimes too simple. There is elegance to the simplicity of &#34;5&#34; languages, and sometimes the scenarios are a bit eye-rolling simple, but the stories are told in a non-threatening and straight forward manner. An important point is that you can change you, not the other person. Hopefully there are enough stories that you can see yourself, because you just may be half of the problem. Through your change, maybe it will be reflected back in a positive way. This book helps paint a picture of what that might look like without requiring reading between the lines.This is an edited version of the original. I guess the idea is that guys need a smack on the head or something. It differs little from the original - other than to provide examples focused on and from a guy's point of view. It is a good read and I found it interesting.Whether you are trying to renew an already good relationship, or revive a cooling one, this book is worth a read.
