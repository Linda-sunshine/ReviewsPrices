review/summary: Wonderful classic!review/text: A timeless classic. I've seen just about every movie version of this story that has ever been made. Some are better than others. This was the first time I read the original story by Charles Dickens. Many of the film versions follow the dialogue of the book quite well. There are a few English words that we no longer use, but the built in dictionary on my Kindle was helpful--most of the time. This is a great read that every Christmas Carol movie buff should read. It is a timeless story that never grows old no matter how many times it is read or performed.
