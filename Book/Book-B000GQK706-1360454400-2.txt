review/summary: ebook format review - great value and superb quality!review/text: This review is on the ebook format as there is no need to rate one of the greatest fantasy classics of all time. The LOTR is a wonderful story that I enjoy more every time I read it!This ebook version of the LOTR in one volume is a great buy at a reasonable price for anyone who likes ebooks. I noted no flaws in the text and was pleased with the extent and quality of the maps in an ebook format. It makes a great addition to any ebook library!I highly recommend it!
