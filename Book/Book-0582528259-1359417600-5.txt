review/summary: The oldies are the best!review/text: The interesting thing about it is that it is about 45 years since I last read this book, and then as a young person the language and sentiment seemed old. On re-reading it I found that the language seened modern, though the actions of the characters seemed archaic...read also The Wide Sargossa Sea by Jean Rhys, this is like a deconstructed version of Jane Eyre, very interesting approach.
