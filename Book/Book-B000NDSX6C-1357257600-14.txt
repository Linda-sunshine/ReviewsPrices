review/summary: The Beginning of a classicreview/text: Although Tolkien has a tendency to ramble and gets bogged down in details, this is an excellent introduction to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Movie fans need to be aware that the film takes considerable leway from the book. The role of Thorin is larger in the film than in the book and he is much more the hero in the film. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in the future films.Tolkien writes the Hobbit as if he is writing for a young audience, he also uses humor to advantage in this novel. This does not mean I did not appreciate the book. But it is not for very young children, there is too much detail for them. I would recommend this book to 7th grade and above.
