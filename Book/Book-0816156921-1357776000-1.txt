review/summary: Great Readreview/text: For anyone who has only ever seen the various film versions of the story of the Count , the book is a little bit different. From my own memory , I believe the film version staring Gary Oldman is the closest any film version comes to the book version.The book of course is set in the 19th Centuary and as such the language is in that kind of old english style , if you can imagine , and as such it may be not to everyones taste , but is worth the effort.I found the ending to be a little anti-climatic. The final confrontation with the Count seemed to be over very quickly considering the build up to it. Nevertheless , a classic tale from my fellow Irish countryman and certainly worth a download.
