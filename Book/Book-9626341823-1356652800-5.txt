review/summary: I am glad I bought this versionreview/text: I read a review from someone who obviously loves &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; as much as I do. I have never listened to the unabridged version and I love it. It will be on my &#34;must listen to&#34; list every Christmas. Tom Baker does a fine narration of this classic. If you like the story, you'll love this audio version.
