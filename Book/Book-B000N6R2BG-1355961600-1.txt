review/summary: Wow!!review/text: I forgot who wrote this book when I was reading it on my kindle and I was shocked at some of the things that were happening within the story ... as I was telling my husband and friend about the book they asked who the author was so I went to look, saw it was Jodi Picoult and was like OF COURSE it is!! Great story. I thought there were a few holes in the story line - I like to know why things happen and I didn't feel like the why was told.
