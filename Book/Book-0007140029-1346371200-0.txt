review/summary: Great summer reading for 4th and 5th graders.review/text: I read this book for my summer reading assignment and I thought it was very good. There was a cat named Rusty who was owned by people whom the cats referred to as "twolegs." A clan called ThunderClan asked Rusty to be in their clan. Rusty was renamed Firepaw. He would learn things about his new friends, the other clan members. He was taught to hunt and fight by his mentor who was a strong warrior.I recommend this book for anyone who likes action books and likes to read about cats.
