review/summary: Christmas starts here...review/text: I doubt if there's been a Christmas season in the last thirty years that I haven't read, watched or listened to A Christmas Carol, in some form or another. Like King Lear, every actor reaches a point in his career where he wants to stamp his mark on this classic, so you have to be really quite special to compete with the crowd. Fortunately, this reading by Tom Baker IS really quite special!I approached this with some trepidation because, much though I like Baker, for me the definitive version is Patrick Stewart's and I doubted Baker could match him. I was wrong - Baker brings drama, fear, sorrow and ultimately joy to the story just as much as Stewart does. As with all of the best of the Dickens' narrators/performers, (Callow and Margolyes, as well as Stewart, spring to mind), Baker has a huge personality and a powerful voice - necessary to fill the shoes of Dickens' larger-than-life creations. Although this is a straight reading, Baker uses his fine acting skills to give each character an individual identity. I enjoyed the occasional background music and other sound effects at the more dramatic points and felt that they added to the overall performance.I intended to listen in instalments but by the time the first disc ended, I was so hooked I ended up listening to the whole thing in one session. Not better than Stewart (not possible!) but as good, and of course this is the unabridged version. Three hours of pure listening pleasure - this set will now join my select collection of Christmas Carols, to be brought out and savoured time and again over many Christmases to come. Highly recommended.
