review/summary: Love itreview/text: Thought I'd check this book it since I've never read it and it's a classic. I loved it. I loved the style and pace of it. It was interesting to read about the original vampire and his qualities. I did not have a problem with this digital version and thought it was quite good. Very entertaining read.
