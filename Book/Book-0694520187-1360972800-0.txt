review/summary: poetic and adventurereview/text: Melville is an observer with a normal mind and an imaginative one. Unlike the fantasy gang he starts from an original wordliness and flies then on his imagination.Rated as adventure one can miss Reading his Amazing imagination.Anyone who likes Reading deeply is going to find a treasure here.
