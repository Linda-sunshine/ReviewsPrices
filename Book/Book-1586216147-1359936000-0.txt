review/summary: Nicholas Sparks keeps the spark in my marriagereview/text: After I read this book, I watched the movie, and I can say that I LOVE The Notebook! I have written down mine and my husband's story and keep a detailed journal of our lives. I cannot wait to get Alzheimer's disease and have him read it to me when we are old! I have begun saving money so that we can turn our three bedroom house into an old folk's home so we can live here forever. I watch the weather channel religiously so I know when there is rain in the forecast, then I can be prepared. I stand in the rain and yell for my husband to come out and kiss me and then we have passionate sex on the floor of the living room. I make sure to remind my teenage daughter to leave her first true love, so that he will be able to steal her away from her rich fiance that she will settle for later in life. She understands that this is the only way that she will have her happy ending. I have taught her that love is the only emotion that matters and Nicholas Sparks will keep her spark in her future marriage!
