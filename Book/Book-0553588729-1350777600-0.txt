review/summary: OMFG i needed this book so bad!!review/text: Im a first time dad and I need this book. Good, solid info that will help you thru this whirlwind of shitty piss filled diapers, sleepless nights and nerve shattering sounds of a baby crying. Use the book and you will have a peaceful happy existence with your bundle of joy, dont use the book and you end up like that lady that super glued her kids hand to the wall. Dont be like that lady that super glued her kids hand to the wall.
