review/summary: What a story!review/text: Had a great time reading this book to my whole family as we drove across the country this Summer! It was a much anticipated re-read for my husband and a first time read for the rest of us. It is a classic for a reason! Funny to think about a fast food chain with Long John Silver for its name sake, even if he was a seemingly amiable sort of guy.
