review/summary: Nice to read the original story!review/text: Having never read the original story of Oliver Twist, my only knowledge was from the films Hollywood has produced and I wanted the real story. I enjoyed this book very much and was pleasantly surprised to see that a film version done way back in the black and white film days was nearly word for word.
