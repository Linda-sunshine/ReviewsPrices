review/summary: Classic adventurereview/text: I originally read The Hobbit back when I was ten and fell in love with the epic tale and the harrowing adventure. I am so pleased to be able to own a digital copy of this book. I purchased it for a single re-read during a trip and have now found myself reading it again nd again. Ease of access and this classic is a match made in literary heaven.
