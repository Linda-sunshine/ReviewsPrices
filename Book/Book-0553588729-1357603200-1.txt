review/summary: Reasonably Good Advice in a Funny Packagereview/text: I got this book when it was passed on to me by a friend. The first thing I noticed about it is that it starts off like a crazy infomercial, like "you too can quiet your baby - it's a miracle!" which really put me off actually.One thing about baby advice books (and advice from friends, family etc for that matter) is that no one concept or strategy works for everyone. I think it's a mistake to get too invested in any one philosophy over being flexible for your own baby and family. And of course, nothing is a "miracle" but just some stuff to try.For this book it boils down to there are five things Dr Karp recommends for quieting babies and you can get the info on what to do for these in 10 minutes in a very small segment of the book. This practical advice is useful and reasonable.The rest of the book the whole "fourth trimester" thing is basically made up by Dr Karp to add some context and structure to the practical advice and can be completely skipped if you want to skip it. I would say that generally speaking he only uses verifiable facts when stating thing specifically - such as if he says "we know babies cry most around 6 weeks of age" there are studies supporting that fact. But, at the same time the larger ideas in the book, such as the application of the moro reflex to why babies don't like to sleep on their backs, and other "what your baby is thinking" type theories are just conjecture. However, as far as I can tell this is true of all baby advice theories and he's no worse than anyone else.So while I don't believe the hype, I found the specific five things to try helpful! So it's worth checking the book out.
