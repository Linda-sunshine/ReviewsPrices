review/summary: Huckleberry Finnreview/text: "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" is, obviously, an American classic. As the title suggests, it follows the adventures of Huckleberry Finn who is paired up with an escaped slave, Jim. This story is just as fantastic as everyone seems to say; it definitely deserves the title of being a "classic" book. Each obstacle Huck Finn and Jim encounter is captured in stunning detail by Mark Twain and keeps the reader captivated.One of my favorite things about "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" is how well the humor and drama balance each other. As the two boys work through each problem there is always a slight air of humor; although there are some intense situations in this book, nothing ever gets too serious. There is an absolutely perfect amount of sly, funny comments, mostly from Huck Finn, to counteract all of the drama. "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" get even funnier and more enjoyable, though, when Tom Sawyer enters the story. His preconceived notions of everything that must be done in each situation provides endless entertainment. This book is a serious, dramatic book but has humor that makes it that much better.No matter how inventive and entertaining the storyline in "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" is, though, it is still extremely difficult to get over the grammar. The book is written as if Huck Finn wrote it, with his accent and spellings. Also, the slaves' dialects are written in exactly the same way as they speak. I understand why the book is written in this way, but it does not make it easier to understand or less frustrating to read. Mark Twain wrote this book in a brilliant way; however, after a while, the grammatical errors wore on me and did take away from the story line a little.
