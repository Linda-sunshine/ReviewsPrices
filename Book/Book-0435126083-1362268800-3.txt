review/summary: A Guilty Pleasurereview/text: I first read "Wuthering Heights" 20 years ago as a teenager. I remember at the time being captivated by the star-crossed lovers Heathcliff and Catherine. I decided recently to reread the story because it had been so long and I had forgotten what had drawn me to it.If this had been my first time reading the story, I would probably give it no more than 2 stars. It is definitely a mood piece. As an angst-filled teen, I can understand my former attraction to brooding characters and missed opportunities. As an adult, with much less angst, I have grown to pity the characters I once held in admiration. To say it plainly, Heathcliff is a d*ck. He was so hell bent on his own vision of revenge that he not only wastes his own life, but ruins the lives of others. The bad boy I was so attracted to 20 years ago is in actuality a loser. So is the story of the teenage girl.I have given this book 4 stars due to sentimentality. If you're looking for a happy ending fairy tale, this is not the book for you. If you're 15 years old with a chip on your shoulder, then this will probably become your favorite classic of all time.
