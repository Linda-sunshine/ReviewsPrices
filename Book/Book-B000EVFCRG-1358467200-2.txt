review/summary: The love of a familyreview/text: What more can be said about Little Women? This classic story of a family of six has warmed many hearts and it has warmed mine again. As an adult, I am sure I feel differently about this book at age 64 than I did at age 10. We women have come a long way and this book is a gentle reminder of all that has happened in 200 years. My book group enjoyed reading about this feisty,, friendly family.
