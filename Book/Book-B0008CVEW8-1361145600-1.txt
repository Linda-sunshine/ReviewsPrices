review/summary: Treasure islandreview/text: I think this book had a lot of dignity. It really kept me hanging over my bed because it was so interesting. I just love this book! I chose this rating because it was really really good. I wouldn't say prefect because it's really old but it really is a big hit for today! I just absolutely loved it!!!!!!!!!!
