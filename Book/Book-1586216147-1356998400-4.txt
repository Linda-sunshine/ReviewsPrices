review/summary: The Notebookreview/text: I have read a lot of books before, but the notebook isn't just a book. It's an example, a lesson of love. It shows us that just because the odds are against us, and just because everyone else doesn't believe that miracles can happen, that love works in mysterious ways. And some loves are strong enough to overcome anything. And that love is the only real cure for tragedies.
