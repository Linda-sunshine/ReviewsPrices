review/summary: The Complete C.S. Lewis Signature Classicsreview/text: My adult children asked for this book for Christmas and are very happy with it. It has a beautiful design and is a keepsake item as well as good reading. The only thing some may not like in this compilation of C.S. Lewis's works is the cumbersome size of it. One has to decide if the convenience of having all the text in one attractive binding outweighs having multiple copies of books containing the same material, and that is completely an issue of preference.The book was delivered in a timely manner and was packaged well for safe delivery of the contents.
