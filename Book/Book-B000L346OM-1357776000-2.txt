review/summary: Circumstances don't give life meaningreview/text: Francl seeks to demonstrate that, contrary to our natural inclinations, man finds true meaning in life by not focusing on self. While it is my personal belief that this is especially true in relationship to God, Francl demonstrates that it applies not only to the spiritual, but to every aspect of living. Even in the unimaginable conditions common in the German concentration camps of world war II, people survived by focusing on the needs of others or doing some greater good. Fascinating and thoughtful reading.
