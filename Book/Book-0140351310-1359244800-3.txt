review/summary: Not only enightening, but hugely entertaining!review/text: Today's literary environment is filled with books that read like a bowl of popcorn--they are quickly devoured and lack any substance. However, I understand why many readers shy away from the classics. Most of the time, when I pick up a book I'm just looking to be entertained and diverted--I don't want to feel like I'm in my 12th grade English class. Don't despair if that's you: there are some classic novels that capture the best of both worlds. Jane Eyre is one of those books.Jane Eyre is filled with poetic and beautiful prose that will enlarge your vocabulary and stimulate your imagination. I especially enjoy the dialogue between Jane and Edward Rochester. Not only do the characters speak beautifully, but they also speak intelligently. There are many times a soliloquy will cut right to the heart of the matter in question with the precision of a scalpel, but with language that is poetic as it is accurate. It's a pity many modern novels can't achieve this same balance.Reading Jane Eyre is not like eating your literary vegetables. This book is hugely entertaining. It's gothic romance at its best. Edward Rochester is brooding, seductive, passionate and troubled--the quintessential bad boy. He is infinitely more compelling than that other Edward you'll find lingering around Forks. Jane is a tower of strength. She is a woman who falls deeply in love, but is not defined by that relationship. She does not find her identity in any man, but in the treasure of the spirit God gave her. She faces what would seem to most of us like unendurable suffering in the most admirable way--yet she doesn't come off as superhuman. This is the kind of character teenage girls should be reading--not the simpering, swooning Bella Swan.If you pick up this book, I promise you'll be entertained--but while you are entertained, you will also be uplifted.
