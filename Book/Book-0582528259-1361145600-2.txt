review/summary: Bronte gets wordyreview/text: I recently saw the movie Jane Eyre and was tempted to read the book. The movie was beautifully done, but did leave out some very important events that were described in the book. Overall it was a bittersweet love story... A tale of burning down walls figuratively and literally; of allowing ones self to accept truth and love regardless of station; and of knowing ones self above all. Though Bronte does get a bit wordy in her writing (I'm more partial to Emily's writing vs. Charlotte) this is a rewarding story of strength of heart and perseverance of the spirit.
