review/summary: Loved this bookreview/text: From the very first sentence I have enjoyed this book so much. From the very beginning it has made me laugh so hard and out loud that people around were looking at me like I was crazy but I didn't care. It was suspenseful but not scary and had just enough romance you could daydream about. It leave you with question but mostly it leave with wanting to read more, more in the series or just more in her collection. I will be reading this book again and again and suggesting to my mom and grandmother to read it as well.
