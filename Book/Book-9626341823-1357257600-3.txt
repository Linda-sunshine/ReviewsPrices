review/summary: The Standardreview/text: This work sets the standard for all Christmas stories that follow it. In my opinion it is bested only by the real story itself found within the Gospels. Dickens wasn't the greatest novelist of his time, perhaps not even the greatest of his friends and acquaintances. However, his characters will live with us forever for no one can introduce us to better ones. Old Ebenezer Scrooge is perhaps one of his best known and has become a symbol of anti-holiday merriment. Added to this is the plight of the poor which Dickens describes in painful detail drawn from his keen eye and actual experience. Plus, it is Kindle - you can't beat the price!
