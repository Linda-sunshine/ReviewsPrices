review/summary: I don't understand the fuss about this novelreview/text: This is the first Kurt Vonnegut book that I have ever read. I was intrigued as it is considered a classic science fiction book so I thought I would give it a try. Vonnegut is clearly a talented writer. The book explored some interesting themes such as free will vs. destiny. It was told in an unstructured way which left me wondering if there was a reason behind it being told the way it was. I also wondered if there was some grand revelation at the end of the story that would explain the popularity of the book. I finished the book and never figured the above out.The book could best be classified as dark humor / sci fi, but the humor didn't appeal to me. The book wasn't a chore to read, but I didn't find it compelling in any way. When I finished it left me wondering what all the fuss was about. It left me with just enough curiosity to want to sample another Vonnegut book, but I am not in a rush to do so.
