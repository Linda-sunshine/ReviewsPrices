review/summary: Gets better with time.review/text: It's a really great time to revisit this book-- or to visit it for the first time. The recent Peter Jackson film is a great representation doesn't completely do justice to the feeling behind this novel. It's an adventure book for children with a profoundly adult longing about it for the fantasy and imagination of youth.
