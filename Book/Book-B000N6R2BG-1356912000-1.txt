review/summary: Formulaic Jodi Picoultreview/text: Once again Jodi brings in for discussion social issues usually left swept under the rug. Her writing is elegantly descriptive whilst keeping a tight rein on fantasy and is able to create believable characters to complete a plot of familial anguish together with legal parameters.
