review/summary: Titlereview/text: I read the Importance of Being Earnest for my summer reading. I originally chose this book because it is short and a classic so I could get it for free on my kindle; consequently, I found myself surprised when I found that I genuinely enjoyed it. This book was a fast-paced, light-hearted, delightful comedy that is appropriate for all ages. The Importance of Being Earnest was a joy to read and has been on the ap literature test in years past.
