review/summary: Better than the filmreview/text: If you have only watched the film and never read the book, then you should read the original, its much better. This is a great read and contains loads more than the films did, its very well written and you wont be able to put this book down once you start. This is one of those books that I have read at least 10 times and never tire of picking it up again. The only other book that I know that is in the same category if Michael Bulgakov's "Master and Margarita" - so you should read that too.The Master and Margarita (Penguin Classics)
