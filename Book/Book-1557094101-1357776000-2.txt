review/summary: Poor adaptation to e-bookreview/text: We thought it would be nice to read 'twas the night befor Christmas to the kids so we downloaded it on Christmas eve. Boy were we disappointed . The original words with nice illustrations for kids but a horrible adaptation to the kindle. It only shows one page at a time and the pictures and story are written across 2 pages so it's pretty much in readable. Also it doesnt even show up full screen.
