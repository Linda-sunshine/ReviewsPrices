review/summary: Mixed feelingsreview/text: I had delayed many years with this book at the top ofmy &#34;gotta read it&#34; list. I know it is a highly reviered classicand I'm not sure why. Is it because of the time it waspublished? Beats me, just know I was left somewhatmystified at its reputation.
