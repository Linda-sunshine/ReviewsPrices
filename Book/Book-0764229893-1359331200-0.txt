review/summary: Get ready for a great seriesreview/text: A great book by Lynn Austin-it made the scriptures come alive. It is more than evident that the author did her homework historically and scripturally. Warning-this may ruin you for other Biblical historical fiction! It is absolutely excellent-well written and accurate.
