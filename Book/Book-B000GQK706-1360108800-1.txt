review/summary: You can never go wrong...review/text: ...with this series. Lord of the Rings has been a favorite series of mine since I read &#34;The Hobbit&#34; in fourth grade and devoured everything else JRR Tolkien ever wrote. This is an excellent digital version of the book I loved, and I can find no real fault with it. Was definitely worth the price I paid, and I would gladly pay it again if I had to.I will never, ever tire of Tolkien's world.
