review/summary: Running Blindreview/text: i have just finished reading this title and given it only 3 stars due to its printing format. The book was good as one has come to expect from Mr Child. The story was taught and one was in suspense as to who was the killer right to the last chapter. But it did not have any chapters, this was confusing as one would be reading one scene with one set of characters when half way down the page the scene completly changed and we were having conversations with other characters! If this was a cost saving excercise it did not work!
