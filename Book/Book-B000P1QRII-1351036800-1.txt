review/summary: Great tale, deftly toldreview/text: This book has all the qualities I enjoy in young adult literature (I am not a young adult): a compelling narrative, interesting characters, a well-described environment for the action. There are a couple of things in this story which stretch credulity, but I was able to set them aside and just "be" in the tale.
