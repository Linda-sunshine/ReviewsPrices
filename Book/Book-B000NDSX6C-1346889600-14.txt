review/summary: Simply the Best.review/text: I first read The Hobbit when I was in high school many years ago. Rereading it today still gives me the same enjoyment and sense of wonder I had back in my younger days. I'm hoping that Peter Jackson does as good a job on the upcoming Hobbit movies as he did with the LOTR trilogy.
