review/summary: One of those you will not be able to put downreview/text: I was riveted by this book. I imagine it will do the same for many people especially if they are more religious than I. I think the best part was the end, I actually kind of sat there a few minutes to really absorb it. I loved her other books but this is my favorite so far.
