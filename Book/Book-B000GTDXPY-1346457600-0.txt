review/summary: Entertaining Easy Readreview/text: I just finished Calamity Jayne, and I did enjoy it. I would recommend it as a funny and easy read, but it is not at all "amazing". One thing that was amazing to me were the number of spelling and grammar errors. (Kindle Edition) I just hate that, it becomes a distraction. Back to Calamity, a silly and somewhat transparent 'mystery' that only the title character is unable to figure out, is still worth reading.
