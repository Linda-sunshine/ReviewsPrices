review/summary: Rather decent for the most partreview/text: Brian Robeson, a 13 year-old boy, has found himself in a situation that could end in life or death aboard a Cessna aircraft flying over the Canadian wilderness...Gary Paulsen, the author of the adventure/survival novel, Hatchet did a wonderful job detailing, narrating, and sculpting a picture in my mind, for the most part.The reason I say this is because I feel Gary Paulsen just gave up on the book towards the end. Gary Paulsen gets into a rather decent part in the book and seems to get tired of writing then ends extremely abruptly. He never touched back on the secret between his divorced parents. Gary Paulsen is a great writer, but ending a book is not really his thing. Hatchet is great in detail, and has a surprising plot, but it does not have very many characters, and good information on the main character. I would recommend this book if you like a quick book with a slow going plot and a unique story.
