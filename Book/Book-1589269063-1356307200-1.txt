review/summary: Love itreview/text: First let me start off by saying that if you have serious relationship issues it will take more than this or any book to help you. With that said this book does a wonderful job of identifying each persons primary means of communication. In doing so it also allows each person to " speak" to their partners in a more loving manner.
