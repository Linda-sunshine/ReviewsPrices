review/summary: BUY THIS EDITION!review/text: This was one of my favorite books in middle school-so much so that I still have (and read) my old beat up version with the missing cover. My 6yo has started reading heavy books and kept stealing my version of this, so I bought him his own. I didnt realize this one was a special edition, much bigger print, with pics, but same exact story. This is an amazing novel, I would suggest it for any age.
