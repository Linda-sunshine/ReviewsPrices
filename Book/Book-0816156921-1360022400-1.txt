review/summary: A classic, but requires a patient readerreview/text: Bram Stoker's Dracula is a celebrated classic for good reason. So much in popular culture since its publication over a century ago originates from the creation of this single character--this undead, parasite of the night.The story itself is a brilliant, wordy mess of journal entries written by forlorn characters desperate to understand an unfamiliar evil. But rather than compulsively turning the pages, you're more likely to wander through the confusion thinking, "What is going on here?" Dracula has its moments--alarming revelations that will chill your bones--but I'd be understating if I said you'll have to slog through a bunch of babble to get there.
