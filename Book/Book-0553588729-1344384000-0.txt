review/summary: Saved us a lot of frustration!review/text: My wife and I and our son for that matter got a lot of use out of this book! We are first time parents and were having a lot of trouble calming and keeping our son calmed not to mention getting him to sleep for more than 45 minutes. The 5 S's worked wonders for both and many other things in the book helped us and gave us a better understanding of what our new baby was going through and what he needed to be comforted. I highly recommend this book to new parents or any parents that have fussy or colicky babies! I don't know how we would have made it through without the advice from this book.
