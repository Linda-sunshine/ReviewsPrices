review/summary: Book vs. Moviereview/text: The book was great, the movie sucked. Come on Tom Cruise for Jack Reacher?! He's about a foot shy and 100 lbs shy. It ruined the whole movie, if you know Jack Reacher. The book was way better, more story to it, the movie wasn't even close to the book. Names only and maybe a slight premise of what the book is about but that's all. The book was enjoyable, once I got into it I couldn't put it down. I think I read it in less than a week, which is good for me. I recommend the book to any Jack Reacher fan but don't see the movie.
