review/summary: Good But Difficultreview/text: A classic, I know, and good story line, but very difficult to read - thanks to my Kindle, between the dictionary and translations, I was able to look up words or phrases on just about every page - made for very slow reading - but was still interesting enough to stick with it, even though it was probably the longest book I've ever read!
