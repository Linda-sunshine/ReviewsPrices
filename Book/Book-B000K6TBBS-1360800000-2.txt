review/summary: Good guys DO finish first.review/text: Jack Reacher is at it again in this 4th book from Lee Child. He does an unsolicited good deed and has the FBI all over him as a result. While the Bureau doesn't look particularly good in this book, Reacher certainly does. It is sad that he can't settle in with the love of his life, but if he could where would that leave the readers? Another great book that expands the Reacher character and points the way to further adventures. Tight plotting, great character development and no let downs keep Child's books at the top of the list for me.
