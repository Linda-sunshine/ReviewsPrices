review/summary: Fantastic Bookreview/text: This book started a mental change in my life. It created a need for deeper introspection, and as such helped to motivate me to take steps to further goals and career. More than that, it has helped me to take a deeper look at my ambitions, and to prioritize what I really want. This is a great book for someone who has been searching for a better understanding of the inner-workings of thought, and how thoughts ultimately impact the movement and intention of every-day life.
