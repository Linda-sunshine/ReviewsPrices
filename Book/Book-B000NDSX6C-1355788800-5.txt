review/summary: Welcome to Tolkein's worldreview/text: "The Hobbit" is J.R.R. Tolkein's introduction to Middle Earth, a land filled with dwarves, elves, and men. A place where evil exists and is growing, but also a place where good exists and is willing to stand up to injustice, slaughter, and violence.Fans familiar with the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy will recognize characters, stories, and events from this tale, and will likely delight in learning more about Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, and the discovery of a certain ring. Rereading this story, it did seem a bit unpolished and lacking in places in comparison to Tolkein's later works, but I still enjoyed the visit to Middle Earth.
