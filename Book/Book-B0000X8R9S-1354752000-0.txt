review/summary: My Review 1# by this guyreview/text: My review: Hatchet 1# Brian Robensen has just met his fate! With only his hatchet and knowledge he has just crashed a Canadian wilderness! This book is very suspenseful for example he encounters a psychotic moose that almost drowns him! But that's not all there's much more to come just read the book! I would recommend this book to 4-9 grades because it has some parts that may be inappropriate for younger kids! In my position I love this book and my favorite part was when he got the survival pack! Well that's it for now! Sincerely, Ahmed!!!
