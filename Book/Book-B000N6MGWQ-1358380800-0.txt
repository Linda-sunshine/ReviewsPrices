review/summary: Amazing book, just...read it!review/text: It is definitely a five star book....very easy to read and it has so many things to learn from it. Heaven will not be what all of us expect since nobody has gone and came back, but this book might give us a very good idea of how our live continues after death, of how everything we do counts for something no matter how meaningless we think it is...Besides, Mith Albom is an amazing writer, the way he tells the story makes it impossible to put the book down...I mean, just read it, and thank me later.
