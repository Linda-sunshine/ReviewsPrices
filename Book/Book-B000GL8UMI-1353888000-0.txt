review/summary: Great read!review/text: Somehow I've never managed to read this book, even in school. I'd seen it for years in the library, but was always turned off by the title/cover. To be honest, I didn't even know what it was about. However, the minute I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! With interesting themes and characters, this is definitely a must-read classic!
