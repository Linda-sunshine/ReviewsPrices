review/summary: Enjoyed it for a few chapters...review/text: This book is entirely too wordy. As great of an author as Aldous Huxley is.....he bogged this book down with every word in the english language. I'm no scholar or human encyclopedia, but I'm far from a moron. After learning the reasoning behind Jim Morrison's band name selection, &#34;The Doors&#34;, I found myself researching Aldous Huxley's &#34;The Doors of Perception.&#34; This was put into action because Jim Morrison was all about experimental drug usage and his decisions in life and poetry selections were due in part to many of his readings from Aldous Huxley's books. I thought &#34;Brave New World&#34; may live up to the hype, but I was wrong. I'm sure there's plenty of overly positive reviews on this book, but I'll let you be the judge.
