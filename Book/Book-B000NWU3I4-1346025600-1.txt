review/summary: enjoyablereview/text: I enjoyed this 'story in itself' - although I felt it was aimed at a different age bracket than the Silmarillion.An epic tale of Bilbo Baggin and friends in the precursur to The Lord of the Rings.The Ring of Power comes into the most innocent of hands - and the strings of destiny are pulled together.Enjoyable.
