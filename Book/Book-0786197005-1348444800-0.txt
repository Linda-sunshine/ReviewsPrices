review/summary: Fun Read!review/text: This book was really fun. It was action-packed. The beginning was a little odd, at least to me, but the rest of the story kept me interested.Since it's an older story, it's really great for adults like me who love "old-school" sci-fi. My son wasn't grabbed by it, by the way. So not sure if it's great for kids.
