review/summary: Amazingreview/text: This book came across my way in Target one day and I wanted it.It wasn't until that it was recommended to me by one of my very good friends that I had decided to finally leap and buy it.OF course relationship problems at the time -___- 75% his fault 25% mine (You know how some simple minded men are, they act straight foreign on you when you tell them you feel uncomfortable about something then they lie to you and expect you to get over it or just see that your feelings don't matter in this situation when it does because a Monogamist relationship consists of TWO PEOPLE NOT UNO) Yet this book truly explained some things.I've come at easy with some things and he has grasped a better understanding of how unfair he was being. I had to sit and read the chapters to him because he dislikes reading books @_@ Kinda obvious that I am the bookworm and he's the game whore.
