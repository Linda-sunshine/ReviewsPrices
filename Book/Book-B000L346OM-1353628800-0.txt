review/summary: One of the most important books I have ever read.review/text: This was required reading my sophomore year in high school. Though I had tremendous appreciation for it then, I find that reading it in my adult years has allowed me to more deeply understand the significance of the message. I think this should be required reading for all of us, at least by the early adult years. It will make you appreciate your life and the opportunities you have regardless of your circumstances.
