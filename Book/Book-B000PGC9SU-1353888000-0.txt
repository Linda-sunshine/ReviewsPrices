review/summary: Mixed Thoughtsreview/text: This is one of the first books I downloaded to my Kindle.I found it difficult to read and didn't finish it.However, his deliberate attempts at self-improvement, the little stories like being in a boat and being forced into the water to help get it safely to shore and his bitterness toward the passenger who refused to help made him more life-like than much of what you see and read about him. As for his flaws, they just make him human despite his attempts to eradicate them.Much of it had the feeling of the ramblings of an old man, not a straight timeline.If you are a history buff, I think you would enjoy plowing through this book. I may go back and try to finish it since first-hand perspectives are important and often different than those of historians.
