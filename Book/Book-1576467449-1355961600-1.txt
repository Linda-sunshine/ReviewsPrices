review/summary: Powerful character developmentreview/text: I didn't think that anything could be better than Dicken's Tale of Two Cities. This came very close. In fact, the character development in Great Expectations seems much deeper than Tale of Two Cities, possibly because the reader is not distracted by the current events of the time. I was amazed by the insights into human character and emotion as well as the portrayal of consequences arising from human behavior and choices..
