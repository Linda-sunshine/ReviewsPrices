review/summary: a classic, which surprised mereview/text: even tho we've all at least heard the musical, seen the movies, it's still a joy to read this. I was shocked, tho, at the unvarnished anti-semitism, which got me thinking and reading about the accepted anti-semitism in Victorian literature. I realize it'd been terribly ignorant.
