review/summary: All in onereview/text: I have enjoyed the Rings since the sixties, reread many times. I have three volume and one volume print editions, but bought this e-edition for the convenience for traveling, etc. There is little to say about the story that has not been said by critics, fans, etc. The notes were handy, the appendix is full, but the maps were lacking in detail upon enlargement, but that was a small issue compared to the portability.
