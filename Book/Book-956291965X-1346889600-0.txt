review/summary: Good Read, butreview/text: Haveing seen the movie I had to read it. I did not stop reading it after a few chapters which is my test. I felt young people would get some terrible advice from the Lord Henry. I feel that some of that part got boreing and skiped thru some of it. It is a classic and is well worth the read.
