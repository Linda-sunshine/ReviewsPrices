review/summary: Not quite like the moviereview/text: I have the seen the first part of the movie and wanted to read the book. I found it a very easy book to read (not like the 'Lord of the Rings&#34;) that took me about nine months to read. I have finished it and thoroughly enjoyed it. Can't wait to see part 2 of the movie.
