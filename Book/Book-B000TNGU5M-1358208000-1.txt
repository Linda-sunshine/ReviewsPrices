review/summary: Required Readingreview/text: It's difficult to say a piece of this anguish and depth was beautiful, but it was. It was written almost poetically, poetically in the sense that the truest poems cause one to cry, to labor, to desire to fix what is broken in the world. How Mr. Weisel demonstrates kindness in any form supersedes my understanding. While he questions his God, I wonder if it is only his God who could have sustained him after a series of such torment. Our children need to read it. They need to feel compassion for those who have suffered the inhumanity of a brutal world.
