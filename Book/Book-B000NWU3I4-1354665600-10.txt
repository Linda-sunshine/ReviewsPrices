review/summary: A book to read and read again!review/text: I have read this book before and enjoyed it even more this time. The characters are different and that makes them more interesting then most! A great story of loyalty, friendship and respect. I wish everyone would read this story with an open mind and with a desire for something that will take them away from the everyday characters of so many, many books.
