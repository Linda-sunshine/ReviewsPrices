review/summary: Every page has many a turn of phrasereview/text: I read this together with my teenage son, him for English class, and me for pure enjoyment and a re-read. We actually listened to the audible version as we read along on my Kindle - our own kind of 'full immersion' experience. What I found is that giving Dickens my full attention (vs. listening while e.g. doing yardwork, driving, etc.) really made a huge difference in my experience of this book - because there are do many delightful nuggets throughout this book! It was rewarding and fun to see in my mind's eye, and take pleasure in, the huge banquet of tasty and very often humorous nuggets offered. Many are in passing, like when Pip is in Wemmick's guest bedroom, with the head of the bed so close to the flagpole that he feels as if he's spending the night balancing the pole on his forehead.
