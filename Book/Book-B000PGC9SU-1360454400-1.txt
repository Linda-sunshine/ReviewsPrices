review/summary: He's hilarious... to me at least.review/text: Setting the standard for what the autobiography is today, Franklin tends to be much funnier than what people expect him to be. He maintains grounded with self deprecating phrases and a modest tone although with all his achievements as one of 'Merica's founding fathers you think he'd earned the right to boast a bit. It was a fun read and I'm glad I was forced to read it in class. A bit short for my liking though.
