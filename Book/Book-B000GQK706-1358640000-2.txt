review/summary: Bloody awful!review/text: This review is for the actual item listed, not the LOTR series. LOVE the series, HATE this rendition. Some of the actors overact to the point where it's distracting, and the others are just awful. The voice of Sam sounds like an 8 year old girl and Gandalf sounds like a senile old coot. The music is trite and the transition between scenes are confusing. Just awful!!!
