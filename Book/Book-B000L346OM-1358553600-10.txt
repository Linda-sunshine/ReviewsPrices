review/summary: A testimony to mankind's potentialreview/text: I had heard of Victor Frankl years ago, but never had the opportunity to read his work, and I'm grateful to finally get the chance to &#34;hear&#34; the voice of a concentration camp survivor. His observations on the ability of men and women to be more than just the victims of life's suffering are well worth reading and gives much food for thought. His ideas are as relevant today as when they were written.
