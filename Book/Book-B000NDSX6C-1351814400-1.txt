review/summary: Bilbo's Best Adventurereview/text: I must admit this is not my first reading of this book, actually it is my third. I first had occassion to read this when my sons were in Jr. High School where as part of its curriculum this was compulsory reading. So, as a result we read it together. I find it a highly entertaining adult fantasy and those who have little or no imagination are missing out on a most delightful escape from the daily hum-drum of life. So read if you dare!Now back to my new Kindle e-reader - I just love it and also not having to go to the library when I want a book. I just go into the Good Reads application on the computer, decide what I want to read, then simply key it into my Kindle and its there that fast. No more waiting for borrowed books to be returned. Wonderful!
