review/summary: A real delightreview/text: I was enraptured with this book. I recently started downloading the free classics when I got a Kindle for my birthday; the dialect is a bit diffucult as the book was written in the 19th century; but the awesome thing about the Kindle is you can look the words up right off the text.
