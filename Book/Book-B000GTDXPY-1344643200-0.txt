review/summary: Calamity Jayne ~ Fantasticreview/text: I got this book free from an Amazon download. One word for it: Wow! So well written. Funny. Engaging. I love the story, the characters were well done, and the mystery wasn't to revealing, so you didn't really know "who" until the end. You had some options in mind, but that was it. I enjoyed the book so much that I did something I rarely do.... I bought the series in a boxed set for my kindle! I normally don't spend more than a dollar or two for a kindle book, but this book was so fun... I just had to have the set. Love it! What are you waiting for??? Buy it now! You won't regret it.
