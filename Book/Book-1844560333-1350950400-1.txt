review/summary: Re-reading Pride and Prejudicereview/text: I don't know how many times I've read this novel. Lately, I've listened to it on audio books and read along every evening. Sometimes I would jump ahead and then re-read that section. It was so fun...I know it sounds a little odd. I bought a used copy because I have several others, unfound upon quick glance, scattered about the house. Nice, comfortable copy.
