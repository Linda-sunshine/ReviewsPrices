review/summary: Classic romance at its best.review/text: Can you imagine a more classic tale of romance?You are immediately transported back to the 19th century--I want tobring this book with me every time I travel to the English countryside.More than any other novel, this story really captures Austen's wit.Books these days are so lackluster in comparison, and it's becomeso incredibly hard to find a hero to live up to Darcy. I'm never, everbored when I pick this up--even on the hundredth read!PLEASE give this one a shot if you haven't already--you won't be sorry!
