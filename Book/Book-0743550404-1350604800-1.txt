review/summary: If you're interested because of "Haven", forget it.review/text: I bought this book because the television program "Haven" is based upon it. The word "based" should be preceded by the words "Incredibly vaguely". Two characters names and occupations are about the only things in common.Then, the book itself doesn't tell a story. It sets up a mystery, and by King's own admission, it's about HAVING a mystery, rather than SOLVING one. It was extremely short for the price, and I felt completely revolted at having spent ANY money on it.
