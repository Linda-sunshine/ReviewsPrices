review/summary: What can I sayreview/text: What can I say, this series came out of the blue and swept the world away. When I read this book for the first time 10 years ago as an adult, I read each following book with the same sort of excitement a kid has waiting for Christmas.Even though the movies were solid, they couldn't capture the flow, the humor, and the excitement that the books contains.
