review/summary: A great classicreview/text: I read this book in high school because 'I had to', it was required reading. I hated it. But when I got older, and could read at my own pace and place, the book is one of the best mysteries ever written. I can't imagine going to a horrible school like Lowood, but perhaps that was preferable to living with her Aunt Reed, a most disagreeable person even unto her death. I cried when she and Mr. Rochester could not get married because of the 'house secret'. She seemed to have such a hard life anyway, that was icing on the cake, or de-icing if you will. The book flowed smoothly and I even managed to get past the 'true English'. I've always had trouble reading English writers, but Charlotte Bronte is an exceptional writer. I like when she addresses her audience, &#34;Reader, you would not believe this but...&#34;, etc. As I said it's a great mystery, and autobiography, but I don't want to say more to spoil the story! Chance it to say, if you've only read the book because, 'you had to', read it again in a new light. I'm taking all of the books I read in my English classes that were 'necessary to read', and giving them a second go-round. This one was definitely worth it!
