review/summary: Everyone Needs This Bookreview/text: Still a timeless classic that seems simple but remains forgotten among numerous people today. I noticed it with myself & a few simple changes gave immediate positive feedback. I read it a few times a year, as old habits are hard to break. Carnegie really was one of the greatest regarding human behavior & observation.
