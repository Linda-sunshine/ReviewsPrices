review/summary: Inspiring Classicreview/text: I read this years ago and now am passing it on to another generation. Ms. Ten Boom suffers for her protection of Jews, loses her family, yet God frees her to do a wonderful work for Him. This book is a lesson about how God carries us through problems and crisis; it is also a stern look at what happened to innocent people and makes us think about the world in which we currently live.
