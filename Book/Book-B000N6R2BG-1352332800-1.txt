review/summary: Keeping Faithreview/text: Interesting unusual book but true to Jodi Picoult`s form of writing.Keeps you in suspense but the ending leaves you hanging and I would have preferred a definite ending not for it to be left to my imagination.However I would definitely encourage you to read this book if you love to get into a book and not be able to put it down.
