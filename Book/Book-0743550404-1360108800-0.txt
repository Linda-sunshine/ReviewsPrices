review/summary: Stephen King owes me for my timereview/text: I cannot believe this piece of junk came out from Hard Case Crime with the most deceitful cover in the history of literature. This is a campfire story, not a pulp or crime novel. I read it to see if King could write a serious crime novel and wasted a few hours.Hard Case Crime should have higher standards.
