review/summary: Slipped through the cracksreview/text: Somehow I had completly missed the Great Gatsby. I never read the book in High School or College, so I decided to give it a shot. It is a classic for a reason. The characters and setting are timeless. The pacing of the novel is perfect right up to the conclusion. Check it out before the movie comes out.
