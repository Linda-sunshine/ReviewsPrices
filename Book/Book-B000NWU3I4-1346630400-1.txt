review/summary: Grandson loves this bookreview/text: I purchased this book for my 11 year old grandson. He loves it! Has shown it to his 13 year old neighbor/best friend, and he thinks it is a good version of this book. His friend has also begun to read The Hobbit; they are critiquing it together. Thanks.
