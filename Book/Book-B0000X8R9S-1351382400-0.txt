review/summary: hatchetreview/text: I liked this book because it was an adventure book and a ether girl or boy book. The setting was the Canadian forest, there was a l shaped lake, tall trees, berries, and bushes. The story was about a boy named brain and there was a pilot, too. Brain was going to Canada to visit his father. His parents are divorced. He is on a plane with a pilot. The pilots chest starts to hurt. The plane started going down and there is a crash! I would recommend this book, it is really good. At first it was sad then I was happy for brain at the end.READ THE BOOK TO FIND THE SECRET
