review/summary: Worth Reading to Better Know this Periodreview/text: Gods and Kings is a good book for gaining insight into the politics of kings and priests in the years after David took rule. Austin does a good job of telling us how it could have happened. It's also nice to see how prophets could have influence on both the courts and people.I like stories to be more descriptive than this, one but Gods and Kings does help this Old Testament period come alive.
