review/summary: Isn't It Ironic?review/text: For a book that celebrates excellence in workmanship, it is ironic that the Kindle version of this book is so poorly formatted. The main problems seem to be centered on punctuation although there are some typos.I first read this book in high school and wanted to see if it made the same impact 40 years later. While I enjoyed it again I found it to be bloated - saying the same thing over and over again. What could be said in a paragraph or two is stretched over 5-10 pages. All right - we get it!
