review/summary: My first.fantacy book I've read.review/text: Purchased ebook: June 3, 2012. Owned paperbacks since the early 90's.Love this fantacy fiction. This was my first fantasy sci-fi book I have read. It had the perfect amount of fantasy to where I didn't feel like I was being assaulted by the make believe. Tolkien's story focused on the plot and kept the fantasy on the background.Own the paperbacks but I thought I'd buy this ebook edition too.Audio doesn't work but it's worth it for the other special editions added to book.
