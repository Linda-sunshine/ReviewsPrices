review/summary: good book, but not for me.review/text: It was a good book, I like the story line, but I'm not a big fan of the 18th Century English language, I found it very hard to understand some of the statments that the character were making, I had to reread them several times.This was a assignment for class, is really the only reason I read it, but I did enjoy.
