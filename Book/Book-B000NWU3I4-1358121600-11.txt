review/summary: A spectacularly written novel, that I highly recommend!review/text: I came to this book with no experience with The Lord of the Rings whatsoever, not having read the book or the movie, and I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is one of the best books I've ever read. Tolkien was a philologist, and his intense love for language shows in the quality of the writing Though this story was originally written for children, its tale of adventure and camaraderie is one that will amaze readers of all ages.
