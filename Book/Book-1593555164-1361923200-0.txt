review/summary: Easily one of the worst books I've read in a nice long timereview/text: I read the 1 and 2 star reviews before purchasing, and thought that I was well prepared for any potential disappointment. NOPE! There are pointless conversations, information is revealed by having Reacher explain very basic concepts to people who SHOULD already know these things, everybody ever said nothing - and these are just the stylistic concerns. There's the plot itself - never mind who pays for parking, who befriends an ex-sniper and goes to the range with him for years and pretends to be a s***ty shot in the random event his crazy ass sniper ways might be of use later??I gave the book two stars because I *was* entertained - it's just that my entertainment consisted of passing the book back and forth with my partner while we both screamed at the top of our lungs how bad it is, and drank waaaaaaaaay too much vodka for every time someone said nothing.
