review/summary: Depressing and thought-provokingreview/text: This was a classic I had heard about and seen/heard popular culture tell, but had never read for myself. What surprised me the most was that there was no assistant, no Igor. Also that Frankenstein hated what he had created. The book had many pages of remorse and it is very gloomy and sad. So much death and sadness created by giving life to something that should not be alive. I think Mary Shelley is trying to warn us that God is the only One who can create life. When we try, bad things happen. I don't think I'd read this again, but glad I did at least once.
