review/summary: Veteran Lord of the Rings reader, on tablet for first time.review/text: I've read this wonderful tale too many times to count over the years. With each reading, I appreciate even more Tolkien's amazing world of language, cultures and geographies, along with his wonderful ability to spin a story. It was convenient to have it in electronic reader form, but I missed the maps from the books. There is only a general map in the front and it doesn't do the job of the maps in the original three book set. Reading Lord of the Rings is like reading a historical account of a great war. Any such account needs maps for reference and context. For that reason, if you want the best enjoyment of this great story, get the printed versions.
