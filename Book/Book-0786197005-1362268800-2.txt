review/summary: Excellent reading, imaginative, original, and full of surprisesreview/text: Taking into account that it was written at the beginning of the last century, it is awesome the fairly amount of imagination that Edgar Rice Burroughs shown here. I know that some things will appear odd to some readers given the amount of knowledge gathered during the last century, but it is the spirit of that beats within this gorgeous adventure what makes it great. In fact, not all SciFi novels age this well; this novel works because the main characters are great and it tells a wonderful story full of adventure (let us wait and see what our grandsons think of our current SciFi novels, and movies too).I am not a big fan of spoilers, so I will not say anything about the story.
