review/summary: Very well donereview/text: This book is very well read but we found it hard to follow the characters when it is being read to us. We got it for our 7 year old and she was clearly not interested. We will save it for when she is a little older. It takes a bit of practice for this visual generation to learn how to &#34;listen&#34; to books.
