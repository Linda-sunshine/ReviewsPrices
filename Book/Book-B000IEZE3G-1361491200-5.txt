review/summary: So worth readingreview/text: I always said ewww harry potter I would never read or watch the movies. But my uncle bought me the book on my kindle and I read the book so fast it's not like any of the books I've ever read but I've enjoyed it so much I'm reading the next one and going to finish the series then watch all the movies
