review/summary: A mind-blowing experience.review/text: I was given this book as a special gift from someone I vaguely knew. The reason he gave it to me was because he saw in me a certain characteristic that reminded him of this novel, Atlas Shrugged.When I began reading this novel, I was lost in exile, isolated from the world and my life. I read this book with eager eyes, devouring page after page. I identified so much with this story, mostly because I was lost within society and my life because I felt as if I was denied of what I truly wanted. But everything we do should have a personal motive, and we should do it for our best interest. The characters in this novel sacrifice everything for society and the government, and they do it not for the money, but because it is their job. So what happens if everyone suddenly stops doing their job? The people who hold true power and true control are gone and the leeches of society are left flooding the city in chaos.This is real life. We may not see it every day, but it is real.What purpose do you have in your life? Are you living for others or for yourself?Though I am still young, Atlas Shrugged has been the most influential novel I have ever read. It is timeless and represents a philosophy that most may not agree with or understand, but to those who can identify themselves with this novel and philosophy, Atlas Shrugged will inspire you.
