review/summary: Thoroughly Enjoyablereview/text: Warriors Into The Wild by Erin Hunter is an excellent bookabout the life and times of cat clans that have shared theforest for generations. These clans include ThunderClan,Riverclan, Shadowclan, Windclan and Starclan. In addition,there are cats outside the major clans; such as, Yellowfang,Smudge and Barley.Hunter outlines a complex system of governance among thecats. Each warrior cat has an apprentice. Each clan has aleader and a deputy. In addition, there are cat queens andelders who dispense wisdom.The story opens with a wild catfight between ThunderClanmembers and an encroaching tribe of cats called theRiverClan warriors. Knowing their own turf, the ThunderClancats dived through some rocks and disappeared into theforest roughage without a trace.In another moving scene, Hunter describes the death ofRedtail from a stealth attack by the RiverClan . The ThunderClanceremony began with each member looking up to the Silverpeltthick band of stars. In the cat folklore, each dead cat in the clanwas said to represent one of the StarClan warriors in the Silverpeltconstellation. In an unusual post funeral event, Bluestar namedLionheart as a new deputy of the ThunderClan to replace Redtail.Eventually, the ThunderClan welcomes Rusty who is seen as apotential savior for the group. The medicine cat doesn't agreecompletely. Instead, he believes that ultimately the ThunderClanwill be saved by fire.Hunter's governing principles for the cats involves an organizationalhierarchy with leaders, deputies, warriors and apprentices. Thissystem of organization differs from the one envisioned byGeorge Orwell in Animal Farm. Orwell described a series ofcommandments for the animals to abide. And so, Orwell'sanimals can't sleep in beds, wear clothes, drink alcohol or killanother animal. In addition, all animals are equal.Warriors Into The Wild by Erin Hunter is a good beginner bookto introduce themes of governance in the animal kingdom. Hunter'sbook should be read and understood at some point before teens,high school students and other readers progress to the more complexAnimal Farm or William Golding's, Lord of the Flies.Credits: First Published on Blogcritics
