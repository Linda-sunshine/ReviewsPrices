review/summary: A book that will change your views on art and show u what aesthetics is, in a very witty and dramatic way!review/text: My friend told me about this book, maybe 2 months ago or so. His reccomendation was so promising that I was eager to get this book. After about a week I was in a bookshop and I saw this book, immediatly I had to buy it, and it was so cheap.I've read it in a week or so, and after I finished it, I opened the first page and began reading again - thats how marvelous this book is. The dialogues are so thrilling and full of witty but thought provoking aphorisms, especially from Lord Henry (one of the characters). For example: "I am too fond of reading books to care to write them.","Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing." ,"Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the cave-man had known how to laugh, History would have been different."Wilde writes so naturally, with no stifness and with so much humour!I won't go into the subject matter because you can get that anywhere on google. But I will tell you that this novel made me a fan of Wilde and also made me read more of his work!Next week I plan on getting his plays (also from Oxford World's Classics, because they put so much to provide you with a good introduction, chronology and resources about the book, and the format is beautiful and easy too read).It's not hard cover, but I like it better as a paperback, it is not thick and you can take it anywhere with you, and its cover and design is unique.
