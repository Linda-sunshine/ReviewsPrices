review/summary: Haven A Better TV Show Than This Bookreview/text: In my whole life I have always liked books better than their film or teleplay counterparts. However, for the first time the book feel very far from the Teleplay Haven that is presented on the SyFy network. Haven is supposed to based off this book, but I can find minimal similarities except that the show is in Maine, the characters have some of the same names, etc. The book is speculative, leaves room for major error and is hard to believe. A Colorado man has X amount of time within one day to get to an island off Maine's coast where he is found dead.The elderly newspaper reporters speculate how he could have gotten there with their intern of several months. Speculative fiction for a formulaic writer like King just doesn't work. I read the book in a few hours and was sadly disappointed.@krautgrrl recommends watching Haven instead of reading this shallow book.
