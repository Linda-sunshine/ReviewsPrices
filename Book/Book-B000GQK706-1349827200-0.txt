review/summary: Beautiful copy... for the shelfreview/text: The good news is that this edition is beautiful, from the moment you see the gilded edges and throughout the entire tale as you gaze upon the images included within. There is simply nothing quite like it elsewhere. Even the dust cover is better than any other.The bad news is that it is huge, and as such as it simply too large to be read enjoyably or comfortably. What I wouldn't give for those well-worn library copies, because this tome is simply too big to to curl up with on the couch at night.That said, it looks great on the bookshelf!
