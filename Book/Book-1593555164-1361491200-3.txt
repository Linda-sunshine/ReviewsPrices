review/summary: Not like the moviereview/text: A very good book, but don't expect it to be like the movie!The book goes to a few places that the movie doesn't, and that's okay.I read the book, then saw the movie, then read the book again....the differences don't make it bad, just different.I LOVE Jack Reacher, whether he's 6'5&#34; or 5'6&#34;!
