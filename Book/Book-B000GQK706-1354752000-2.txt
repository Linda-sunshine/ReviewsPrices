review/summary: The whole trilogyreview/text: Come on, it Tolkien! How many of us fans re-read these books over and over? I decided it's a series I wanted to have always available and the paper version is quite large and bulky. This is perfect for kicking back on a plane or car ride and drifting off to the land of hobbits and rings. Highly recommend this for all fans.
