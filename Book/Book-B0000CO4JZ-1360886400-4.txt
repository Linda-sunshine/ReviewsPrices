review/summary: Well-written....a Lost Generation soap operareview/text: With the movie pending, this seemed like a good time to re-read a novel I haven't picked up in years. So long, in fact, that I can't remember my first impressions of it. So we're stuck here with my impressions from the re-read:Gatsby, you fool. You're smart enough to pull yourself out of poverty and desperation (albeit perhaps not in the most legal way, but one takes what one can get) and then waste it all on a silly girl? How are we supposed to feel any sympathy for that? My guess is that we're not.Fitzgerald was one of the Lost Generation, so we have to expect a lot of pointless stuff here. That's not to say it's not interesting - on the contrary, it's a regular soap opera: love affairs, cheating, lying, crime, rich people, etc and so on. He clearly disdained the idle rich and this novel showcases that. Yet as much as Gatsby, Tom and Daisy irritate (especially Daisy, as we never really get to know her at all), they also fascinate, something I believe Fitzgerald was disdainful of.The most fascinating character, in my opinion, is found in Myrtle Wilson, the poor wife of a garage-owner who longs to escape her existence. Although Fitzgerald devotes far more time to Daisy, it is Myrtle who is complex and compelling in every way. If nothing else, you should read the book just to get a glimpse of her.The book, of course, is a tragedy. Or is it? Tragic events certainly happen, but it is difficult to feel any sense of sorrow or compassion for them.With the movie coming out, I would suggest you read this one if you missed it during your primary education years. At only 160 pages or so, it's a short read and worth your time if only so you can poke fun at the inaccuracies/exaggerations in the upcoming movie and talk about what Fitzgerald himself would have thought of the production. ;)
