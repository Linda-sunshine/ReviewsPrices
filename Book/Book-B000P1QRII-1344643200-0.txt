review/summary: Give me The Giver!review/text: The Giver by Lois Lowry - Book 1011AUGI read a lot of Lois Lowry as I was growing up, but I somehow must have missed reading "The Giver." My newest cousin-in-law, Jennie, recommended that I read "The Giver," and when I realized I hadn't already read the book, it shot up to the top of my list."The Giver" was a fabulous read about a seemingly utopian society where the people in the society are spared from any discomfort, such as hunger, war, even pain from a scraped knee.Each year, as children are groomed to perfection, the Ceremony concludes with the Twelves receiving their assignments, which are similar to careers they will have for the rest of their adult lives. Jonas is unsure of what assignment he will be given, and the entire community is shocked to find out that Jonas has a special task, with the Giver. The last Twelve to be assigned to the Giver had a disastrous outcome.Will Jonas be able to survive his assignment with the Giver?"The Giver" reminds me, in a way, of the movie "Pleasantville," where the townspeople lived in a perfect society, but also a society that lacked uniqueness, real love, and color. While "The Giver" has some darker undertones, it seems that the movie may have had some inspiration from the book."The Giver" was a quick read, a Newberry Award Winner, and a book to add to your Must-Read list, if you haven't already read it!If you lived in a utopian society, such as in the beginning of "The Giver" and "Pleasantville," what memories would you be able to live without?What memories would you be devastated to lose, or to never experience?Thanks for reading,RebeccaLike my review?
