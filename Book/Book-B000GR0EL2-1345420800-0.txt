review/summary: Genuine Story of God's Gracereview/text: This book has been very impactful in many lives, including my family's. It is a truly inspiring story of one woman's faith, courage, and love for God. Corrie ten Boom went through extremely difficult circumstances, but relied on the Lord's help throughout her entire life. As the book alternates between different times in her life, it tells the story of how she grew up in Holland, and was taken into a Nazi concentration camp along with her sister. It is amazing how God protected her and carried her through the fear and pain that she and her family had to endure. Ultimately, she never lost sight of who God is, and how much He had done and continued to do. She brought to mind Paul in the jail cell, worshipping God even in the midst of trials.I was moved by Corrie's extreme devotion to God and her love for others, including her enemies. This book is a great example of how Christians can live godly lives that serve others and honor our Heavenly Father. Anyone should read this book and no doubt will enjoy it and be impacted by it.
