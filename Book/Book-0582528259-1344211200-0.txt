review/summary: Excellently writtenreview/text: Spending some time reading some of the old classics that I've not gotten to before, and from start to finish, this one catches and keeps your attention. Very well written, and the descriptions of events and characters are spot-on for putting you right there in the story. The ending was not quite what I expected, but as so often in life, everything doesn't always turn out according to our plans, eh? I'll definitely read this one again!!
