review/summary: GREAT FOR HS STUDENTS!review/text: This novel would be a great addition to your collection of books read. The great Gatsby is written in manner that is relatable to the reader. The first time I read The Great Gatsby I was in high school. I found it to be a great masterpiece that I couldn't cope with putting down. (I even cried at the end...which never happens). I read It again as I entered college and it blew my mind away. It was pure magic and left me astonished by the language and the bittersweet romance of the hopeful but desperate Jay Gatsby vying for the affection of a married woman but his one and only true love. It seems like every time I reread this novel, I find another flawless element that always keeps me wanting to read even though I already know what happens.I recommend The Great Gatsby for all high school students because high school is a time in your life that one starts to find true deception in everyday life that can be very relatable while reading this novel. High school is a time where deception is laden and you have to find out who you really are and identify what is fake and what is real. Also, when you re read this this book at a later point in your life, you will find different elements every time that will inspire you to pick up this book many more times throughout your lifetime.
