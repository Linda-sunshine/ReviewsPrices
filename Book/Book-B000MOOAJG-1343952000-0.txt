review/summary: Buy the other onereview/text: I have been borrowing the 2008 version of this very long audio book from the Newport Beach Library for my vacation drives...I'm up to disk 33. It is narrated by Scott Brick and captivating. On the waiting list to re-borrow in Newport I got this 2007 version narrated by Christopher Hurd from the Irvine library. His voice is grating and uninspiring. I desperately hope I come to the top of the waitlist for Newport before I depart for vacation.
