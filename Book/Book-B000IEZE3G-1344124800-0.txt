review/summary: A fantastic book, but too much silver platterreview/text: I love the Harry Potter series, but the first book always bothers me because so many things are handed to him on a silver platter.Oh look, here, have a powerful wand, a huge pile of gold, an invisibility cloak, some extremely powerful allies, two loyal friends... and if that isn't enough, why not have the power to melt Voldermort with your bare hands!Seriously, Harry couldn't have failed in this book even if he tried. Everything is handed to him on a silver platter so it requires very little effort on his part.
