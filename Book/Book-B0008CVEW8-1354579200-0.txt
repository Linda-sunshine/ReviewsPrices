review/summary: Island Treasurereview/text: Another classic book is Treasure Island. It is wonderfully great and would be classified as the same as "Call of the Wild". Treasure Island is a wonderful book that can be read from anywhere and everywhere including having the book on an island and being able to look for treasure. Another timeless classic that has been past down throughout the generations and will continue to be passed down throughout the generations.
