review/summary: Can history repeat itself?review/text: Night is a terrifying book about the horrors, as lived by the author, in the German concentration camps. It's a very powerful book that stays in your mind for sometime after completing it. I have read it twice now and I was as moved during the second reading as I was the first. It is a true story that portrays the young teenager's struggle with his innermost feelings and conflicting thoughts about life, family, basic survival, and his God as he lives through the hell to survive. This should be required reading in our high school history classes, as the best way to prevent history from repeating itself is to make yourself aware of it.
