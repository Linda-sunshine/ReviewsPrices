review/summary: There are no surprisesreview/text: This book is pretty predictable. I can't believe these "help books" have any value. The author seems very proud of his accomplishments. The problem with help books is they tell you what you already know, or can figure out if you think about it long enough. This is the first and last "help book" I will buy. This guy is making money off this book and I'm embarrassed I bought it. "Five Love Languages" is a pat book on how to solve your marriage problems and offers pat solutions that really seem forced and insincere. Really, the best thing is to get some counseling. There is no easy solution.
