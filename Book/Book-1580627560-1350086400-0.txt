review/summary: HANDS DOWN I LOVE THIS BOOK!review/text: I loved this book so much, I began reading it a second time. Not only was it hilarious the entire time, it was VERY insightful. I found myself identifying with the "Nice Girl" in past relationships and a lot of times I covered my mouth in disbelief at how much I had really short-changed myself. Luckily, after having my heart broken a million times in my 26 years of life, I had already decided (prior to buying this book)that it was time for an attitude change. As a self-proclaimed nice girl, I always thought to myself "I wish I could be a bitch, but I just don't have it in me."This book showed me how to be a bitch without being a BITCH if you catch my drift. I was halfway there, with the person I'm currently "dating" but still had some nice girl tendencies. This book opened my eyes, and gave me the extra confidence boost to say "Yes, I do have it in me to be a bitch. I deserve better." I have a new outlook on not only dating, but my life in general.So Nice Girls, please do yourself a favor and get this book. I promise, your eyes will be opened, and tears will be spared.
