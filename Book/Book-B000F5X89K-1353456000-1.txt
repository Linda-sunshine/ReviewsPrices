review/summary: Cracking bookreview/text: Why I have never read this book before I do not know. The fact that it was written by Shelley when she was only eighteen or so makes it an even more remarkable story. Very easy to read and access the language. The misery of Frankenstein and his monster is described so eloquently, sympathy is evoked by the reader. As I say above, I wish I had read this book a.long time ago.
