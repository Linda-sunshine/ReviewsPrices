review/summary: It's reputation is well deserved.review/text: This was a surprising selection for my book club. I had seen the movie years ago and thought it okay. The book describes a period of growing up in difficult times with wonderful use of words and descriptive phrases not dated at all. This is, yet again, a case of the original book being much better than the movie! It is well worth a visit.
