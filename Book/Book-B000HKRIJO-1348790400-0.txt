review/summary: Mere Christianity by C. S. Lewisreview/text: Audio quality is great, content is classic C.S. Lewis. The contents of "Mere Christianity" were originally given over the radio during the heavy attacks of Germany on England during World War II. The significance of the information is increased by understanding the cultural setting in which they were first spoken. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to think!!!!
