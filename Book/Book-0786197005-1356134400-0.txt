review/summary: Must Readreview/text: Got into this after seeing the movie, it is a very well written and interesting series as all ways though the books bet the movie. However, unlike some interesting really enjoyed the movie adaptation and feels that it really didn't get the credit it deserves. But that usually happens when you are introducing a fairly unfamiliar character into the mainstream.
