review/summary: A classic?review/text: When I was reading this I kept wondering how it could be a classic. After I finished it I realized I kept thinking about the characters and the things they do and what makes them tick. This is what makes it a classic.HOw Fitzgerald weaves elements of time into the plot and how shallow relationships can be.
