review/summary: CLEVER STORY!!review/text: Have enjoyed Jack Reacher for a while, only discovered Lee Child about a year ago and am hooked! Jack is the sort of &#34;cocky&#34; self assured hero who does get hurt, but gets his quarry every time. One Shot is definitely one of Jack's more interesting investigations, more twists and turn than a pretzel - always interesting characters. can't wait to see how Tom Cruise is Jack reacher in the movie.
