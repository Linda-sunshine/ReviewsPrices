review/summary: Best Read Everreview/text: I used to think that his book series was the stupidest book series' of all time. Then, after much prodding by members of my school's quidditch team, not a joke, I finally sufficed. I finished this book in less than a day and I think I'm most going to likely maintain this pace for the whole series.
