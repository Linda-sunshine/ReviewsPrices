review/summary: Beauty is in the eye of the Beholderreview/text: I am not one to cry when reading a book, but this one made me cry, laugh and love. I have seen movies of Jane Eyre and they never do it justice. Very moving and so sad that a child should ever go through such things but I know that they do. This Jane show so much strength and honor. I only wish that I had read it years ago. This is a must read. If only the people of today would show this kind of strength our world would not be in the mess that we are in.
