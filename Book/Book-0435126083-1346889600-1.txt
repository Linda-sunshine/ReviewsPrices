review/summary: Wuthering Heightsreview/text: I didn't have the opportunity to read American Literature in HS and to be honest,I doubt I would have enjoyed this one as much back then. I feel when you reach a certain age,you understand more about life and,of course,there's nobody telling you to read it NOW! This is a well written love story and is about how tangled up love can become when you are denied to follow your heart. It's a sad tale but I enjoyed every minute of reading it. If you haven't read any of the Classics,I suggest you read this one,makes you want to read other classic books!
