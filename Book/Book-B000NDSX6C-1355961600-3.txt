review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: Lord of the Rings is a three volume read of an adventure of Hobbits against orbs, goblins, and various creatures in a clash of good versus evil. It is in my top five reads of all-time. The Hobbit is another adventure of a Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, and his elf compadres as they overcome a myriad of obstacles and their cleaver escapes. if you like stories of fantasy adventurism you will love this book with its plots twists and unexpected turns.
