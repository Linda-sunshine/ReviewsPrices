review/summary: A MUST READ FOR OUR TIMEreview/text: Although it is a long read, I loved listening to it on audiobook. Ayn Rand has put out a profound and tantalizing tale which can be applied especially to our time in history. It makes you ask quetions about how much the government should assist private businesses and shows the expected outcome. She is a fantastic philosopher for any time.
