review/summary: A very inspiring and encouraging book on Christianityreview/text: C. S. Lewis, with the help of the Holy Ghost and leading of our Lord Jesus Christ, managed to write a book that gives a deep understanding of Christianity not only to outsiders but also to Christians themselves. The former to seriously consider the radical change in their life, the latter to deepen their faith Christ and enhance spiritual growth. Soli Deo Gloria!
