review/summary: Worthwhilereview/text: The prose is very simple and easy to follow. This is a wonderful book to read if you just want to feel good, I really enjoyed it. I am looking forward to finding more books like this one. On a side note, I definitely had lots of fun reading the sections about the park; as I am a huge roller coaster enthusiast.
