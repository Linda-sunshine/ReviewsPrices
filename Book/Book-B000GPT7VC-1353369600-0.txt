review/summary: Just read Uncle Tom's Cabinreview/text: Good, entertaining, & enlightening book. Brought the tragic reality of slavery to focus. I did not care for, however, the endless biblical quotes & Christian bias woven throughout the book, as if it were fact & not one of many belief systems. I also disagree with the authors statement that non Christians degrade the world and become essentially evil.
