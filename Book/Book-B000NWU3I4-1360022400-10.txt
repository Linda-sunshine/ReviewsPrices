review/summary: Tolkien's introduction to Middle Earthreview/text: First read this book decades ago and picked it up again after seeing the first of Peter Jackson's three Hobbit movies to see how accurately he held to the story. I enjoyed reading it on my Kindle this time around. My conclusion is that Tolkien was a master at telling these tales, and Jackson is great at making them into movies.
