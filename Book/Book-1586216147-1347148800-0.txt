review/summary: The Notebookreview/text: Probably one of the greatest love stories ever written. True love, lasting love, from youth to death. Give yourself plenty of time to read it because once you start you will not want to put the book down until it's finished. What are you waiting for??? Buy it now, you will not be sorry.
