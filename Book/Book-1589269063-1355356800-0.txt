review/summary: Amazingreview/text: I was put on to this book from a friend. I'm not married but she knows of the issues I was having with my boyfriend and she suggested I read it. This ha opened my eyes so much. I loved that it was able to help me learn what I wanted in a relationship an what my boyfriend wanted. It also made me think of my parents, I am planning on buying the book for them go put a spark in their marriage.
