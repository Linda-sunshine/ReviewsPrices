review/summary: Uncle Tom's Cabinreview/text: I decided to start reading classic books....so sad I picked this as my 1st. This book is so slow & difficult to read with all the slang. I was raised in the south & still don't understand half of what is trying to be said. I will try to finish & understand what the great appeal of this book is, but cannot recommend it.
