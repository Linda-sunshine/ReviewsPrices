review/summary: Too creepy for mereview/text: This seemed like an important book, and I was in the mood for something serious, so I purchased it. It's just getting too weird and disturbing for me. I give it 3 stars because the writing is good - and maybe I'll pick it up again sometime, but I decided I wasn't really enjoying reading it, so I stopped. The scary thing is that some of it -- i.e., the repression of women -- sounds like it could happen today if the right wing extremists had their way. But it's really very creepy, even by their standards.
