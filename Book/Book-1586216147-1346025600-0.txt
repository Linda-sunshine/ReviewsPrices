review/summary: My first Sparks novelreview/text: This is the first Nicholas Sparks novel I've read. I loved the movie so I had to read the book.This was a wonderful read for an afternoon when you're in the mood for a great love story. It's something quick and easy, but also a tear jerker. It is a story about love not only in the present time, but lasting a life time.I will definitely be reading more of Sparks' novels in the future!
