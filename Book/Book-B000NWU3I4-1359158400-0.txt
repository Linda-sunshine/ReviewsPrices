review/summary: Timeless Classic for Children and Adultsreview/text: When you read a good book, you sometimes can't stop singing it's praises. In my opinion, "The Hobbit," is one of those books. I actually had not read this book until a few years ago, and regret not reading it earlier in my life. 'The Hobbit' is at one level simply a charming adventure story, perhaps one of the most charming and most adventurous ever told. If you haven't read it, you should, because it is quite enjoyable. Read it to your children and luxuriate in the excitement and joy that shines from their faces. That's enough.Many people often imagine heroes as strong and comely in form. Comic books are filled with mythic heroes whose exaggerated human virtues amount to "beat people up" good. Tolkien's protagonist is radically different than such heroes as, Lancelot, Beowulf, or Batman. Bilbo Baggins is small, mundane, weak and sometimes whiny. Of all characters in this story he possibly possesses the least amount of "fighter's instinct." Yet, he is not a completely mundane character. Bilbo is one of my favorite of all times characters as he is gentle, simple, and humble. He bears no grudges and desires no vengeance. Bilbo is indeed another breed of hero; A hero who succeeds though a mixture of luck and common sense. Bilbo is a unique take on the everyman hero!Gandalf is also a favorite of mine, despite being a deus ex machina in several situations. The wisdom of Gandalf along with his pure, unfailingly good, although slightly grumpy demeanor make him quite interesting, and mysterious.The Hobbit is an outstanding book that I highly recommend to all adults and their children!
