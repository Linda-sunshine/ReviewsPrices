review/summary: Your life is worth living, you are just failing to see the whole picture .. This is the book for me.review/text: The book brilliantly builds up, piece by piece, the answer to Eddie's question: "is my life a waste?". It's a simple process of revealing the big picture of Eddie's life and how his life is after all worth living. it's just that he could not see the whole picture when he was alive.The only thing i didn't like is the direct "Lesson"s the writer is giving us!! .. the lessons are obvious, so the writer is just repeating himself here as if to be sure that we get it :) .. at least it was too direct for me.
