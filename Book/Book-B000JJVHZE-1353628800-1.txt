review/summary: This mockingbird still singsreview/text: I've just re-read this work to see how it stands the test of time. The most impressive feature of the novel is the narrative style. The narrator is an adult remembering or reflecting on the story in a child's voice, a neat juggling act that mixes satire and naivete. The satire is reminiscent of Jane Austen, especially when Lee, through Scout's voice, tackles education, class, bigotry, and the missionary society. The indictment of race in the novel is well documented, especially the casual use of the "N" word, even by the children. While some may find the portrait of Atticus as hero to be overblown, it is a loving and touching characterization on the author's part. The scene where the children join Atticus to confront the potential lynch mob at the jail still makes me cry. It seems to me that Lee has been pitch-perfect in capturing time and place. My conclusion: TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD remains a classic of 20th century literature.
