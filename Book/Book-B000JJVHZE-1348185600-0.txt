review/summary: mockingbird o' mockingbird.review/text: I'm in the middle of this classic right now. I see why it is a classic. Its tale of racial segregation is one to stand in one's mind for a lifetime. I am getting a feel for what this novel is about. Wish there was another. I guess you can't duplicate a classic. Harper Lee's only work of publication but still upon reading is a masterpiece that should never be banned but taught to people why the content is wrong. Why certain terms for people were used. Never this book taken off the shelves via censorship and there rules that in some ways make points that set good standards. Some rules are bad. This book deserves not the out of print treatment nor edited cencorship. Morals of this story should be taught to people. Bad morals should have explanations as to why. This novel lives on in a glory need not disturbed by the senseless ones. This classic book will always stand the test of time. Mockingbird o' mockingbird live on forever.
