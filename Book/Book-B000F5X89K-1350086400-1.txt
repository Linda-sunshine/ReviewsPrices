review/summary: Not your HORROR channel b/w movie adaptation.review/text: Written in 1817 (published 1-1-1818), the English language is on a pedestal in this classic piece of literature. It took me a quarter of the book to finally get into Shelley's command and use of the native tongue, but from that point the reading sped up considerably. Yes, you will want to read this with a dictionary close at hand (thank you KINDLE for your fortuitous inclusion of an interactive, in-text dictionary feature).Frankenstein, and his Monster, are both used throughout the piece in ways that speak to the issues of creation, Creator, free will, and sovereignty.Inherent to the issue of "Monster's" path of death and destruction is the fact that Victor Frankenstein failed to, or was unwilling to, name his creation. Void of an identity, It was forced to spend its existence searching for an identity, as well as an acceptance from society.This is not your HORROR channel b/w movie adaptation. This s pure literature, filled with passion, with characters struggling with issues of existence that are paramount to ones survival in world in which they have been placed; love and hate, life and death, acceptance and rejection.While not a 'life changing' read in my opinion, it is a book with the power to cause one to evaluate one's life, and seek for a better, brighter tomorrow.Read the lines. Read between the lines. Let the lines speak to, and through you.I rate this book a solid 4 stars out of 5 on the following scale.+ poor read++ so-so read+++ good read++++ excellent read+++++ life changing read
