review/summary: Why didn't I read this soonerreview/text: Like many people (I assume), I read this book when I saw the disney movie was coming out, and the premise of the book intrigued me. This is a great book from start to finish. It's get just enough action, political intrigue, love, and adapting and overcoming in an alien land all mixed together and balanced to perfection. I'd recommend anybody who likes a good story to pick this up. My dad even went on to read the entire series. A solid choice.
