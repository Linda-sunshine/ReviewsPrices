review/summary: Amazing Storyreview/text: I remember owning this book as a kid and starting to read it more than once but never finishing it. After seeing it free for kindle, downloading it, and letting it sit in my collection for a month or so I finally got around to reading. I am so glad I have done so. I loved every page of this novel from start to finish and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a thrilling tale of piracy, discovery, and treasure. Treasure island goes down as one of my all time favorite books
