review/summary: Good read didn't want it to endreview/text: I have not quite finished this book but I find it fascinating. I came upon it accidentally and must say, I think I was intrigued after reading that the author had committed suicide and then posthumously won a Pulitzer prize. What a great loss. John Kennedy Toole obviously had much talent and who knows what potentially could have been written by him. The book is funny, touching, and downright bizarre at times. I am already sure I will be wanting more when the end of the book comes.Very bizarre way to end. Seems some of the backstory in the book was not ever completed, left me wondering what was the purpose of some of the characters.Still a very good book.
