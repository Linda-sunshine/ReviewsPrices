review/summary: A New Kind of Paranormalreview/text: For the original review and more, please visit markedbybooks.blogspot.comOk, so maybe werewolves and shape-shifters are getting kind of stale. That might be so. But what about mutants? Well, more specifically, humans with avian DNA and wings? Pretty cool, huh? That is the treat you are in for if you read James Patterson's book, Maximum Ride Series.The story starts off with meeting the FabSix: Max, Fang, Nudge, Iggy, Gassy and Angel. These kids are from all different backgrounds and ethnicities but they all have one thing in common: wings. They are 98% human and only 2% bird. You would think that these kids would be all weird and have twisted features, but that is not the case. The 6 of them have the most wonderful time together despite the fact that they are on the run from some psychotic loons that want to track them down and force them to be lab rats. Er...birds, sorry.They spend all their time running, hiding and pretty much being kids, that is, when they aren't kicking some serious butt. You see, when you have these things, well, mutants after you called Erasers, you kind of get an urge to run. Tell me, if someone came running up to you, yelling that Erasers were after them, you would either think, "What a nut," or you would want to help them. Its only logical.Anyways, throughout the book, (and the series) the six friends overcome obstacles, learn new fighting techniques, as well as run for their birdy lives. But despite all the drama and trauma, they still learn to love and work together as a family. Because otherwise, they get caught and made into soup. And who in the world would want that?GabbyFor the original review and more, please visit markedbybooks.blogspot.com
