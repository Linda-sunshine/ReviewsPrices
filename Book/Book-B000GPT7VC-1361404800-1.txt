review/summary: Read this book!review/text: Every American should read this book. I read this first when I was a teenager, but took away from it very little. A more careful and sophisticated reader now, I am impressed by the effort of Ms Harriet Beecher Stowe to present the unadorned truth about our bigoted nation, then (and now).Because the written representation of black speech is difficult and slow to read and many of the words used are not defined in the Kindle dictionary, or anywhere, be prepared for some frustration.
