review/summary: Be Grateful to God for Fleas as Well as for Flowers and Treesreview/text: What a wonderful history of two sisters and their family who lovingly provided &#34;The Hiding Place&#34; for Jews.Jews were hated and slaughtered by the thousands by the Nazis (National Socialist German Workers Party). My older brother, Wendell Hall, personally saw dead Jewish bodies stacked up like cord wood at seven Nazi death camps. His Army unit was the first to liberate six of them. Then, he was transferred to the unit that liberated Dachau. He was especially grieved at what he saw because his best buddies in the first unit were Jewish Americans.Fortunately, the Ten Boom sisters were Dutch, not Jews. If they were Jews, they would have suffered the same slaughter. Because they helped the Jews, they were traitors. They were imprisoned in a flea-infested women's prison. During prison processing, a kindly nurse surreptitiously handed the author, Corrie (Cornilia) Ten Boom, a miniature bible. All the women gathered together each evening after work at the one dim light. Corrie read the German Bible aloud while other bilingual women took turns translating it into other languages. Fleas were the reason they could do it. The guards never entered the flea infested building.Betsie, Corrie's sister, when they first became flea bitten, told Corrie to be grateful for the fleas. First, they were grateful because of their faith. Second, they were grateful when they knew fleas protected them in their perilous pursuit of truth. Truly AWESOME!
