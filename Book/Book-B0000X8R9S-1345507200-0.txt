review/summary: Hatchetreview/text: Girl, this was a great story. I'm in the 6th grade and I find this book interesting. Not only does it show that it's not easy to live alone, it teaches us to not take the little things for granted. Some of us wake up and bamm, food is there, but if there were only raspberries or turtle eggs to eat we would be looking crazy.This book has also showed me that I shouldn't give up no matter how down it may look. If Brian would have given up and killed himself imagine all the stories he would never get to tell stories he went through or the Secret. I think this is a book everyone should read and comprehend.P.S.- This should be made into a film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
