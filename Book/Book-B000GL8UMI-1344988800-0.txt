review/summary: Great Book, Great Messagereview/text: im in highschool right now and had to read this book for summer homework. normally i find reading books for class to be strenuous, but i really enjoyed this book. being the first time i read a piece of bradbury's work, i definently came away impressed with his unique writing style. it makes you re-think how we use technology in our daily lives and offers a future that is frightening to consider. a really good story to top it off, this book is well worth a read.
