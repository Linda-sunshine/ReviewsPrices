review/summary: Looking for something?review/text: I finished 1984 and I came back to amazon.com to write a review. Clicking from my booklist to 1984 to the review page, I got:Looking for something?We're sorry. The Web address you entered is not a functioning page on our siteApparently the version of 1984 that I bought is no longer available from Amazon.Shades of Minitrue. I wonder if I read the same book you did?As other reviewers have said: this book is a masterpiece. Orwell captures many details of life under a totalitarian regime. He backfills Winston's character with memories and dreams -- if I lived in that society, I'd spend a lot of time in my head, too. He proceeds from there to the economic and political system, presented both through Winston's job and his trips to the proletarian quarter and through The Book. And from there to philosophy. The man who tortures Winston explains why, down to the first cause.
