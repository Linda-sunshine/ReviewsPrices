review/summary: Horrifyingreview/text: If you haven't taken the time to read Uncle Tom's Cabin, then you have missed out on a compelling book about the horrific events that took place regarding slavery in America. I encourage you to read this book. Granted, it takes some time to pick up on the lingo, but very much worth the effort.
