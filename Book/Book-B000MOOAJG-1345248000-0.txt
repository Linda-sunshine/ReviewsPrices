review/summary: Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Randreview/text: Best book that I have read in a while. It is amazing that the events she wrote about is coming to past. This book sheads light on what this country is becoming. When ther is no reward for work then no one works. I need a reward to work hard. This story should keep the reader wanting to finish the book quickly.
