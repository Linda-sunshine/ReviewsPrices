review/summary: Don't use the film to judge it.review/text: This book and the film of the same name have very little in common. For instance, the romance is very played up in the movie and mostly incidental in the book. You'll notice that some of the villains are far more menacing in this book than you'd expected as well. I think that this book is a good book and really the movie seems as if it's from a completely separate story that just happens to have some connecting points. My only real criticism is that this book, like many from its time, is very long and you can get bogged down in details. Thankfully, Dumas' style is actually not that hard to read and the book felt worth it.
