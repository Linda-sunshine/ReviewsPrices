review/summary: Review from Theamwriterreview/text: This is the first book of many in the Harry Potter by J. K. Rowling. I absolutely loved this book. I was actually scared for Harry Potter and the information that he was told about his parents, not being fully accepted by his Aunt, Uncle, and his cousin. I like stories where characters are living one life and then they come into another life that is completely opposite from what he grew up with. I absolutely loved reading this book and I look forward to reading the others. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone that likes fantasy, wizards, magic in their stories. This is a good read.
