review/summary: Exceedingly helpful information for the man in your life.. or for you, if you're the man :)review/text: I am a relationship coach and recommend Dr. Gary Chapman's books to my clients, as well as to the people on my website. So many folks go 'Wow, I'd wish I'd known that before!' Knowing about peoples love languages makes it so easy to understand more of what they need. In my own relationship I can tell him when my 'love tank' is getting low and I also ask him how his is doing too. It's become a very useful method of communicating how well we are each communicating our love for the other.My sweetheart is an 'Acts of service' love language person, while I'm a multiple love language personality. Being able to say 'Honey, my love tank is a little dry in this area right now', is a far better way to get my emotional needs met, than to be hurt and angry because he's not giving me what I need. Plus, when our love tanks are full, we are both far more inclined to give more love to the other.This book really says the same thing as 'The 5 Love Languages', but it is put into a male perspective. I highly recommend reading this book. It will assist you in understanding how to give different people in your life what they need to feel appreciated and cared for. Even coworkers, parents, siblings, children and friends! It has the power to improve all of your relationships if you choose to use it :)
