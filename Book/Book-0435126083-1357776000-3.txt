review/summary: Forget about (I say FORGET) about seeing the movie!review/text: A dark and visceral piece, shocking, frightening, at the hands of a great story teller. The love story between Heathcliffe and Cathy is only part of Heathcliffe's tragedy. I was not prepared for the second half of the book, which is where the devilment of the hero is displayed. There is nothing in current literature with which to compare it. A compelling read, but hold on to your hats.
