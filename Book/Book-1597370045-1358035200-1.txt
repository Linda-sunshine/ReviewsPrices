review/summary: The Picture Of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wildereview/text: This is the first book by Oscar Wilde that I have read and I am glad that I chose it. It is also the first book that I have read using my new Kindle. It was a good experience both with the Kindle and the book. I highly recommend it. I now understand why Oscar Wilde is considered a great writer. Kelly Robinson
