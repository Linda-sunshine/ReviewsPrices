review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: The story and the book are both excellent. However, for me, the footnotes that line both sides of each page are a bit distracting. I guess my eyes have just been trained to automatically jump to find a numbered footnote when I see a referenced footnote number within the text and I've had to consciously avoid doing that because it's like going back to school rather than merely reading for enjoyment. The storyline can easily be understood without the footnote, making the footnote quite distracting. But going back and reading the footnotes at a time other than when the text is being read is quite enjoyable and enlightening.
