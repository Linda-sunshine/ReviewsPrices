review/summary: An inspiration to read the O.T for the first time 'again'.review/text: At first I was a little skeptical as to the soundness of the technique in the telling of the story because it took me by surprise to have an ancient Jewish story told in the modern vernacular. But Ms. Austin pulled it off, and I was intrigued. Her method of storytelling was an inspiration to go back and re-read the various books of the Old Testament.To be honest I did read all 5 of Lynn's books. I was engrossed with the first one and it was free. Amazon's marketing technique is a wonderful thing!
