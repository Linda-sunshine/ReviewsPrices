review/summary: Wish I could buy this for youreview/text: With so much useful information, you would have to be crazy not to buy this book, especially for the price. Don't think of this as a self-help book because my instant thought after hearing that phrase just shy's me away from it. Think of it more as a book on advice for getting along with everyone. The information that is given is most certainly relevant to one's daily life and can be implemented almost immediately. I guarantee you will learn something after reading this; and the best thing is that you can practice the information without getting out of your comfort zone. I'd recommend this book to anyone that is capable of reading.
