review/summary: Left unsatisfiedreview/text: Stephen king is best known for horror, to state the obvious. This is a mystery story that makes you forget you aren't reading horror. The character development is Kings typical A+. Because it is engrossing, you don't realize until you are done that there is no action, only narrative. And although you have been warned from the start that there is no satisfactory, neat, wrap up, it is still a shock when that's exactly how it ends. If you can't stand an unsolved mystery then this book is not for you. But if you value a good spin that leaves you saying "I bet this is what happened," then you will enjoy this book. And be sure to read the afterword.
