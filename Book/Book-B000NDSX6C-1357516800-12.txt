review/summary: Nice edition but not for a first versionreview/text: This book is amazing. I love the depth of the details it offers, plus all the photos and illustrations... It gives a very interesting and deep perspective of the Hobbit's/Tolkien's world.However, all that extra info kinda gets in the way if you are reading the story and want to get lost in it.Really something you do not want when reading it for the first time.Highly recommended if you want to go deeper though :)For the rest of you, I would recommend the 70th Anniversary Edition [Hardcover]
