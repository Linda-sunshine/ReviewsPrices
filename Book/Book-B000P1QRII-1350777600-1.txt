review/summary: COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT WITH A DIFFERENT ENDINGreview/text: The GiverLotte's reviewI loved The Giver the moment I picked it up. But the more I read the less I liked it and the more confusing it became. I had a million questions I wanted answers for when suddenly just like that (snap) the book ended. I couldn't believe it. It was as if the author didn't know what should happen in the end, so she just made up an ending and finished the book. If this book hadn't ended so abruptly it would ha e definently been one of my favorites!
