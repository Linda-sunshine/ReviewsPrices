review/summary: Wowreview/text: I'm engaged and we have been together now 4 years. We've had our moments and sometimes I could not understand why or how we got there but this book made everything make sense. It has helped me realize what we both need and lack. I can see what we are good at and still need to work on before, we walk down the aisle!thank you so much! Every couple must read thus regardless if you're married or not
