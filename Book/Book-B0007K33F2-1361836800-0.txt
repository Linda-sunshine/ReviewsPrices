review/summary: Great Storyreview/text: This is an excellent book. I love the classics and had somehow managed to have never read this one until last year. Amazingly, it feels like a story upon a story upon a story. It has the beautiful quality of building anticipation from beginning to end and continuing the story when you are afraid it is about to end! More recent books always leave you with the feeling that you want to know what will happen next when the book has ended, this story gives you everything you could ever want and more beyond your imagination. I highly recommend it!
