review/summary: OPENS A DOOR OTHERWISE UNSEENreview/text: I loved reading this books so much that I've read it again from time to time to refresh my memory on all the info and the stories that are packed in it. It's not only inspiring and motivating but also very realistic and understanding that things aren't always perfect for two people. This is highly recommended to anyone seeking to improve a troubled or a perfectly fine relationship. It's eye-opening and is fun to read with your partner.
