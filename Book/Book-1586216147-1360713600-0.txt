review/summary: Okay but overratedreview/text: Nicholas Sparks is obviously a good writer which is why he has sold so many books. But I expected this book to be better considering how good his other books are. I have read the Last Song and Walk to Remember which both were at least three times as good as this. I think it is because this was one of the first books he ever wrote. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad but I wouldn't reccomend this book for those who have never read Nicholas Sparks books. His other books are much better.
