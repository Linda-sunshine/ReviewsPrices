review/summary: My boyfriend's nuts about it!review/text: Atlas Shrugged, the second part of a 2 part series, follows The Fountainhead in an exploration of corporate America in the stranglehold of government-sanctioned creation and regulations that stifle the creative spirit. The hiding of the greatest minds in this book show that industry cannot be successful unless it is given free reign to create and bloom. A good read for anyone who's willing to think higher than a 5th-grade level, and should be required reading for High School levels!
