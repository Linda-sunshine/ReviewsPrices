review/summary: Bad formattingreview/text: I downloaded a badly formatted kindle version of the book. No indented paragraphs. No indentions at all! I really felt cheated but I'm new to the series so I don't feel so bad as those who read it under a different title. This is a prime example of the publisher being greedy.
