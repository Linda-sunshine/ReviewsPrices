review/summary: Heartbreaking, Yet Warmreview/text: I love how Jane is a character that I could relate to. Even though her circumstances are unique, as are everyone's, she's a regular human being with regular emotions and reactions, just like the rest of us. There's a little mystery and plenty of heart.
