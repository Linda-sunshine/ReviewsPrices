review/summary: Easy, practical. But don't forget to trust your instincts!review/text: During my pregnancy, I read so many "baby books," including Baby Wise, the Baby Whisperer, and Happiest Baby on the Block. Once our little bundle of joy arrived, I thought HBOTB provided the most helpful, practical solution for sleep problems. (Also liked Baby Wise's overall advice re: sleeping and eating, but took some of the specifics with a grain of salt.) (Don't get me started on how Baby Whisperer caused me to obsess to the point of tears trying to follow the "EASY" schedule -- my fault for relying on it too much, but it just did not work for us at all.)Having skimmed some of the negative reviews, I agree there is a lot of padding in the book, but to me, that just comes with the territory of these types of books. It doesn't diminish the effectiveness of these methods.Our little one is 19 months now. She was never, ever a "natural" at falling asleep (particularly for naps). Due in large part to these methods (and I will also add a plug for the SwaddleMe brand swaddler--a lifesaver), it became easier and easier to put her down for naps and bedtimes. In fact, she slept for 7 hours straight beginning at 4 weeks, and 11 hours straight at 6 weeks. 12-hour nights came shortly thereafter. Part of that is due to her easy-going temperament and lack of health issues, but it was also thanks in large part to Dr. Karp's words of wisdom.
