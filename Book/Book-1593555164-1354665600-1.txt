review/summary: Tom Cruise is not right as Reacherreview/text: Intrigue, knowledge and action abound in this suspense and action thriller. Definitely a page turner. Lee Child writes his books with an economy that is very pleasing to the reader, and is able to pack twists and turns into this well thought out story.
