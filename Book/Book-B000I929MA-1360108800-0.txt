review/summary: The holy grail of feminist thought and distortion of reality. Nothing more.review/text: This book contains every typical, boring, stereotypical jab from an author who obviously doesn't understand the passages from the Bible that she uses to build the whole foundation of her book. Ironically, the passages from the Bible she chooses to depict man's oppression sanctified by God were thought up, instigated and executed by the WOMEN in the passages, not the men. Note to author, please do more research on the main platitude of your book, so it can have validation. She obviously has an ax to grind with Judeo-Christian principles and uses this book as a platform to distort, cast aspersions, and instill fear regarding these belief systems.Regarding the story- extremely depressing, no hope, no good verses evil, just twisted grossness and blah. Her main character is weak, conviction less and incapable of making any exciting moves in this story. After I was done reading this book, I could find no takeaways, except there are no ends to the misunderstanding of Christianity and no shame in extorting it to promote women's rights and freedoms and the author's weird understanding of what that means. I read this book because so many other people have and wanted to know what all the hype was, instead I'm mad I wasted my time and money.
