review/summary: A classicreview/text: To read Jane Austen's articulation of the English language is an experience. This book reveals a good picture of English country living among the genteel. It is humorous with a touch of seriousness. I had previously read this book but as with all good classics, it is worth reading again. Kindle books are the way to go. So accessible and convenient.
