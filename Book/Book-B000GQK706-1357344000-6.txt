review/summary: What can I say? It is LORD OF THE RINGS. IT IS AWESOME!review/text: My favorite thing about this version is that I get all of the LOTR books for under $10. (kindle version that is) The book is really good. Harder to read than the hobbit, and sometimes I get lost with all the historical places and characters that are mentioned but when I get to the sections that describe the actual adventures I find the reading much easier again.
