review/summary: Pride & Predjudicereview/text: Why is this still being published? How does anyone finish this stuff? The women are pathetic, their lives meaningless; the men are shallow; thank goodness I don't have to live in such a self centred universe. I'd rather shoot them all in the first five pages, and let characters who are trying to contribute to others' lives get more oxygen. Talk about suffering for Austen's art - she did, so we have to too? Give me strength!!
