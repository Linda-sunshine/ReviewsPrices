review/summary: Simple format, fantastical readingreview/text: I had to give this version of the Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien a high rating. I bought the Kindle version for an excellent price and have been reading away hours. The novel itself is a classic fantasy, a must read for all book lovers for its quintessential place amongst the genre. The story is, while now tired in the face of an ever-growing bulk fantasy output, still held high by the cachet of its deep lore and consistency. The interesting tale of the various editorial and publishing history is discussed in the foreword. My one regret with the otherwise very readable and superb Kindle version is either the lack of or my inability to access any of the Middle Earth maps that are provided in the text version. Geographically important details in the book (a book very focussed on details!) can't be fully appreciated without access to these maps more readily. Other than that, great fun to read!
