review/summary: A must read regardless if you are not in a romantic relationship!review/text: I love this book! I've shared it with several friends and relatives who have all enjoyed it. This is applicable to all relationships (not just romantic ones). I don't know exactly how much the "male" version varies from the original but I've shared this particular book with couples who did not seem to notice a difference. They are both fairly androgynous. My boyfriend and I read this book over a year a go when we were still dating. It gave us dialogue we needed to express our abstract thoughts and feelings. His commitment to reading this book while reflecting over it together wooed me. Till this day he asks me "how is your love tank?". Definitely full!
