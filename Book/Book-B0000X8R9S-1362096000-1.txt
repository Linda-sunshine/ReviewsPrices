review/summary: One of the best books for both young and adult readersreview/text: I am happy to be able to express my enthusiasm and admiration for this book here. Hardly ever you can find such uplifting and inspiring story, so carefully written, with so wonderfully proper and meticulous choice of words. This book teaches you, no, it simply shows you how to live, how to be happy even when facing seemingly insurmountable problems, and it achieves it without pompous moralizing, providing you at the same time with riveting story of breathtaking events. I think the book has had influence on my and my son's life. I read it more than 10 times. I wish I had talent of Gary Paulsen to write so simply and so deep at the same time.
