review/summary: Like every other Nicholas Sparksreview/text: While this book may make you cry and is sweet, it definitely made me see how typical Nicholas Sparks is. He uses the same themes or ideas for most of his books and they are all very similar. Because the story seemed so familiar and unoriginal, I really didn't enjoy it. If you have read several of his books already, I don't recommend this book. If this is the first Nicholas Sparks book you have read, you probably will enjoy this book, although others like Dear John or The Last Song are better.
