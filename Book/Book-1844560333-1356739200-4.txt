review/summary: I never tire of this novelreview/text: What is there to say that hasn't already been said? That in my head I switch back and forth between Colin Firth and Sir Lawrence Olivier as Darcy? I'm certain that's been said.....read it for the first time or read it again. Top 5 best opening lines of a novel ever.
