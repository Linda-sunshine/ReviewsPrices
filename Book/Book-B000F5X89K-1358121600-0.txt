review/summary: Excellentreview/text: It took me a few pages to get used to the writing style, but it's well worth the read if you're fond of the English vocabulary and a gaze into the true desires of the human spirit. It's a dense, sad tale of loneliness, contempt, regret, and some of Mary Shelley's daddy issues. Definitely not the story you see in movies. Still, I'm left wondering why this original version hasn't been made into a very smart, very intense movie.
