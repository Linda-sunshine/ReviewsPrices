review/summary: Who does not like Wuthering Heights?review/text: I certainly liked it.... I guess the only thing that is so very frustrating to me and most surely the point of the novel, is the destruction of all involved in this story. The love is not love at all but total obsession and selfishness. Its a cautionary tale. I used to think it was supposed to be romantic, but after reading it and also seeing the BBC version of Wuthering Heights I am convinced that Emily Bronte thought to diadactically show the writer that what some call love is no LOVE at all.
