review/summary: Dracula best vampire book everreview/text: Dracula is is now and always will be one of my favorite books to read, as I am a fan of anything relaated to fear or horror as long as is not a slashermovie or book, the way he goes about selecting his victims and then going after them is both inriguing and at times frighting, and I think anybodythat likes a good viampire book will like this.
