review/summary: Love the blurb!review/text: I look through a lot of free kindle books on a daily basis, so the title, cover, and blurb are very important to me. The title has to stop me long enough to click on the link, the cover needs to look professional and hint at the storyline, and the blurb must be easy to read and tell me a bit about the story.This one stopped me with the title and cover, and the blurb was well-written and charming enough to make me want to read the book. I just wanted to say congratulations to the author for a great presentation. I look forward to reading the book.
