review/summary: Absurd Novelreview/text: Lee Child is disappointing. When reading his other novels, you are sometimes uncomfortable with what you suspect are cliches. In this one he writes about my home state, and it isn't simply cliche, it is absurd. He is a Brit writing about Americans with a completely biased attitude. The plot line is absurd. I won't bother to read any more of his Jack Reacher novels.
