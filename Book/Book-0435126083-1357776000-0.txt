review/summary: A Most Unpleasant Readreview/text: I gave this one star, not because you can go no lower, but because it is well-written and has a coherent story line. Aside from that, however, I found it quite lacking. I personally found the story to be dreadful and unpleasant. I generally have no issue with unpleasant characters or unhappy endings, but aside from the writing style and Bronte's ability to hold the story together in a clear manner I found nothing enjoyable about it, and pleasant or not books are meant to be enjoyed, elsewise you're wasting your time.
