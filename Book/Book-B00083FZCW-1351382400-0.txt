review/summary: maximum ridereview/text: I read the book maximum ride and I think other kids would enjoy this book because of how make believe it is for example how many books have you read that are about a 98 percent human and 2 percent bird creature. This book is defiantly a four and a half is because I don't like that it's a sires, but other than that its very well written and it gave me such a rush of emotions all at once take for example when I found out max was a girl. I was thinking about how she always has to be in control and reasonable not just for herself but also for the others that has 98 percent human and the other 2 bird. How else this amassing author got to me was when angle got taken and max automatically went to get angle even though I didn't work quit right. I was sad for angle but I was moved when max tried her hardest to get her back. Even though this is a made up I stilled believe every word like it was actually happening the charters had so many emotion that she didn't tell the reader but she showed the read I know that was how it was for me. The end of the book was good because it didn't show an illusion of a fairy tale ending but it wasn't a terrible ending were every one dies even though some of them are mean enough where they should but anyway I thought it was touching and anybody lucky enough to read it would think so to. My favorite part is when max goes and helps a poor girl that is getting bullied and then when she got shot and the nice girl took care of her.
