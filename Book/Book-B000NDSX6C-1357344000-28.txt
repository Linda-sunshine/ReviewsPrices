review/summary: Very Enjoyable Readreview/text: With the movie just coming out I decided I better read the book before I see it in a theater. I was very glad I did. I really enjoyed reading this book. It was easier reading than I expected, and it was really fun. I loved the adventure, I loved the imagery that was painted in my mind. I loved the themes found throughout the book. Definitely a must read for anyone whole like fantasy/fiction novels!
