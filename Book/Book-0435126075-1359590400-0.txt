review/summary: My very favorite of the classics!review/text: I love the classic British romances, but this one most of all. The language is dated and a dictionary is needed to understand fully Miss Austen 's meanings. Many other authors fail to fully satisfy the way this does. Every young woman dreams of her own Mr. Darcy.
