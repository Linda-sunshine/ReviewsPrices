review/summary: Excellentreview/text: I read this book for school, and was really surprised that I enjoyed it. Ray Bradbury wrote this book in the 1950s and it seems that he was pretty accurate about the things that people would do in the future. I really enjoyed the way he wrote the book, it seemed very lyrical at certain points.
