review/summary: The book, &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34;review/text: I thought I was purchasing the book to download onto the Kindle. My daughter told me it would be the actual book. I have thought of returning it, but I may keep it and read it the old-fashioned way. My grandsons like the book also and i may pass it on to them.
