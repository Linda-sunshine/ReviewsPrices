review/summary: Compelling readreview/text: I rate this one of Lee's better stories. The plot is good and the way he leads you along into the truth of what is happening is tantalising.This is also the one that's the first movie from the series. Unsure about Cruise as Jack though. Doesn't fit in my minds eye with the description of Reacher we all know.Time will tell.
