review/summary: Ben Franklinreview/text: This autobiaguphy of Ben Franklin was OK but it just stops when he stopped writing his journel for some reason.--Having read other books on Franklin he was one of our founding fathers but he was not much of a family man--His wife died while he was living in europe without much said about it. She wanted to come and stay with him and he told her no. She died alone.
