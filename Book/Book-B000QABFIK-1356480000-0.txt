review/summary: Touchstone bookreview/text: I first read this when I was 11, or rather, it was read to me. I read it over and over all through my teen/college years, since the story follows the main character through all those years. Certain pivotal experiences are still the same. Also a great piece of historical fiction to learn about immigrants, boss politics, urban slums and expansion in the late 1800s/early 1900s. And it says a lot about poverty.
