review/summary: A Timeless Adventure Classicreview/text: I had never read this book until I downloaded it for free on Kindle. Wow! How did I ever miss this one? In my youth I read Tolkein, Burroughs, Howard, and many others, but, somehow I never got around to reading Treasure Island. Not only is this one of the great pirate tales, it is also THE buried treasure book, and, one of the truly great adventure stories of all time. While there are many that will find fault with some aspects of the story, all in all, I would suggest that all would-be writers desiring to tell a tale of adventure should take the time to reread this tale before they begin their labors. I should say that having done so, the bulk of them would recognize how far short their own efforts fall. Technically; the book is extremely well written, the plot moves along at a brisk pace, the characters are well drawn, and the dialog sparkles. There is plenty of action, adventure, and suspense, all of it told in a crystal clear prose that wastes not a word. In a nutshell this may indeed be one of the greatest tales of adventure ever told.Although it has traditionally been perceived as a story for younger readers, having just read it at middle age, I believe that you shouldn't consider this a children's tale. Long John Silver is as darkly evil a character as ever appeared in print; he seduces men with a ready confidentiality, warm, friendly, knowing banter, and then cold-bloodedly murders them when their back is turned. He suffers no scruples, knows nothing of mercy, and sells anyone at anytime to the other side if he thinks it will profit him. I think Long John Silver would have done well as a Wall Street corporate raider.
