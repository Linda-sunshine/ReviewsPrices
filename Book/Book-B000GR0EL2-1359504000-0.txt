review/summary: Some books are priceless and worth rereadingreview/text: I read The Hiding Place many, many years ago. So when I came across this 35th Anniversary edition I was immediately drawn to purchase and read it again --- almost as if for the first time. This story is as important now as it was then. There are special stories that have an impact on our lives and contain elements that cannot be defined. I highly recommend this to anyone who is ready for a chance to make a difference.
