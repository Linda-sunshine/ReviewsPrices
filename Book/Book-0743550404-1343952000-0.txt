review/summary: Liked it, but nothing like Havenreview/text: I liked this story immensely; the open ending made me keep thinking about it long after I was done reading. My main thought is about why are we so sure the Colorado Kid took the ferry at all? The ferryman was said to have a drinking problem, so his placing of him on the ferry at all is suspect, and if he could have chartered his own plane, couldn't he have chartered his own boat? :)That being said, I specifically bought this because I love the show Haven and the credits say it is based on this story. How? The newspaper men exist in the show- barely, the bar is called the Grey Gull, and there is a picture of the Colorado Kid- that's about where the similarities end, so if you are looking for a story about "the troubles," etc. you won't find it here.
