review/summary: Visionary, but difficult to readreview/text: The prescience of Ayn Rand makes this book a must read for those who are interested and engaged in the politics, and psychology of our world today. This story has great insight into the dangers of socialism and communism as well as the pitfalls that come with the belief that the good of society outweighs the good of the individual. However, Ayn Rand often gets bogged down in her narrative by repeating her philosophies over and over again, just using different words and multiple examples of the same. The speech by John Galt is, at times, rambling, and goes off on many tangents. But as a whole, it is both entertainig and thought provoking. Be prepared to dedicate a great deal of time and thought to this book.
