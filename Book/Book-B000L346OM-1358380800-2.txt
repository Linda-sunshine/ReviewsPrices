review/summary: Bird IIreview/text: Being able to find meaning in suffering... very interesting to read! Thinking that only through suffering we are able to find meaning in are lives is something I felt strongly about but after reading this book, that true meaning to are lives doesn't necessarily have to come from suffering and isn't any less meaningful. I'm glad I read it.
