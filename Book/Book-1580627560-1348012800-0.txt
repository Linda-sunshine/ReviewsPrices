review/summary: Why Men Love Bitchesreview/text: I never really thought about what being a "good girl" meant. It just was who I was. While reading this book I could not help but bust out laughing at seeing myself in most of the chapters. I WAS the one that had given up her life and loved to try and be what I thought someone else wanted. I was not doing either of us a favor. I found an inner strength I didn't know I had after reading this book. I am still nice...but now a nice for me first. It's liberating!!!
