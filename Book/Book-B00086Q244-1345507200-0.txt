review/summary: A Helping Bookreview/text: This Book I read some twenty years ago. This was such a good book that altogether changed my behavior. This is a book that must be included in school course. This teaches the reader to behave and find success.This book impacted much on my life and relations. I followed this book almost all the time.I gifted this book to several people during last twenty years. Surprising, none of them read and find its treasure.
