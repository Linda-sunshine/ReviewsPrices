review/summary: Good readreview/text: This is my first time reading this book at 23. I liked the story a whole and I think it is one all young (or old) people should read. However, I gave it three stars because I didn't have that moment of "WOW!" I did enjoy the writing, but I think it very unlikely I'll read it again.
