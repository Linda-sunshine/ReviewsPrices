review/summary: Reviewed by Read2Reviewreview/text: With the new release of the film and because I revisit the Lord Of The Rings books each year I wanted to revisit The Hobbit. It's been a favourite of mine since I was a little girl. We actually read it at school as one of our "book list" books.The story of Bilbo Baggins is an exciting one. Hobbits don't usually leave the Shire but as Thorin and his dwarves along with Gandalf turn up on Bilbo's door he is encouraged to take an adventure with them. From the minute the book starts I was pulled into the story and found it hard to put the book down.The way Tolkein writes is pure genius. He paints a picture with his writing and Middle Earth, possibly thanks to the films, was so easy to picture. The characters are very easy to like or hate depending on how Tolkein intended them. Bilbo, the hero of the story, is someone that stays with you when you aren't reading and I found myself wanting to read more and find out what was happening.I think it is fair to say that since childhood the books have always been quoted as amongst my favourites. The Hobbit was one of the very first books that made me fall in love with fantasy and even now, 20...... years after my first reading I loved the story as much as I did when I first discovered it. It will stay in my heart probably until the end of my days.If you haven't read the book yet I would highly recommend it to you. If you don't fall in love with Middle Earth like I have I would be highly surprised."There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world."I give The Hobbit 5/5.
