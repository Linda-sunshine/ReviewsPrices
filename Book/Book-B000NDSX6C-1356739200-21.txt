review/summary: GREATreview/text: This is a great book full of fantasy and adventure. I swear as soon as I finished this I immediately went to get the fellowship of the ring. I couldn't put this book down and would recommend it for everyone out there. Now if you excuse me, I have to catch the first hobbit movie.
