review/summary: Brilliant but depressingreview/text: This modern classic paints a vivid picture of the shallowness and dishonesty of high society and of the futility of pursuing nostalgic dreams. Fitzgerald's characters are very believable, but all tend toward being loathsome, pathetic, or some combination of the two. This is one of those books that is definitely engaging and memorable, but not necessarily enjoyable.
