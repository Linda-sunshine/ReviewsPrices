review/summary: Fantastic!review/text: This has got to be one of the greatest books I will ever read. And this is coming from a 5th grade boy. I love classics, and have read books like Treasure Island and A Christmas Carol. But this may just be the best of the three.Now I want to say specifically to Pete, yah, you know who I'm talking about, that how the heck could you say this book is bad? IT'S AWESOME! And then I want to say to aaman or whatever your name is, come on. Really? Did you have to write TWO reviews on how bad this book was? No. And then there was someone else who said they tried to read it twice with their mom, but hated it. Anyway, I'm on very low battery, so I need to go. Good-bye.
