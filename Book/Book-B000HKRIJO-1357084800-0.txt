review/summary: Given as a Giftreview/text: Mere Christianity by C. S. Lewis was a requested Christmas gift by a college-aged granddaughter. Having read the book years before, I knew it would be a good choice for her as well. I was pleased to find the Gift Edition because it includes pictures and narrative that set the historical stage for the original articles. I believe she will find this adds to her understanding and enjoyment of the book.
