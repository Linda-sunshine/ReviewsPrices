review/summary: Moving and Enlighteningreview/text: This book is touching and moving. Makes you stop and think who you may have touched in ways you never realized...or who helped shape your life.It has certainly made me rethink my words and actions. I want to be someone that somebody may "meet in heaven" someday. And I certainly know what my heaven would be!
