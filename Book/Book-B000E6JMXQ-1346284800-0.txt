review/summary: a trial to readreview/text: I can not describe how much I did not enjoy this book. It took me 5 months to read it for a reason and I consider 5 days a long time to read a book. So much description and no plot made this book feel like it was 1000 pages long. It just never got anywhere. I cared nothing about any of the characters and finished it only so I could say I did.
