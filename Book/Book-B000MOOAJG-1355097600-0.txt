review/summary: The fiction book that became fact.review/text: It is a nice story, you need to read it twice. Once to see where it goes...Who is John Galt. Read it the 2nd time to put the pieces together....all of the clues are there. First you cruise through it...aha! I got it. But...did you? Fancisco told you and told you....but you need that 2nd time to see it in a different light. This book will stun you with the relevancy to today, including the same regulations and laws....named a wee bit differently, but they are now here. For such an old book to see the future, and Ayn Rand did see the future through her past, you will be stunned. READ THIS. READ THIS. The most important book you will ever read. A 2nd book would be Taylor Caldwell's &#34; Captains and Kings&#34;. You realize the world is not everything you thought.READ THE BOOK and twice if you really want to see the clues...to see the writing on the wall.
