review/summary: Okayreview/text: If you want to get a copy of The Hobbit anyway and are interested in some side notes, this is good. If you are buying it for the side notes in particular, my opinion is that it's okay but not great.I was expecting deep insights about Tolkien's writing, such as whether he had something in mind (like from WWII, etc.) and symbolized it with something in the book or not, if he &#34;massaged&#34; something over time to finalize and perfect it, etc., and there are some notes like this, but most of them are mildly interesting to boring notes on word derivations, etc., which disappointed me. Do the &#34;Look inside&#34; thing at Amazon or something to see if it appeals to you. Not bad but not what I was expecting.Of course, you still get the book text itself, which is a great read, and this is a good price for that alone (although I prefer the edition that has &#34;illustrations by the author&#34;, with more Tolkien, and obviously includes the entire book text too, and also at a good price). If you're a student of writing and/or of Tolkien, this annotated edition is probably a very good buy, but if just a person who enjoys The Hobbit and hopes to get great insights into it, okay but I don't think great.
