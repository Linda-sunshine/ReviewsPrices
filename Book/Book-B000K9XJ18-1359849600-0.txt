review/summary: Action packed with a fascinating, twisted plotreview/text: Jack Reacher outfights and outsmarts as only he can; if you didn't already harbour suspicions about the ethics of America's mainstream crime-fighting organisations (aka FBI) you can hardly read this book without feeling some level of concern.
