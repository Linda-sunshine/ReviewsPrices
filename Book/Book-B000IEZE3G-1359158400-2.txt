review/summary: still unpleased!review/text: I have learned to not purchase a used book anymore. I believe my standards of what a good used book is and others are different and that is okay. I am not unhappy with this seller, I have just learned my lesson in purchasing a used book. Not the sellers' fault. I have no problems with the seller. They did try to replace the first one, and when the second one still wasn't good in my opinion, I knew it wasn't their fault. Thank You Seller for trying.
