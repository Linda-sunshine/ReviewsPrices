review/summary: Outsanding, thoughtfu thriller - and in the movie version Cruise is able to 'pull it off'!review/text: Childs pulls U into his novels with Jack Reacher putting together bits and pieces of the puzzle bringing them together in an exciting climax. The book was outstanding, as are most of his Jack Reacher series - 17 to date. I'd give the movie 3 1/2 stars, and Robert Duvall's part added his particular personality to it.DL; Cloverdale, CA
