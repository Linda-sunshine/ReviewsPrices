review/summary: Amazing Book!review/text: The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who finds himself in the middle of an adventure when Gandalf the Gray, a wizard, shows up at his door, bringing 13 dwarves with him. The dwarves are starting a quest to reclaim their lost home and gold from the dragon Smaug. Bilbo loves his home and his simple life, but he finds his Tookish side forcing him in.I was extremely happy with The Hobbit. I thought it was masterfully told, and I enjoyed Tolkien's style. I particular like how he is very straightforward, and doesn't force the reader to feel emotion. Instead, he presents the plot and allows the readers to feel on their own. I was often surprised by how casually a death or important, emotional event was told.My only criticism of the book would be that there are too many characters. The 13 dwarves are named Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori, Nori, Ori, and Thorin. Although the names are rather amusing, it is often hard to remember who is who. Having all of the names (except Thorin) very similar to at least one other name can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it is very amusing, and it can help you remember their relationships, such as Fili and Kili being brothers. It can also make you feel like you know all of them when you really don't. On the other hand, it can be confusing at times and it can distort your perception of how many people are in the party.In conclusion, I was extremely happy with The Hobbit, and would highly recommend it. I loved the story, how it was told, and the themes present in it. Although I thought there were some issues with the characters, it was a very impressive read. I am definitely going to be reading more Tolkien.
