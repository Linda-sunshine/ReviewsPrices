review/summary: Never disappointsreview/text: As it always has, GWTW sweeps you up in its story about a woman who faces down adversity and never blinks. Scarlett may have flaws, but when trouble comes, she's the one everyone turns to for answers, and she's the one who has solutions. For many women, especially myself,it's still the most compelling American novel of all time.
