review/summary: The most romantic book everreview/text: I suppose it's needless to review the story. It's nice to get a copy of Jane Eyre on my Kindle - I like re-reading bits from this book from time to time, it's kind of inspirational. This edition's minor (and - it seems to me - the only) shortcoming is the impossibility of going to any specific chapter via &#34;go to&#34; option.
