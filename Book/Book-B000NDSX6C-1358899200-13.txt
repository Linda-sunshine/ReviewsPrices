review/summary: Teen bookreview/text: I've read the Lord of the Rings series as a teenager and I remember myself being completely fascinated. 10 years later, I've read the Hobbit, after seeing the movie (The Hobbit: An unexpected journey) and it was okay, a little boring at some points. Maybe the target audience should be teenagers.
