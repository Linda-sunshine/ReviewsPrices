review/summary: Sheer torturereview/text: I shouldn't be writing this, as I am apparently missing something in this book. Jane Austen was obviously an intelligent lady, had great facility with the language, was able to make keen observations, and had a good soul. But reading this was an exercise in grim duty. I could not have cared less about any of the characters or the outcome of the "plot." The one character with any potential of interest was Darcy, and he turned out to be a very dull boy. This seems to be the 19th century version of today's romance novel, written for a certain audience. Nothing wrong with that, I suppose, but I would rather even read Russian novels of the same century--another literary torture chamber, but a more interesting one.
