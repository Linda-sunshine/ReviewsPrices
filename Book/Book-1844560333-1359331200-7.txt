review/summary: Always a pleasurereview/text: I have been reading Pride and Prejudice every few years for the past thirty years at least. It is always a pleasure. The Kindle version gives me one more access to a book that I love. The characters in this novel have endured the test of time for a reason. They were well thought out and developed by a master of her craft. Every time that I read it I feel as though I am visiting old friends.William E Sherrill,
