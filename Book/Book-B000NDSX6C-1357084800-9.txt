review/summary: One of my favorite booksreview/text: I first read The Hobbit in 1980 and once I got several pages into the book, I became enthralled in it. With the new movie coming out, I wanted to read it again as a refresher and I had just bought an iPad mini, so I though I'd go electronic instead of reading my old paperback. It's definitely more convenient than carrying a paperback. My only complaint is with the Kindle app on the iPad: it doesn't support playback of the attached audio files.
