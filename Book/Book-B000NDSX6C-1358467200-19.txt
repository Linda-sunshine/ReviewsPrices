review/summary: The Best Fiction Story Every Writtenreview/text: I read The Hobbit several times while growing up but hadn't read it in some time. After going to see the first installment of the movie, I decided to buy the book to reaquaint myself with the story since it had been many years. The movie is severly disappointing and deviates from the original story quite a bit. This is the REAL story.The book is written well and flows in a manner like life flows and is hard to put down. The charactors are alive with personality the descriptions are full of imagery and the adventures are wonderful. Do yourself a favor and save money on the movie. Read the book instead.
