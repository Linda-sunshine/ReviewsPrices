review/summary: Amazingreview/text: I liked the book. I also really liked that it followed a lot of the original movie. Worth getting this. I gave this a 5 star because the story as was very leveled,a and not straight forward. Total buy, I recommend this book to every one I know. I watched all 3 movies (including Disney's ' version) and I also did a play with it. It was all very nice, and this was probably my favorite. I recommend this to friends, family, and every one. Good job Charles Dickens, you made a 13 year old read!!(:
