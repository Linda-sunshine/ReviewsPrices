review/summary: Finally got (back) around to this one.review/text: I first read this book about twenty years ago when I was home sick from elementary school. I don't know what made me choose it, I don't remember much of it...I don't even remember if I liked it or not, really, so maybe I should stop saying that I've read this book twice. Re-visiting it was really more like picking it up for the first time except for a couple of scenes that felt vaguely familiar.For the most part, I can see why this book is a classic. An author's creation of an entire world, with new creatures and politics and history, is one of my favorite things to discover (if it's done well, and this one was). I loved the gentle, familiar narrative voice and its occasional side commentaries. I greatly enjoyed watching Bilbo learn that there is more to him than he thought (this, I suspect, is the real appeal of this book for so many readers: if plain old Bilbo Baggins can embark upon such a dangerous journey and live to tell the tale, what may life have in store for us?). I liked that the characters aren't perfect, that they make mistakes but also experience successes. After all, minus the elves and faeries and goblins and dragons, isn't that what life is all about?There wasn't much that I didn't like about this one, to be honest. I probably won't read it again anytime soon, but that's only because I've got so many other books on my to-read list. However, once my son is old enough (he's only seven months old right now, and I'm already thinking about which books to introduce him to), I'd love to read this to him as a bedtime story. I look forward to sharing this journey with him.
