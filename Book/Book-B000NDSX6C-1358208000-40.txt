review/summary: Lost in Tolkien 's worldreview/text: Everything about this book is magical. I was transported alongside Bilbo in all these adventures. Never has a book had such an impact on me. And not to mention Tolkien 's style of writing! Eloquent and fun and just beautiful. I am sad now that I have finished it because I did not want the adventure to end but such is life.
