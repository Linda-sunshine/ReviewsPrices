review/summary: Fun for all ages!!!review/text: Alot of people think Harry Potter is just for children. I am a twenty-something year old and love this series!! It is for both young and old! This is by far the best series I have ever read and I have read Twilight, Hunger Games, Fifty Shades of Grey...etc.
