review/summary: Amazing undersea adventure!review/text: Only four stars because of the amount of skimming I had to do because of the massive quantity of scientific nomenclature for the fish and other creatures encountered. Beyond that, this book is an amazing adventure story with triumphs and dangers that make you feel the atmosphere of almost every scene! It makes the movie seem mundane.
