review/summary: The Future Looks Scaryreview/text: I can see why so many people love this book! Ray Bradbury truly is a master storyteller. I instantly gelled with this book and could not stop reading until I knew what was to become of Montag (and those poor outlawed books!!). The writing contained the perfect level of description - it painted vivid pictures in my mind, yet never got hung up on the mundane.And the story! Though written over 60 years ago, I found the plot and underlying messages to be very applicable to modern life. It was a sad, yet fitting portrait of our obsession with technology and pointed towards that frightening theme of "the future is bleak". I'm always a total sucker for these dystopian novels, but this one takes the cake - or at least a hearty-sized slice of it!
