review/summary: Uglies #1review/text: This book started off slowly for me. I was interested in how the story would turn out, but it took quite long for me to really get into the story. In the beginning, I thought I'd only want to read this first book of the series, but now that I have just finished the book I do want to continue the series, just not right now. So my mind changed a lot during this book. It was not bad at any point, it kept getting better and better from the ok start. I would've given the last half of the book 4 stars.So I liked the story. But I would have wanted a little bit more out of the characters. In the beginning I also felt that at some points an event was rushed to get to another point in the story. If the story would have been written a little differently, with the emphasis on the events that were written at the last half of the book and a little more introducing the characters, I would have given it more stars. If I did not too many books to read right now, I would continue the series immediately because the ending of this one..well you know how they make these books! :)
