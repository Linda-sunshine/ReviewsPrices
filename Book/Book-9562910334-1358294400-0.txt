review/summary: So eerily propheticreview/text: There are very few books that make you afraid for the future and current day as much as this. This novel will make you look at today's changes and wonder how much of it is truly science fiction. Almost 30 years beyond the predicted time, this book reveals how foolish and unaware we often choose to be. To remain free, we must be unwilling to relinquish our knowledge no matter what others may think. No other novel has directly changed my thinking (so far) as much as this one.
