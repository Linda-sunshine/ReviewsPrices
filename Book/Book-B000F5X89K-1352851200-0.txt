review/summary: An eye-openerreview/text: It often occurs that the movie version of a classic novel differs greatly from the book, but in this case the difference was astounding. The original B&W movie bears almost no resemblance at all to the book. The "monster" is actually benevolent and good-natured, and becomes violent only after being mistreated. The novel focuses much more on Dr. Frankenstein's personal struggles with his own actions. Worth reading just to set the record straight. (I read the Kindle German translation.)
