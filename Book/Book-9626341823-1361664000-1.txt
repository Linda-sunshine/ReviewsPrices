review/summary: Great edition of A Christmas Carolreview/text: Love Robert Ingpen's illustrations - they work so well for this story in particular. As far as I can tell, this is not abridged either which is a huge plus. If you want an edition of A Christmas Carol on your shelf, this is definitely a good one.
