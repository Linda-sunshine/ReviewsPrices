review/summary: Running Blind Reviewreview/text: I started reading the Jack Reacher series because I didn't have anything else to do. Waiting in a hospital waiting room I bought the first book on my Kindle because I'd remembered there was a movie about them coming out. Anyway, the first book wasn't that bad. I enjoyed it. Then second and third were okay, but not as good as the first. Then we get to this one. Book four. Running Blind. When I finished it, it left me feeling angry and confused. Which is not emotions a writer should want to leave his audience with.The book follows Jack Reacher's involvement in a serial murder case being led by an FBI task force. There were several problems right from the beginning with this whole setup. First, Jack Reacher was involved with the FBI before in Die Trying (book 2). He rescued the god-daughter of the President, a rising FBI agent. One of the main characters in the book was the director of the FBI. Fast forward a year and now none of these people exist? They're not even mentioned in the story, like the author even forgot he wrote the second book. It's very annoying, because it makes a lot of the driving force behind Jack Reacher's involvement in the FBI case unbelievable.Second is the method used to commit the crimes revealed near the end of the book. It's just plain stupid. It's like someone commits the perfect crime and at the end the author couldn't solve it himself. He made the crimes too implausible. So the explanation at the end is terrible and leaves the reader angry and confused.Don't buy this book.
