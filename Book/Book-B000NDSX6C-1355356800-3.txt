review/summary: Great for kids learning about J.R.R Tolkienreview/text: My 7 yr old son became interested in the Hobbit after a Lego catelog showed up with Lord of the Rings and Hobbit themed lego sets. He tried to read my copies of the LOTR and the Hobbit, but it was a little to much for him. I was excited to find a graphic novel version of the Hobbit. The pictures are engaging and keep to the spirit of the story. I know it misses some details that you will only get from reading the originals, if he loves the story as much as I do then he will eventually read the full length novels when he is older.
