review/summary: Loved itreview/text: As a fan of the LOTR books and movies I decided to read The Hobbit before the new movies came out. I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. Just by looking at the number of pages I knew it wouldn't have the same depth as LOTR (which is what I wanted) but the fast paced and fun story was great. Different that LOTR, but still great. After reading this I'm considering some other works by Tolkien that take place in Middle Earth.
