review/summary: Timeless Classicreview/text: Read The Hobbit 35 years ago for the first time and many times since and throughout my life it has been a joy and a comfort. Knowing that Smaug will be defeated, that Gollum's ring will find it's way to safer pockets with brighter futures and that in the end the inhabitants of Middle Earth are not so different from ourselves. A children's book that grew into so much more. Professor Tolkien's written words are the true magic that the movies can never truely portray. Bought the Kindle version, my paperback is rather 'delicate' from being reread so many times, and illustrations and maps are clear and all included. Will continue on my quest to reread the Tolkien series on the Kindle, what better way to spend the afternoon than with old friends.
