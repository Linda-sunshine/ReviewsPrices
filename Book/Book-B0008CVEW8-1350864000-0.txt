review/summary: dover classic novel great stocking stufferreview/text: Any of the dover classic edition paperbacks are great stocking stuffers, economical, and it is always my policy to encouraging readingto young people. This review is either for Treasure Island or A Christmas Carol. Both are books I highly recommend as reading toany pre teen, teen or adult.
