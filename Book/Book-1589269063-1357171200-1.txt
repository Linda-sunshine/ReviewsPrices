review/summary: Potentially life-changingreview/text: Learning of these concepts has literally changed the way I look at my relationships in my family. It has helped me figure out what makes the others &#34;tick&#34; and, therefore, informed the way I interact with them and interpret their behavior with me. I could not more highly recommend this book (or audio book)!
