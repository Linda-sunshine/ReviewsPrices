review/summary: Hilariousreview/text: My sister loaned me the book and it took me forever to start it. But when I did, I couldn't put it down. Hysterical book about a man who lives in his own little world out in our own little world. The cat in the weenie cart part had me crying with laughter. BUY THIS BOOK! Absurdity at it's best!
