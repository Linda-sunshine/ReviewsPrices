review/summary: Love This Versionreview/text: True to the original. Love the illustrations which look like what would have been in the original. Easy to read font and so far no glaring mis-hyphenations (which bug me no end). I read A Christmas Carol every year and having such a convenient &#34;copy&#34; is really handy as I shop and read while I eat my lunch.
