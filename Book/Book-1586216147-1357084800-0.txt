review/summary: Timelessreview/text: This book is one of my all time favorites. I've seen the movie countless times. I've read the book one other time. Some say this book is sappy. Well it is a Nicholas Sparks book. He is known for the sap. That's why you read his books.I enjoy reading the love story of Noah and Allie. It started out as a sweet innocent love that turned into something so much more.How many women would love to be loved the way Noah loves Allie? I know I would. Soul mates are forever. Time does not end love if its meant to be. Neither does illness.My heart breaks for Noah time and time again.
