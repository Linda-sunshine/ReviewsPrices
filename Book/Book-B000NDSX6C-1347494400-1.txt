review/summary: Hobbit Reviewreview/text: This was one of the best purchases that I have made in a long time. The Hobbit is a very difficult book to read, but with these audio tapes, it made reading the book so much easier. The announcer was so amazing and I would buy another audio book from him. My daughter and I were able to breeze through the Hobbit with these tapes, whereas before, we had a very difficult time understanding the book. I am so glad that I purchased these tapes, a very smart move, well worth the price.
