review/summary: 5 Love Languagesreview/text: I think this book is one of the best books on relationships I have ever read. Had it been around earlier, it may have saved my first marriage.I am happy to see that the majority of reviews concur with me. I am frankly shocked by those who gave it a 1 star, what were they reading? It is a must read for couples entering a new relationship!I gave a copy to my son and daughter-in-law and insisted they read it before they got married. Nothing guarantees success in a relationship, but better understanding your own needs as well as your partners, sure improves your odds! I am not a book lover! I'm a doer! But this book was a real eye opener as well as an easy weekend read for those of you who are like me!
