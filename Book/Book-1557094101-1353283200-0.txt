review/summary: Great bookreview/text: I had this book when my son was a baby and I read it to him every night. It was his favorite book. Now he has a son and I purchased it for him and also one for my daughters daughter who will also enjoy this book. I also bought one for myself so I can read it to them when they come to my house.
