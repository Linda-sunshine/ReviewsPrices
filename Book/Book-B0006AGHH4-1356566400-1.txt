review/summary: Uncle Tom's Cabinreview/text: Orginally being from NY, I don't remember reading this for our reading in English, my husband is from FL., it was mandatory reading in his school. I ordered this, as I read this story, I was sooooo very upset, how African Amercians were treated during the era of this book,Cival War 1852 many times, I had to put this book down, cried with Uncle Tom, a man of humanity. Talking with my husband who went to school in the south, he told me stories about how civil rights for white and black were different, busing, water fountains, bathrooms, I am appalled about what he saw, where I grew up, I went to school with African Amercians, where they would come to my house, go to theirs, I was taught just because their skin is a different color, they are all the same inside...I still have dear friends I went to High School with...I love getting together with them. This is a powerful book, if you have not read this, just give it a try....
