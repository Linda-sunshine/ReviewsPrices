review/summary: Inspiringreview/text: I don't usually read stories about concentration camps and the Holocaust because I find them too upsetting and depressing. I received this book as a gift and I didn't touch it for a year. But, I'm glad I finally read it! While this book absolutely exposes human behavior at its worst, it also shows it at its best. The Ten Boom family is an inspiration to me and an example of faith and gratitude. Throughout the story, the family relies on their Christian beliefs as they struggle to choose whether to help others and risk punishment and then later as they are imprisoned in a concentration camp. I loved this family and the fact that it was based on actual events saddens me but also motivates me to be a better person. A favorite part is when the father has been arrested and is told they will let him go if he promises not to help anymore Jews. The father answers, "If I go home today, tomorrow I will open my door again to any man in need who knocks." Another favorite part is when the sisters find reason to be thankful for fleas. This book will lift you up.
