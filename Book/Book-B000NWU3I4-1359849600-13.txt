review/summary: I can listen to Rob Inglis read this story over and over!review/text: The performance by Rob Inglis is spectacular. He has a different voice for each character and you get to know and love each one. I actually look forward to driving to work so I can listen to him. I listened to samples of other audio book recordings of the Hobbit but they do not compare to this version. I am planning to try the Rob Inglis version of the Lord of the Rings trilogy next.
