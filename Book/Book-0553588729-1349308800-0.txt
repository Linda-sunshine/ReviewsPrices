review/summary: Closest thing you're going to find to a Baby Owner's Manual...review/text: Get this book and read it cover to cover before your baby arrives and you will be well prepared! I got this book instead of attending the class at my hospital, which was highly recommended for new parents. The class was based on the book and I am completely satisfied with reading the book instead. I used nearly all the techniques in this book and my baby rarely cries unless she's hungry. We had her sleeping straight through the night from 8pm to 7am before I went back to work at 12 weeks.
