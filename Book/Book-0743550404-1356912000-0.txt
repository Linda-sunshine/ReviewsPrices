review/summary: Review of The Colorado Kidreview/text: I purchased this book to get a possible insight as to the plot of &#34;Haven,&#34; which I enjoy. I can see how Haven is based on the book, but there was no resemblance to the storyline. I am also one of those who likes the mystery to be explained, and The Colorado Kid just leaves you hanging.
