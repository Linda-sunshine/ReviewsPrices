review/summary: Must have for any LOTR fanreview/text: My father read the Hobbit to me as a bed time story when I was six. I read the book for myself by the time I was eight. My paperback copy fell apart with constant reading by the time I was a teen-ager. I am so glad to have a permanent copy that will not fall apart, get lost and always remembers my place. Next purchase - the LOTR trilogy and quite possibly the Silmarillion
