review/summary: Riv's Reviewsreview/text: I thought the first half of this book was life changing. I highlited many passages and have referred to them several times after I had finished the book. There was just enough story mixed with philosophy to be on my level of understanding. His ideas are in line with my own form of thinking, mainly, our thoughts are the only control we have over our situations in which life leads us. Worth reading more then once!
