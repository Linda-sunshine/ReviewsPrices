review/summary: A real pleasurereview/text: It is the first book I happened to read on my Kindle. I was afraid the quality may be bad, for it was among the cheap or free classics. It is not the case, the format is very enjoyable. Concerning the book, its fame is sufficient to make clear how nicely written it is. That is definitely the kind of book that make me really enjoy the english language.
