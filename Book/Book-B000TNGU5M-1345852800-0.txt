review/summary: Nightreview/text: I've read this book twice; once 28 years ago, and then last week. I remember how haunting this book was back then; how strongly it affected me. It affected me so deeply, I began an intense study of the Holocaust(at least, it was intense for a 9th grader). When I read it this time, I felt the same haunting feeling and a desire to know more. A desire to learn all I can so that my grandchildren never forget what happened. The book is clearly written, with a strong, obvious, and dynamic plot. It was shorter than I remembered, but that is probably due to the fact that I read it over a semester all those years ago. Loved it! Should be used in every English curriculum.
