review/summary: Classic and easy goingreview/text: One of the most easy and rewarding books I have ever read. It breaks away from going too deep into outside lore, and focuses deeply on the specific characters. I re-read it just before the new movie came out, and was glad that I did. I would suggest this to be a must read for any fantasy lover.
