review/summary: It's ok....review/text: I am a fan of classic novels...that is all I read. I have never read 'The Hobbit', so I thought I would give it a try. It is ok. It is not bad, but not great either. Maybe just not my cup of tea. The constant turmoil wears on me and I find I don't want to read anymore, but I am forcing myself to finish. It is not the worst thing I've ever read...it is just not really holding my attention all that well.
