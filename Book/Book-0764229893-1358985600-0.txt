review/summary: Disappointing..review/text: The author made a good attempt at trying to bring some bible characters to life, but PLEASE DON'T BASE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE OLD TESTAMENT ON THIS BOOK. The characters say and do things that dont really seem to fit with the Ancient settings.... I kept having to remind myself that it was set in ancient Israel...because the characterisation doesnt fit the setting. I shouldnt have to remind myself of that...a good book should do it. This story had a lot of potential though, had it not been published I would have had some contacts who could have helped you develop the story better and develop characters more fitting to the scene.
