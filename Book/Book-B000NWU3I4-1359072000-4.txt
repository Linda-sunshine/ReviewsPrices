review/summary: A classicreview/text: It has been more that 15 years since I've read this book originally, so i decided to pick it up again. I love the innocence of the story, It is beautiful and intriguing. However, it is relatively easy to put down. I read 2 other books since rereading this novel, which could be due to several mitigating factors. However, what ever the reason, it is still a classic and very enjoyable.
