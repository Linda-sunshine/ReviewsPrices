review/summary: Yearly Required Reading from now onreview/text: If ever you're feeling a little out of sorts about Christmas, this is the story that will set you back right.For most of my life I relied on movie versions of A Christmas Carol, until 2011, when I was grieving the death of my father. I saw I could get a free version of this book for Kindle and began the most pleasant adventure of Christmas ever.I've just read the story again (2012) and it was even better, as I found even more to like about the tale.May we all find the place in our hearts where we feel like Scrooge at times, and be converted to the true Christmas Spirit by this most wonderful work of Charles Dickens.
