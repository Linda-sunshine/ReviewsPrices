review/summary: This book took Ayn Rand 12 years to write then took me 16 years to read. I'm glad that I did!review/text: I have the book on my shelf but I read it on my Kindle. I also bought the Cliffs Notes on this book to help me focus. I forgot things in the book over 16 years. I believe this book is written in a style not common now or then, which may turn off some readers. Faith and feeling will never create prosperity for you. Your reason and logic is your only tool to survive. Ayn Rand believes this is not selfishness but self- fulfillment. The book is a story of what happens when the thinkers and achievers go on strike. Prosperity can not be demanded then paid for with nothing more than a wish and/or a prayer.
