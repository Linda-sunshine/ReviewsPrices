review/summary: A Quick and Enjoyable Readreview/text: I've seen and enjoyed just about every film version of &#34;A Christmas Carol,&#34; but reading this classic was just as pleasurable if not more so. My favorite film version is the one with Alastair Simm as Scrooge and I couldn't help but match many of the actors from that film to the characters in the book as I was reading it, but that never took away from my experience and I think actually enhanced it. The book was actually quite a bit shorter than I expected, a little over a hundred pages, but it was rich and well worth the read. Highly recommended!
