review/summary: One of my all time favoritesreview/text: I have loved this book every since I first read it back in high school. I bought it for my kindle because it is such a favorite and I like to reread at least once a year. If you are a fan of Emily Bronte and Jane Austin then I recommend this book. You cannot help but empathize with Jane and relate to her on many levels.
