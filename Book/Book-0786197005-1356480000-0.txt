review/summary: Looking forward to more movies from this seriesreview/text: Saw John Carter and loved it. Good story, action, and scenery of Mars, etc. Reading Princess of Mars on Kindle.My daughter works on the Mars Rover programs so I know the differences between the real and fantasy.Definitely recommend Edgar Rice Burroughs books to everyone for the entertainment value.
