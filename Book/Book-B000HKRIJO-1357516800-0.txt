review/summary: Great itemreview/text: I was actually looking for a copy of The Screwtape Letters and found this nice softcover edition of a whole collection of C. S. Lewis writings for only a few dollars more. It is soft conversation but the niceer paper and uneven edges make the book itself a bit classier.
