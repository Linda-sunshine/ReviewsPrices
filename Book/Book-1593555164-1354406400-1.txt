review/summary: Jack Reacherreview/text: Jack Reacher is never dull. I have read several of the novels and always love them. They are getting a little repetitive. I can't wait to see the movie of this book, although I can't say I am happy with choice of Tom Cruise as Reacher. From a 6'5&#34; Reacher in the book to 5'9&#34;? Cruise, believable???We'll see.
