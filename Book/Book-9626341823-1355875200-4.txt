review/summary: it's Dickens!!!review/text: What more can I say, but I LOVE Dickens. I especially like his Christmas books, they are really short, and still life changing.I read somewhere that Dickens put out Christmas books, like he did all of his books, to make money, but especially around Christmas, he would write books that would bring in extra money for Christmas, so these Christmas books are written differently than his other books, where he was not paid by the word, or page, but for the book, in it's entirety. Hence, they are less wordy, not necessarily a good or bad thing, because Dickens wouldn't be any good without words.
