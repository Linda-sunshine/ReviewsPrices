review/summary: Definitely not the greatest love story.review/text: Surprised I even bothered to finish this one. Found the characters annoying. Really surprised I finished this on. I kept reading hoping it would get better. This is the book version of the movie THE FOUNTAIN. The only redeeming quality of that movie is the score.
