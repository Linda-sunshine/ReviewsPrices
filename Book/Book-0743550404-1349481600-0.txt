review/summary: Fun Quick read, nothing to do with the TV Show Havenreview/text: Fun Quick read, nothing to do with the TV Show Haven. I enjoyed the book on it's own. I had some expectation that it would have something in common with the TV show on SyFy Haven. They mention that its based on the story all the time. The newspaper guys are there thats it. So have fun with a classic Stephen King book where beautiful Maine is a central character. Don't expect the book to turn into the TV show as you get to the end.
