review/summary: good readreview/text: Uncle Tom's Cabin is a very good portrayal of America in its pre-Civil War Slave Days. Stowe writes her characters to be believable and covers each archetype of thought/attitude toward slavery that existed. There are those today who read her book and call is racist and prejudiced, but this controversy is unfounded. I came across a letter penned to Stowe by Charles Dickens in which he tells her his regard for the book but that she possibly "seeks to prove too much". Read IN CONTEXT, it is not racist at all, but a VERY good eye opener to general thought and sentiment during a dark part of American history....Stowe writes her characters well, in all their humanity, makes you love them, hate them, feel for them.... There will be times when the reader may laugh, and times when the reader will cry, but it is a VERY worthy book of reading time, no matter what your penchant is for reading.....This version is good. No mistakes in the digital version. Always a plus!
