review/summary: Messed with a classic and created a zeroreview/text: James Allen's "As a Man Thinketh" is an inspirational single setting read that embraces the notion your thoughts establish your destiny. Your higher thoughts pull you toward what is pure and real and your base thoughts draw you into immoral conduct and inhibit your spiritual release to fulfillment. This relationship of thought upon action impacts the companions with whom you associate and determines who is drawn to you and whom you repel. This edition destroys the simple read and truth of the words by pulling text out and seeking to emphasize portions to an extent not intended in the original version. The result is a spotty, distracting read that detracts from the power of the original work. While the photographs are attractive, the emphasis of certain text in the photographs is an overall distraction that ruins this work and makes the message banal.
