review/summary: Excellent Book and Pretty Good Migrationreview/text: The story is a classic, I don't believe I need to review that. The transcription to ebook, however, had some issues. The degree signs did not show up on the default kindle font and there were a couple of times where there was a missed space, but, other than that, it was great over all.
