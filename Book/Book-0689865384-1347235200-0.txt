review/summary: Slow and Drawn-outreview/text: My 12 year old daughter's first book review:I was very shocked after reading this book.I thought I would have enjoyed it more after hearing good things about it. But it was definitely a disappointment. I found it shallow, slow, and well- boring. The book was drawn out way too long considering it's a series. I was definitely not happy with the main character, Tally. I found her whiny and couldn't really relate to her. I was also upset about how easily Tally and David developed feelings for each other. It seemed like the Author was just trying to force a romance to make the book more interesting.I was expecting the Author to make a point about beauty not being skin deep. Although there were some highlight worthy sentences I was a little let down.I'm also not a fan of the way the book was written. In the beginning, I found the way the Author jumped from Tally to Shay narrating confusing. I'm a fan of having feelings deeply described and that is something else this book lacked.Although, this wasn't a horrible read I'm not going to read the rest of the books. I am a little interested in how Tally will look pretty, but it's just not worth it.
