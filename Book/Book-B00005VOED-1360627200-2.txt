review/summary: The title fits the characters perfectly...review/text: I viewed a biography on the author on TV the other day, and frankly, his tragic suicide and the fight his mother put up to have this book published fascinated me. It peaked my interest, so I went and bought the digital version. I frankly didn't quite know what to expect, so I really didn't have any expectations except one of the fascination of his personal story.The title fits the characters perfectly. Everyone of them. It was hilarious, entertaining, and kept me reading until I was finished. I'm glad I saw that story on the author's life, or else I would have never known about this book. This book is a must read for anyone, whether you live in New Orleans, or know a group of dunces and can relate. My one wish is that the author could have had this published and gotten the recognition he deserved before he took his life. Maybe it would have prevented his suicide and we could still be reading his works today.
