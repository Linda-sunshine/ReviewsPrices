review/summary: A great children's bookreview/text: As a middle-schooler I loved this book and The Lord of the Rings, and read them all multiple times. I remember that once I began reading the trilogy I no longer had that much desire to revisit The Hobbit, thinking of it as child's fare. That was a loooong time ago, and I have wanted to re-read the book that started me into the fantasy genre. I have now satisfied that desire with the kindle version, and have to say that the story reads almost like a summary of itself in too many places. It's also written in a voice entirely unlike the serious tone of the trilogy to which it is a prequel---it is truly a book written to appeal to children, not adults. So, the adult in me wants to give the book three stars, but the child I used to be remembers this book quite fondly and had it on a pedestal at the time, and would give it five stars. So I have settled in the middle---pardon the unintended pun reference to middle-earth---at four stars. If you have a child in elementary school or early middle school, or even better a child that you are reading stories too every night, that child would probably really enjoy this story.
