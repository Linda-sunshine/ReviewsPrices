review/summary: Great Biblical Based Fictionreview/text: One of my favorite authors does it again. This book makes you take a step back and consider the realities of life during the reign of the kings in the book of Chronicles. Wonderfully written and keeps you coming back for more. I can't wait to read book 2 of the series!
