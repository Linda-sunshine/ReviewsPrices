review/summary: Way too repetitive and boringreview/text: The book is repetitive and pointlessly wordy to the point of becoming boring and annoying. I agree with the reviewers who wrote that the entire book content could be summarized in a pamphlet. I didn't like the author's writing style either, but this might be just a matter of taste.I would not recommend this book.
