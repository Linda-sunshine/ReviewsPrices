review/summary: Famous because of the movies?review/text: This is kind of a really, really old type of adventure book, with beautiful words and sentences that it help us to imagine Middle Earth - a beautiful, magical world, this is what I like the most in this book. (Some chapters intend to make reader feel dreadful, but in my opinion, they failed to do that)However, these are problems: It's not and adventure with much events, tricky problem, hate, fear, love, this is only about the scene and some abnormal behave of characters (the elves, wizards, etc.). Beside, it's hardly to feel any war during reading the book, where the battles are only described in some chapter, 4-5 chaps or so, during that, just long talk, scenery (again), and long-term events (it take months or years for a main event in the book) so in the end of reading this book, I though: "Well, the world seemed not to be in dangerous issue, right?".Finishing reading the book, I feel I like the movies more, far more than the book, with more modern event, sentences and the way they solve problems. This book is not disappointing, just not like expected.
