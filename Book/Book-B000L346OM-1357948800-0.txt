review/summary: Man's Search for Meaningreview/text: I read this book for the first time some 20 years ago. It has reminded me again and again how one can live a life of meaning even when it seems almost impossible to do so. For a catholic striving to live the life in the manner of Christ, it is most helpful and inspiring and compares with the best spiritual books that have guided me consistently. It is a book that has always been on my list of favorite literary works and which I have shared with many friends to help them find meaning in life, too. The feedback has been consistent: a great book!. .
