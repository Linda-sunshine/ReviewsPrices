review/summary: Very Disapointing Packagingreview/text: I've heard the broadcast before and know it's a great show, but this release of it contains "green" packaging. In other words, cheap cardboard-sandwiched discs of which I personally guarantee that each one will come with more scratches than the behind of a dwarf in a sand-laden speedo. Again - not green as in soft green grass, but green as in the greenbacks the company makes from this type of cut in quality.If a company had pride in its product it would have at least foregone the post consumer content grade recycled paperboard and upgrade to paper sleeves. Or better yet, perhaps a $3 jewel case that holds all 5 discs? The exterior box is certainly large enough for a nice plastic jewel case. Instead it contains a cheap, thin, cardboard book of the discs that takes up all of 1/3 of the interior space. The rest of the box is loaded with a large cardboard insert as filler.These type of (goblin) antics are why people stop buying audio CDs and look for other means to acquire their audio (preferably without the aid of a burglar). I certainly won't buy any more products from AudioGO or BBC Audiobooks without holding the product first. The NPR wood box set of the Hobbit radio drama at least shows some class... and (not an official review) from when I last held the wood box set, I could say that the discs were protected enough that not even scratches from Smaug would be of concern.
