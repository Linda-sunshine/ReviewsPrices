review/summary: HATCHET BY GARY PAULSENreview/text: HATCHET BY GARY PAULSENIn Gary Paulsen's amazing novel Hatchet, Brian Robeson is faced with certain difficulties after his flight to his dad's house in Canada goes horribly wrong. He finds himself fighting for his life in the Canadian wilderness. Brian is faced with many difficulties and surprises.I found his book very exiting and interesting. I felt I really got to know Brian as if I were a creature watching him or was in his head. I could see, feel, taste, hear, and smell everything that he could. Gary Paulsen can think of quite a wild idea and turn it into an amazing novel.In my opinion this book would be a story for, probably, 8+. It's an amazing book but there are some scenes that describe intense pain and some pretty mean animals. I recommend this book for anyone who loves adventure and survival.
