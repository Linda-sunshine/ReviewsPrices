review/summary: The truth of this Worldreview/text: This is Huxley's best book in my opinion. The novel is simply a masterpiece of art. Huxley is able to describe our modern society and also make predictions about where we could go if things keep heading in the direction they are going, but does so in a subtle yet captivating way. The amazing part is that Brave New World was written in 1932, but most aspects of it still applies to today's world, nearly a century later.The plot of this book is wildly interesting and keeps you entertain, while also leaving you thinking about today's world and how things could be different. Brave New World is a tale about a Utopian society in the future where babies are no longer born to parents but are instead created and raised in hatcheries where they are divided into different classes. The society is an unemotional, but always happy society due to the drug they take daily, soma.The plot dances around several different worlds where the societies are different ever so slightly and leaves the characters asking if they should go live in one of the different, more natural worlds, or stay in the Utopian society which is London in the 2500's.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an entertaining yet mentally stimulating book. Brave New World is one of the all time classics and is a must read for anyone looking to educated themselves.
