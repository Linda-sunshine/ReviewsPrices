review/summary: AMAZON LLC CHEATED ME - sent religious propaganda disguised in this book cover - NOT PERSUASIONreview/text: HUGE APOLOGIES TO JANE AUSTEN AND THIS WONDERFUL BOOK. I ordered Persuasion as a gift for my mother. What she received instead DID NOT delight her in the least. It was the COVER shown here, but carefully bound to some nutjob religious rant. NOT PERSUASION. NOT AT ALL. OBVIOUS product tampering.So much for trusting in Amazon as a seller. No way to contact them. "My job" to jump through hoops (WORSE - to ask my MOTHER to jump through hoops) to return this trash and get my money back. Same as outright theft - selling me garbage I didn't order and making it painful to get the mess corrected. All relying on the fact that the cost is under $9, and so not worth the customer's hassle.So it's fraud or theft - and I'M FURIOUS. No way to contact anyone human for any help. Amazon LLC STINKS!
