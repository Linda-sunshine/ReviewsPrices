review/summary: Funny, page turnerreview/text: I got this for my Kindle and I didn't put it down until I was finished with reading it. I really enjoyed this book. It made me laugh and it has some sad parts. But, it is funny. If you have ever read the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich then trust me you will enjoy this book. Jayne reminds me of Stephanie. :) hope you enjoy your copy as much as I have.
