review/summary: Revitingreview/text: An absolutely beautiful book. Fitzgerald successfully mastered the words that cover these pages in such a way that connects to humanity. He has a way of wording things so that the past seems so current. The story seems to come from within.Fitzgerald adds little touches that helps the book seem so genuine. Even if you don't find the story line moving (which I did) there is no way to not appreciate the elegant writing style that is so Fitzgerald.It is a must read.
