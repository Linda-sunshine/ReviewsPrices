review/summary: The Great Gatsbyreview/text: My daughter needed to read the Great Gatsby for her sophomore year of high school. I read it as well and it was a good book. It was hard to follow the story at times, but overal it was ok. I would recommend this book. SInce the remake of the movie is coming out next year, it may get more publicity again.
