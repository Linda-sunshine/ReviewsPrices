review/summary: Simply mesmerisingreview/text: The Lord of the Rings is a rare thing, a book that is every bit as captivating the tenth time you read it as the first. I honestly have nothing negative to say about this truly amazing series. Each installment is just as brilliant as each other. These books are so incredibly detailed that you could read them ten times over and still miss things. I can't recomend these books enough, if you only read one series in your life make sure it's the Lord of the Rings trilgy.
