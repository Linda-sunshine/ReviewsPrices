review/summary: How it All Beginsreview/text: This is the first book of the best book series I've ever read. Harry, Hermione, and Ron are an inseparable bunch of friends at Hogwarts who use their own smarts, teamwork, and even disobey the rules to help out. It may seem like a children's book to many, but any adult would find this book to be excellent along with the rest of the series.
