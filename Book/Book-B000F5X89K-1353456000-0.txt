review/summary: Foundation of today's Sci-Fi and Horrorreview/text: It was a real pleasure to reread the founding novel of both Sci-Fi and horror, important types of fiction that provide readers with challenging questions and vicarious, imaginative adventures.When she was 18 years old, Mary Shelley wrote her surpisingly complex novel after she had a rather disturbing nightmare; at the same time, she was part of an amicable writing contest between herself, her husband, Percy B. Shelley, and their guests, Lord Byron and John Polidori. Frankenstein is one of the most influential novel of all times, having been translated widely and changed into plays, films, shows and pseudo sequels. Its characters - the monster created through galvanism out of dead bodies parts and its creator, the "mad" scientist Frankenstein - have reappeared endlessly in other novels, films, cartoons, animated features, Halloween costumes, action figures, video games and everyday language.Many of its essential thematic ideas have become key issues in fiction and media, such as: the scientist's moral resposibility regarding his/her creation, the dangers involved in replacing God in his life-creating function, the important need to be accepted by a social group, the acceptance or rejection of "different" beings perceived as "others". Frankenstein will always be read with enjoyment for its being such superior entertainment and reverence for its being such an accomplished classic.
