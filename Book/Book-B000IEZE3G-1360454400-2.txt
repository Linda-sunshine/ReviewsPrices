review/summary: Harry Potterreview/text: I loved this book. JK Rowling puts you right in the middle of the story. Great read!!!! I liked that I can read it on my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; too. Very handy. These are big books and can get heavy. The Kinder Fire is light and I can adjust the print without having to wear reading glasses. Great Book!!!!
