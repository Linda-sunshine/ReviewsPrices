review/summary: This book saved my sanityreview/text: This was recommended to me by a friend, who said it worked wonders for her son. I bought it two months before I had my daughter. It is a little preachy, but he makes sense and has backed everything in this book with medical studies. The cuddle cure really helped my daughter; she is a very, very happy 11 month old. I am very happy I had the cuddle cure and the education that I received from this book- it made me more confident and happier because I knew how to help my daughter.
