review/summary: Loved this book!review/text: Jodi Picoult once again left me unable to put this book down. Very well written about such a controversial subject - which of course is her specialty. She made you feel as if you were living within the family. Making you dislike some of the characters immediately and then turning it around so that you could see the "other side". Loved it!
