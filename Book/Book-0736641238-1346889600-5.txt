review/summary: A Classic!review/text: I wish I grew up with this book, but I just read it now and I adore it. Louisa May Alcott has a wonderful voice, the characters are such relatable girls that they feel like dear friends, and the strong message of Christianity is an important theme. I believe every girl should read this book.
