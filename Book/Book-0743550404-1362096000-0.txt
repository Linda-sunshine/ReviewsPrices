review/summary: not worth the readreview/text: I bought this book based on the fact that the Haven TV show is loosely based on it. Boy was I disappointed. Only thing I can see it copies is the two old newspaper men. Besides that let down, the mystery in the book is never solved. As far as I am concerned, this was a totally bad purchase.
