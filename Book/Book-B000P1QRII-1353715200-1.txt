review/summary: The Giverreview/text: I have read this book in a hard copy. It is good both for adults and children, for it has got some implied and hidden messages that sound quite real today as well. The imaginary community there appears very convincing with its symptomatic developments of technology and human nature. Although this book touches on some serious social issues, it delivers its storyline in an intriguing and lighthearted, even amusing way. The style is quite "reader-friendly", enjoyable and immersive. I also recommend it to language students.
