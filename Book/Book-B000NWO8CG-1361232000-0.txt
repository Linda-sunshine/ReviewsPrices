review/summary: Classicreview/text: This is a classic, every lady wether she be a girl or a woman should have read at least once in her life time, preferably at a young age because it is a classic coming of age story about love, dreams and that awkward moment between birth and death called life. I absolutely loved it! I read it in Middle School and it still remains in my top list of favorite novels of all time.
