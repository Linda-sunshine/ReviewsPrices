review/summary: Love the seriesreview/text: Every &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; book has been an entertaining read. I did like &#34;One Shot', but some of the others in the series are even better. It could be that for the first time, I saw the movie, before I read the book. I must say the book was still better. Reacher is by character definition, the type of guy that can intimidate the crowd, just by walking in the door. This book had less danger, although the primary antagonist was very well written.I will continue to include any of Lee Childs books based on this character, as a great recommend for anyone who enjoys murder mysteries, or thrillers.
