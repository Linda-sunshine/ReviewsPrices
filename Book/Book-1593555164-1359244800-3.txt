review/summary: Great detective story but disregard inconcistencies !review/text: Just finished reading this novel and all words in positive reviews about it are true: it is a great read, nicely written, difficult to put down ( and made my 8 hour plane trip seem very short ), believable main charachters...Recommend greatly as quality crime book which is not easy to find. Will definetly buy more books of Lee Child.With one exception... If you know anything about Russian histlory, russian language and what Gulag actually was - you just need to disregard all those russian parts. Just pretend it is about something else as it doesn't matter that much ( should they be Columbian, Hungarian, Russian, Zimbabwian ) - as long as plot is good and writing itself is superb. Still - how much would that cost to pay for some basic consultancy wiht native speaker ? Especially considering that it is now translated to Russian, and translators have to have comments here and there that it is author mistakes :). And Gorbachev ended Gulag in 1963? come on - he probably was just out of school at that time :).Still - as I say, book itself is great detective crime story and definetely worth reading. Just don't believe much what is written about those other evil guys and never repeat it in public :)
