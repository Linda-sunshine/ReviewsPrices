review/summary: I enjoyed it more than I expected to . . .review/text: My daughter (who is 12) read this series and recommended it to me. She and I share a love of fantasy / sf novels, and we often trade books back and forth.I thought this series would be a bit juvenile, and yes, it is definitely targeted for teens. However, it is also well written and entertaining, with some fascinating concepts centered around a dystopian-but-hopeful future society. If you are a fan of light science fiction, dystopian fiction, or &#34;futures imperfect&#34; type stories, you will enjoy it I think. It's a quick read and a real page-turner.This is the first book in the series, and was my second-favorite (I liked &#34;Pretties&#34;, the second novel, better.) Enjoy!
