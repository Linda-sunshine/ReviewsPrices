review/summary: Still the best mix of SciFi/Fantasyreview/text: I reread this book recently after approximately 20 years, although it has crossed my mind many times since then. I saw the movie (which wasn't very good) and wanted to compare it with my memory of the first book of this series. Of course, the book is far superior to the movie in every aspect. (The movie couldn't even get the costumes right--the characters in the book are naked! Well, I guess that would have been a problem with the PG-13 rating...) If you saw the movie and were disappointed in it, check out the book; it's as good today as it was when I was an innocent and unjaded high schooler.
