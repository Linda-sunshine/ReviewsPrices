review/summary: Always a favorite of mine!review/text: In my personal oppinion, this story of Christmas is one of if not the best outside of the biblical story. It not only evokes the true sense of what Christmas should be about, but uses the message out of scriptures to empasize it beautifully. I will make it a tradition from now on to read this story every year to remind myself what this season is all about, Him and the love He has shown us.
