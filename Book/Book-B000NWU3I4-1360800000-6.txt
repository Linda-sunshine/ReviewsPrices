review/summary: Cool Connectionsreview/text: The biggest theme present in The Hobbit is the quest; when Bilbo goes with Gandalf and the dwarves to Lonely Mountain. The quest has been in literature for hundreds of years, it is seen in Beowulf when he goes off to kill Grendel and it is also very much so present in the Arthurian Legends. The biggest quest in Arthurian Legend would have to be the quest for the Holy Grail. Arthur and his knights think that if they bring home the grail then a time of peace and prosperity will fall over their lands. Bilbo sort thinks the same way when he takes the cup from the dragon; he thinks that by having proof of his exploits that will make him an even more recognizable figure among the other hobbits.Another interesting parallel in The Hobbit to Arthurian Legend is use of named swords. It is with his sword Excalibur that Arthur was able to derive a lot of his power. The same goes for Bilbo after acquiring his short sword from the trolls, he does not name at first knowing that he has to prove himself with it but after that he names it Sting. It is with this sword that Bilbo was able to feel his own powerAlthough Tolkien publicly denied any connections between The Hobbit and Arthurian Legend it is defiantly easy to see where people are able to see parallels and connect the two stories together. Overall The Hobbit is a great read it does not take long to finish and interesting to see the differences between the movie and book. Everyone should read The Hobbit at least once in their lifetime.
