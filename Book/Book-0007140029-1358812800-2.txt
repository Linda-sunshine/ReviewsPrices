review/summary: Both a quick read and fun-to-read.review/text: Every now and then, I lose my reading mojo. I lost it bad at the end of last semester and dawdled on my to-read list during my break and finally got it back after rereading Into the Wild.Now, Into the Wild isn't a YA novel, nor is it one of the genres I normally review - after all, animals as the main characters don't pop up enough for me to really take a look at it.But I really love this series and since I never reviewed it the first few times reading it, I thought - well, why not?Now, the writing isn't *zomgAMAZING*. It is, after all, both middle grade and featuring cats. But the world and the story itself are fascinating and fun to read; Hunter does an excellent job at creating a world that isn't stark black-and-white, where the villains are also friends, and where you actually don't know what's going to happen from one moment to the next.Well, I did, but I had already read it before.But it really is an excellent series from start-to-finish; both a quick read and fun-to-read, it's definitely something I'd recommend.
