review/summary: Big book: Got this for a youngster to apply for the scholarshipreview/text: I bought this book for a youngster in high school. I wanted him to apply for the Rand scholarship. I glanced through the book. The youngster really enjoyed the book, although it took him quite a while to read it. It is a big book.
