review/summary: Details were sometimes tediousreview/text: I read this after reading &#34;Mysterious Island&#34; just to get the background story. I think that Verne must have been a botanist and/or marine biologist - he goes into SO much detail on fauna and aquatic wildlife. This distracted from the story for me, I often found myself skipping pages just to get back to the journey.
