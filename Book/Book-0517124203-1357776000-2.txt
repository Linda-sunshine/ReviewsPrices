review/summary: A surprisereview/text: I wasn't sure what to expect. I enjoyed it. It was a surprise. First, it was much shorter than I expected. It wasn't nearly as dark as I expected. And I had no idea how it would end. Much has been written about it and it has been over-analyzed beyond belief. I didn't read any of the commentary on it and don't intend to unless one of you sends me a convincing argument as to why I should.My expectations must have come mostly from the 1951 Disney movie. And I expected a darker movie. Maybe I should see the movie again, as and adult and see if I still think it is so dark.I would encourage you to read it, if you have any interest at all.BTW, the version I read looked different from this one, but I couldn't find it on Goodreads or Amazon. I read it on the iPad ap called "Free Books."
