review/summary: Beyond Five Starsreview/text: The Giver is one of my all time favorite books! As a former teacher, I had a class set that kept us all turning the pages and wondering if this utopian world was really as perfect as it seemed. I can't help sharing it with everyone who hasn't read it yet. Lois Lowry has yet to disappoint me with anything she has written. Her latest release, Son, is the fourth book in the Giver Quartet and ranks right up their with The Giver. It answers many of the questions lingering after finishing The Giver!
