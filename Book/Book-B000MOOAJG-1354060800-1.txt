review/summary: Awesome Bookreview/text: I had read Atlas Shrugged in the 60's and was surprised at how well I remembered it. Great book and philosophy on what happens when government interferes with private industry. I wish everyone would read this to better understand that you cannot kill initiative and expect the country to survive!
