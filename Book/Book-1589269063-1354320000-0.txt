review/summary: This Is A Book I Will be Re-Reading Every Year of My Lifereview/text: This book is about more than relationships and marriage, but even if that were it's only application it would be one worth reading.It goes over 5 different Love Languages, or 5 basic needs and how each of us prioritizes which we are most receptive to.If you are interesting in understanding, developing or repairing any relationships with another human being, I would urge you to give this book a read.I am an ecclesiastical leader and as I have counseled with spouses or parents who do not understand why their efforts are unrewarded or why their relationships are strained, I have found myself referring to this very volume.It's short, easy to read and very down to earth. It is one of a handful of books that I read and re-read to glean new insights and to further entrench it's teachings.Give it a shot. It could very well change the course of your marriage - and your life.
