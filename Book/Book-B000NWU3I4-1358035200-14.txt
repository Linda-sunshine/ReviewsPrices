review/summary: Great book, but datedreview/text: This book is obviously a classic. Everything in here that seems cliche is because other people took it from Tolkien. Nevertheless, it is hard to get past how clumsy the writing can be, and how simple the plot is -- a challenge appears and is solved in a few pages, usually by luck. Fans of R.A. Salvatore or Terry Brooks or any more modern fantasy writer will probably be disappointed. There is action, but it is scant. Where this book really shines is in the description of an amazingly fleshed out world. And while the plot is simple and straightforward, it is certainly extensive. It is easy to see how Peter Jackson decided to turn it into three movies.
