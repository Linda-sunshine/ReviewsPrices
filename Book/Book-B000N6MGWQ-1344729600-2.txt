review/summary: The Five People You meet in Heavenreview/text: This book really makes you think about taking inventory of the activities we participate in our lives and to really consider what are the things that are most important. Are we really doing want we want and how is it affecting those around us that we care about. I loved this book. I think that Mitch Albom writes from the heart.
