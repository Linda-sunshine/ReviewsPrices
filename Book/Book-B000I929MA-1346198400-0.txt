review/summary: A chillingly prescient narravative...review/text: Considering the anti-women, religio-political climate of 2012, Atwood's tale of social oppression is beginning to feel all too real. A must read for a generation of women coming of age at a time when millions of politicized religious fundamentalists are actively engaged in bringing about an American theocracy. Some of the parallels between Atwood's fictional work and contemporary Christian Nationalist right-wing ideology taking root are too close for comfort.
