review/summary: Simple Title, Deep Concept..Inspiration Will Followreview/text: After feeling empowered byAttitude - Your Best hope for Happiness (A look at the men who founded the Positive Attitude Movement)I decided to check out one of the books he recommended: James Allen's "As A Man Thinketh". I have heard it was a classic and wanted to see what all the buzz was about. I purchased the book free of charge through the Kindle store and found it to be very insightful and uplifting. The language particularly is one of the strongest parts of this book. It is written in the style of early philosophers like Plato and Aristotle which means lengthy sentences, highly quotable phrases(I Tweeted several of those quotes), and musings on timeless issues like morality and character. If you are looking for a "Top Ten" or "Be Happy in ...Days", you won't find it in this book. If you are looking for a book that sit down with a nice cup of coffee, a notepad, and muse on the role of positive thinking in your life, this is a great book for you.
