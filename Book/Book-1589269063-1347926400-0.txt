review/summary: Emotionsreview/text: As a recent graduate of Psychology, my mentor recommended that I build a library of useful material to expound on when speaking with clients. She recommended Gary Chapman's 5 Love Languages not fully aware of the condition my own marriage was in. I bought the book, and wondered how this book made it to print without them having interviewed me? It is because Dr. Chapman has interviewed countless others who are or were just like me. I shared the book with my husband and now, I offer to anyone who is born with an emotion to read this book! It is the answer to survival and learning how to love, even yourself.Rev. Marsha C. Fearrington
