review/summary: Still wondering about what really happened to the Colorado Kidreview/text: I bought this because I have become a fan of SyFy's Haven and was hoping to get a little background. I knew that the TV show was only based on this short story. It added little to what I already knew. (Had I read it several months before it would have given me the name of "The Colorado Kid".) Only two of the main characters in the short story are in the Television series and I was disappointed to find them so different. Regardless of the television series, taken alone as a Stephen King story I was still disappointed and yet fascinated. The story asks a lot of questions and King doesn't really give all the answers. For me, that's both a strength and a weakness of this story. I had to laugh at myself though because King reeled me right in.I have read King novels that I loved and some I didn't care for at all and some were just too hard for me to follow. I think that is one of King's strengths. I absolutely never know how much I am going to enjoy or dislike his book. I think if you are a real Stephen King fan you will enjoy this story. If you are looking for background about Haven...remember that the show is loosely, very loosely based on the story. I am still asking the question of not WHO the Colorado Kid is, but what the heck was he doing in Haven?
