review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: After seeing the movie, I was anxious to follow the story all the way through. A special adventure was in store for me.Exciting, Provoking, Imaginative and Thrilling as I watch the tranformation of Bilbo Baggins go from self-centered toan overcomer of adversity. I was happy to finally know how Baggins got the ring. Hope the next movie installmentfollows the book more closely.
