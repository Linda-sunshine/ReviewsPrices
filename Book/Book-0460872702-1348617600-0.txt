review/summary: Proof that the upper classes are as full of sin as the rest of us.review/text: The thing that this book brings out more than anything is the idea that the rich gained their power and notoriety through some type of moral superiority. That is completely trashed in this book.First of all, Tom Buchannan is the most unctuous character in this book, if not all literature. He is the picture of the eastern establishment rich kid who had everything given to him. And he is a leach to his wife and skulks around with Myrtle.Daisy and Gatsby are also pathetic characters. The thrust of the novel is also important in that it brings to light the fact that money and vast riches cannot bring happiness. We still see that today. The 1920s and the Jazz Age were the beginning of the era of conspicuous consumption and while Gatsby throws weekend long parties, he almost never partakes in them, and he is rather quite miserable.The ending of the book, not to give spoilers, demonstrates the conceit of the era. A seminal work of American Fiction.
