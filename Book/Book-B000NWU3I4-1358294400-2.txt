review/summary: Timeless classic is well worth reading againreview/text: The first time I read this I was about 12 years old, and it was just an awesome story. I read it again as a busy mother trying to keep on top of her son's reading assignments, and it spurred me to read the whole Lord of the Rings set. Now, I'm a grandma who just wants to remember enough of the story to go see the movie, and the story and writing are still great. I found myself reading parts of it out loud just to hear the dialogue or alliteration. Definitely time well spent for the enjoyment value received.
