review/summary: picoult - faithreview/text: Really great, well-written book. This author has a genuine gift for taking a controversial story line and making the reader understand all sides of the issue. This particular book deals with the existence of God from the perspective of a child unfamiliar with the typical religious understanding - she's unbiased, not affiliated with any particular doctrine, and yet, she is the conduit of numerous miracles. As a result, her life becomes filled with controversy and this book is primarily centered around how she and her mother are impacted. The message to me was loud and clear - it brings home the idea that love prevails in all things. It will make even the doubting Thomas (that's me...) reconsider their perspective regarding the existence of a higher power in this crazy world.The author is one of the best storytellers I have had the pleasure of enjoying in many, many years. I would very highly recommend.
