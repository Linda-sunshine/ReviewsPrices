review/summary: Probably my last.review/text: I have now read the first four of the Jack Reacher stories. I very much enjoyed the first. The second was not great. Not bad, either. The third and, finally, the fourth have pushed my tolerance level to the limit. I strongly wished the author would do more research before he puts &#34;stuff&#34; in the books. Nothing intolerable by itself, but they start to add up. For example, Jeep is copyrighted trade name and does not apply to all SUVs. (book three) There is a difference between the US Army, Air Force, and Marines. One cannot use the names and commands interchangeably. I found the portrayal of the FBI somewhat distasteful and not realistic. (book four) Artistic license is certainly expected. They should, however, try to stay within reasonable limits. After researching the author's background, I suppose a greater level of &#34;bad America&#34; conspiracy theory is expected, but I am not obligated to read it.
