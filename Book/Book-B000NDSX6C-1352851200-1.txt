review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: In my opinion The Hobbit is the best fantasy story ever written. I have read it several times thru the years and it continues to be entertaining. I highly recommend The Hobbit and then the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Great reading for all ages and classes of people.
