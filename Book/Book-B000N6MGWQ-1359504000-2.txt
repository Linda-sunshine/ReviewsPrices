review/summary: Very interesting concept for a book...review/text: Only about halfway through the book and it has changed the way I think about how the actions we take and the things we do affect those around us, much of the time without us even thinking about it, or realizing it. Each decision we make is like a pebble thrown into a still pond, the ripples spread out and affect everything around us..
