review/summary: Incredible Storyreview/text: Elie Wiesel's story of his time in one of the Nazi death camps and his treatment at the hands of his captors is an absolutely incredible story. It is one that shows the determination of the human spirit, as well as what happens when that spirit is broken. It is a haunting tale of man's inhumanity towards his fellow man, and should be read by all as a bulwark to keep these types of atrocities from ever happening again.
