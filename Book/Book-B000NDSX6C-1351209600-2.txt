review/summary: Print quality is poorreview/text: This book is printed on really thin paper that tears easily - much more easily than other paperbacks in my collection. I have already ripped two pages just reading the story to my daughter, and I'm only on page 85.I purchased this new version because the product page indicated it included pictures, but the pictures are all rough b/w drawings that do not enhance the story.
