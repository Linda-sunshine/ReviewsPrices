review/summary: The Great Gatsbyreview/text: I read this book a long time ago. Now that I know many &#34;society&#34; people, I found the book not so fascinating. I guess it's interesting to reread what life was like back then. I couldn't help but wonder how cell phones and having Internet service, especially Google, would have changed this entire book...
