review/summary: A collectors itemreview/text: Slip cased and leather bound, this version contains all three of the Lord of the Rings tales. As translated from the runes in the book, this is the Red Book, retelling the tale of Bilbo Baggins and Sam Gamgee. The leather is beautifully embossed and colored in jewel tones. This is a worthwhile addition to your library.
