review/summary: A Required Read For Everyonereview/text: This is my favorite book, i bought this one to replace the one I lost. I have adored this book since I was a kid and now my 16 year old is reading it, definitely a classic, and its a book that was made into an equally impeccable movie that is true to the story with a winning cast including Gregory Peck
