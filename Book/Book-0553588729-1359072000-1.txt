review/summary: Useful information that could've been condensed to one page.review/text: You can get the same gist on how to calm your baby by reading these reviews and the rest are just fillers! Ofcourse, babies are their own unique person, so not all of the information (if any) in these types of &#34;cookie cutter&#34; books will be applicable to all babies. The three things that work best for us out of all the 5 S's are swaddling, sucking, and swaying/rocking/motion. Other than these three soothing methods (which can be Googled), the reassuring tidbit that we got from the book was that newborns NEED/WANT love and affection, so it is important to not deprive them of such simple requests. This alligned with our belief that it is ok to give your newborn the attention, as we do not believe in the &#34;cry it out&#34; method or anything along that spectrum for a newborn.
