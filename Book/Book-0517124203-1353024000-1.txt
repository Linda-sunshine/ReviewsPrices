review/summary: Confusingly nonsensicalreview/text: A quick and easy read, if you don't read into the nonsense! If you've seen the film, the book seems comparatively brief and Alice seems to be exploring Wonderland with no specific purpose. Otherwise, its an interesting read and aptly suggests the nonsensical views a child has on the adult world.
