review/summary: A Masterpiece; "Night" paints the truth of the holocaust with vivid strokes of brilliance.review/text: As the author ofThe Pi of Life, I understand the dichotomy of existence. Yet the terror and tragedy of the Holocaust baffles me.How could humans perform such atrocities?Elie Wiesel strips the veneer of time. He reveals the anguish and terror--sprinkled with moments of hope and love--that was life in a concentration camp."We did not know, as yet, which was the better side, right or left, which road led to prison and which to the crematoria. Still, I was happy, I was near my father.""The Kapos were beating us again, but I no longer felt the pain. A glacial wind was enveloping us. We were naked...""He looked at us as one would a pack of leprous dogs clinging to life.""Night" broke my heart while compelling me to turn the page. It cracked the door on the madness that stripped humanity from tortured souls fighting for survival. Yet throughout "Night" Scattered pools of hope shine through the darkness. In the clutch of evil love survived. Humanity endured and with it meaning."We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere."
