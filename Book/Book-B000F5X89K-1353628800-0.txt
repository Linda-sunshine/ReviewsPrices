review/summary: One of the bestreview/text: Everyone knows about Frankenstein, but now many of us have read Mary Shelley's masterful tale of this mad scientist and the tragic monster he creates. Reading it again after so many years is like renewing a friendship with an old friend. If you've never read it, please do. You'll be surprised. Frankenstein's monster is a sympathetic figure rather than a scary one. He's a sad one, too.
