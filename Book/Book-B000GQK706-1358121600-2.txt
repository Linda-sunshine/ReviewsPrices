review/summary: Excellent Copy. Magnificent Read by J.R.R. Tolkienreview/text: This is an excellent digital copy. J.R.R. Tolkien is, of course, the best fantasy writer in the history of mankind. If you have never read The Lord of The Rings: You owe it to yourself to do so now! You will never regret it. I enjoyed reading this so very much. I wish he was alive and still writing.
