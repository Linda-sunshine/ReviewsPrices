review/summary: Jodi Picoult handles the ultimate &#34;what if&#34; with her usual masteryreview/text: What would happen if your child started having visions, quoted from the bible, developed stigmata? If you were besieged by the media and the public seeking miracle cures how would this affect your life? And if this tore your marriage apart and your husband wanted custody of your child, how would you cope? Picoult has taken these possibilities and created an absorbing story capturing the feeling of bewilderment and helplessness of Faith's mother, Mariah. To add interest and complication she adds the growing attachment to the TV religious sceptic, Ian who initially wants to expose the phenomenon as a hoax.But how do you end a story like this? It would almost seem that the miracles must be explained . . . . . but Picoult brings the story to a close which may not satisfy some - but for me it was the only way it could be left.I will keep reading Picoult's books (this is about the 5th I have read).
