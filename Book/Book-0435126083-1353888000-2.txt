review/summary: A truly wonderful journeyreview/text: Amazon almost always send an email asking customers to review books they have recently purchased. When I recieved one such email asking me to review Wuthering Heights my first thought was that I would not dare to even try to say anything about such a classic book. But I have just finished reading it again after many years and I had forgotten how wonderful and musical it is. The words flow on the pages like music to your ears. The characters are so engaging, even those you love to hate, and the settings are so real. I feel like I have spent the last few days in an eighteenth century manor house, in the kitchen, near the fire, listening to an amazing story being told by a humble house keeper. I think that sometimes today we forget how inspired beautiful prose, can really make us feel, for hours at a time I forgot all my modern day worries and my hectic work load and just enjoyed a truly wonderful reading experience. Do yourself a favour and reread this book, and if you have never read it then do so you wont be sorry.
