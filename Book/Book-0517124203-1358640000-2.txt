review/summary: visionaryreview/text: Usually described and also thought of by most people as a Children's book of nonsense. It's not really a a book for children. Even the smartest child may not know what to make of Alice in Wonderland. Compared to the nonsense writing of Edward Lear it (Alice) is something altogether different. Alice (at least part 2 Through the Looking Glass)contains some of the best poems ever written. A Fantasy written by a visionary (Lewis Carroll, or a visionary fantasy. It is also a great work of Literature, a great work of Art and one of the best books ever written.
