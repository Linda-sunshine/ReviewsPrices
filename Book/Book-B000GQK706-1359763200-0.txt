review/summary: Best series of novels I have ever read.review/text: Lord of the Rings novels need no review. They are right up there with the best books ever written, and contain every element of good and evil struggle we all have to face, and teaches you that &#34;good&#34;doesn't always win. However it also contains details of friendships forged, and what one friend will do for another in their hour of need. Tolkien draws you into a fantasy world, and soon you forget the fantasy part, and find yourself so immersed it, it is as if Middle Earth was a real place, and all it's subjects become like real people in your mind. Superb books, written by a celebrated author.
