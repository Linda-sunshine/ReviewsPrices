review/summary: I loved it then, I love it now!review/text: I can't explain why I love this book so much. I read it as a teenager, re-read it and it's even better as an adult. The Lord of the Rings in general is a mythology unto itself, with depth of character and all the grand themes of life playing out in Middle Earth. It's also a folk tale. My favorite book ever.
