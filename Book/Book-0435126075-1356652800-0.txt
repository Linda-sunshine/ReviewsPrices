review/summary: Excellent classicreview/text: Though the language used throughout this book, is the stilted,formal verbiage of an era long past; the charm and humor of the protagonists is readily recognized. The first time I read this book, was a required reading for a literature class. Being a more "mature" reader, has greatly increased enjoyment of this volume.
