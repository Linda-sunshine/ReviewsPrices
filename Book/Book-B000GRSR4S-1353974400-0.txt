review/summary: A classic, and for good reason.review/text: A gentle and tragic and imaginative and very, very humane prose poem on the tragedy of war, focusing on the devastation of Dresden by firebombing. Vonnegut has distinctive voice. Because he uses whimisical sci-fi fantasies to balance the terror and agony of his main subject, this is often misunderstood as a science fiction book. It is a major work of serious fiction. A great novel.
