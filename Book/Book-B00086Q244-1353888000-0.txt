review/summary: Must read.review/text: I read this book for the first time 25-years ago and re-read every few years as the incite provided is as relevant today as it was when it was written many decades ago. I loaned my hard copy out, and, not surprisingly, did not receive it back so ordered on my Kindle. A very easy and quick read that I would recommend to all.
