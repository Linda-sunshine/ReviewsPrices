review/summary: Is that why...?review/text: Didn't think that this book was going to do anything for me. Trying to keep an open, I heeded somebody's suggestion and read the book. I was surprised! I read the entire book--in a couple of sittings--and finally understood why I and my husband had so many problems. We are so different, speaking different love languages. Now I understand and have shared it with my husband and we are working pass our differences. Loved the book!
