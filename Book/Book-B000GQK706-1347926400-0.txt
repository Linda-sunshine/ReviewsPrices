review/summary: awesomereview/text: I Love The Lord of the Rings and I was needing a hardcover copy of the greatest fantasy series there is. I must say that this totally blew my mind. I think any die-hard Lord of the Rings fan should have this in their collection. honestly the only thing I'm upset about with this copy of the book is that id doesn't have all the maps at the end in it. The two fold out maps are great even though I'm afraid to take them out for the chance that they might get ripped. All and all though, it's a great edition of the book and I was more then happy to pay the price for it.
