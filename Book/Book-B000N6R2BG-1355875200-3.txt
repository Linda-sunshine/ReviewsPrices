review/summary: &#34;Keeping Faith&#34; is Jodi Picoult once again masterfully tackling a tough subject.review/text: This is Jodi Picoult at her best! The dialogue and character development so drew me into the story, that I feel as if I knew the main character, Mariah White, and was agonizing right along with her as she overcame her fears and uncertainties in her battle to keep her 7-year-old daughter in the wake of a sudden divorce that rocked her world as well as her daughter's. I was gripped by the story as it twisted and turned. The ending seemed a bit abrupt, though it did allow the reader to draw some conclusions. I simply couldn't put the book down, yet I didn't want it to end.
