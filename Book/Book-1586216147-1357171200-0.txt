review/summary: For once the movie is better then the bookreview/text: I was very excited to read this book at first after seeing the classic movie. Unfortunately I do not enjoy the book very much. It skins over the young Ali and Noah which is what I actually wanted to know more about (what the movie left out) overall it is a good read if you have seen the movie otherwise read the last song by Nicholas sparks instead
