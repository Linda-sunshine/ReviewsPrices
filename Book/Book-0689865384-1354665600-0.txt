review/summary: This whole saga was wonderful.review/text: I absolutely loved these books. After reading Hunger Games I read every dystopian book & series I could find. I read Divergent/Insurgent first, Legend, the Throne of Glass/novellas, The Scourge, Under the Never Sky, Delirium/Pandemonium, Matched/Crossed, Eve/Once, Enclave/Outpost, Graceling/Bitterblue/Fire, I was tearing through them all. I put off reading these books for so long because I thought a story about a bunch of vain people would be dull & wouldn't be for me. I was so wrong. You really don't get an idea of the Uglies world from the summary. The books were so exciting, and the world that was painted was creative, imaginative, and everything else you want of a good dystopian. The characters are rich and original as well. Tally Youngblood isn't very likeable at first, but as she changes your love for her grows leaps & bounds. I'm glad the lack of other options finally made me read this saga, as it turned out to be hands down in the group with my other favorites!
