review/summary: A MUST READ!!!review/text: This is one of the most amazing books that I've ever read, and I have the honor of teaching it every year to my tenth grade students. It's amazing how little students tend to know about the Holocaust in today's day and age, and watching them go from novices who state that they would simply fight off the Nazi's to understanding the enormity of the Holocaust, the dehumanization, and atrocity of WWII, is amazing.Of course, Night is a heartbreaking tale that always leaves me an emotional wreck. It's very hard to fathom that people could really do such horrible things to each other, and my generation is very lucky to have never experienced anything like it. But this also makes our younger generations very nave and confused when it comes to understanding what really happened in the Holocaust, why it went on for so long, and why we study it in school. We truly can never allow future generations to forget, especially as survivors are now few and far between, and soon, firsthand accounts will be no more.I've found that this novel really touches those who read it, even the most reluctant student. Though they may not admit it aloud, the story has a way of opening up the reader to the atrocities, and it explains what happened in such a way that it's impossible not to connect to it. Wiesel is an amazing, exceptionally strong person, having survived such an ordeal, and his message to never forget it plainly and aptly stated. With its vivid descriptions and short, pointed sentences, Wiesel does a phenomenal job not only telling his story, but showing it to all who read it, allowing them to experience it through his words as well.
