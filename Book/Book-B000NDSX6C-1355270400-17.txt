review/summary: Perhaps I'm at a disadvantagereview/text: Perhaps I'm at a disadvantage, but I read Fellowship of the Rings before I ever read this novel. I am a big fan of Fellowship, and therefore this book left me wanting......more?LOTR trilogy is a darker story with a better view on the evils in our world. The Hobbit, to me, while a fun story, seemed more innocent and almost naive. After a friend explained to me that The Hobbit was written before the death of his son, while LOTR was written after, it seemed to make more sense. However, I prefer the harder journey, for I feel that there is much more earned at the end.The story is a fun story, one that I am sure we will read to our children. But as a 24 year old, I just felt that it wasn't what I was looking for in a novel. Yes, it is a classic and I believe it is for a reason, but I believe it is for a younger audience. Had I read it sooner, perhaps I would have enjoyed it more.
