review/summary: One of Austen's bestreview/text: I was in love with the movie and I am now equally in love with this book. I enjoy the style of writing, and how easy it is to understand. What a wonderful story of strong women who are able to rise above their class. Yet, they do it through love and never sell themselves into it.
