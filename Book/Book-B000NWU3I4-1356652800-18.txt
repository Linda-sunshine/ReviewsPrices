review/summary: Liked itreview/text: I should have read this book first and I highly recommend that those who want to read the Lord of the rings start here. Remember though, that the hobbit is a book written for young ones and thus lacks the complicated plots, leveled meanings and advanced writing style of the ring series. I enjoyed reading this tale and will happily go on to reread the others.
