review/summary: Always A Classicreview/text: From the first time I read this book as a teenager until now, it has captured my attention and imagination every time.I'm always amazed at the author's ability to create such a rich and detailed history, current story, and future events.Read this classic and beautiful book (all volumes in one) and be swept away in a land of magic, triumph, love, and friendship.
