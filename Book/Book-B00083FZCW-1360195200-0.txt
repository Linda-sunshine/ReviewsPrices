review/summary: Labeled as new, but when it came in the mail...review/text: I ordered this book in new condition and paid over $17 for it. What I got in the mail over 2 weeks later was not at all what I ordered. The binding is torn severely and the cover is covered with stickers and stains. Two of the stickers say $9.69 and $3.39, obviously not what I paid for it, but the prices reflect the condition it is in.
