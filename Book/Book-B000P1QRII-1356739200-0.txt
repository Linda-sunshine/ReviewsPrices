review/summary: Starts slowly, but really comes together in the endreview/text: I really liked this book, and the pacing of the book was very fascinating. The first half of the book seemed almost entirely like build up, and then the resolution came in the second half of the book.This book is set in a futuristic society that's a mix betweenBrave New Worldand 1984. The society is completely controlled, but they live in self contained "communities" of about 2500 people, that are vigorously regulated. For example, only 50 babies are allowed to be born into the community at any one year. My guess is that this takes place around the year 2500 - 3000, but technology has stagnated because of these self contained communities, so technologically they're still stuck in the 1980s.The book is classified as science fiction, but the only science fiction element is that Jonas gets a call to be a "Receiver," and he also ends up being a "Giver," which means that he can receive old memories and give old memories. In this book, the whole community has rejected emotion and memories, but the problem with that is that you can't get rid of emotion and memories. They have to go somewhere. So, the community decided to make a job called Receiver, which contains all of the emotion and memories in a single person, to protect everyone else from these emotions. This makes the job of the Receiver really frustrating, because he or she can't share the emotions or memories with anybody, besides the previous Receiver who has to die after just a year of training.It's the first of a four-part series, but it stands alone well as a single book. I highly recommend it.Pros:+Very tight, well put together story+Fascinating and thought provoking. I'm going to be thinking about this book for months to come.+A very fun, quick read+If you read it as a family, it gives a lot of interesting topics for discussionCons:-A little slow at first
