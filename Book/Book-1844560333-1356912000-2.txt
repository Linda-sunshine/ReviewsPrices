review/summary: Kindle Edreview/text: It was easy to download and read. I like having both physical and electronic copies if I can. It was convenient to read because of accessibility on my phone or tablet. Anywhere I got stuck waiting I could start up the book again. Of course the story is a classic too, read it because its my now fianc&eacute;e's favorite and I was brushing up for ideas before my own proposal!
