review/summary: Revisiting the Classicreview/text: Finished re-reading this tonight, with a friend. It remains among my favorite books and I am looking forward to the movie.It is not a perfect book but it is a perfect story with an unforgettable character. Fitzgerald is a master and Gatsby may be his best showcase.Reading aloud is something we should rescue from middle school classrooms. It goes good with wine and friends.
