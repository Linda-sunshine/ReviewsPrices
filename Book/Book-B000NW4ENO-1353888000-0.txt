review/summary: I'll be reading this again and againreview/text: I fell in love with the movie first, so I thought i would give the book a try. For those who loved the movie, the depth of the characters and complicated feelings it brings, the book is even better. I love that it gives insight into characters that the movie doesn't have a chance to expound on.I always finish the movie wanting just a little more. The book helps satisfy a bit of that. Even having seen the movie countless times, the book was still a page turner.Some are offended at the glorification of the south and the misrepresentation of slavery in the book. I don't think it's wrong to find the perspective represented as very idealistic. But maybe take it more as a book written from the warped view that some probably had about their relationships with their slaves. It really is about the end of a civilization and their entire way of life.
