review/summary: book club bookreview/text: I selected this book because I had a boss 30 years ago that said it was the best book she ever read. I suggested it for my book club book but didn't check to see how long it was. I find it hard to wade through all the muck to get to the story. Clearly the author was from Russia born in 1905 and saw much suffering which affected her writing. If I had it to do over, I would just go see the movie.There will be some interesting ideas to discuss at our meeting. People will have very differing opinions about how to treat the poor. Ayn Rand and Mother Teresa were at opposite ends of the spectrum.
