review/summary: A laugh Riotreview/text: This novel tells the story of Tressa Jayne who is quite famous as Calamity Jayne in her small town. The nickname is justified by describing a series of rather unfortunate and hilarious accidents that Tressa is involved in. Tressa character has all the shades of a blonde girl with no brains who ends up at the wrong place at the wrong time. During one of those accidents, Tressa happens to discover a dead attorney in her car and that is where the adventure begins.The mystery is fast paced and quite intriguing,it evokes a certain empathy for Tressa and you feel like cheering her on.The other characters especially the senior citizens added to the mix are well written and seriously funny. The off-on chemistry between Tressa and Ranger Rick is adorable. The author has painted a very colorful portrait of Tressa making the reader chuckle along the way. Some of the dialogues and exchange of one liners will make you smile. I don't want to reveal much but the portions of Tressa and her tight jeans and Tressa with a customer buying music CDs are remarkable and will have you laughing loudly. I highly recommend this book.
