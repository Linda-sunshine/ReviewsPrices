review/summary: The ultimate character writerreview/text: Jane Austen created Elizabeth Bennett - every respectable man's ultimate woman - and Mr. Darcy - the role model for all gentlemen. She combined romance and wit with real characters and a story that has enchanted every generation since it was published. For some, the language is a barrier, but perseverance will reward any reader with possibly the best book ever written.
