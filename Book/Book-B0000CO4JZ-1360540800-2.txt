review/summary: Depressing, Pointless (semi-spoiler)review/text: As with so many &#34;classics&#34;, this book does not hold up over time. It's not that I don't think we currently live in a society where most believe that wealth and fame will make us feel loved and happy. It's that in this day and age, it doesn't work to end a story without hope. We live in an age of mass consiousness raising. Yes, show us the &#34;evils&#34; in the world, but then show us what the alternatives are. Show us the answers. This book, and many that were ground-breaking in their day, tells the story of tormented people and was written by a tormented person, all who's lives ended tragically.
