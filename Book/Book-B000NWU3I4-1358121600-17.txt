review/summary: Truly, A Classic, In My Opinionreview/text: The Hobbit is a great book that, in my opinion should be taught to kids in school. The book has us go on a journey with Bilbo Baggins and The dwarves that include Thorin, Balin, Fili, Ori, and some ten other dwarves and for about half of the way, The Great Wizard Gandalf The Grey. This book has definitely inspired me to go see the movie. Though I feel that at some points, Mr. Tolkien may have overdone it just a smidge with the descriptions a bit, this is definitely one of the best books I've read in a while.
