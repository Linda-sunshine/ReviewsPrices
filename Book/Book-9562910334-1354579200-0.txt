review/summary: A Very Interesting Readreview/text: At first this book was not a book that I wanted to read, It was assigned to me as an English project I.S.U (Independent Study Unit) so like every kid in high school I started to dread it. As I started to read though, the story started to get better and better. There were points where I just wanted to continue reading and not put it down. The story is very well written, it gives you a very good idea as to what a Dystopian world could potentially look like. Although at the beginning it does start out very slow, it is a very good read.If you read this book and enjoyed it, also take a look at "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley. It is quite similar to "1984"
