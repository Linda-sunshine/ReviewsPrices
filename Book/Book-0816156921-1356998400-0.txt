review/summary: Classic Vampire Talereview/text: Finally got around to reading the penultimate Vampire Tale, from which the genre was inspired. The dialects were well written, but sometimes difficult to comprehend. Mostly due my lack of exposure to UK dialects. Once I shifted my mental gears, however, I enjoyed the dialogue.The main characters were definitely based on the period and location, and I felt they spoke and acted appropriately.I would say it was worth the wait to read it, except I should have done so sooner.If you have not yet read this classic novel, I would STRONGLY urge you to do so now.
