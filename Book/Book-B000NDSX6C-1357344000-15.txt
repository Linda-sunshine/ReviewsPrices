review/summary: Great listeningreview/text: We bought this at our daughter's request. When we saw that it would take 11 hours to hear the whole book, we asked her if we could &#34;test&#34; it on a drive to Phoenix (and back) at Christmas. With her approval (we'll take it to her this spring when we visit her in China), we were entertained for the whole trip plus another hour when we got home. Now we've seen the first of the three Hobbit movies, too and were more familiar with the characters than we would have been without the great preview.
