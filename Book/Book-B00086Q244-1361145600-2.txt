review/summary: Better than I expectedreview/text: I've known about this book, as well as other Dale Carnegie books, but never was interested in them due to the titles, which I thought, gosh, how manipulative! But after several people had recommended, I finally broke down and got this and another Carnegie book. Wow, was I wrong. Actually, rather than manipulative, this book is very positive and presents quite moral ideals.I now think this is a book that everyone should read at an earliest age possible. Maybe should even be a text book in school!
