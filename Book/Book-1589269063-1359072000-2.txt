review/summary: Gives a great understanding of people in generalreview/text: I loved this book. I feel it will help me with all kinds of relationships in life, not just romantic ones. I learned a lot about myself and what makes me happy, and was able to see how to better love all of the people in my life better. I'm not normally the type to read this kind of book because I'm stubborn and like to figure things out on my own, but I hit a rough path and felt like I could use a little guidance and this was just the thing.
