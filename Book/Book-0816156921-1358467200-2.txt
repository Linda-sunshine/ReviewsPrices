review/summary: Not what I expectedreview/text: This is much more engrossing than the typical Vampire fare seen on TV. My wife, who does not like horror, recommended this book. As usual, I am glad I listened to her. The book is not gory, but the fear can be felt through the pages. The struggle between good and evil captured me as I read this book. It is truly a classic.
