review/summary: Fantastic Readingreview/text: I loved this book...I bought this in Oregon at Powell's Books a few years ago on sale and I thought the writing was fantastic as well as the reader (Kate Burton). She was able to do so many accents for various characters and they sounded so good! This is how much I was a fan...when I first bought it, CD #11 didn't work...there are only 12 CDs so I was so frustrated. I really wanted to finish this with the reader I had started with! I call Powell's and they sent me a new set...and of course CD 11 didn't work. I ordered it off Amazon, and CD 11 didn't work. Finally, I called the publisher and begged and pleaded not just for a replacement but for someone to ensure that CD 11 worked before it came. They sent it for free and FINALLY FINALLY CD 11 worked and it was worth it. So yes, now I have 4 copies of this audio book which is a bit crazy, but hey, it was a great book!
