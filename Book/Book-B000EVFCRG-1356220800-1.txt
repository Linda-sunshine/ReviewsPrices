review/summary: An interesting and lovely storyreview/text: I have long been a fan of Louisa May Alcott and highly recommend Little Women be read to younger children as well as for teens. The engaging girls in this story are examined for their faults as well as their virtues. While it is an old fashioned tale, the message is timeless regarding choices that are made by young people. Also highly recommend &#34;Eight Cousins&#34; and it's sequel, &#34;Rose in Bloom&#34; by LMA.
