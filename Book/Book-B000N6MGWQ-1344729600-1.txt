review/summary: Excellent Characterizationsreview/text: I bought this book because I truly loved "Tuesdays w/Morrie" and in many ways, this one was even better. It would make a sweet movie as well. You'll love the main character and how the book evolves and you get to know him through the eyes of others. It's not preachy or religious, by the way.
