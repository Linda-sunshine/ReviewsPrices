review/summary: Awesomereview/text: I don't read Lee Child books. A friend recommended the Jack Reacher series and I tentatively picked up Killing Floor which I enjoyed. However his second book was a drag and I quit reading the series. When the movie came out, I was curious to see how the story shaped . Surprisingly it was a well made movie and I picked up the book. I am just glad that I did. It is well written and I finished it straight in 4 hours.Must read!
