review/summary: Pride and Predjudicereview/text: Prior to reading Pride and Prejudice, I had just completed reading Emma. I was so bored by the tedious nature of Emma that I couldn't see what the inspiration was of such a following as portrayed in the movie "The Jane Austin Book Club" which I thoroughly enjoyed and was inspired to read some of her works. I prevailed and went on to read another of her books, Pride and Prejudice. I am pleased to say that I'm hooked and am looking forward to reading another of her works. (I still feel that Emma was very tedious and boring though)
