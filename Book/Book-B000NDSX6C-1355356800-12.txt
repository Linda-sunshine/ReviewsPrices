review/summary: As great as ever!review/text: I first read The Hobbit in my teens, 50 years ago. It is like re- visiting an old and well loved friend. If the new movies are as good as I expect, then the journey will be complete and I shall be as contented as Bilbo at the end of the tale.I attended the 12:01 showing of Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey , this morning. It lived up to all my expectations and followed the book perfectly!
