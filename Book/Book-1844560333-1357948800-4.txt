review/summary: Everyone must read!review/text: This book is made for everyone!It is hardly ever slow, although some people might not be use to the writing style of that time, and has a delightful, strong lead heroine who never falters in her strength like most female characters now-a-days.So beautifully written and should be in everyone's bookcase
