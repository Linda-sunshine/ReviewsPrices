review/summary: A Classic Re-readreview/text: I had to read this in high school (16 years ago), and I remember it being a much easier read at the time than it is now (for me). Although I love Bronte's extreme detail of setting the scene or describing the garb that her characters wear -- the old English writing is definitely something that took me a bit of getting used to. I re-read several parts til I absorbed what what being said or who was saying it.The story of Heathcliff and Catherine is definitely an amazing one, and was the reason I chose to do this re-read. With so many references in 'Fifty Shades of Grey', and that character's love for old English writing I chose to re-read this classic & keep it on my main page of my Amazon Kindle for easy access to read it, refer to it & mull over.It is a classic re-read, but if you are not used to the old English you may want to use the dictionary on the Kindle and look up some of the 'lingo' that the Brontes were so famous for using.All in all, it is a great book with deep rooted characters, unrequited love, anger, and jealousy -- and much more that I do not want to give away. For that, you need to acquire this classic for yourself!
