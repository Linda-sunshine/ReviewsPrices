review/summary: Perfectionreview/text: This is most certain a timeless masterpiece in which Jane Austen achieved perfection. Pride and Prejudice is a reading bliss with its unique and beloved plot. The unsuspected decisions and changes of plot keep you on your toes wishing for more. The description and personalities of the characters is extraordinary and you feel yourself intrigued within the story, and falling in love with Mr. Darcy alongside Elizabeth. The end is perfect in every way possible, but you can't help yourself wishing for it not to end though. Her vocabulary and formality may at times be more difficult but it makes it all the more interesting. It's a timeless classic which I love and adore, and never tire of no matter how many times I read it! ~A.C.
