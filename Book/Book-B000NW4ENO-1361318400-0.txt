review/summary: LOVE!review/text: The first time I read this book many years ago when I was still in high school and did not take the time to appreciate the book like I should have. Now that I have purchased this book and have re-read it I have fallen in love with the character of Scarlet. Although it is a long book, it is totally worth it.
