review/summary: Love the book.review/text: I can only rate the book itself, as I haven't read it on my Kindle Fire HD. I downloaded it because I am a tremendous Tolkien fan and wanted this on my Kindle. The book is terrific, though my favorite is still The Lord of the Rings. So I highly reccommend the book, though I haven't checked out the Kindle version.
