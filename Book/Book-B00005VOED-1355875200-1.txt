review/summary: I've Read It and Own the 25th Anniversary Paperbackreview/text: John Kennedy Toole committed suicide so I'm sure if he live to see his story gain such success but if you haven't read it, it's a laugh out loud joy. I highly recommend it. Set in New Orleans, the main character is an adult still living at home with some major personal challenges - many of which are his own creation.
