review/summary: Might have been better during pregnancy...review/text: I read this book during the time I was trying to figure out why my baby wouldn't sleep well (or ever!). Turns out she had colic, acid reflux, AND food allergies. I tried all the suggestions in this book but unfortunately they did not help.I do think it would have been more helpful to have read this book while pregnant. Perhaps I would have had a better idea of suggestions and tips from the start... although, in my case, they would not have helped anyway. I found this to be a pretty quick read and have kept it just to reference for the next baby.
