review/summary: In a Galaxy We Know on a Planet not so Far Away It all Beganreview/text: Yes Virginia, science fiction and fantasy existed long before George Lucas created Star Wars. It existed in the mind of Edgar Rice Burroughs who many know through his Tarzan series. In Burrough's A Princess of Mars one finds every aspect of Star Wars; a heroic figure, a beautiful princess, forces of evil and in the end good triumphing over evil. All of this set in for Burrough's time on so distant planet with alien technology equally and in some instances more interesting than in the original Star Wars. In fact while reading this action packed story, I could not help but see the connection between Burrough's story written in the first half of the 20th century and Star Wars. This was an entertaining and fun read. Further, the Kindle price was right.
