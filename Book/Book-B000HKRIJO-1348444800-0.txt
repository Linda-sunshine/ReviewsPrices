review/summary: The best argument for Christianity without vitriolreview/text: C.S. Lewis will make you think deeply and give strong arguments on the existence of God. He's my favorite Christian author because he doesn't have to throw the book at you to make you realize the existence of God. He argues the scientific aspect of it, presents philosophical arguments about the existence of God, and then makes atheists think again about how and why God exists and makes Christians even more confident that the Lord is alive and well. On top of that C.S. Lewis used to be a strong atheist but his friendship with J.R. Tolkien helped him consider otherwise.
