review/summary: Groundbreaking bookreview/text: It must be at least 25 years since I first read "Man's Search for Meaning," and I still refer to it. Frankl spends about half the book describing his experiences in Nazi concentration camps, and the rest of the book discussing how he tried to make sense of it and teach others how to handle adversity. One of the most important books around, highly recommended.
