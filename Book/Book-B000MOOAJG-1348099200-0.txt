review/summary: Great Storyreview/text: I loved this story! Dagny is a great heroin with her strength and rational approach to business. It is long, which can put some people off. Ayn Rand had a message with this book and has added a lot of speechifying. However, if you get through these speeches, the story is fantastic.
