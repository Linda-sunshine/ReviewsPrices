review/summary: Quite boringreview/text: This was my first Stephen King book and it was not what I expected. Very slow and drawn out in the beginning. I didn't like the format it was written.I get the impression that this is not how Stephen King normally writes. It wouldn't put me off reading other .books he has written.
