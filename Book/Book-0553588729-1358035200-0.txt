review/summary: not worth buyingreview/text: I think people love this method which is fine. I'll probably use it but it's not worth buying to read. I heard there was a dvd. This book should simply be an article because that's the length of real content in the book. I am not a fan of books which constantly repeat the same things over and over again. I kept hoping I would read new things as I continued to read, but it was the same stuff throughout the book. It feels like they decided a certain length of book sells for a certain amount so just keep adding filler to get to that price point.
