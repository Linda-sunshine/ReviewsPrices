review/summary: A classic in a perfect devicereview/text: I first read JE in Spanish when I was 11 or 12 - my memory seldom serves me well. Years passed but JE didn't - have no idea how many times I read it! After some years of studying, I was able to read - and enjoy - Bronte in English. That was sublime! My printed version is really worn out now but I am enjoying my Kindle version greatly!Love all the features! Highlight and mark all my favourites paragraphs - and find them in a second! I gather more easily now all the lines that show how empty, wounded and deeply hurt EFR's soul was and how Jane gave Rochester's heart a voice. And a voice is meant to be heard... and followed.J+E's characters symbolize now to me an encounter of one spirit seemingly divided in two. But they both had to learn their lessons of acceptance and forgiveness before such awareness arose in their hearts.After leaving Thornfield, Jane's journey was about acceptance. She had to acknowledge - fully and wholeheartedly - her love for EFR past any conventionality. She came back to him out of love. She had no expectations but to be with his "best earthly companion".Rochester's journey was about forgiveness. He himself had to admit - heartily and unconditionally - his wrong actions and forgive himself. He lied, hid and manipulated out of fear. He did not know how to do things differently - out of love.
