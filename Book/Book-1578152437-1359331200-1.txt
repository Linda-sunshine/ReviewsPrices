review/summary: Horray for Dickensreview/text: I had not read Dickins before. I saw the movie version of Oliver and I think that helped me understand Dickins writing better. The book did not download properly and I only received the first half. Luckily I had a copy of the real book and could finish it. The Kindle stated that the rest would be automatically downloaded but it did not.
