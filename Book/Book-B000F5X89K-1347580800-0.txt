review/summary: Is Frankenstein a good book or a terriable book?review/text: The book Frankenstein was a pretty good read. There were many twists and turns in the plot I didn't expect. Although it is considered a horror book, there are some slow parts that you just have to get through before the attention-grabbing moments. The wording could be confusing at times which would spoil the horror effect on me. Many times I would get so frustrated with Victor for his negligence of the monster and his threats. However, overall the book was good and interesting and at times a little bit creepy.
