review/summary: So much better than the first timereview/text: Like others this was my second trip through Moby Dick. I am glad I chose this narrator. He brought out the wit and humor of the story - plus more irony and social commentary than I expected. I am sure many readers assume that Melville is wholly dark, sonorous, grave, and somehow "important." There is that, of course, but on the whole I found the language of the story consistently lighthearted - even breezy at times. This narrator captured it all - the highs and lows, the humor and the pathos, plus a rich and diverse assortment of memorable characters. When I originally read the book, I eventually began to feel that finishing it, alone, would be the reward. There is a brightness and spirit in this audio version that was lacking in my own head as I read the pages. The story came to life for me, and I was rewarded with every chapter.
