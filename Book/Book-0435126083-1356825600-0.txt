review/summary: Masterfully Written And An Obvious Classicreview/text: Wuthering Heights is a beautiful novel dealing with the human condition connected with love. Emily Bront&#1105; masterfully illustrates how love can dictate human emotion, devotion, and action in everyday life. Through Bront&#1105;'s use of juxtaposition between life and death or heaven and hell, we are introduced to the how love is one of the strongest metaphysical emotions humans acquaint with. This metaphysical passion transcends Mr. Heithcliff's daily routine and drives him to rash decisions of revenge, as well as producing an idea of active and passive forces throughout the novel. This includes the ideals of nature and society being such a force in the development of Catherine as she is unfairly controlled by the forces of Mr. Heathcliff. Bront&#1105;'s use of diction throughout the novel only reinforces the theme through an elegant Yorkshire style. Hefty English accents are thoroughly used, even to the point of confusion. This can most pertinently be noticed with Bront&#1105;'s character Joseph, who carries a heavy accent. All of these devices accumulate to form the imagery of underlying passion that is threaded page by page. Personally, her ability to use such complex and yet detailed imagery to advance the plot astounds me. I would wholly recommend this novel to any individual seeking an understanding to humans' mysterious and controversial collision with love.
