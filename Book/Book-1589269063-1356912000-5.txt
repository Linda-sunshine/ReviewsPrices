review/summary: It all makes so much sensereview/text: I was drawn to this book because I was recently engaged to be married for the second time. My first marriage lasted 22 years. If I had known the "primary love languages" at that time I may have not gotten divorced. Well, we can't change the past and I am going to try very hard to make my second chance at marriage successful!The book helped me identify those areas that make me happy and those of my fianc&eacute; through simple exercises. It was written in simple, easy to read format using different scenarios that I could identify with.I have shared it with my fianc&eacute; and family. Although some were hesitant at first, they have taken an interest in how it works. It was great reading and would recommend to anyone who is involved in a relationship.
