review/summary: The Giver in the classroomreview/text: The Giver by Lois Lowry is a concrete member of nearly all adolescent, young adult best novel lists. Lois Lowry's The Giver was published in the early 1990s. Shortly after, the novel found itself in the classrooms of English teachers. This relatively modern novel has been widely praised by students who have been assigned to focus their attention for the span of the assignment. It is my belief this should be the case and it should also be widely used by Social Studies teachers. As someone with a B.A. in History and an Integrated Social Studies license, this is a very effective way to teach students the characteristics of utopian societies. It can also be used as a method to study factory or company towns, such as the Pullman Town of late 19th century Illinois, which is a subject of study in United States History classes. If students have read The Giver before studying Pullman case and the strike that occurred as a result of the town's traits and how it applies to business of the era, lessons would almost certainly be more effective. Students of the class may find the objectives easier to understand. There are many novels where English and Social Studies teachers of all age levels (though it may be most effective at the middle and high school level) should combine forces to teach content. The Giver is a prime example of a great, compelling novel that should be used in English and Social Studies classrooms. Students may also enjoy that it is a quick and easy read.
