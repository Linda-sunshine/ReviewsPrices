review/summary: Atlas Shrugg on CDreview/text: Product arrived promptly. I had a little trouble getting use to the narrator but finally got into the book around track 8 of disc 1.I am listening to this for book club. It takes about 50 minutes to get through each disc. This was a good purchase for me sinceI spend a lot of time driving and don't have time to read a 1500 page book.
