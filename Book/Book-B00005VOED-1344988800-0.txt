review/summary: A Cnfederacy of Duncesreview/text: A Confederacy of Dunces was written by John Kennedy Poole. He was unable to find a publisher,although all these years later, it's become a cult classic and it would be a humorless person indeed, who didn't agree that this is the funniest book ever written!Unfortunately, Poole committed suicide in despair; he was 31 years old.His mother haunted publisher after publisher until it was printed and distributed.Along the way, it collected a Pulitzer Prize for Poole.This is not only the funniest novel, but the saddest story of an author.New Authors...never, never, never give up.
