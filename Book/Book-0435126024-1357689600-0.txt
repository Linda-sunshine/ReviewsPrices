review/summary: Wonderful!review/text: I've always been one to love the classics, and this one does not dissapoint. The vocabulary and writing style(s*) are encredible, I am enjoying this book throughly! I love the font-size/amount of words per page as it shows up on my phone, it makes reading very enjoyable. (*The authur had some misspellings that weren't caught by the publisher, but I think it adds to the charm. She also jumps from 1st to 3rd person without warning, and changes tenses, but again, it adds to the book.)
