review/summary: Great Titlereview/text: The book is well organized, and it shares a lot. It has many pictures from different countries and features J.R.R. Tolkien's colored sketches located in it's center.I was happy to pick this book up, I set the dust cover aside and to keep it in good shape. The book itself is layed out with annotations in side bars along the pages. Looking through it I see an editorial story of how the book came together in it's current finished version.Love this book, would buy another as a gift.
