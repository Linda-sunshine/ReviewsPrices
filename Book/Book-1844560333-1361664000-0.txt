review/summary: Austen's best novelreview/text: Others may vote for EMMA, but the story of Elizabeth Bennett and FitzWilliam Darcy's stormy romance has been read, dramatized, and filmed more times for the delectation of more readers. Enjoyed by teens through centenarians for two centuries, this comedy of manners belongs in every collection. A true comfort read--and a delight!
