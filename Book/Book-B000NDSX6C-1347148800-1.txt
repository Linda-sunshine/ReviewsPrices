review/summary: Beautiful story, beautiful bookreview/text: I bought this wonderful fancy edition of the Hobbit because I wanted a nice edition of the classic. I am fairly confident that this is the best edition ever printed. The actual book itself (without the dust cover) is clothbound in dark green and and has the title printed in gold on the spine. There is also a gold dragon outlined in gold on the bottom of the book (a really nice touch). It is very beautiful.The jacket is very beautiful as well. The jacket has gold everywhere and the golden color seems to catch and reflect light. The front cover has a picture of Smaug lying atop his hoard (hence all the gold). The back cover has a picture of the dwarves and Bilbo leaving Gandalf at the edge of Mirkwood. Spectacular. Overall, the jacket is very beautiful and makes the book shine.The story (as you may well know) is one of the best stories ever written. It remains (and always will remain) a classic. This book reflects the enchantment of the story. The thick, glossy pages and foolproof and durable binding are a testament to the quality of the story.The watercolor illustrations are another testament to the greatness of the story. Alan Lee dose a wonderful job replicating different events in the story. Alan Lee also drew gray pencil drawings taking up about a quarter of a page (those are done very well as well).Overall, the story is one of the best ever written and this edition of the story is probably the best version ever in print. The paper, print and binding quality is as good as you can get. Alan Lee also did a very good job on all his paintings and drawings. Almost every thing about this book is beautiful.
