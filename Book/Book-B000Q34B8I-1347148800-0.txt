review/summary: Delightfulreview/text: This year, I set out to complete a classic book challenge being offered on many book blogs. Among the items I needed to read was a classic play. Wary of Shakespeare, I turned to Oscar Wilde to fulfill that requirement. Boy, am I glad I did! "The Importance of Being Earnest" is delightful.The story revolves around two friends, Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff. Jack lives in the country but is always going to London to deal with his good-for-nothing brother, Ernest. However, his London friends know him as Ernest, and this "brother" doesn't actually exist. Algernon, meanwhile, is a London dandy who periodically takes off for the country to visit his dying friend, Bunbury (who also does not exist). When Algernon discoveres Jack's secret, he is anxious to visit Jack at home and meet his young ward, Cecily. He arrives at the estate, claiming to be the scandalous Ernest.Naturally, hijinks ensue. Jack is in love with Algernon's cousin Gwendolyn, who insists she could only ever love a man named Ernest. Cecily is also enamoured with a man of that name. Of course, both men cannot be Ernest. And this is where the comedy lies.The play is very short (my copy clocks in at 90 pages) but it is extremely funny. I'd seen the Colin Firth film version a few years ago and was happy to see that it was fairly faithful to the original text. Gwendolyn's mother, Lady Bracknell, is equally as witty in the book as she is in the film, and Oscar Wilde demonstrates his sharp wit at every turn.
