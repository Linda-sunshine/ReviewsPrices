review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: Do you like wizards? Are rings cool to you?The Hobbit blasts your mind with almost any thing you can think of.Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with Gandalf and the Dwarves to get there home back.But they run into something that only Bilbo can handle.I loved the Hobbit because Bilbo goes with the Dwarves and they go in the middle of a rock people fighting.They also fall into a cave with people that attack them.Does he get out? J.R.R. does an out standing job of writing this book.But wait The Hobbit has more, we have The Fellowship of The Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of The King.Thee Hobbit was AMAZING and I hope you like it to.
