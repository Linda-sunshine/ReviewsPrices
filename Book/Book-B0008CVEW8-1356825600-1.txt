review/summary: Long John Silver!review/text: This is a great adventure story that stands the test of time-not just for the hero's journey aspects, but also for the precise, scene-based narrative in which is was written. But for me, what sets it apart are the wonderful details surrounding a nautical adventure to the tropics and, most of all, John Silver. He is a wonderfully complex protagonist: tragic, complex, manipulative, smart, and impossible to predict. Like many, I read this as a child; my surprise was re-reading it in my early 30s and seeing how well it read now.
