review/summary: Very vividly writtenreview/text: I feel woefully inadequate to reviewing this book, as it is one of the great classics, and there's been so much said about it already down the years.My thoughts on reading it (apart from that it's a good book, and very vividly written) were that Emily carries out a very good analysis of what "heaven" or "hell" may mean to different people - that one person's "hell" may be different to another's. I have not read any studies on the book, so I don't know even if this is meant to be one of the themes, but that was my impression.I would definitely read this book again one day.
