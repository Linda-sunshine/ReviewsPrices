review/summary: Great Bookreview/text: Such a great book, as I read it for a project. It was easy and was full of adventure throughout the story. Gary Paulsen did an outstanding job with the numerous descriptive details and fun parts in the book. To add on, their were some humor and some sad parts, but i highly encourage reading this book for ages 7 - whenever you die.
