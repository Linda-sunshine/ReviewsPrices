review/summary: It's brand newreview/text: I have read "FRANKENSTEIN" before and suggest that anyone who judges the story by the movies do the same. I bought this book to display in my collection. It looks new. It smells new. It is quite a nice looking book. Yes, I did have to read it. If you've never read it-you DON'T know the story at all.
