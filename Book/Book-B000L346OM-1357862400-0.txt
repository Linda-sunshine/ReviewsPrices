review/summary: Read it againreview/text: I first read this book 40 years ago, and each time I re-read it, I take more away, because the meaning and purpose of living is specific to the moment of life, as Dr. Frankl expressed. This is probably the single most important work written in Psychology/Psychiatry in the 20th century. If you have not read it in a while, re-read it. If you never read it, do so.
