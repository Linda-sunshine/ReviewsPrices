review/summary: Calamity Jayne is a Smash Hitreview/text: I picked up this novel hoping for some fun. I mean, the name, the cover, the basic concept all point to a fun mystery read.And I was not disappointed!This book was a ton of fun to read. I found some of the similes and metaphors over the top, but not so much that it ruins it.There are lots of twists and turns in this accidental investigator's report. And you don't know who to trust, or who to believe. The only part I found that wasn't fair for a 1st person mystery is when she finds out who's behind it all we don't get to find out until later. I've always found 1st person mysteries are better when the reader knows everything the hero does. But it does help keep the suspense going so I'll cut her some slack... this time 8=)I'm looking forward to the next Calamity Jayne mystery. I'm sure it will be just as much fun and keep me up late reading again!
