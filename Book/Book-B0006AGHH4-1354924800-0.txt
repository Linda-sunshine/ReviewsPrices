review/summary: Why didn't I read this sooner?review/text: I didn't know anything about this book before I read it, I had only heard that it was a &#34;must read&#34;. I didn't even know the subject matter.What an eye opening and moving book. I grew up in a place where (obviously) slavery was long gone, and racism was fairly unheard of. I suppose that left me very ignorant to the realities of the slave trade in the U.S.I was moved to tears again and again as atrocities against the lovely characters in the book were committed. I was indignant at how people were treated, and frankly still are, in some parts of the world. It makes me wonder though... what would I have been like if I had lived in a time where slavery was widely practiced? I would like to hope I would be the same person I am now, but books like this really make you wonder...
