review/summary: Really?review/text: I thought I would read this book since it is so famous and respected as good literature. I found it was just people, some very wealthy, behaving badly. Not an entertaining topic, and a book I was glad to finish to put it behind me. I feel sorry for high school kids who have to read it.
