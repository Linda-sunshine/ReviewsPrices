review/summary: A timeless bookreview/text: A terrific book which helps put so many things in life in perspective. Unfortunately, evil exists in this world. Sometimes it's self imposed and sometimes we are just victims. Frankl leads one to understand that hope - hope in the future, hope for loved ones, or hope that one day you will be free of harm - can help you survive the most heinous of tragedies. A great book.
