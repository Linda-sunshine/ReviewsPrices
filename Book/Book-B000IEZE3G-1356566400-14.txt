review/summary: false advertisingreview/text: I had to give one star because there is no such catagory as zero starts, which is what this quack deserves. This product was supposedly a first edition, first print of Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone. Firstly, it is not a first edition or first print of the book, and secondly, it was large print, which was not advertised. We are very disturbed by the false advertising and plan on returning the book for a full refund.
