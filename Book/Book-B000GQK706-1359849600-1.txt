review/summary: A revisit to the original.review/text: I read this series back in the 70s and was a big fan. After so many years, and many viewings of the remarkable movies that were made by Peter Jackson, I felt it important to get back in touch with the original story. I found that having all three books in one volume was helpful in getting the actual flow of the story back into perspective.
