review/summary: Great Adventure story; missing linksreview/text: Of course, this classic of Stevenson is a real classic.A great story about a boy growing up in an Inn, then going to sea to find a treasure. Many twists in the plot and a good outcome. Gives at the same time a look in early 19th c. life and a bunch of less used vocab, including maritime vocab :).The Kindle edition should have links from the table of contents (which was nicely scanned from the printed version), to the various chapters in the book.I remember that I have read (a translated) paper version a long time ago, and that there was a postscript, saying that 'he would not reveal the islands location' or something to that end. I missed that in this edition. Not sure why. Where there different editions originally, some having a epilogue, and some not? Is my memory failing? Something else? Anyway, it is a good idea to add also the very final pages, even if they do not contain any story.Recommended! (Four stars means for me: really good book, but not that top level of A++)
