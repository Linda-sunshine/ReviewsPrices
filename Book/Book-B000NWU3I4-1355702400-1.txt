review/summary: Teachers buy this over iTunes or Audible versions.review/text: I bought the audio CD's about 5 years ago from a used book store. The story is well read with varied voices for each character. The narrator can go a tad slow at points, but it's much faster than a "popcorn read," and it saves your voice if you have multiple sections (I have 4 of Freshman English) to read to.Why is this better on audio CD?1. Compatibility Issues: I bought "The Hobbit" on iTunes after my iPad refused to play certain chapters over my iTunes Match from my computer. I find this rather suspicious considering that my MacBook Pro had no problem playing the burned copy of my CD before.2. Mp4 Recording: It's split into "two books" meaning that each book is somewhere between five and 6 hours long. No 3-5 minute snippets like the CD's have which make it super easy to start and stop for classroom readings.3. iTunes Player stinks: You cannot easily start and stop from a specific second of the recording. Instead it jumps about a minute and a half at a time. Good luck starting at a specific paragraph if you accidentally bump a key. It won't happen.If you have the audio CD, you can play this from a CD player, or burn it to a computer and choose a variety of digital players to use. iTunes works just fine so long as you're dealing with the 5 minute long clips as opposed to their 5 hour long clips.If you're brave, you can also loan this out to other students or perhaps a new teacher.
