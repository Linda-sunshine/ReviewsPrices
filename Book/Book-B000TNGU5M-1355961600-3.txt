review/summary: Black Hole for the Soulreview/text: This is the story of a Transylvanian Jewish boy's total emersion into the hell of the Holocaust. It flows dramatically like innocence caught in a raging river of hate. When I finished the marathon of hopelessness, I read it backwards like the Hebrew book it is. I retraced in slow-motion the journey from the concentration camp back to its source--the boyhood home of the Wiesel Family. Reading it forward and backward opened me to the deepest parts of my own soul. This is a book you can never forget. If you have the courage, read the Diary of Anne Frank along with it. Somewhere in that Black Hole of humanity, you will see the glimmer of the light of your own Hanukkah.
