review/summary: Classic at its Bestreview/text: Fell in love with this novel when I had to read it for introduction to fiction class. Even though the novel lacks the description of nature, it enables one to feel rural England with its green meadows and fields. The plot is basically a soap opera but it is simply fun to read and see how it develops till it reaches the good end. Therefore, it is a truth univerisally acknowledged that the lovel of great literature must be in want of reading this book :).
