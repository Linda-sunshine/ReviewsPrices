review/summary: It's a classic and now I know why.review/text: Wonderful story line and beautifully written. She writes so that you can really feel the characters' emotions and almost see into their souls. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the archaic vocabulary is something one just has to wade through. I get the gist of it though and that's what counts.
