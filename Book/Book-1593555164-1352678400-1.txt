review/summary: One Shotreview/text: ONE SHOT (Pub. 2005) is Lee Child's ninth novel and my favorite book in the Jack Reacher series.What I like most is the intricately woven facets surrounding a 'who done it'. Lee layers interesting plot points with subtle but constant tension.Reacher is at his absolute best in this story. He's called into a heinous crime scene in a backwards way. The sniper arrested for killing six people in a public courtyard tells the cops, "You got the wrong guy." Then he says, "Get Reacher for me."'Reacher's reluctance to help the accused sniper is overshadowed by his certainty that something is not right. I love the way Reacher methodically and ingeniously unwinds the DA's airtight case.Lee manages to give us non-stop tension, an intriguing mystery along with a couple scoops of romance and some cool factoids while he makes Reacher fight and think in his classic Reacher way. Good stuff - go buy it!
