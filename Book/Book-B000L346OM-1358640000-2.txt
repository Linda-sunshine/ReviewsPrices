review/summary: Worthwhile Read...review/text: I was recommended this book by a Psychologist as I am studying at the moment. It is an amazingstory, the book is divided into 2 parts the first being his encounters of his time in a POW camp duringWW2. The second part being about how he survived the atrocities by using skills he taught himself &later developing the techniques used today known as Logotherapy. Easy to read & absolutely riveting...
