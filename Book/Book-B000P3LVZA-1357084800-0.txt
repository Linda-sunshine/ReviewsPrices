review/summary: Commentary or Prophetic muses...review/text: Aldous Huxley creates in this book the &#34;Brave New World&#34;, a hilarious commentary on what may be considered a scientific ideal set in the future, or commentary on the expectations in his own 20th century realizations of a scientific movement. Either way, the &#34;Brave New World&#34; does not disappoint the reader. You can expect a little hilarity in every chapter concerning his observations indicative of a heightened sense of awareness of the concerns in society. Those things that the modern world takes for granted are copiously elaborated in his &#34;Brave New World&#34;, unexpected and uniquely distinguished with an air of humor. His observations are elaborate and of a keen sense and the writing is excellent and a joy to read. The chapters are relatively short and never laborious or containing any sense of tedium. I would recommend this book to anyone for a good reading experience and a wonderful adventure into the &#34;Brave New World&#34;.
