review/summary: Unexpected Lovereview/text: My emotions were all of the place with this book. I consisted of well placed imagery and overall events. I believe I actually cried a few times, especially towards the end. I'm can truly and honestly say that I loved this book and I'm glad I had to read it for my AP English class.
