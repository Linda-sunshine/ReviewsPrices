review/summary: happy with book but not with tom....review/text: I love all of lee childs books... my only disapointment is that they made tom cruise play Reacher.... I thought he was suppose to be tall and rugged looking. I would of liked to see vin deisel or the rock.... much better to look at then the short guy tom.... not sure if im gonna go see the movie or not.... seeing tom as reacher just ruined for,,,, i am not a big cruise fan.....
