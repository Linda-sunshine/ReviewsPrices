review/summary: You've Come a Long Way, Babyreview/text: The secret to enjoying Jane Eyre is to read the first two thirds, and then stop. If you ignore that advice, you might conclude that a woman&#8217;s ideal role is something akin to slavery: total submission to the other gender.Yuk!The two men Jane involves herself with are certainly egomaniacs. Perhaps I&#8217;ve gone too far&#8212;maybe they&#8217;re just maniacs. Maniacs that Jane is more than willing dedicate her life to. The eccentricities of their personalities don&#8217;t bother her at all. What was Bront thinking of?A comparable near contemporary female character is Lizzie Hexam [Our Mutual Friend (Dickens, 1864-65)]. Like Jane, Lizzie was strong. Like Jane, Lizzie submitted herself to a dominant male, Eugene Wrayburn. Perhaps a significant difference is that the man Lizzie served, if not a perfect human, was worlds more appealing (at least to me) than either Eyre&#8217;s Edward Rochester or St. John Rivers.The last third of this book is all the more disappointing because of the quality of the two thirds that preceded it. Jane began as a woman with intellectual curiosity and strength of character. The life and future she ends with are anything but hopeful.
