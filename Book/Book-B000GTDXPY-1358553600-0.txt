review/summary: I didn't finish itreview/text: I started this thinking it was a clean book and for some misguided reason, I equated clean with no swear words. It was silly of me, and I didn't get far into this book before I gave up on reading swear words and half finished blond jokes. So, although it might have been an awesome book, I deleted it. I'm tired of having to endure swear words to enjoy a book.
