review/summary: One of the greatest books of all timereview/text: This book takes the reader on such a moving and satisfying journey. After many tears and many times laughing out loud I just finished the last page. I wish it hadn't ended, and yet the story is perfectly whole. I'm already estimating how long it will take to digest it so that I can read it again. It gets a little slow in the latter third, yet wraps up so beautifully that it's all worth it.
