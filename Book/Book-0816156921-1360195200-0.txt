review/summary: Bram Stokers Draculareview/text: It's Dracula, what more needs to be said. Tho not the original vampire story, it is the classic vampire story that set the stage for all the horror stories to follow. Set in Victorian England this story has been viewed on many levels, from horror story to social commentary on Victorian mores to the authors personal horror of society.
