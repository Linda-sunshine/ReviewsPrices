review/summary: Running Blind is another great Jack Reacher book.review/text: I love the Jack Reacher series! All of the stories keep me on the edge of my seat. It's great entertainment.And this one is no exception. Lee Child's style of writing is clear and descriptive. Because I enjoy these books so much, I refuse to see the movie that was recently released...the Jack Reacher in my head could never be represented by a mere mortal.
