review/summary: The Greatest Tale of Allreview/text: For me, professor Tolkien's tale is the best tale, I know.Though it has in many ways served to define the fantasy genre, it is wrong to call the book a fantasy in itself. This a fairy-tale of the old kind - but also myth and legend. The reader clearly senses the depth of history in world that Tolkien describes, and this current of untold stories, myths and legends from earlier ages draws the reader into the world.Foremost, however, this is the story of how the deeds of the small is what changes the world and defeats evil rather than the great or might of arms, and finally it is, for me, the greatest tale ever told.
