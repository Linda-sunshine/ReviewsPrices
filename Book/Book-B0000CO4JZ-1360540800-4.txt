review/summary: Timeless little jewel..and speaks to our own timesreview/text: This book reads with deceptive simplicity, light and frothy, but in reality it's beautifully crafted. As another reviewer mentioned, it is even better to read later in life, even if you read it back in school, it will 'land' differently now.The story is timeless and very American. The self created master of the universe, still looking out and coveting from his gilded perch.We live in a world full of greedy strivers and wannabes, grasping for success at all costs and often achieving it; who create their identities out of whole cloth, and who we then look up to admiringly, unaware of any seedy backstory.This book is as contemporary now as it was almost 90 years ago when it was written, and probably will continue to be, so long as humans continue to be the greedy schemers they have been to date!And it is written so beautifully. Fitzgerald would be enjoying his renaissance and he deserves it, as his own life was as full of tragedy as it was glitter and praise.
