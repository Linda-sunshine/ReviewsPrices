review/summary: Wonderful bookshelf bookreview/text: I purchased the Hobbit, Illustrated Edition for my grandson. It came so fast, I couldn't believe it. It met all my expectations as a beautiful book. I am sure he will have it forever and enjoy reading it more than once. The colored glossy pictures are great and all in all it's just a very well made book. Thanks
