review/summary: goodreview/text: as expected. I like Reacher and I hope Child had nothing to do with the casting of Tom Cruise, because now I see his image while reading and it's damn jarring. Plot is good and the usual twists and turns help keep the reader engaged. Child is a good writer of this genre.
