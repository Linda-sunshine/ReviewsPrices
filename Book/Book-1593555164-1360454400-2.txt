review/summary: Good readreview/text: Typical Jack Reacher. Super smart, super tough, solves the crime/problem, gets the girl, then moves on to the next destination via bus. A number of scenes from the &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; film closely resemblance to book, but, as you'd expect, there are significant divergences also. Worth picking up.
