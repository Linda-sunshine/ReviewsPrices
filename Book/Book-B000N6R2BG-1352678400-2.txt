review/summary: American drivelreview/text: I regret buying this book for my E -reader. I have read Jodi Picoult books before and enjoyed them, but this book was a lot of drivel. A most unlikely story with touches of Mills and Boon. A boring and unlikely plot which may be attractive to people believing in psychics, angels and the like, but I found it almost impossible to finish.
