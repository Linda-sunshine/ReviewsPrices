review/summary: Do not order this version of a great bookreview/text: This is the cheapest version of any book I've ever seen! I wondered if I had received the wrong book when I saw how THIN this paperback is. Well, here's how they did it: The print is so small as to be unreadable, in addition to the ink's being so light that it is grey instead of black. The pages are not even numbered! The paper is of lowest quality. Overall it's an embarrassment of poor quality. Mr. Fitzgerald would not approve and neither do I.
