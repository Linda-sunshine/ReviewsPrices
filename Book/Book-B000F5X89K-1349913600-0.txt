review/summary: Frankensteinreview/text: I really enjoyed reading this book. It started off a little slow but that is simply how the author chose to introduce the characters. It was well written and engaging. Part of the story is told by Frankenstein and part by the monster. He finally has a voice. I have heard of the story but never understood all the details until reading this book.
