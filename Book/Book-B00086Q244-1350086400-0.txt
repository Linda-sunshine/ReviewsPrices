review/summary: common sensereview/text: Like most basic psychology, most of what this book preaches is common sense. However, it brings it to the forefront of your mind so that you consiously think about your interactions with others. I think the anecdotes he provides are great and the advice is sound. I would recommended reading a chapter at a time, and after you do, spend a few minutes thinking over it and how you can implement his suggestions in your day-to-day life.
