review/summary: I absolutely love it.review/text: I was expecting a lot of extra information on the Hobbit, but I was surprised by how much more there was. It can be busy sometimes, but you can just look right past the extra stuff and read the book if you want. Or, if you've already read it, take the time and soak in the amazing information that this version provides. The illustrations are particularly interesting. I would recommend this to any fan of the Hobbit book. It's amazing :)
