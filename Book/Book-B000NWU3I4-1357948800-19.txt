review/summary: The Hobbit and Tolken's workreview/text: I've been a lover of Tolken for a very long time so I'll put this all into one review.The Hobbit is a great book I am read it a number of times as well as the Lord Of The Rings But I've never been able to see it as a childrens book it is a great book and it helps to get the most out of the The Lord Of the Rings.Of which I gave a copy of to my nephew when he was in the 8th grade and he won an award. Bilbo's Journey is a good book to but more on a theogical form.Charles Perry
