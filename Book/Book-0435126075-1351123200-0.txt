review/summary: A Classic and A Favorite!review/text: I actually had bought this book but didn't immediately read it. It wasn't until I had to watch the 2005 movie for my Women in Literature class that I fell in love with it. I quickly started reading this book and couldn't believe I waited so long. It is definitely one of my all time favorite books.
