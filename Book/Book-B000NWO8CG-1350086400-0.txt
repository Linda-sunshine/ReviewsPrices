review/summary: fabulous revisitreview/text: Re-reading this book was a wonderful decision. I read it when I was ten or eleven and enjoyed it, reading it as a mature woman, with life experince under my belt the book was the same and yet so different. I know I enjoyed it more this time but although it is the same book my prospective is so different, it was like a new book. It is no wonder that this book is still so read, it is still real and insightful into family interactions and personal observations by the all of charactersI recommend it highly
