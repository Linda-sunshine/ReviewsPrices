review/summary: Interesting concept on Heavenreview/text: This book wasn't what I expected it to be, but it was an interesting story on life & death. The story tells about a man's life as a maintenance worker for an amusement park. They story jumps back in time to different milestones in his life up until his death. When he dies and goes to Heaven, he meets 5 different people from his past that all played significant roles in his life OR that he was a significant part of their death. It was an easy reading story that kept my interest. It's not the typical story about dying & going to Heaven.
