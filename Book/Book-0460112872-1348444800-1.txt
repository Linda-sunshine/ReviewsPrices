review/summary: Jane Eyrereview/text: I read Jane Eyre when I was 15 years old. That was 58 years ago. Reading it now I realize what a wonderful book this is. The use of the English language is remarkable. The way the author describes a scene so expressive and emotionally dramatic. I am glad I have reread the book at an age where I can better appreciate how wonderful it is.
