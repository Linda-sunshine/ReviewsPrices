review/summary: You cannot get much better than Tolkienreview/text: I love Tolkien's world. The vibrancy, the realistic character portrayal, the in depth descriptions and the sheer imagination and fortitude it took to concoct these imaginary lands is astounding. Whether you appreciate the fantasy genre or not, this classic book series is in a class by itself. This is one of those rare books - like the Harry Potter novels - that one can read over and over and never get bored of. It can take a bit of time to get used to the &#34;Middle English&#34; language (read: much like old English) however, once you get used to it is becomes smooth sailing. The plot is engaging and you find yourself caring about the characters very easily. Tolkien was a true master of the story telling art. The Audible reading (by Inglis) is really a treat as well.
