review/summary: Short and... well not sweetreview/text: Overall Dorian Gray is a good jaunt. Some people have called the book crude but, considering the content, perhaps crude is the best way to present this book. You are supposed to hate most of the characters. Besides the artist, most characters are the very definition of Fench Decadance and some even get their just rewards. This is a free book so just buy it and enjoy the short story about what happens when vanity runs rampant. Cheers
