review/summary: and so it goesreview/text: Vonnegut....what else is there to say? If there is any negative critic out there, I'd likely read it, but already I am a skeptic about his or her literacy.I've laughed, and nearly cried at his stories but he is able to convey the tragedies, the horrific, the mundane in an unsentimental way that is the hallmark of every great writer.Don't miss it, if you haven't read it and the others, you shouldn't consider yourself well-read.
