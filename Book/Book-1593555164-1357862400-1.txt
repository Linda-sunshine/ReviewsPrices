review/summary: Characters not reponding, over and over and over.....review/text: The idea of character not responding to each other is life like but this idea does not edify a book at all. Once is enough to say that Jack did not respond...said nothing. I just got tired of that being used over and over. And the lady who showed up long enough to have sex with Jack then is not menti oned again was not good move. Why not just high a prostitute if he cannot keep his pants zipped.
