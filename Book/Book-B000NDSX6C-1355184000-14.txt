review/summary: Fanstasy classicreview/text: The Kindle version of this wonderful title includes JRRTolkien's drawings of key scenes (Beorn's Hall, the Troll's camp). The text is formatted well, and the book is only a couple dollars. I bought this to refresh my memory before the movie came out, and I was not disappointed.
