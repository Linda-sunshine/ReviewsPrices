review/summary: Amazing!review/text: This book has been well thought out and is an amazing story. I can't wait to read the next one! The storyline pulls you from the very beginning and doesn't let you go until the very end. Jonas was a very relatable character and was my favorite. There are points in the book where I thought should be rewritten or is unnecessary. Great Job Lois Lowry! This will be a book that is enjoyed for many years to come.
