review/summary: There and Back Againreview/text: I have read The Hobbit and the Trilogy many times since I first found out about it in 1967. It's a classic that should be read by all. I bought this along with the Trilogy to replace my paperbacks that I have &#34;read to death&#34;. Shipper was on time and packed well.
