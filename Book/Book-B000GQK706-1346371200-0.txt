review/summary: Best purchase I've made this year.review/text: I think money spent on books is never a waste and this particular one is definitely worth the 50 bucks. Beautifully made it's even more astonishing to look at than you'd expect from the pictures. It's also printed in an agreeable sized font so it's not tiring to read and it comes with a bunch of appendixes, maps an explanations which help in getting more involved into the story. A must have for all LOTR true fans out there.
