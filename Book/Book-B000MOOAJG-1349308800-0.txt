review/summary: not wirtten for a mature audiencereview/text: The focus of the book, as everyone probably already knows, is on the individual and the evils or limiting nature of socializm. This is an interesting and currently, widely held philosophy that represents the basis for some political platforms. While it is not important whether I agree or disagree with this perspective, it is of note that the book appears to be written for a 6th grade audience and has simplistic, sometimes child-like characters that become of little interest as the book drones on.I guess that I was expecting more and can understand why this book didn't do well with an educated public.
