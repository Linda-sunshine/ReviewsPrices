review/summary: One of the finest adventure books ever written.review/text: Just finished this book for the second time, the first was 30 years ago. I enjoyed it just as much this time as did when I was younger, it is a timeless classic. I can not think of any way this book could halve been improved upon. Tolkien was one of the world's best authors with the tales that he weaves, a true mastermind. If you are looking for a true adventure story look no further, you will not be disappointed in The Hobbit.
