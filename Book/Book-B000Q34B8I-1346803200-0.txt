review/summary: The Importance of Being Earnestreview/text: It's a very funny, satiric look at life in England at the turn of the century. The wit and humor is possibly dated. I don't believe a young person today would find it as humorous as I did (as a boy) and still do. I still recommend it as a good "vacation" read.
