review/summary: Ended abruptlyreview/text: I love most of Jodi Picoult's books but this had some unrealistic characters and was quite predictble, The end (if you could call it that) left me disappointed.....She didn't let us know what happened to Faith just left you hanging wondering what became of the whole story line. I would have recommended it until the end but I was disappointed she didn't really end it. I thought I was missing pages. Very disappointed!
