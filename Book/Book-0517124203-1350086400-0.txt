review/summary: Insanity in a bad wayreview/text: When i was a child this story always captivated me, but reading this tale as an adult left me annoyed and confused. Though the language is remarkable, the story itself us hard to follow at best. It is disjointed and fractured. Characters are introduced for such a brief time that they are not know or likeable by the time they exit. Two stars for ingenuity, but the lacking connectedness.
