review/summary: Amazon, where are the reviews for the audio CD?review/text: I object to the reviews presented by Amazon for the CD, "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: A Signature Performance by Elijah Wood." I could not find a single one. The 700-some reviews were for books. Tell me about the CD audio: Is Woods' accent true? Is his delivery compelling? Is the presentation truly unabridged or are there omissions? inaccuracies? I loved the sound of his reading voice because it seemed boyish, not like an adult actor trying to sound boyish.
