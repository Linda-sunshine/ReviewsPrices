review/summary: A classic worth readingreview/text: This book is entertaining and extrodinary well written. It made me laugh reading about the elder Miss Trixie who was not allowed to retire because of people wanting to "help her". The book is insightful and an amazing observations about the condition of life. I don't want to give anything away not out of rudeness, but the book is just a pleasure to read and I don't want to spoil it. Honestly, this is absolutely the best book I have ever read. If I could read only one book in my life...this book would be my selection. I have given this book as holiday gifts to friends and family and they have nothing but praise for it. Read it and enjoy : ).
