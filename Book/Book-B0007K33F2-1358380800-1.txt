review/summary: what I bought, not what i expectedreview/text: Count of MC is quite possibly one of the best books ever written. This 300-450 page novel does not do it justice. A lot of passages have been edited out and in some way translated extremely poorly. As a fan of Dumas or just a reader I would NOT recommend this book, instead go and get the 1000-1100 page version, idk if they make it in a softcover though, but that edition is EPIC.This is like watching a movie in fastforward, you miss a ton of the most important vital conversations/scenes b/c you're only skipping through for the action, and then just as you're about to get interested it'll end.Great for highschool book reports terrible for people that actually enjoy reading.
