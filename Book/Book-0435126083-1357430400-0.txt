review/summary: Intriguing yet leaves you with mix emotions.review/text: I read this book because is a must read and I heard it mentioned in many movies/shows that I thought I had to give it a try. I was not interested in the beginning but it turned out to be a page turner although I was disappointed at how it ended, not sure there was any other way to end it but while reading it I wondered if there was a movie about it (never searched to see)...some how I kept picturing Gerald Butler as Heathcliff.
