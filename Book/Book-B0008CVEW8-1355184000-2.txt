review/summary: Stevenson's masterpiecereview/text: As a child, I saw the Disney movie when it first came out. Later, I read the Classics Illustrated (comic book) version. It was not until I was 23 years old and in the Navy that I finally got around to actually reading the book itself in the edition with the Wyeth illustrations. I found it to be a perfect masterpiece. Of course, I was already familiar with the characters and the plot, so nothing came as a surprise One oddity of my childhood was that I somehow managed to get through it without reading any of the classic books except in comic book form, so it was only in my twenties that I went back and read the actual books. I visited Scotland and toured a museum in Edinburgh devoted to Burns, Scott and Stevenson. Among other items, I remember that there was a rocking-horse that belonged to Stevenson as a child. Adults reading this book need to find an essay by Stevenson on the internet titled A Humble Remonstrance, which sort of goes with this book, but would be boring to a child. In the 1960s I remember being on a bus that was going along a causeway in Miami, and one of the artificially-created islands of the causeway was Treasure Island. There was a boy on the bus who said to his mother that he was sure that this was the real Treasure Island. Fortunately she didn't spoil his opinion with the rude truth. Recently I was talking with a trio of teenagers and told them that this was my favorite book. They responded in a rude fashion and declared that it was boring. I suppose that they had been forced to read it in school, a process which seems to invariably backfire in its well-meaning attempt to cast pearls before swine. Stevenson was looked down upon by intellectuals for a long time because he was popular and wrote for the young, but eventually even the snobs had to admit that he was a fine writer. The real treasure of Treasure Island is the book itself.
