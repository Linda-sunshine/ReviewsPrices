review/summary: A timeless favouritereview/text: This is the book to choose if you would like to dip your toe into the works of Dickens for the first time. It's easy to read with engaging and colourful characters and a classic and timeless moral - mixed with several good doses of humour & social history and an occasional jab at Victorian politics. Timeless.
