review/summary: Lovely, Sturdy Cover and Clear Reading Editionreview/text: There are many covers, bindings, and font options available for The Hobbit, but I found this version to be lovely, sturdy, and clear to read. It's also survived my overzealous seven-year-old, and that, in itself, is quite the feat.As for the actual book--it's content, I mean--there are plenty of reviews about what a wonderful, rich tale Tolkien's created. I can only add to what others have said by stating that this book meant enough to me, as a child (and now as an adult) to be one of those I couldn't wait to pass on to my own children (who, in turn, have embraced it fully).
