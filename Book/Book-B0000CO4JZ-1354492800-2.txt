review/summary: read for my book clubreview/text: I read this back in high school and now recently for book club. I thought it was a quick easy read and can now see why so many movies and other books reference it. I liked it, some in my bc did not. like many books it's about what you love. I thought the writing was beautiful, story was a bit sad, but without doubt a must read.
