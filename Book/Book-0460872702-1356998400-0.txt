review/summary: A Classic and a Good Readreview/text: In my younger years my dad gave me some good advice. "When you feel like criticizing anyone, put yourself in their circumstances first."I never saw my grandmother, but I'm supposed to look like her. I had a rich uncle, who lived near the rich and famous, but he didn't live in a mansion like the Gatsby's. However, like Nick carraway, the narrator in this novel, I was awestruck by the wealth, my uncle's way of life and the rich and famous.I loved the movie that was based on this novel, and found the book to be delightful reading. F. Scott Fitzgerald did a great job of bringing to life the characters in his novel and making them have flaws like everyone has from time to time. I have heard the jazz age was a wonderful time in lots of ways and this novel brings the way of that world into our minds, hearts and fascination. I imagine our lives would be very mundane without great writers like this. I hope everyone explores this classic tale.Jeannie Walker Award Winning Author of "Fighting the Devil" - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murder
