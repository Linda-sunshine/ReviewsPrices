review/summary: Scary!review/text: I think even though the book is sometimes hard to follow, because the author jumps back and forth between different scenes, it is overall a well written book. The idea that something likes this could happen is very scary.Overall, I wish the author would have tied up some of the ends, and not included so many open endings for the reader.One of the parts that made me mad, was when the commander reveals that some things have to be kept hidden and that "nature demands" certain things to be available to men. Even though they put up this laughable farce, that women are the most valuable in the society, they get treated very badly .... all around. Almost everybody is miserable in this new society and the total deprevation of human contact and being used in the most disrespectful way was a good way of illustrating the need humans have for social interaction.Since the author was in West Berlin when she started the book, it is easy to see the connection to East Berlin and how people where kept locked away and lived in very simple conditions ... what I mean by that is the lack of choices at grocery stores, entertainment, and other things like furniture/cars etc. The basic needs covered, but not much else.Overall, the author did a great job and I would recommend this book to any book club.
