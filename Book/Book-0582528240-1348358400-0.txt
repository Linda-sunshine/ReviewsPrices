review/summary: sense of nostalgiareview/text: What I liked most about this book was the sense of nostalgia it induced. The events Huck experiences may be dramatized for entertainment value, but they highlight the real sort of internal struggles we all experience as young teens. Huck battles with loyalty, friendship,and trust issues. This is one of the best pieces of classic literature I have ever had to read for school. Twain has the sort of flaire in his writing that speaks of quiet wisdome and soul. He also has brilliant insight into the human condition.
