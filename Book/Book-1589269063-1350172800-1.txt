review/summary: Worth the Moneyreview/text: If you read one book on how to create a happy relationship, this is the book. It is an Amazon number 1 kindle in three categories, relationships, Marriage, and psychology and has been since it came out. It is only about 200 pages long, and honestly he could have said it all in less than fifty pages (although I enjoyed the extra 150 or so). It is so obvious when you read it, kind of like saying, "the sky is blue," when somehow that fact escaped you.So the 10,000 dollar question is: Do you know how your partner most experiences LOVE? Because everyone experiences what they consider to be LOVE in different waysWords of Affirmation: This individual feels most cared for (loved) when their partner TELLS them how much they care for them, appreciate them and such.Acts of Service: This individual feels most cared for (loved) when their partner DOES something for them.Affection: This individual feels most cared for (loved) when their partner TOUCHES them. Such as hugs, kisses, holding hands and sex.Quality Time: This individual feels most cared for (loved) when their partner SPENDS TIME with them, no matter how trifling the activity, this person does not feel loved unless their partner is spending some time with them.Gifts: This individual feels most cared for (loved) when their partner gives them MATERIAL THINGS.I recommend this to anyone who wants to love and be loved.
