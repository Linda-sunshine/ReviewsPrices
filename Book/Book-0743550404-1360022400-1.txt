review/summary: Not enough meat to the story!review/text: Stephen King makes a bold statement in this book's afterward. He claims that readers will either love this or hate it. While I didn't hate it, King is capable of so much more. The reasons he gives for loving/hating it didn't apply to me though. Basically we're given an odd mystery and the answers are hard to come by. I think the book would've been better served with more extended flashbacks to the time of the original mystery. Overall, it was too quick and mundane for me.
