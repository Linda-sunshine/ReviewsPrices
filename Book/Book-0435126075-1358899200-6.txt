review/summary: Dictionary lookup does not work on K4/KT/KPWreview/text: I'm only giving a 1 star review because of the single issue referenced in my review title (it would be lovely to have separate 'formatting' reviews). It applies only to the edition of P&P; with ASIN 'B008476HBM' (Pride and Prejudice) and only on basic Kindle, Paperwhite, and Kindle Touch (these pay attention to language attributes so as to use a 'matching' dictionary).This happens to be the only edition of P&P; enabled for WhisperSync for Voice (with a free audiobook available from Audible) which is why I got this edition and have discovered this issue.Otherwise, the formatting is good, and (so far as I've read) free of typos. The price is right. And of course, the story is great, and everybody should read it.It seems the language attribute for the book is not set to 'English' and so (again only on K/KT/KPW) one gets 'Dictionary Not Found" even though an English dictionary is available. On my Kindle Touch, it does a lookup in the Italian dictionary that I happen to have on there (and of course fails to find these English words). Dictionary lookup works fine on my Fire and I'm guessing on Kindle Keyboard and older Kindles, which always use the one and only default dictionary.It is probably possible to edit the language attributes (e.g. with calibre) so that it works correctly. But that only fixes that instance. Fresh downloads from Amazon will still have this problem, at least until it is fixed.
