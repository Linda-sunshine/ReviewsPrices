review/summary: Delightful every timereview/text: Each time I read the Hobbit I am always enchanted by this world and the character of Bilbo. It is a more enchanting book than the Lord of the Rings: less defined, less certain, and more magical in every sense. It is also interesting to note just how many references there are to the First Age such as the swords were forged in Gondolin, Glamdring belonged to King Turgon, and threads are started that continue into LotR such as where the ring is found, which is where Isildur was slain.A lovely read again.
