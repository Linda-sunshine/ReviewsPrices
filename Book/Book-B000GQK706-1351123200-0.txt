review/summary: A must read for all English speakersreview/text: This was one of the first fantasy novels I have read. To date it remains the very best of the lot. It's easy to see why. Tolkien spent a good part of his life in coming up with this epic. The story is vast encompassing multiple characters of different races yet with their human emotions and misgivings. Tolkien fleshes out a wonderful world in Middle Earth, and gives proper attention to details as with time and places in the story. For a first timer to fantasy epics it might be little difficult to get through entire volume, but its been split into three separate volumes and can be better read likewise. I would recommend this book to all people who love good stories. For those who haven't had enough other volumes from Tolkien like the Hobbit should come handy. Die hard fantasy fans can immerse themselves in the additional footnotes provided by Tolkien describing the language of Middle Earth, history, family tree and clans of Middle Earth, highly recommended. Best to watch Peter Jackson's trilogy after reading this book.
