review/summary: Great bookreview/text: This book is great! It has lots of illustrations and pictures and lots of notes relating to the text. If you're not someone who likes all that, you can just read the main text without reading the notes. The notes are all on the sides of the main text. It is a high quality book. Feels sturdy and the quality of the books is great!
