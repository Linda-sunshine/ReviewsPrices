review/summary: You'll never look at your house cat the same way again!review/text: You have read enough boring house cat books, get ready for a twist on the life of a cat. Meet Rusty who is not your average pussy cat. When curiosity nearly killed the cat, Rusty meets a strange cat who introduces him into a world of Clans. Rusty's intrest lets this cat open new world of survival and skill and he learns what it means to take care of a clan. When a strange prophecy appears to Thunderclan's Medicine Cat, and Rusty gets a new name, Firepaw, there may be more in store for this young cat than he hoped for.~Destiny~P.S. be on the lookout for more of my reviews in the Erin Hunter series. K.I.T.
