review/summary: Lived by Dr. Karp's teachingsreview/text: I loved this book and lived by it when my son was a baby. The five &#34;S&#34; were key in having a happy baby. None of this is new of course and has been used for centuries, Dr. Karp just puts them together for ease of implementation. Will use all of these techniques for my daughter as well.
