review/summary: Intensely Dissatisfied -review/text: I wanted to read Great Expectations with my Granddaughter who is getting a masters in humanities. They are going back to the classics. I never received the Great Expectations.The computer said it was sent but never showed up on my Kindle. I have a Kindle and I have also ordered products from my computer. I somehow found myself with two (2) accounts with Amazon. I could order books for my Kindle with one account and anything else with the other account. I have tried to straighten this out twice. The result of the last time was to close my Kindle account and the loss of all my books on my Kindle. I still am unable to order from my Kindle and now am also unable to order Kindle books from my computer. Which makes my Kindle completely useless, just a piece of garbage.While I'm on the subject I recently ordered a book and received an E mail saying the bank refused to honor the credit card number. Some time ago I had notified Amazon of a new number that the bank had issued. They had gone back and used the old number. I straightened that out and then I received an E mail saying the Book was undeliverable and Amazon was issuing a refund (the address was right). I may never receive that refund because they keep going back and using the old credit card number.I will never order anything from Amazon again.
