review/summary: My Latest Purchase -The book, "Hatchet"review/text: "Hatchet", the book I purchased most recently through Amazon.com was arrived in time. The item was the recommended book assigned from school for my son as Summer Reading assignment. We were very busy with our summer vacation schedule and had no time to search the book in the book store. Then we found it in Amazon.com and received it intime without any hassle. My son was happy to complete his assignment in time and without affecting our vacation plans. So we are happy about the reliable service of Amazon.com
