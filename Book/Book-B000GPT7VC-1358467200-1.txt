review/summary: Amazing book!review/text: I thought that I had read Uncle Tom's cabin in school, but wanted to read it again. Once I got started I realized I probably never read it. It is an awesome book. It spans several generations and you really feel like you know the families involved in the story. I fell in love with this book
