review/summary: Classicreview/text: I find it surprising every time I've read this how much Huxley gets right in his predictions of the future. Some of the horrifying things in the book look possible now. When is maximizing the value we place on technological and social progress actually good for humanity, and when is it detrimental? Very valid questions about the psychological, sociological, and ethical impacts of technology are raised which are valid to this day. I'm not a Luddite, but I sometimes wonder if that position wouldn't be reasonable.
