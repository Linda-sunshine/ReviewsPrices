review/summary: The Hobbitreview/text: I could have paid $11.95 plus tax in Walmart, but I got the same book for so little money here on Amazon. The book was in excellent shape. Amazon used books make my reading life, so easy and AFFORDABLE. I do have actually two e-readers; The Nook and the Kindle....but I still love to hold a book in my hands. Thank you
