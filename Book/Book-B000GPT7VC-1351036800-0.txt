review/summary: Wish I had read this when I was youngerreview/text: I've heard from many people since I was a kid that this was a book worth reading. Turns out that was an understatement. I wonder, however, if I'd have gotten as much out of it when I was fifteen as I did now that I'm forty. I'd like to believe if I'd read it before I joined the Army and left my sleepy little hometown, I'd have gotten a clearer picture of why slavery was such a tragic part of our history. I'd always been told it was, but this book demonstrates why with so many vivid details. I don't know if I'd been mature enough as a kid to really grasp it all as well as I did now, though. The book is beautifully written, flourishing with descriptions often lovely and occasionally horrible in detail. The few slow parts are more than made up for by the overall greatness of the work. I sometimes found the text a little difficult to read in the places where a heavy Southern dialect is written. That, to me, is always more easily understood spoken than on paper. Excellent book. I will gently insist my young children tackle it when I judge they are ready.
