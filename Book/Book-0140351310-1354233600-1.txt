review/summary: My favorite love story ever!review/text: This is my favorite love story ever and it's the third time I've read it. As an American in 2012 the language is a bit challenging for my teenage daughters but I'm going read it aloud to them as a mother daughter thing over the winter holidays. Jane's character is such an inspiring role model for women today. She is faced with incredible temptation yet she choose to do what is right rather than what feels right and Providence rewards her for it.I have been reading this on my phone rather that a reader, but I've found the kindle edition to be just as easy to read as having the book and I always have it with me, even when I just have a few quiet minutes in the car waiting for kids.
