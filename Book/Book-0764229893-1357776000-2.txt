review/summary: Gods and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings #1review/text: Excellent book. Really depicks how life was during the King erra and Gods Idolarity. So hooked on this book I plan on reading the entire series. Thank you Lynn Austin, what an AWESOME book. Follows the worship of God, the power and sazrifices of kings.
