review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: This book was amazing it ran on a little bit at times. I thought it could have been a little bit shorter but even when it ran it was great. I know that you can't trust things on the internet but this is my honest opinion. IT WAS GREAT!!! This book is one of the biggest page turner' s I know in fact I read this in one day. This book is very descriptive in fight scenes and adds an element that helps how intense it Is and once again you can never put it down. You really see the book in your mind. And the words the author uses makes the book very emotional. With twists and turns James Paterson has really out done himself. I recommend this book to all Percy Jackson fans.
