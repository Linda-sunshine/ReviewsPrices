review/summary: What we, as Christians, believe (in a nutshell).review/text: Read it for the second or third time and it is always amazingly new. I plan to go to a seminar this summer at the Kilns (Jack's home near Oxford) so I wanted to get back up to speed. Also recommend George Sayers' bio of Lewis.
