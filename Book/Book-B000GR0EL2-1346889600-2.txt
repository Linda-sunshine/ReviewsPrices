review/summary: A great readreview/text: I enjoyed this story and it inspired my faith in the Lord. A wonderful testament to Gods work in such tragic circumstances and how the power of God is stronger than anything we face here on earth. From this story I realized that if we believe then anything is possible. I now need to read her other books. A Great Read and I highly recommend this book.
