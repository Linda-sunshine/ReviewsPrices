review/summary: An amazing beginning to an amazing series.review/text: For those who have never even heard of Harry Potter, I STRONGLY suggest that you take the time to read ALL SEVEN of the books. Each one gets better and better and they all interconnect so smoothly. Does it take time to power through all seven books? Of course... but it's completely worth it.The series provides the ultimate in good vs. evil stories because it is so deep and engaging. I finished the series in 2007 shortly after the last book was published and have since reread the entire series three times. Each time in preparation for the final three movies. Each time has been better than the last and I learn and pick up on so many new things that I never even began to think about before. In turn, this has enhanced the movie watching experience as well. Each book provides a different piece to the puzzle and no book should be skipped or skimmed. Each is equally important and that's the beauty of the series.I've read and enjoyed nearly 100 different books and series in my lifetime, and no book series has ever come close to the Harry Potter series. No book have I ever been extremely thrilled about rereading or experiencing than the Harry Potter series. Once you've began reading, you won't easily stop. My father who only reads things that pertain to his job, has begun reading the series and wishes that he was reading them when the movies were coming out because he's been enticed that much.So... basically, what I'm getting at is that you should definitely buy THE ENTIRE SERIES, you'll be glad you did!
