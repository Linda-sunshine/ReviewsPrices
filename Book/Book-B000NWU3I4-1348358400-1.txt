review/summary: Hobbit Fanreview/text: I read the Hobbit in elementary school, but it was not the full version. Being a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies made me want to read the full version f the Hobbit before I see the movie in December. The book was brilliant. I read it in a few days as it was hard to put down. Now I am really excited about the movie and the world of Bilbo Baggins!
