review/summary: beautiful editionreview/text: The Hobbit was the first real novel I read. I was fortunate enough to be given the golden 50th anniversary edition when I was a child. I love this book. With the upcoming movie release, I thought I'd read it again, but found my gold version's pages falling out and didn't want to damage it further.When I saw this little leatherette-bound edition, I was in love. It's so easy to hold and read. The cover feels nice and soft in your hands. And, honestly, it's just a beautiful little book.If I could improve it at all, I'd add a bookmark, but that's such a little thing to worry about.
