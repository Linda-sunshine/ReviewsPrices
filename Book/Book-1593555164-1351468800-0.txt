review/summary: Reacher is Superman... Kinda Unbelievably So...review/text: Reacher just gets more and more superhuman. Kinda getting old, but I'll continue to read some more. It always is fun to read about someone who is in control... even when he shouldn't be in control.Still hard to believe that he'll be played by Tom Cruise in the upcoming movie!
