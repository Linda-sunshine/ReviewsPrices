review/summary: read it BEFORE you watch the movie!!!review/text: The Hobbit is the prequel to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. While (unlike the trilogy) The Hobbit was written for children, it has enough depth to appeal to adults as well. My fifth grade teacher read one chapter to the class (the Troll scene where the trolls argue about whether to boil or roast or simply smash Bilbo & party)- I was hooked. I devoured the rest of the book (and the trilogy afterwards) and have been re-reading them all ever since (I stopped counting after my 45th time through!). I just got all four books for my Kindle- even the maps came through! The character of Bilbo Baggins, especially, develops throughout the story, and has incredible depth. Do you need an unlikely hero? You will find him here!
