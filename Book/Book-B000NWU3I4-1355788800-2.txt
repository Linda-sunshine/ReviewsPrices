review/summary: I love this bookreview/text: I would recommend this book for everyone to read. It is one of my favorite and I have read it many times but find myself understanding it more each time I read it. The idea of just walking out one day on such an adventure is something I would love to do if I had the money to do it. I love the detail he goes into describing the scenes, people, songs, and poems. This Friday I am going to see the movie hoping that I will like it as much the book but I do not think that will happen because even though I like the books better the other movies were good.
