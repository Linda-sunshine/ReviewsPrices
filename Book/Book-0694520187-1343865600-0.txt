review/summary: Is Ahab a Right-Wing Authoritarian?review/text: Can there be anything more absurd than writing a note in Amazon.com about Moby Dick? Fortunately, I write in ignorance of the Moby Dick scholarship.But anyone can see that Ishmael shares with Philip Marlowe an erudition completely inappropriate to the character's role and whole station in life. (His wonderful use of language!) There must be a back-story to each misfit, and I gather that Ishmael's (Melville's) back-story has been identified.One of Melville's motives seems to be political, to project himself as pro-people and anti-dictator. Ahab is a dictator who knows full well that he is misleading the people (both sailors and the Pequod's owners). He is driven by fear and resentment, and uses his political abilities to gather and motivate a mob that will lash out at his enemies.Does this make Ahab one of Bob Altemeyer's RWA leaders?Specifically, does Ahab stand for the Scotch-Irish warlord, the Jackson-Houston-Polk type that figured so large in Melville's time? If so, then since W reincarnated Polk perhaps the vastness of nature idolized by today's environmentalists corresponds to Melville's white whale.The book is full of innocent blood, by the way.
