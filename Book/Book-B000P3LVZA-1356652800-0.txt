review/summary: Sacrificing Science in Societyreview/text: I chose to read Brave New World because I had heard that it was very similar to Nineteen Eighty Four by George Orwell, which is my all-time favorite book because of its dystopian nature. Now, Brave New World is also on the list of my favorite books, for the very same reason. This book makes you question marketing methods and moral issues. I thoroughly enjoyed how Aldous Huxley brought historical figures to life with the allusion of names to scientists and theories that he used in the book repeatedly. The symbolism of zippers throughout the book communicates how their society is formed by convenience. The novel is extremely ironic, which is shown through many conversations that characters have and ideas that are portrayed as well such as sacrifice, art, and age. This book was written in 1932, which is fascinating because of how closely it reflects today's society of consumerism and technology. Brave New World has given me a new outlook on individuality. It is a difficult book to get in to at first, I had to read the first nine chapters twice, but it helped me understand how their society was formed and brought up. This is a deep book with elevated diction, eliminating the opportunity for everyone to read it but the ideas presented are invaluable.
