review/summary: A book everyone should read, at least oncereview/text: I read this book shortly after it was written and many times since. Because I believe the ideas it contains are so critical to the human condition, I have given a copy to all my children and to each grandchild when they became young adults. Since I was a teenager when the dreadful truth about the camps was revealed, the horror of the paths some people can take to abuse others was mind boggling. Frankl's message of hope was essential. After 80 years of life, it seems his words are, unfortunately, as necessary as ever.
