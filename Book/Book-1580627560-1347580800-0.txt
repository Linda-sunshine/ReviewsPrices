review/summary: A Good Bookreview/text: I really enjoyed this book. It was funny, but truthful. There are definetely some great points to take from this book. I would recommend it for the single girl, I wouldn't recommend it so much if you are already seeing someone, well unless you are going to apply the bits in pieces. The main point is Don't Be A Doormat! Be your self, be true to yourself, your hobbies to YOU first. Never give too much or overcompensate a man you are dating. It's most likely that you will forever do that until either he moves on or you make up your mind that you don't like being taken advantage of!
