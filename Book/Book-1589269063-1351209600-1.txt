review/summary: Incredibly helpful and instructive!review/text: I resisted buying this book from a long time, even though it came highly recommended by many people I knew on an online forum about dating and relationships. The title just sounded very gimmicky to me and I was curious what it could really tell me that I didn't already know. The answer was, a lot. The basic premise of the book is that there are multiple ways you can show someone you love and care and that different people find different approaches more satisfying and meaningful. It's one of those things that sounds common sense once you read the book but admittedly I hadn't picked up on before. This book helped me figure out what my love language was and it explained a lot for me. For instance, there were past relationships in which I felt my partner was doing a lot of things that showed they loved me but part of me still felt unsatisfied, this book helped me realize it was because while these gestures were nice, they weren't in my love language. Going forward I feel like I am much better at being able to articulate how I need to be loved and to also feel out how future partners may prefer to be loved. Much of the language in the book is rooted in marriage, but as a single person I think the advice is universal enough that even single people can take something out of it. Yes, there are TONS of self help relationship books out there, but this one, in my opinion, is actually sound and helpful
