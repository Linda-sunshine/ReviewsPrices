review/summary: Bestreview/text: Personally, I think this is Jane Austen's best work. It's certainly her most mature. Anne Elliott is born into a prideful aristocratic family. At a young age, she nearly marries the love of her life, only to break it off after being persuaded by a mother-like figure (on grounds of his not being able to support her properly). He tries to drown his sorrow in his career in the Navy while she stays quietly at home and suffers the Cinderella-like treatment she receives at home.Circumstances throw them back together again 7-1/2 (I believe) years later; Captain Wentworth did well in the war and is now the object of all the young ladies. Watching them re-unite and deal with the hurt of the past is well worth the read. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
