review/summary: Excellent Early 20th Century Science Fictionreview/text: Once you accept the mumbo-jumbo elements of how Civil War veteran John Carter is transported to Mars, you can settle back and appreciate the remarkable fantasy world that Edgar Rice Burroughs describes. In a driving narrative that never lags, Burroughs succeeds in creating a multi-layered society rife with racial animosity and social unrest. Carter becomes the igniting spark, the focal point for societal change at all levels. This book is actually the first of a trilogy. Books two and three are &#34;The Gods of Mars&#34; and &#34;Warlord of Mars&#34; respectively. They are all excellent - so good you'll have trouble believing that they were written nearly a hundred years ago.
