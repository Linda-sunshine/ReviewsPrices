review/summary: A nice re-introductionreview/text: I read this book in the 7th grade and while i couldn't remember that much of the plot, I knew that I enjoyed it a the time. I wanted to get reacquainted with it before the movie comes out and I'm so glad that I did. When I was younger, I was so enamored by the lavish, 20's lifestyle that these characters lived- almost as if I was an outsider invited to tag along with them, just like our narrator, Nick. Reading it now, I have a much more skeptical but mature reaction. I felt sad for how lonely and stuck all of these characters were in their life choices. The only person who was able to realize this early on, and know when to say when, was Nick.While ultimately a sad story, I really did enjoy it and happy that I reintroduced myself to Fitzgerald.
