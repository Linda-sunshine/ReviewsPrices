review/summary: Amazing and very important bookreview/text: It is a classic and yet it is not so known anymore. It is the kind of book you definitely want on your shelf so you can read again some day. Viktor Frankl's analysis of his terrible experience makes you change see life and its meaning in a totally different way. I strongly recommend to everyone!
