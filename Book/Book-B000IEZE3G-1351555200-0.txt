review/summary: Very entertainingreview/text: This is my first time reading one of the Harry Potter books, and of course I have seen all of the movies, except part 2 of Deathly Hallows so I decided to a reading of all the books before I watch the last movie. Only reason I can give of not giving this book five stars is probably because I saw the movie first (usually read the book first) and there were some differences to get used to. The Dursley family seem several orders of magnitude more harsh toward Harry then the movie implied, and it seemed Dumbledore was less present in book 1 then the movie. I do believe my opinion might be a bit skewed, since I have memory of multiple movies with only one book reading. Hagrid's character seems a little bit different then the movie protrays. I'm sure as I progress through the books I will become more used to the book format rather then the movies, as well as the writing style which I found easy to follow, humorous and nicely done.
