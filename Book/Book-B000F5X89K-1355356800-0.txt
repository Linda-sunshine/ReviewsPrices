review/summary: perfect example of early 19th century writingreview/text: If you love early 19th cetnury literature you will love this novel. Yes it deals with the creation of life but at its heart it is a story about love, lonliness and the struggles created by man's unchecked ego.For those reading this based on their love of the 1930's movie, know that they are not the same story. Hollywood took great liberties with the story in order to create their great movie. For modern readers this classic in no way resembles a Horror story; if you are reading it to be scared you will be dissapointed but on the other hand if you are reading this to expand your mind and experience true genius then you will be greatly rewarded.Concerning this e-book edition: it is just the novel and as far as i could tell it read true and it was also problem free.
