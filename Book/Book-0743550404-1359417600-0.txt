review/summary: Who says all stories have an ending?review/text: The Colorado kid is a story within a story that refuses to answer all of your questions. You know the Who: the victim, You know the When: timeline of the victim's death, but you will not find the How or the Why. The makings of a good story are a beginning, middle, and end with all of the loose ends tied up with a nice red bow. In this novel you are told from the beginning that the red bow does not exist, and that because of it the ending does not either. This was a very intriguing read I highly recommend it if you are in the mood for a mystery that keeps on giving.
