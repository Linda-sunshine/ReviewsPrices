review/summary: Before LOTRreview/text: Written before "The Lord of The Rings", Tolkien introduces us to the world of Middle Earth through the unexpected, and unsolicited, adventure of the main character Bilbo Baggins the Hobbit to help the dwarves retrieve their long lost treasures of their long gone ancestors. As they pursue their quest, we come across many other inhabitants of Middle Earth. Some of them are friendly and others are inherently evil and blood thirsty. Hobbits, dwarves, man, elves, trolls, wolves, eagles and the infamous Gollum are properly described to advance the plot but not extensively enough for you to loose interest. I couldn't derive a definitive moral message from the novel but it was immensely entertaining nonetheless. Two points worth mentioning about "The Hobbit". First, the language Tolkien used is so elegant and eloquent. I couldn't help but compare it to other temporary writings which seemed a bit vulgar! Secondly, there are many songs (lyrics) throughout the book and some riddles too. Personally, I found them entertaining and conveyed the spirit of the situation whether it was warring or a peaceful one. This book surely has popped up "The Lord of The Rings" on my books-to-read list. Now, I can't wait to watch the movie and make a comparison. Tolkien has set the bar a little high but I guess Peter Jackson is up to the task since he did such a great job with The Lord of The Rings. Highly recommended if you're into fantasy. Enjoy!@shakirbahzad
