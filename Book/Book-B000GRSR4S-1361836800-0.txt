review/summary: Keep your expectations lowreview/text: When people have raved about a film that was produced by someone who you think you would enjoy, but it just falls flat; it is partly due to the execution and partly due to the expectations. This novel left me feeling the exact same way. The whole time I kept thinking if I just get through this next chapter I am sure I will begin to see the magic. Never happened. The few pages he actually spent on the war were excellent. The dull sci-fi story that takes up the vast majority of the book were not. I am glad that I have read it, just so I can warn others simply to not get their hopes up. Then perhaps they can get more out of it than I did.
