review/summary: Fantastic!review/text: You know how you decide to read a classic becuase you assume that any book that has survived for this long to be great? Then the entire time you read the book you hate it, but you are sure there is some reason it's a classic. Finally, at the end of the book, you realize that you just wasted your time reading an awful book. Well, this book isn't like that. It's actually really great. There are twists in the plot, a surprising end, good characters, and a loveable heroine. If you like romance, then this is the book for you.
