review/summary: Always a 5 star with mereview/text: I love the story & it is part of our yearly Christmas tradition. Every year we start our celebration with watching one of our dvds about Scrooge. I have collected about 6 renditions of the story now so our only debate is which one should we start with each year. We play it during our Christmas tree decorating, but we end up missing a lot of it in the process. I got this book and also the audio so next year we can start with the book and then listen to it as we are decorating. Can't wait!
