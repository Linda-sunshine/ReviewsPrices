review/summary: Not a fan, but an admirerreview/text: Well, I will be honest and say from the beginning that I did not enjoy 'Pride and Prejudice'. I did not find the plot particularly interesting, nor the characters particularly engaging. Then why give it four stars?Because, dear readers, it is perfectly possible to not enjoy something and still hold a great deal of respect for it, and there are very few reviews that acknowledge this fact. Personally, I have never been particularly interested in domestic drama of the 19th century, but this is an important work, and should be read on that merit at least. Many readers seem to forget that at the time of writing, women did only have the choice to marry, and for an upper-class young lady, marrying a rich man was her only option. After all, she could not work, because there was a universal horror of being "in trade" (witness Mr. Darcy's extreme rudeness to Elizabeth having relatives who actually worked). Mrs. Bennett, shallow and stupid though she was, did have a legitimate reason to be worried, since the extremely sexist inheritance laws meant that she and her daughters were to be turned out of their home and onto the charity of relatives the moment her husband died. Small wonder that marrying each of them off was her only concern.Even if one can not enjoy the book, modern women can still look back with a thrill of horror over this idea of being birds in gilded cages - being essentially the property of their fathers and husbands, with nothing to do but stack up "accomplishments" (see Mary Bennett). Jane Austen recognized the whole thing as the barely disguised slave market it was and wrote biting criticisms, smuggled into stories about romance and marriage. And that is why, though I do not enjoy her subject matter or her writing style in particular, I hold the greatest regard for her as a writer and would recommend the book on technical merit and historical interest in the very least.
