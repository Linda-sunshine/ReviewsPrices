review/summary: Painfully incredible & powerfulreview/text: I loaded on my iPad because it was free. After I started it, I couldn't put it down. Stowe takes every argument for slavery and creates an amazing character that dismantles the hollow myths. I have read books before and got tears in my eyes for a moment, but this book had me sobbing.Read an interesting point made on Wikipedia concerning the hero at Gettysburg, Joshua Chamberlain. One of Chamberlain's mentors was Harriet's Beacher Stowe's husband. The Wikipedia article said Chamberlain joined the Union army because of "Uncle Tom's Cabin". This book may not have started the Civil War, but this book sure helped set fire to all that brought slavery to an end.
