review/summary: Receivingreview/text: I've probably read this book tons of times since I was a child, but I couldn't recite it for you. Every time I read it, it's like I have never read it before. The Giver always feels new and fresh to me. I continue to read it with surprise and heartbreak; and even now I find myself tearing up or down right crying at different parts in the novel. Sometimes I feel that Lois Lowry wrote this masterpiece with me in mind, like it was written just for me.The novel is relatively short and simple to read, but is full of powerful themes and deep meaning. Lowry shows the power of our senses, the importance of memories (good and bad), and the significance of being different. The world in The Giver is supposedly a perfect society, but that doesn't make it a Utopia. I recommend this to anyone and everyone, especially young adults and older children. I believe this book shaped me in some way to be the woman I am today.
