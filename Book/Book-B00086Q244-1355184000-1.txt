review/summary: Classic everyone should readreview/text: My son, who has made his living by competing in extreme sports, and is in process of starting a foundation to promote his favorite sport, skimboarding, among the children of third world countries, highly recommends this book. He travels a lot and finds that successful people invariably have studied and put into practice the principles of this book. I highly recommend it for any and everyone.
