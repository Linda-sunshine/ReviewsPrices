review/summary: Nice Illustrations - Poor Animotionreview/text: This book could have been a real keeper for a toddler and one to bring back happy memories for years to come - the pages are thick cardboard, the illustrations themselves book are bright and nicely done, BUT the &#34;animotion&#34; panels are so dim they're hard to see, and they certrainly wouldn't grab and hold a toddler's attention. I would have returned it, but the return shipping fee didn't make it worth it, so it goes in the donation pile for the next library sale. Too bad.
