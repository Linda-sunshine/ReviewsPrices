review/summary: Good read about challenging topicreview/text: Not easy to read some of these truths, but important and eye opening. Good points to remember for anyone who gives up their power in relationships and ends up losing both the relationship and themselves. Some of the advice seems a bit outdated, and yet I wonder if there is not some wisdom to be had in all of it. Especially love the idea of Bitch not being a negative term, but rather a term embracing our fierce self inside that will not die.
