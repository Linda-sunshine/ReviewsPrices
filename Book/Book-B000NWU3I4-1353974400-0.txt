review/summary: Marvelous literaturereview/text: In honor of the upcoming movie The Hobbit The Unexpected Journey (part 1) coming out in theaters on December 14th, I have requested to review the newest edition of The Hobbit from .I have started reading the book with the kids after we have done all essential school work and they love it. We sit down in the living room and proceed to get projected into the world of Bilbo and his friends. The kids always want to know what will happen next when I completed on chapter. Unfortunately for them, my throat is dry by that time and I think that keeping the suspense is perfect because they look forward about our time together to discover the adventures the characters are living.This book is definitively a classic. I remember reading it in French when I was younger. I enjoyed it and was looking forward to read it again. However, this time I am reading it in English and with my kids. Deep down I hope and pray that this book will become a classic that they will re-read again in the future. Knowing that the movie is coming up, my oldest son keeps telling me that he wants to see the movie. I think we will start with the Lord of the Rings which we have already at home. The Hobbit is the prequel of the series The Lord of the Rings.I highly recommend this book to everyone. If you have never read it, you have to discover this story. It is simply fabulous (though sometimes the names or English is written bizarrely) and it will keep you entertained from cover to cover. This book would be a fabulous birthday or Christmas gift for a young person in your life. Encourage someone to read and get this book.
