review/summary: One of my all-time favoritesreview/text: I first read the trilogy back in 1977 and I loved it then. I wasn't surewhat to think about the Peter Jackson movies because I couldn'timagine anyone actually doing them with real actors. I thought hedid a great job, but I was happy I'd read the books before I saw themovies. If you've seen the movies and haven't read the books, youdefinitely need to. One of the best fantasy novels EVER!
