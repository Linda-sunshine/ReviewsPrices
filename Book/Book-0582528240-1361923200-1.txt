review/summary: Great classicreview/text: Reading the classics seems to be going out of style. I know that when I was in high school, I hated having to read classics, and I LOVE to read! However, reading this aloud to my daughter was so much fun for both of us. Huck is such a scamp and gets into so many scrapes, but comes out on top every time. A true work that reflects the time in which it was written.
