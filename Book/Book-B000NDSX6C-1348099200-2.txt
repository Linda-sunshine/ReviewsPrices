review/summary: Still Awesomereview/text: I haven't read this book in years, but I'm sure glad I decided too do so. The character development is great, the story flows, and it really is the perfect setup to the Trilogy.If you've never read this, or you haven't read it in a while, I suggest you sit right down and get on it.
