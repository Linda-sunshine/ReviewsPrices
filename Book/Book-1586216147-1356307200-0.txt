review/summary: Amazing!!review/text: I absolutely love this book. This is an amazing book that explains about true love and total compassion. There is also sadness, but when complimented with the passion, it is wonderfully beautiful. The book is different than the movie, of course, but it is in a very, very great way. I would recommend this book to anybody looking for some real love. Nicholas Sparks is just pure genius.
