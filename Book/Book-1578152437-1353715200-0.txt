review/summary: Oliver Beats the Dickens Out of Most Contemporary Novelsreview/text: Oliver Twist is a deliciously slow and philosophical read with a cliffhanger at the end of each chapter (because it was written for sequential magazine publications). The chapter headings are great. The plot is various and the characters are wonderful. I wanted to read it during the recent election as a reflection upon the conditions of workhouses, with great hopes that our country won't go there.
