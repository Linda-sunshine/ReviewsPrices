review/summary: My Favorite Christmas Storyreview/text: For over 60 years I'd heard the story, I'd seen the play, I'd watched the movies - all of them (I like the George C. Scott one the best), but I had never read the book. I was not the least disappointed with the book. It had just enough back-story that didn't come across on stage or screen to make it new and still the same wonderful story.
