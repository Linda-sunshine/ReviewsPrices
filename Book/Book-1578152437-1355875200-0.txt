review/summary: Lost Interest due to lengthy time gap between episodesreview/text: I enjoyed the first download but the time gap between downloads was so great that I was off reading other things. Even after two weeks I have not gotten back to finishing the book. I'm really unsure that the rest of the book will be there for me to read. It seems that your playing a game with me that I don't really want to play.
