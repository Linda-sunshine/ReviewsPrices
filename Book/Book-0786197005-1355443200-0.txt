review/summary: Adventure, Romance, & Classic Edgar Rice Burroughs!review/text: I was introduced to Edgar Rice Burroughs when a teenaged girl. What fun to meet again after so many years! The brave & handsome hero. The exotically beautiful unpredictable heroine. The fantastic, never before imagined creatures of Mars. Swashbuckling adventures with a bit of future science to add delicious flavor to the dish. Grand reading!
