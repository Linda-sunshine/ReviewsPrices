review/summary: Man's Search for Meaningreview/text: First half of the book was good. The historical aspects of it were fascinating. The book is worth the price just for that. I know a lot of people get into the second half of the book, but I did not. It was too philosophical and long winded for me. The concepts that were being presented could have been done in a few pages. In fact, I really like the overview of the book at the book's beginning.
