review/summary: 1984review/text: George Orwell wrote this classic in 1948. He set it 36 years into the future. He was a visionary with facts in hand. The dark world he portrayed came to pass much sooner than he had predicted. Big Brother became a catch-word for all of the invasive technology that now monitors our lives. Orwell died before his fictional world became reality. He was lucky. The book is a classic. Every human being should read it and realize its' implications.
