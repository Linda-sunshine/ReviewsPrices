review/summary: As good as everreview/text: I loveThe Hobbit--ever since my mom read it to me as a girl. I wanted to read it again before seeing the movie and decided to buy a digital copy for my Kindle since my paper copy is falling apart. I'm thoroughly enjoying this latest addition along with the clickable footnotes.
