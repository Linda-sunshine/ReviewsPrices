review/summary: Still a classicreview/text: Brave New World is still as relevant today as at the time it was written. A real treat for the imagination, and a good workout for the brain. Huxley causes one to question our deepest psychological constructs and our perceptions of reality. A challenging, intriguing, and mind-boggling ride of exploration on the human experience.
