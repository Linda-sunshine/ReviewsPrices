review/summary: Great entree to Tolkien's worldreview/text: Not nearly as dark and brooding, nor as long, as the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the Hobbit is ideal as an entree to the vaster realm of Lord of the Rings. I read this to my eight year old daughter, and she loved it. Now we've moved on to the trilogy. I can't imagine starting there. It starts too slow, is too pensive and descriptive at times - these are features that a fan will forgive, but for an initiate, these can be motivation killers. I got my daughter hooked through the Hobbit, and her interest has endured. We're into Two Towers now. The Hobbit moves at a quick pace, and is light-hearted enough to entertain younger readers. It is utterly lacking in a romantic angle, but this is more than made up for by the themes of friendship and homely virtue. A wonderful book.
