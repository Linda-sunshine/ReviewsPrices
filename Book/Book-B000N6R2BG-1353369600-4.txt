review/summary: Keeping Faith by Jodi Picoultreview/text: I love, love, love Jodi Picoult so I was really looking forward to reading this book. All of her books that I've read have a twist, so I kept waiting for the twist and trying to figure it out. As it turns out, this one doesn't have a twist. I felt the ending was anti-climatic and disappointing. I enjoyed most of the book though.
