review/summary: A wonderful Christmas tale!review/text: I have never read this book until now, and I'm glad that I waited until I was old enough to really understand it. I've been working on reading through the classics, and it couldn't have been a better time to read A Christmas Carol. This book is filled with such wonderful imagery and a very valuable lesson: we can't live only for ourselves. Charles Dickens painted a wonderful tale that I plan on reading over and over again as the years come.
