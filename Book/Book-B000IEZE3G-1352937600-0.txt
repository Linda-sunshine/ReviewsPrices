review/summary: 'Worth it' doesn't even begin to describe this book!review/text: I read this book whenever I was seven years old. Now, at 19 years of age, I just wanted to thank you J.K. Rowling for inspiring me to find an interest in books. It is so important nowadays that children find this interest early on to promote learning and imagination later in life. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone will always be the first actual book that began my interest in reading. Several years ago, I finished the entire series and it is by far the best series of books I have ever read.Now to all who have yet to read her series, I highly encourage you to put all seven books on your bucket list. Parents, please expose your children to this series! It stimulates their imagination, their interest in books, and improves their reading level significantly at a young age.Anyway, thanks again for everything J.K. Rowling!
