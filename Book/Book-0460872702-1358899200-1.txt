review/summary: Print too small - 6 pointreview/text: The print in this version of The Great Gatsby is too small to read comfortably - even for a 16 year old. It is only 6 point based on measuring only about 2mm tall. Buy another version. By the way, Amazon's return system is great. They are coming to pick it up from my house tomorrow, free of charge and I am getting the other version just two days after delivery of the small point version. Good service! I just could not take reading the small print this time.
