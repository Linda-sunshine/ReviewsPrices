review/summary: Nicely Printed Classicreview/text: This copy is pretty much what the First Edition looked like in 1936 and it's easy to see how it got to be so big. Not until The Godfather was published had there been so much interest in a book and its inevitable film version. Impresses to this day and you can see the masterwork the film's screenwriters performed in getting this sprawling story onto the screen. I think every American should read this through at least once.God help the pukes making movies in this era who think they need to "reboot" this story... Also, don't bother with the "authorized" sequels; the story stands on its own.
