review/summary: Kindle Versionreview/text: Getting a series as a single volume on a Kindle makes it so much easier to read. Any spelling or alignment errors that others have noted seem to have been fixed by the time I read this (2013). The single version is much cheaper than buying each book separately. Other than that there's not much to say: It's Tolkien-He's a legend for a reason. For those who have seen the movies and now wish to read the books, try to forget everything you know. The movies are an incredible take on these great books, but each is different in its own right. Much of the order of the journey is switched around. Take the time to read the extravagant details that build this amazing fantasy world.
