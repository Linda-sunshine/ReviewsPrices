review/summary: A classic for a reasonreview/text: I never had the privilege of reading this book prior to this year, and i wish i would have read it years ago. The wit and exquisite use of words by Melville makes this an easy book to bury your nose in for hours. You will be completely immersed in the 19th century whale fishery in all aspects and follow detailed human struggle of revenge. This was such a good read that it has now put me on a classic kick searching for more novels that capture the imagination like this book.
