review/summary: One of Dickens' finestreview/text: Great Expectations is widely regarded as one of Charles Dickens' finest works and I have to agree; it is one of my favorites, second to A Tale of Two Cities. The story of a young boy's growth to manhood, and his rise to unexpected prosperity and subsequent fall, is strongly written and captivating. Great Expectations captures the attention from the first page and, unlike some of Dickens' other works, it never has a dull moment. Like all of Dickens' works, it is peopled with a large cast of unique and quirky characters whose relationships to each other, as the story unfolds, end up being as intertwined as a plate of spaghetti. Some of the scenes and characters in Great Expectations are downright bizarre; the scenes involving Miss Havisham and the Pocket family felt distinctly Alice in Wonderland-ish in their weirdness.What makes Great Expectations so strong is the main character, Pip. He is that rarity among Dickens' characters, one that has depth and more than one dimension and mood. He tells his own story and, as an adult reflecting back on his own childhood and adolescence, he reveals his own youthful selfishness with a poignancy that surely every listener can connect with. Haven't we all been Pip, selfish and unappreciative of the goodness of others and unworthy of their admiration?I did not listen to this particular audio edition, although I know that Brilliance Audio produces top-notch audio books and Michael Page is an excellent narrator. I highly recommend the edition I listened to, produced by BBC Audio. It is a no-frills production, but the narrator (Martin Jarvis) is outstanding. He truly has a gift for voices (I especially loved his rendition of The Aged), and adds color and personality to the story.
