review/summary: The best novel of 20 th century Americareview/text: Over the last forty plus years from high school I have read this novel at least a dozen times and taught itperhaps a hundred times. Two copies had fallen apart, thus the purcase of one last for my remaining years.It is a mystery- how Gatsby who &#34;represented everything for which&#34; Nick had an &#34;unaffected scorn&#34; &#34;turned outall right in the end.&#34; It is marvelously tight- well under 200 pages. It is the chronicle of the Jazz Age. It is lyrical in its prose.
