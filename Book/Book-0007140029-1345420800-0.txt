review/summary: Not an original ideareview/text: I must admit that I have not read this book. However, Gabriel King published "The Wild Road" in 1999. I did read that book and it's sequel "The Golden Cat". This is not an original idea. I gave it 3 stars because a book about cats can't be bad at all.
