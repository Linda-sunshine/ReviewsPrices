review/summary: Great Fantasyreview/text: The Hobbit is truly a remarkable masterpiece. Once you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down. Tolkien does a fantastic job capturing the reader's attention and drawing him or her into the story. I have read the Hobbit several times and it always enjoyable. A great read for children and adults alike.
