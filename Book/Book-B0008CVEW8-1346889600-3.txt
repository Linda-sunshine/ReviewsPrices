review/summary: Dinner at Long John Silver's will never be the same...review/text: Quick and entertaining read of a classic pirate story. I finally read this well into my adulthood, and am surprised to hear how many read it as a child given the complex use of pirate lingo. It's an adventure children will enjoy, but there are also many nuances that will likely only be appreciated by more mature readers. Overall, really enjoyed it, and had no issues with the Kindle version.
