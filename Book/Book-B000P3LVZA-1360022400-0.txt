review/summary: A beautiful foray into a dystopian existencereview/text: This book truly took me by storm and engaged me in a hypothetical dystopic future human society. I was so easily able to relate to the characters and the dilemmas presented within that, truly, I felt as if this society actually existed. This book has opened my mind and called into question my views of today's society as I know and accept it. I would recommend this book to anyone who who feels isolated in society, distraught about the direction our hedonistic society is taking, or is simply looking for a better understanding of the concept of the word dystopia and, indeed, the fine line that exists between a dystopia and a utopia. 5/5.
