review/summary: One Shot - soon to be movie starring Tom Cruise - keeps you guessing and wastes your productivity - Buy it!review/text: I'd heard about Lee Child, Jack Reacher and the dozen or so books with the same character. I thought the scenario to be unimaginative at first, and then I saw them being featured on the NYT Bestseller list year after year. When I finally decided to give him a shot, I downloaded the sample for The Killing Floor on my kindle. I got to the end and wasn't gripped. I decided I was right all along.Then I heard rumors about a movie based on the series being made with action big shot Tom Cruise. My ears (eyes?) perked up when I read an article that the book that the movie was based on was "One Shot (Book 8)" not "The Killing Floor (Book 1)".Perhaps the first book was a fluke, I thought. "one Shot" must be good!So I gave it a shot (no pun intended), and I loved it. Bought a old used paperback and read it cover to cover in less than two weeks. I started out reading it for 15 minutes on the subway to and from work, and would up lunching alone so I could finish a chapter and then another and another. I finished the second half of the book in a day-and-a-half, thanks to a super long lunch and turned down offers to hang out with my friends. The book was that good.Buy it today. Get it right now.
