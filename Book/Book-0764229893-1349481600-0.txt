review/summary: Opened Doors for further studyreview/text: I loved how this book took known stories in the Old Testament, staying close to scripture while making them real where you could almost feel the character of the people in the story. It made me enjoy reading Old Testament stories where it all falls into place where before it seemed rather redundant writing. This author has incredible talent in making historical stories be easy reading to make them memorable.
