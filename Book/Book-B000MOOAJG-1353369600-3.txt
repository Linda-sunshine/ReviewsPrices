review/summary: A Great book...review/text: ATLAS SHRUGGED is an incredible book, and it seems that it accurately predicted the future. At times, it is a bit hard to follow, and it is a HUGE book - but reading the book, and seeing the two movies (so far) have made understanding much more complete. Read it and learn!
