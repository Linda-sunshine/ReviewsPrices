review/summary: A favouritereview/text: The characters and emotions in this book are some of Jane Austen's finest works, and I adore this book. I also adore Anne. All the better that I can now picture Rupert as Captain Wentworth whilst I read (I picture my own Anne, however). Oh, when she first sees him look at her like he used to! And, oh, his letter! Just remembering makes me hanker for another re-read! Just so lovely and emotional.If you love romance, this is one of the very best (although I now know to skip the visit to Mrs Smith, at the end, as I don't think it adds anything to the plot).
