review/summary: Abysmal philosophyreview/text: If rating the book on its physical condition alone, I'd give it 5 stars. No problems there.However, the words inside were dreary and unreal. Between the other one star reviews, and the "Look Inside," fair warning was given.I read it because Paul Ryan recommends it to his staff members, and praises it highly. Look on Youtube to see how highly. His more recent statements back off from the praise. (It could be because Ayn Rand mocks religion.) Now, Thomas Aquinas is his guiding star.Self-absorbed "heroes" find reason to become even more self-absorbed, fighting a world full of whining manipulating "looters," the most dangerous of which are other businessmen and the "heroes'" family members. Almost anytime another nation is mentioned, it is referred to as "The People's State of _____." Eventually, all the strong, brainy, "truly moral" producers "go on strike," by hiding from everyone else, and destroying their own work.At the end, one of their members is busy rewriting the Constitution.Frightening.
