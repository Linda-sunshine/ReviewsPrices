review/summary: Superb, but definitely a product of its timereview/text: Judging by the reviews here, criticizing this book is like criticizing Shakespeare -- anything less than full throated praise is dismissed. Let me be clear: I loved this book and it was well worth the time it took to read. It is deservedly considered a timeless classic.Nevertheless, it definitely has a pace that is not seen in modern books. If this had been created by a contemporary writer it would probably be about 25% shorter. I'm not saying that would make it better, it would simply make it a book created for modern sensibilities.If you like fast-paced modern writing, you will definitely need to recalibrate your expectations. Once you accept this book on its own terms, it is a very rewarding read.
