review/summary: Great Way to Enjoy a Classicreview/text: So, the best thing about this edition (Kindle) is that they include hyperlinks to all the references. So, if you encounter a person or word that they reference in the material at the end, you just scroll down to it, click on it, and away you go. I've had these books in various editions for years now, but this is by far the easiest to manage. I just wish that it had included the Hobbit.
