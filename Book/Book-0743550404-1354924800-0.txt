review/summary: Nothing like Havenreview/text: I love the Haven series. I bought this hoping it would give me more of a backstory and details of the town and the characters but I was so wrong. I normally like King's work, but this failed me in every way. The show's disclaimer should state, instead of "Based on The Colorado Kid," "This novel contains two of the characters and a reference to the title character, but otherwise has nothing to do with the TV series."Now I understand why, in spite of a successful TV show, the book was not reprinted. The owner did not want to field complaints from hundreds of thousands of disappointed buyers.If you have never seen "Haven," and are a Stephen King completist, then this is a worthy addition. But do not in any way assume that the two complement each other. If I could resell an E-book I would sell this one. Or donate it to the Goodwill.
