review/summary: No longer a doormatreview/text: I purchased this book in paperback about 5 years ago. I hesitated to buy it because of the title until I understood what it was about. I believe the words in this book changed my life completely for the better as I no longer let people run over me since then.I loaned it to a neighbor and she never returned the book, so I now have my Kindle and felt like I needed a refresh reading of the book.I highly recommend this book to any one who has lived their lives like a door mat in the past. It does work and you are not a &#34;bitch&#34; just looking out for yourself.
