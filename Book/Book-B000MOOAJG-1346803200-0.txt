review/summary: The question isn't...review/text: It has be over 20 years since I have even picked up a novel, now I can not put it down. If you have never read Atlas Shrugged or if it is a distant memory from high school, pick it up and read it again. I highly recommend it!Or have a preview via this documentary film that examines the resurging interest in Atlas Shrugged:Ayn Rand and the Prophecy of Atlas Shrugged
