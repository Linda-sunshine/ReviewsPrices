review/summary: great...review/text: My wife and I have been together for 7 years and know each other very well. We both have claimed to have put in much effort to make the other feel loved yet ironically, both of us have felt under-loved and underappreciated by the other. After reading this book, we have found that we are speaking our own love language to each other but it is not the love language of the other! Our love tanks are not full. After discovering what the others primary and secondary love language is using the assessment test, we have practiced giving heavy daily doses of the primary and sprinkkling in the secondary and little doses of the others. What a difference! It has been a big challenge for us as both our primary language is the other's very least needed! Wow. Talk about having to be intentional. But I can tell you it has been well worth it. The more I hold up to the challenge, the more he feels loved and wants to give me what I need. And vice versa. No wonder this is such a successful book. Apart from making God the center of of your marriage, this is one of the greatest foundations in a marriage - keeping your love tank full by speaking your mate's love language daily!
