review/summary: Frankenstein Reviewreview/text: The Frankenstein I knew of from when I was a child was about a mad scientist who created a monster who wreaked havoc on the townspeople. With their pitchforks they hunted down the monster and his creator and seek to destroy them. I never read this version of the book let alone knew if there was any other version to this novel, sadly to say. When I was recommended to read this book I thought I would know exactly how it will be but I was surprised to see it the way it was. Frankenstein thinking before I read the novel how boring it will be was actually very interesting and kept me intune. I didn't want to put it down and I wanted it never to end. Victor Frankenstein was my favorite character in the beginning of the novel. He is very intelligent and has a love for science that I can not imagine. When he created the monster I thought he wouldn't be afraid of his own creation but actually be proud of what he created. Maybe even show it to the world, but he disowned his creation and for that he went to my least favorite. As the story went on I started to see how the creation by Frankenstein was never born a monster but made into a monster by the events that he had gone through. I feel for the monster, being brought into this world when he didn't want to, having to endure the troubles of the new world by himself. He was misunderstood, like a newborn child without parents having to deal with life by himself. Still he persevered keeping his self alive. As I read I see who is the real monster, I recommend this book for those who know Frankenstein as a mad scientist who created a monster.
