review/summary: Who doesn't love J.R.R. Tolkien and his marvelous worlds...review/text: I bought this book, in fact the entire Lord of the Ring series, and it is purely for the joy of having two copies...one for me to hear, and one to share.The reader is an incredibly competent actor with many characters depicted in his repertoire of voices, all unique, recognizable and intriguing. His background and accent are perfectly suited to the special Tolkien world and its creatures, and each book in the series is a treasure and joy to hear.
