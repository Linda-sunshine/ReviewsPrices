review/summary: lovelyreview/text: Its a well woven story. Shows many attributes of human nature, the characters are as imperfect as humans are. Its not one of those stories with a perfect heroine or a horrible adversary, this story is realistic and shows different sides to people, it details their lives with utmost imperfect sincerity that you feel so deeply for these people, the author did a marvelous job with establishing a empathic relationship between the characters and the reader, and its ending isnt a perfect fairy tale ending, but its very filling and satisfying, it might be a accurate portrayal of what life is really like, and the ways people go to endure it
