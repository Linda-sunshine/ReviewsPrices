review/summary: The Visitorreview/text: Jack just can't keep out of other peoples trouble and lucky for them. He is a genuine hero and his character is very very entertaining and powerful, a loner that just keeps on getting himself in and out of trouble. Keeping the world safe according to Reacher.
