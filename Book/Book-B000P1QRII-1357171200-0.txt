review/summary: CD was taped overreview/text: Disappointing that the CD was obviously overwritten with the story. It was possible to hear some of the songs in the background. All the song titles are still showing - no chapters or book references. I was disappointed and feel a little cheated since it was supposed to be a brand new copy.
