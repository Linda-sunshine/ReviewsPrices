review/summary: I Couldn't Put it Downreview/text: I never had to read this book in high school, which I now think is unfortunate. I've been meaning to read it for years but never got around to it. Well, now I have and I'm glad I did. The story is beautifully told in an odd, rambling style I found interesting. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. Little Scout's adventures with her brother and their friend Dill are charming and child-like, and as the story progresses, she learns a lot about life--sometimes too much. I think everyone should read this and learn right along with her.
