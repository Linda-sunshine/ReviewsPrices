review/summary: Delightfully wittyreview/text: A classic is a book that everyone knows, and people have seldom read. I am glad that I gave myself the chance to know Wilde from the source. The wit and humor of Lord Henry's aphorisms definitely make this a quotable, laugh aloud read. Many of the dry, cynical observations, remain quite fresh even a 100 years later. Also, made me use the Kindle's dictionary feature quite a lot, in order to understand many items and terms from Victorian England.
