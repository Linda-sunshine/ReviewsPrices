review/summary: Classicreview/text: Such a great, classic book to read every year or two. It really puts things in perspective and Mitch Albom does a great job with the writing. You can really put yourself in Eddie's shoes and is a great story that anyone could empathize with. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fast read that will make them think after reading!
