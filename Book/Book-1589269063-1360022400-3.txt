review/summary: Absolutely reccomendreview/text: This book was an amazing start to understanding the cause of many of my relationship struggles and more importantly, how to begin to fix them. The other book I highly recommend reading in conjunction with this one is "The 4 seasons of Marriage" by Gary Chapman.
