review/summary: Quick Read, Not Terribly Thought-Provokingreview/text: 5 Love Languages helped me analyze my current relationship and reflect inwardly about what was causing tension in my relationship and what could alleviate that tension. That said, I found the text repetitive and containing generalizations about societal roles and female/male stereotypes. It's the kind of book you can read at the gym, and for the low price, it's worth it.
