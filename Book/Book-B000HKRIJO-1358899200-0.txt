review/summary: Great giftreview/text: I got this as a Christmas gift for my niece and god-daughter. I've read it many times, and though you could argue that this work (which was originally delivered as talks delivered to the troops leaving for WWII) is a re-hash of ideas stated perhaps better by GK Chesterton in Orthodoxy and The Everlasting Man, this is a wonderful book.It does a great job of stating the main ideas of Christianity thoughtfully, patiently, and often humorously. And Lewis takes you through from his own viewpoint as a former atheist, so he is aiming at the &#34;outside looking in&#34; crowd.Highly recommended for anyone who wants to understand the gist of Christianity without being patronized, condescended to or lectured.
