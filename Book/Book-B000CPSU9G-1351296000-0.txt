review/summary: Oscar Wilde a gifted author from AMAZONreview/text: I was interested in reading a book by Oscar Wilde. This title intrigued me, or rather the description of the young man who wanted to always stay young and have the picture grow old. I haven't gotten very far into the book as yet, but appreciate the writing. Author is good with words.
