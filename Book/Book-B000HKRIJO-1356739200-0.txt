review/summary: Good selection of Lewis classicsreview/text: I think that in 1000 years, Lewis will be viewed as one on the great Christian thinkers, up there with Aquinas, Anselm, Barth, etc. Of his works, the ones in this volume are the ones he is best know for and the ones that are his best.The binding on the book is strong, but the edges of the pages are rough cut (probably there is a technical term for this), which makes it seem to not be well bound.
