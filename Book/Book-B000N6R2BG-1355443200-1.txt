review/summary: There are more mysteries to life than vision and logicreview/text: I thoroughly enjoyed the book. To believe I would have to be in Mariah's shoes, but in my shoes I can suspend belief and accept that things happen, whether we want them to or not and it is how we respond to those things that define us. I also like that while things can seem quite desperate in the short run, the long run always brings us beauty, wonder, and love that we may not have ever anticipated.
