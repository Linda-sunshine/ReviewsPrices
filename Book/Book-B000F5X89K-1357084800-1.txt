review/summary: Not what you rememberreview/text: The worst thing that ever happened to Shelley's classic is Karloff and Universal. Forget what you think you know about the story of Victor Frankenstein and his monster and allow yourself to experience the work that &#34;inspired&#34; the countless movies. While not as engaging Dracula, the story does have an element found in Stoker's novel and most 19th century horror literature; a certain mix of roles where humans are the monsters and monsters are victims. An ambiguity of wrong and right, good and evil, the inevitable climax between those forces and a moral and lesson that is hard won and forever lifechanging for the characters and the readers. For monsters and victims and hubris are not exclusive concepts. They exist in every character and truth is fickle in these tales.
