review/summary: Enjoyed by a reluctant readerreview/text: The Harry Potter books have a reputation for getting even reluctant readers to read, and it proved to be true in this case. I bought this book for a 9 year old boy who mostly doesn't enjoy reading. After he actually started it he finished it quickly and asked for Book 2.
