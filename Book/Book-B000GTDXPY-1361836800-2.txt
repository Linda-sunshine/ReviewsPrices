review/summary: laugh-out-loud comedy and suspensereview/text: Calamity Jayne was a laugh-out-loud story full of suspense. Loved the characters, from Tressa "Calamity Jayne" to Ranger Rick to Grandpa Joe and Hellion Hannah. As soon as I finished reading the first book, I bought the boxed set of 6 so that I could read the rest of the Calamity Jayne adventures. A light and fun read with characters reminiscent of Janet Evanovich characters.
