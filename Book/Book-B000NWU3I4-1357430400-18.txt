review/summary: Still an Entertaining Readreview/text: I decided to reread the Hobbit in between viewings of the Hobbit movie, and I'm glad I did. This is definitely a good book, but it might not have held up quite as well as I'd expected. I'm still going to give it 5 stars for the nostalgia, but otherwise I'd probably give it 4. The writing style is just very detached, and it's very hard to get into the characters. I never felt like I was Bilbo Baggis, this was partially from the writting style, but especially because of the comments from the narrator. Instead, the Hobbit feels like a story someone is telling me. Maybe this is why it works so well for children/young adults, but reading it now I just felt detached from everything that happened. There's a lot that happens during the book, but it all goes by so quickly that it's odd. This is most noticeable for the ending, which I found to be poorly done. There's such a buildup to fighting this dragon, but in the end it's fought and killed in about one pages time. Then the battle where multiple main characters are killed is hardly described at all at first, and then it's just summarized by the narrator. Still, The Hobbit is a fun and easy read, that everyone should at least read once.
