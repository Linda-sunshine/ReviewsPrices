review/summary: Second only to Pride and Prejudicereview/text: At age nineteen, Anne Elliott was persuaded to give up Frederick Wentworth, a young naval office. Though she loved him and continues to love him, he could not provide her with the security and prestige her family felt was her due. He goes off to sea and Ann settles down to a life of servitude to her family. Years later, a wealthy Captain Wentworth returns with the idea of marrying -- not Ann but one of her young in-laws.When I first read Persuasion, I was too young to understand Anne's position. Being utterly selfish, like Anne's family or utterly cowed, like Anne at the beginning of the book, was foreign to me. It took some life experience on my part to be able to appreciate the theme of duty to oneself vs duty to one's family.Though much shorter, Persuasion is a harder read than Pride and Prejudice. It takes time to warm to the main characters. If you give it that time, Anne and Frederick's love story is well worth the effort.
