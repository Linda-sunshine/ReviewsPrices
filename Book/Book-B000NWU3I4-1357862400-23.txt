review/summary: A great read for everybodyreview/text: I read The Hobbit for the first time when I was about ten, making it my first foray into Tolkien's works. It had been a few years since my last journey into the first workings of Middle Earth, and I found the holidays a perfect time to pick it back up, especially considering the release of the first film.Having read Lord of the Rings since my last reading of The Hobbit, I had forgotten the stark contrast in tone. Tolkien definitely tells the Hobbit in a much more innocent, almost-naive voice, which is understandable, considering (1) he hadn't fully conceived of the darker-themed LOTR at the time, and (2) it is a children's story.While it is a children's story, The Hobbit is still a masterpiece that anybody can enjoy. You can discover something new with every fresh reading, and there's always a new message to be found.I would recommend this book to anybody, whether you are interested in an easy read, a great plot, or are introducing your children to Tolkien's world.
