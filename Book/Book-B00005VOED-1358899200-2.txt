review/summary: A Great American Commentaryreview/text: St. Ignatius believed that people could write their way to truth, and medievalist Ignatius J. Reilly (Jesus? Really?) does his best work writing as he lolls around on his stain-sheeted bed - that is, before he loses said sheet during a failed insurgency at Levy Pants. Hilarious characters abound, while never losing sight of what's most profound - the truth of the insanity of being human.
