review/summary: A cautionary tale.review/text: The Scarlet Letter is a catuionary tale set in a time with a very different moral code. This makes for fascinating reading at the start however, the writing style is so long-winded and introspective that it is not a particularly satisfying read. I wanted to fast forward through a lot of it to get to the action. The unusual characters in the story are well described and I liked the writers attempt to portray a "fallen woman" in a sympathetic light - and with unusual strength. I appreciated it for the insights, but won't be recommending it.
