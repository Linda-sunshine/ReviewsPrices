review/summary: An old tradition being passed along!review/text: My Mother used to read this book to me and my siblings when were kids. I lost it through the years, and when I saw it on here I absolutely had to get it for my nephew of almost a year, I know he won't appreciate it this year. But years to come it will be a tradition for my brother to read to his son. This book is detailed, so beautiful and special. I recommend it to anyone who wants to start a tradition, reading it every Christmas, or just for a work of art. This book is amazing! The book came on time, and as it was described. Very Satisfied Customer! THANK YOU!
