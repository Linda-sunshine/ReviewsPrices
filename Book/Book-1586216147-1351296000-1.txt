review/summary: A very moving story.review/text: The Notebook is a very moving story,which gives us an insight to life, living with dementia from a partners perspective. It is sad but also shows the strength of a love that is determined and stubborn.The book is very well written, as I work with dementia people five days a week and have a very close connection to husbands and families, I could read a very truthful account of the inner feelings of all concerned. Well done!
