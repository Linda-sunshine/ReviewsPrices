review/summary: Second time reading this... even better.review/text: I was 14 when I first read this series, and it was amazing. The Maximum Ride series was the first series that got me interested in reading for fun. It was fast paced and kept me interested. I'm 18 now and now I caught some of the jokes more then I did when I was younger. It's a bigger book, but it's a fast paced book. Although it's geared toward younger teens, it's enjoyable at any age. If you haven't read it yet, read it. You won't be disappointed... unless you're a boring person.
