review/summary: A great storyreview/text: With all the hype around zombies and vampires in recent years I decided to read the one that started it all.and I was not disappointed and you won't be either.I'm 38 years old and thought this book to old to read.but it had become my favorite horror book of all time.great story written in journals gives it a more gothic feeling,don't pass on this classic.
