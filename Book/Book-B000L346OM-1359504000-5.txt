review/summary: This book's message stays with you!review/text: This powerful book about a personal experience dealing with Nazis goes well beyond the stories of Corrie Ten Boom or Anne Frank. It is a book people want to reread several times. As a matter of fact, our local library cannot keep enough copies of the book because patrons check them out and won't return them!
