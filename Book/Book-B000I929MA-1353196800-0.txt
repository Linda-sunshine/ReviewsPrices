review/summary: Definitely a must readreview/text: I had to get about halfway through this book before I actually began to appreciate the situation that the main character was in. Initially, my reaction was that she had just given up on everything and I couldn't understand why she didn't fight harder for her "freedom". After she revealed more personal information about herself and had some meaningful interactions with some of the others in the book, I was horrified at the oppressive conditions that all of these women were living under. I even found one of the "bad guys" a somewhat sympathetic character, which caused me a bit of conflict.I couldn't imagine waking up one morning and having all of the rights and freedoms that I enjoy taken away from me, including the right to control what happens to my own body. In the end I found myself wanting to know more about what happened to some of the women and men who were central to the storyline.I like the idea of reading the story as a historical personal narrative that was uncovered years later. Overall it was a well written book and it really is frightening when you think of the power that this government has over the women. It is definitely worth a read, and as a woman be prepared to feel a bit angry with the treatment of the women in this story.
