review/summary: 50 Shades of Greyreview/text: I started reading this book because of all the hype about it. I couldnt get into it at all. I stopped reading it after a few pages. Then I saw a review of it on the telly and I definitely stopped trying to get into it. They certainly didnt do the book any favours. It was badly written and the content wasnt that great. Might watch the film though !
