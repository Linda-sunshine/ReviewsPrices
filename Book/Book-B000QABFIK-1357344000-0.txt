review/summary: A book about nothingreview/text: I remember when I first began to read this book for class, didn't understand how a book could be about nothing and still be a classic. But after it all, I've come to classify it as a book about life, simply put. It's a grotesque, truthful, yet beautiful description about life that can be loved by all.
