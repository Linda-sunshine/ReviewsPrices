review/summary: Reveiw by a 15-Year-Old Girlreview/text: This is an unbelievably wonderful play on words. It is so much fun to read.Mr. Carroll was well acquainted with three young sisters. The middle one (who was his favorite) was named Alice. Once, on a summer picnic, he told the girls a story he had made up about Alice. They loved it so much that he made a book out of it and got it published. The illustrator he worked with was very accommodative, and he made the pictures exactly to Mr. Carroll's liking. The real Alice had short, dark hair, unlike the original illustrations. (Robert Ingpen takes some liberties on his version, but I am IN LOVE with his dreamy illustrations). As is stated in the first chapter, "What is the use of a book...without pictures or conversations?"I love the attention to detail in this book, such as a little cup of orange juice on a bookshelf.Alice herself is a wonderful character; she is confident, but humble enough to admit that she makes mistakes. At one point she [SPOILER WARNING!] relates to another character how she enjoys playing croquet with herself, and when she cheats, she will scold herself most harshly so as to bring tears to her eyes! She is also amazingly smart, especially for being only about seven. (She states her age in "Through the Looking Glass".)I would recomend this book for ages twelve and up. It just won't be enjoyable for younger ages. I tried reading it to my 9-year-old sister (who has been complimented by many people on her amazing vocabulary) and she didn't get the humor. It was written in the 19th century and the language was just over her head.Now, I have seen many cats without smiles, but I have never seen a smile without a cat. How about you?
