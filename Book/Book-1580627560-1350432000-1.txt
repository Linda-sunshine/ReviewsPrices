review/summary: Exactly As Promised.."from doormat to dream girl"review/text: I've read this and also Why Men Mary Bitches and cannot say enough good things about these books. I never realized what a Door Mat I was --just doing normal stuff we girls do when we start falling for a guy-- until I read the "Bitch Books." (BITCH = Babe in Total Control of Herself). I just became a Dream Girl to a great guy. It worked for me. If you're repeatedly wondering "what went wrong this time?" then look no further. Get it, read it, love it!
