review/summary: Worth the Readreview/text: Just brilliant. I looked for this book in Arabic for some of my students who expressed an interest in it. My copies, warn and dog-eared and some of them long lost or &#34;forever borrowed&#34;, I find must be consistently replaced. The search continues, but the book really is just that good. Though written by a Christian, he's not writing just for Christians. Chapman includes this information in his book, but it's worth restating here: this book is for any and all faiths, or none at all, because it's all about people and their relationships. The book, and all it has to say, is uniquely, wholly unifying. This one is for humanity.
