review/summary: The Hobbit- Reviewreview/text: I needed to reread this before seeing the movie. Things happen quickly with a Kindle and just like that I was transported to The Shire. You can't put this down, especially if you have never read The Hobbit (Is there actually someone out there who hasn't read The Hobbit?) For shame!!! Buy it, you'll love it
