review/summary: I downloaded this book just in time for the movie!review/text: I read this book as a child, and when i saw the preview for the movie, i knew i had to reread it. My husband bought it on my kindle for me and i got to read it before i saw the movie! i can't wait to see how the movies bring the book to life. by far this is my favorite book that JRR Tolkien writes. It is a lot more light hearted than the Lord of the rings. Definitly a must read!
