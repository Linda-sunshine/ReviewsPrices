review/summary: The Handmaid's Tale is Now My Second Favorite Overall Book, Favorite Contemporary Novelreview/text: I just finished The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood. It's like a super hybrid of 1984 and The Bell Jar. It is everything a dystopian novel should be, and from the perspective of a truly realistic female character and the language is poignant, powerful, and gorgeous.To enjoy a small sample of the awesomeness, read this brief passage. It is one of many I highlighted for future admiration:&#34;I want to keep on living, in any form. I resign my body freely, to the uses of others. They can do what they like with me. I am abject.I feel, for the first time, their true power.&#34;
