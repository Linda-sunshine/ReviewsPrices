review/summary: Hollywood could never top this!review/text: Though it is easily in the Top 25 Most Reincarnated Story Lines in Hollywood History; motion pictures never seem to do Mary Shelley justice. I will be the first to admit that I LOVE Frankenstein's Monster in all of his incarnations. However, Shelley's Monster is poignant and visceral on the page in a way he never seems to be on the silver screen. Read this classic - it is a true horror that will touch both the mind and the soul.
