review/summary: Enlightened!review/text: This has opened my eyes to a new way of living and showing love. For years, I have been showing my husband love through "Acts of Service", (my way of feeling loved). All the while he 's been feeling unloved, because his love language is "Quality Time"! Wow! A definite eye opener! Will definitely recommend this book to all my family and friends. LET THERE BE LOVE!
