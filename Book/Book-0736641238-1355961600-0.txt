review/summary: Summaryreview/text: Little Women is a classic written by Louisa May Alcott about four sisters and their mother during the Civil war. I have loved this book since I was in 4th grade and continue to love it now.....I won't say how many years later. It's a great read, great descriptions of the morals and manners of the area. I would highly recommend.
