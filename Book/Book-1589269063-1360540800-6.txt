review/summary: Life changerreview/text: I am currently separated from my husband of 12 years. We have 2 small children and before reading this book, I saw no hope for the two of us, our relationship was toxic and we definitely weren't showing eachother love. After reading this book, I have all the faith in the world that we can successfully love eachother in the language the other person speaks. I never realized how unloved my husband would have felt, but since he is an "act of service" person and equates love with a clean house, or coffee made for him, his lunch made before he goes to work, etc, he was definitely feeling unloved because none of that was important to me. Now that I know the love languages and have passed the book onto him, I know we will be successful in loving eachother until we're old. If your marriage is failing, I highly recommend this book and if you have a happy marriage, reading this book certainly won't hurt anything, it can only help if you're willing to read and learn from it. It's an easy read, it doesn't read like a text book, there are stories I know I could relate to and now I can't wait to show my husband in HIS language how much I truly love him
