review/summary: A Classic That Never Diesreview/text: This is a gothic tale to end all gothic tales. Forget Twilight and any other teen pop book out there at the moment, this is the real deal. Romantic, well written and of stunning originality, this is the story which started the vampire phenomenon.Composed as a set of letters and journal entries we follow Jonathan Harker and his encounters with one Count Dracula. Forget the myths and find out for yourself why this is considered one of the best books of all time.
