review/summary: Mans Search for Meaningreview/text: This book on tape was a great review of the psychology of man. As the book deals with issues, philosophies, theories, and hypothesis's I found myself reviewing what makes me tick. I listened to this with my wife and the book generates live discussions, which could lead to revelations.
