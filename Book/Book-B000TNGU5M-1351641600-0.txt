review/summary: A must read for anyone who values mankind and the human spiritreview/text: A tragic and haunting first hand account of the atrocities against the Jewish people during WWII. The story basis we are familiar with, but the candid way it is told, and the specific perspective in which only he can tell it still chills you to the core. A definitive look at a grave chapter in our collective history that we must never forget.
