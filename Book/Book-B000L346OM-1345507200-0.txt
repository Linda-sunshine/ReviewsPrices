review/summary: Hard to put into wordsreview/text: On the surface this little gem of a book could appear simplistic. However, the author, a Nazi camp survivor, does not dwell on his horrors or loss (both unimaginable to me). Rather the gift of life under any circumstances is truly a gift, how we choose to live our gift is totally up to each person.
