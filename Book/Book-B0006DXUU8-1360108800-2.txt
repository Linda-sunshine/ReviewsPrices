review/summary: Great book!review/text: This is a really good book! Scrooge is a really mean guy in the beginning, but in the span of one night, he is completely transformed. The new man he has become, gives the story a good ending. I think this story is good for my fellow teens, it shows that all people can become new, that forgiveness is possible, and that you should always be considerate of others.
