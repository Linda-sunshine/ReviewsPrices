review/summary: Everyone should read the classics!review/text: Too many people only know these classic stories by what the film industry has provided instead of the original by the author. I was guilty of this myself and wanted to original story. I had seen some earlier versions in film, in black and white, that followed this original nearly word by word so that was refreshing to see that someone got it right. Of course, the premise of Scrooge has been done and overdone to the point of silliness these days, but now I know the version as it was orignally designed and perhaps can watch these film versions with that knowledge.
