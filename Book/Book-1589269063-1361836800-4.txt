review/summary: Formatting?review/text: Product was great however, when ordering I was confused by the questions in formating. I ordered them to listen to them on a cross country car ride. What I recieved I have to listen to with a computer or DVD player, it would not work in car stereo or a walkman type CD player. My daughter works on computers and she didn't know what format to order either so I don't think it was us. It didn't ask DVD or CD and any audio CD should play in car stereo. That's pretty much the idea of audio formatting.
