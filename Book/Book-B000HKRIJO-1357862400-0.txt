review/summary: Great for the logical mindreview/text: C.S. Lewis is great at explaining stuff in a very logical manner. Though he can hit on some really deep theology at times, he does a profficient job of laying it all out. Would really recommend for any Christian looking to delve deeper or anyone questioning, as C.S. Lewis was a devout athiest before trying to disprove God/Christ and coming to him through his quest to disprove him.
