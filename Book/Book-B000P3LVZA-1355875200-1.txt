review/summary: Maybe revolutionary at the time...review/text: Huxley's Brave New World is a choppy, disjointed, not so harmonious account of a future in which everyone is genetically engineered and conditioned to be happy. Should anything unhappy occur, there is always soma, a plant derived drug on which the entire society is dependent. In this 'Brave New World' the terms 'mom' and 'dad' and 'parents' have become such curse words. Every member of society was conceived in a lab, the less important members conceived in multitudes, creating up to 96 identical people who are destined to perform the same mundane task their entire life, and be happy about it. Everything seems to be going very smoothly, until an 'Alpha' (member of the highest caste of society) by name of Bernard takes a vacation to a 'savage' reservation. When he returns, he brings with him John, a savage from the reservation. John, raised in a world of vastly different morals, struggles to assimilate into a society in which monogamy is shameful, babies are developed in bottles, and no one has ever read Shakespeare or the Bible. Huxley's book feels like a commentary on communism and socialism, but it is hard to care about the message he is sending, when none of the characters are engaging enough to identify with. It almost seems as though Huxley had a great idea, but couldn't quite make a story out of it. Overall, an interesting idea, poorly developed.
