review/summary: Outstanding book.review/text: There are many great lessons to learn from this book. Perseverance and faithfulness are the two obvious and most prominent. The story of Corrie Ten Boom's family and their efforts to hide Jews from the Nazis is simply amazing, and it's a story that everyone should read.While Corrie's courage is admirable, I was more moved by the actions of her sister Betsie. Even while they suffered the most horrific conditions, Betsie prayed not only for their fellow prisoners, but for their guard and tormentors as well. While this is an example that is set for us in the Bible to follow, it is a monumental task and to have the faith that she had under these conditions is unbelievable. And to find out the end of the story for some of the guards they prayed for reminds us to keep an eternal perspective.The true stories told in this book are better than any I've seen in fiction, and the fact that they are true stories makes them all the more fascinating. Particularly amazing were the results of the absolute honesty of Nollie and Cocky.The impact of Corrie Ten Boom before, during, and after her ordeal is remarkable. This is a well written book that conveys not only her story, but the spiritual lessons that can be learned from it as well.
