review/summary: Somewhat Overratedreview/text: The Hobbit is considered a literary classic for the fantasy standards it created, and though there's a wonderful story here (the Riddles in the Dark chapter with Gollum is particularly exciting), but I was turned off by the quick writing style that emphasizes innane background details and cordially dances past what could have been epic sequences. For example, we get a full paragraph or two describing Bilbo's Hobbit hole, yet a measly sentence or so describing a battle in a thunderstorm between giant rock monsters. The Hobbit is an imporant piece, and many will undoubtedly love it, but I found it difficult to enjoy.
