review/summary: Must readreview/text: I did not read this book until I was in my 40s, and I am sorry it took me til then.Admittedly,I am partial to the LOTR trilogy,otherwise I would have given 5 stars.To me,this is perfect for young people to be introduced to Mr.Tolkien,and a wonderful adventure.I love that there is no technology,it is all good vs.evil,being to being,if that makes sense.My son's and I share a wonderful bond with these books.
