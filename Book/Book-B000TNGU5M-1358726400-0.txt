review/summary: A Dark Jewel--Classic For All Timereview/text: Night is a brilliantly written, tightly woven narrative of unconscionable evil. My reaction to the book was, How could we, as a global community, ever have allowed this to happen to another human being? Nevertheless, I am grateful that Elie Wiesel survived to tell his story. Everyone should read this book.
