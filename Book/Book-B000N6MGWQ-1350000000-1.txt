review/summary: My Literature Class loved it!review/text: I allow my students to choose a book that we can read together. This was one of their choices and they have really enjoyed it. I like the book because it has allowed for for many a discussion on life, death and how we should live our lives. I have used other Mitch Albom books and found them to be easy for teens to relate to. Mitch has a "tell it like it is" way of putting experiences into words.
