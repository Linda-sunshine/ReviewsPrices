review/summary: A Wonderful Story....review/text: This novel is brilliant and amazing. The plot centers around Guy Montag, a fireman who's job it is to burn books and houses containing books. The world has made books illegal, making humans almost like robots who are lazy and obsessed with technology and fun. This novel is a definitely sci-fi, but it also could be considered future fiction or dystopia. There is a lot of action and adventure within the story, but I also like the philosophical implications that Ray Bradbury put in there. A wonderful read that will keep you captivated and thinking!
