review/summary: One of my favoritesreview/text: I read this book in High School and many of the topics have stuck with me to this day, many years later. I bought this book to re-read and love it just as much as I did all those years ago! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a classic with several underlying themes or just wants a good read!
