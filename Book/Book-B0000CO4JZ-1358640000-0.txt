review/summary: Surprisingreview/text: I was not prepared for the turn the book takes and was left feeling perplexed. This is a book I was required to read in high school and did not at the time. I will need to spend some time now digesting the meaning behind the seemingly meaninglessness in the story. An engaging read but a challenging story.
