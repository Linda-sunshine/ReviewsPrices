review/summary: A Review Of Amazon's Willingness To Bilk Kindle Usersreview/text: Can someone tell me why Kindle "books" are so expensive?!Software is always famously more profitable than hardware and is where companies make their money.But come on!The cost to produce the file is minimal.Server space: minimal.Cost of delivery: minimal.I often see the cost of a Kindle book outstrip an actual (superior/preferable) BOOK.With Kindle 'books':There are no printing or binding costs.No Warehousing costs.No employment costs for storage, creation, and shipping.No shipping costs.No overhead of a brick and mortar shop to factor in.No shelf space consideration for a retailer.So WHY are Kindle 'books' SO expensive?!Because sales of the reader made it the best selling item on Amazon.Ever.So as a reward to us all:They decided to rip us all off.Maximize, profits, (already a healthy scenario at the original intro prices/come on), at the expense of the average person.What I'd spent on my Kindle could have easily bout 20 used books at a store.Far more than I've bought for my Kindle.Why spend the same, or MORE, on a convenience version when 90% of us, or more,will agree that NOTHING matches holding an actual book and turning the pages.A boycott would be a nice thing to read about.
