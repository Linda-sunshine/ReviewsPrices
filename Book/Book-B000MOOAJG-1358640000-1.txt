review/summary: Very Good Read.review/text: I enjoyed this book very much. However, and I'm sure this may sound absurd since she's the central character, at times I found Dagny to be somewhat ridiculous and at others, just damned annoying. It's sort of hard to believe that a woman wrote a female character this way. Sometimes this story becomes rather tedious and quite bogged down in philosophy but for the most part, is captivating.Anyway, the philosophy is valid and striking and it's spooky in its prescience. Small wonder that today, the looters are often heard to describe the book as having been very amusing when they were teenagers or in college, but now they understand the world and as mature adults dismiss it as merely silly nonsense. After reading the book, it's easy to understand why the moochers would try to diminish this work in this manner. It's a threat.
