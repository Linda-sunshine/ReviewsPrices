review/summary: Love by tiptoereview/text: Jane Austen cannot but become a favorite after reading Pride and Prejudice. It may have taken 36 years to get to it, but I couldn't devour it fast enough once began. I was amazed at how easily the personalities were painted in Elizabeth's language of each man. You can't help but know each man exactly for who he is as Elizabeth does, not always timely but eventually the truth comes out. Splendid storytelling. Exceptional literature!
