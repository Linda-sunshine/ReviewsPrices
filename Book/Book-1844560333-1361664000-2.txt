review/summary: Reviewreview/text: For being still in high school, I enjoyed this book so much that I should think it a must to read again when I am older. This was by far the best "classic" I have ever read and may just be one of the best books I have ever read.All books will now be held to a different standard. The characters were completely enthralling. This book is the embodiment of all great reads.
