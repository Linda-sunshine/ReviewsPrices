review/summary: obsessedreview/text: I have seen most of the movies but not in order and I never really knew what was going on so I finally decided to read the books and I have fallen in love. I am so glad I have 6 (?) More books to look forward to as the first was amazing. I now have a much greater appreciation for the movies and I can't wait to watch them all again. Harry Potter is truly an amazing and magical story. I highly recommend it for all ages!!!!!!!!
