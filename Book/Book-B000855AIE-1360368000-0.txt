review/summary: A Timeless Classicreview/text: I reset my goals after reading it. I am using lessons fromGoal Sticking: How to Go Beyond Goal Setting and Get on the Road to successto stick to my new goals.Before I read this book,I avoided setting big goals because I thought they were beyond me. But after reading As A Man Thinketh, I have started setting big goals. Whether I achieve them or not, only time will tell. But at least I have broken through the mental barrier to thinking big.
