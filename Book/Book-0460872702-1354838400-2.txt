review/summary: There's a reason they call it Greatreview/text: Stop being retroactively pissed at your high school freshman English teacher and just admit it: The Great Gatsby is a damn fine novel. This is the third time I've read it (first and third for fun, the second for the aforementioned English teacher, who did indeed manage to suck the joy out of it), and I'm still struck by two things:1) That Daisy Fay is easily the most contemptible female character in literature since Catherine Earnshaw.2) That Jordan Baker's story of how most people (including herself) are "careless drivers" truly shaped my worldview growing up. She ain't wrong.Get over the acne flashbacks and give this one another chance.
