review/summary: Relevance of the book todayreview/text: If I had read this book decades ago, I would rate it higher. Today it would be difficult to get people to read it. As a former English teacher, I was fascinated and intrigued by Wilde's sentence structure and word choice; most readers today would find it stilted and actually difficult to read. In addition, the class structure adds more problems for understanding how the characters behaved. Lastly, the older British custom of describing men and their feelings about their friends would put off many readers. (Same problem with some of Shakespeare's sonnets.) While it is certainly a classic, there are many contemporary authors who deal with the theme as well as Wilde. It is probably a great choice for English literature majors; however. I suspect the general public could invest their time better with another book.
