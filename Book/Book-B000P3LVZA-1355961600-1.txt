review/summary: Will it stand the test of time?review/text: Huxley's Brave New World was a clear pioneer of early dystopian novels. The book is a frequent pop-culture reference, and is still a must-read for that reason. But, it's questionable whether this will stand the test of time.The novel revolves around a hyper-sexualized people that focus on pleasure and happiness - at the cost of reality. The basic premise is novel and exciting, but is aging. Newer dystopian novels and films (i.e.,The Children of Men) seem to have a grit and closeness to reality that Huxley's book never delivers.As most dystopias aim to warn the ills of centralization, this follows suit. Unfortunately, the history and possibility for the development seems underdeveloped and unexplored.
