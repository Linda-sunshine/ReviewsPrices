review/summary: The Hiding Place still speaks to me.review/text: I read this book as a teenager & was so moved by all that Corrie, Betsy, & their father endured to help people that others considered worthless. Today, I'm 53 & I am again moved & touched by the stamina that these ladies had in such adverse conditions. With Betsy's empathy & compassion for the (to me evil) people who persecuted her, it makes me feel like anything is possible no matter what the circumstances.
