review/summary: A Very Helpful Bookreview/text: The Five Love Languages is a very good book for married couples. The book's thesis is that there are five ways (languages)in which we experience love. My way is different than my husband's. It will help any marriage if this is read and learned and applied.I have recommended this book to clients in my clinical social work practice and they have found it valuable. One of the most difficult things for couples to learn is that their personalities and views are not alike. They need to see things from the other's point of view in order to understand each other.
