review/summary: Interesting bookreview/text: If you like futuristic stories this book will make a great addition to your collection. The main characters are teenagers living in a society, in a not very far future, where at the age of 16 everyone undergoes some plastic surgery to become `pretty'. There is of course a resistance group and the story will develop into a great thought provoking romance thriller.
