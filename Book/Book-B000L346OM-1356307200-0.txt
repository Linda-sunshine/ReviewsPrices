review/summary: This book speaks to the heart of lifereview/text: I can truly say this book made me come to grips with the focus of my life. I have so struggled to make sense of my time on earth and have I made a difference. Such an important quest comes full circle after reading what happens when all hope is removed. I have given a copy of this book to both my sons. I want them to be fulfilled men.
