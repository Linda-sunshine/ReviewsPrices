review/summary: good way to wade throough the classicsreview/text: its Moby Dick....what more needs to be said, i am trying to read the classics i missed in my youth, this is an excellent way to do it, melville is not even close to a favorite, so i am glad i didnt pay for it and it was nice that Kindle has these for free.
