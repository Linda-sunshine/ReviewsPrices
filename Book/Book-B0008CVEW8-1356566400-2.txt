review/summary: gifts for the kidsreview/text: I knew my 2 kids had not read this book. This is a classic book that all kids should read at least once. I had a whole collection of classics, Black Beauty, Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, etc. Kids nowadays have no idea what white wash a fence means, lol.
