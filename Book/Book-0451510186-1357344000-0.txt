review/summary: Food for thoughtreview/text: A great book, with many interesting ideas to mull over and written in beautiful English. It is a relatively short read, but it is one of those books that is so packed that it definitely demands multiple read-throughs. I will say that it is not a very suspenseful book, so it does take some degree of discipline to go through, but it is so good and such a masterpiece that the journey is definitely worth it.
