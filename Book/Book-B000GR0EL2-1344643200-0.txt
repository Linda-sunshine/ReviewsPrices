review/summary: Moving & inspirational!review/text: The Hiding Place by Corrie Ten Boom is not only well written and witty, it is so moving and inspirational to encourage us to stand up for what is right. The book is very educational to what occurred during that time and gives a very real depiction of not only the anguish of those that suffered, but the amazing bravery of many people living that nighmare.
