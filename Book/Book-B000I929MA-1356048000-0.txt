review/summary: Disturbing, but thought-provokingreview/text: Disturbing......because this could so easily happen right here.I thought it prophetic that in the "Historical Notes" at the end of the novel, Gilead(America under the monotheistic regime) is grouped with Iran (and that Gilead's takeover was accomplished by blaming the acts of terror on Muslims), when it's the hard Religious Right who push for monotheism and are always warning against Muslims.....Ironic.I thought this was a disturbing inside look at dominionism, Biblical cherrypicking, and oppression taken to the extreme. Anyone who thinks "this could never happen in America", I ask you to look at the recent legislative restrictions on women's rights, birth control, abortion, equality, the rights of LGBT, civil rights, voting suppression, attempts to bring Christian theocracy into our government, the war on the poor rather than on poverty, the lack of compassion by the Religious Right.....and think again.Excellent commentary on issues such as the consequences of pollution as well.
