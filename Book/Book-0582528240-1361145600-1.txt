review/summary: The Book that Contains the Best Line Ever in American Literaturereview/text: Ernest Hemingway has remarked that &#34;All American literature grows out of Huck Finn.&#34; Jane Smiley has said that it was braver for Harriet Beecher Stowe to write Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1850 before the Civil War than it was for Mark Twain to write Huck Finn in 1885, twenty years after the war had ended. Maybe she is right, but Twain treats Jim as a person, while Stowe treated most of the slaves in her novel as a social problem. We all know the story. Jim is a runaway slave; Huck is a runaway teen. Together they raft down the Mississippi. Yadda yadda yadda plot, and Jim is sold back into slavery by two con-men, forcing Huck to choose between what was legal in 1840 (the approximate date of the action) and what was (and is) moral. He has heard the words of religion tolerating and even supporting slavery. He knows the laws support slavery. But Jim is his friend. Jim is not property. He is a man. When Huck Finn finally decides that his only course of action is to free Jim, he signals his determination with the line, &#34;All right, then, I'll go to hell!&#34; &#8212; and thus proves Jim's humanity and his own. In those days, people believed in hell, yet Huck will risk that eternal damnation for a fellow human. It's a great line in a great book.
