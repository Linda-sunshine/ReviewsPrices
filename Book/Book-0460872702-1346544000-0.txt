review/summary: I know the last page by heart...review/text: it is one of the most beautiful pages ever written. Although I recommend TGG to everyone and frequently give it as a gift, it's a shame that so many people are forced to read it in high school as that ruins it for a lot of folks; although I guess just as many people discover it through that forced feeding.
