review/summary: What an Adventure!!!review/text: This was the very first ERB I have ever read, and what a treat it was! When I heard they were making a John Carter movie, I decided to read the book first and I am glad I did. I am sure that if Edgar Rice could see what they did to his masterpiece he would have been rolling in his grave. The amount of thought and imagination that was placed in this book is just amazing. To create creatures, cultures, languages, customs, describe and go into the mechanics of science, physics, and engineering of the technologies found on the planet were just ingenious. Most of these concepts were completely overlooked in the movie, which I find to be a great shame. Please, if you have not read the book yet do so! It explains so much that the movie simply ignores. The characters are rich in personality and heart, from the good and faithful Woola, to the feisty princess, to friends from all backgrounds and races, to the brave John Carter himself. The adventures are filled with danger and surprises around every corner. This is a great book/series for any adventure/sci-fi reader.
