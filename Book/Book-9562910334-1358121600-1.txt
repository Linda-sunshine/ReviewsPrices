review/summary: American classicreview/text: So I guess after Suzanne Colins wrote The Hunger Games a bunch of other people decided to write reality show books because they wanted to make lots of money too. And this is one of them. Big Brother is a show where a bunch of hot people live in a house together and hook up all the time. Like "jersey shore," only they are trapped in the house and no beach. But in the book which I guess got taken from Big Brother show, its like a countrywide reality show and everyone is trapped in the country which instead of Jersey Shore is called Oceania so I guess its set in Australia or something? But the idea doesn't change. Everybody wants to stay in teh country and not get taken to a little room called 101. In the mean time people talk really wierd because its the future even though the book is 1984 which was like 30 years ago. Way before I was born. So why do they make us read it in school? Like none of it actualy happened even though I don't remember the 80's.What I didn't get about the book is why people don't just say whatever Big Brother wants them too so they can stay out of room 101. Like you have to say that two and two are five, and red and blue make orange, but you have to actually believe it which is really confusing. Even though his girlfriend Julia says they should just make stuff up like the government wants, winston who is the main character tries to start a rebelion. he just ends up getting attacked by giant rats or something. So don't rebel unless you like giant rats.So in conclusion, this is a great American classic and you should read it, it says how important it is to rebel against the power even if theres no reason to.
