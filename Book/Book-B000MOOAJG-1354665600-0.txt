review/summary: Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Randreview/text: The prose is beautiful as it tells the story of how the economic climate changes, somewhat gradually, in the country, with an eerie,identifiying quality about it. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in what can happen when the government starts taking over peoples' lives; how it changes the economy, changes people, and how it takes away the incentive to be entrepeneurial.
