review/summary: Now I know why it's a classicreview/text: First time reading after seeing nearly every tv/movie version. Very impressed and really enjoyed the conversational writing style of Dickens. Thought it'd be a hard read due to the time period, but was able to settle in easily. A great read at anytime of year, but extra meaningful at Christmas.
