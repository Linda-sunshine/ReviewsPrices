review/summary: Powerful... every time you read itreview/text: I read Night once in high school, once on my own, and again for a class on the Holocaust in college.It is not a work that looses its power over time. In fact, I find myself more moved every time I read it.I've read many accounts of the Holocaust, but Wiesel's is by far one of the most moving.I'd love to explain what it is that moves me so much, but it's hard to place a finger on it.Perhaps its the eloquent way of telling such horrific events. Maybe its the tragic events themselves... I really can't tell you for certain. But regardless, this is a must read not only because it has been accepted almost as a classic non fiction work, not only because of the difficult subject matter that we must study in order to not repeat the mistakes of the past, but because it is an account of the human spirit's ability to survive tragedy and horror.
