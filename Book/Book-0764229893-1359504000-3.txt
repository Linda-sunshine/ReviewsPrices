review/summary: Very incitefulreview/text: I had rather low expectations since this was a free kindle book, but I gave it a try. I found myself captivated and enriched. Hezekiah is one of my favorite characters because he represented a person devoted to God in the midst of a people far from God. This book gave me much greater insight into what he faced and how the nation of Judah was politically, socially, and religiously during that time. It was a great read and I highly recommend it whether you are a student of OT history or not. It was hard at times to keep in mind that this was a novel. The historical setting is vivid and I believe it to be based on solid historical research. Enjoy!
