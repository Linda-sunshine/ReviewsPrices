review/summary: Insipid and poorly written: for juvenile and immature mindsreview/text: Poorly written, this self-aggrandizing, purposely fat, obscurantist tome reads like a bloated attempt to high-brow a pulp fiction novel, full of poorly thought rambling digressions and self-contradictions by a psychotically paranoid rabid anti-Communist who never got over her privileged family's exile from Russia (first it espouses non-violence, then it takes plumb glee in the shooting of a guard in the chest at point-blank range, and hints at justifiable genocide of those teeming "parasitic" unwashed masses). Let it be denounced clearly: Objectivism is barely-veiled fascist Ubermensch crap and everyone worth one iota of critical thinking knows it. You won't pass a philosophy course anywhere with blind adherence to this crappy book. It's not even a philosophy - it's propaganda. Rand claims to have written the most original philosophical work ever, but it's just Nietzsche For Harlequin Romance Dummies, and even Nietzsche cringes pickle-faced and rolling in his mothy grave at her puerile co-option. This is a jejune work ready-made for the narrow egoism of wounded teenage and immature minds stuck in solipsistic foxholes, ready for that singular savior and attendant cult of personality, akin to "Catcher in the Rye," just as "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" was directly intended as capitalist propaganda for children, as admitted by Dahl himself. It's all about as enlightening as a flat, lukewarm Big Gulp of Mountain Dew, refills included via her other repetitive tomes. Wave this book at your own peril - the rest of us laugh at you, with well-marked derision.
