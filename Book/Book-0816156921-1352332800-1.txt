review/summary: ramblingreview/text: Although I enjoyed this book, I can't give it more than three stars. At points in the book as your reading its very interesting and holds your attention, then next you know it goes into a lot of rambling that totally brings the interest point to 0. I found myself skipping pages especially towards the end. The ending leaves you saying "is that it"!
