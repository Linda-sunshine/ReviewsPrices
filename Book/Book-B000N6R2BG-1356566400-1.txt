review/summary: Another winnerreview/text: I do enjoy reading books by Jodi Picoult. She always finds a hot button issue and tackles it with just enough fictional, interpersonal story lines to make it an entertaining read. She always leave me thinking about the bigger issue at hand and usually very provacative topics. I would recommend this book.
