review/summary: wuthering heightsreview/text: Love the movie. The book is different. Its hard to read and doesnt start out as the movie does. Or maybe it does and I just am not reading it right...lol.. Its a tough read for sure. Keep a dictionary handy!! For those of us that don't have vast knowledge of that era's English. Or maybe I'm just stupid. I still have to give it five stars for the story itself.
