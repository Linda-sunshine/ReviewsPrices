review/summary: Rage against the wildernessreview/text: Violent, gory, sexy, passionate, wild, untamed, exhausting, tragic, sick, but ultimately forgiving. And written by a parson's daughter living in the barren Yorkshire moors.How much of this novel is sexual fantasy and how much is experience? It's impossible to tell. There's no explicit sex in the novel, but we can say it's nothing but implicit sex. It's not about love or hate, it's about two people who've made themselves into a single being. Catherine Earnshaw of Wuthering Heights can neither love or hate her adopted brother Heathcliff: he and she have become part of each other, in their soul and in their flesh.If Wuthering Heights has a tragic element, it's not a conventional one: the moral of the tale isn't that one should resist one's animal impulses. Quite the reverse: Catherine and Heathcliff are one and the tragedy unfolds because of Catherine's decision to disregard her irrational but unbreakable bond with Heathcliff. Just as Catherine should have embraced a life with Heathcliff, maybe we should embrace our animal nature.Emily Bront is a woman of her time and her prose reflects this, yet there are scenes of intense physical violence. Where could a sheltered young Victorian woman have gotten the experience to write of these feelings and actions with such authencity?One of my very favourite novels. I first read it over 25 years ago, in Yorkshire as it happens, and I just read it for the fourth time, again in Yorkshire. A true work of art.Vincent Poirier, Montreal
