review/summary: Pride and prejudicereview/text: Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful classic novel. It is the captivating story of two people almost losing the opportunity of finding happiness together by being proud and making incorrect assumptions about each other through the influences of others. The era is one of a leisurely life spent in rambling homes, going to balls and seeking romance. He is a rich and seemingly arrogant gentleman and she is a poor and very feisty young lady in a large, happy family of girls who must marry well. Throughout the book, the author is so clever in getting the reader to understand the good and bad tension that exists between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett. It's the kind of book you can't put down when you're reading it and the kind that can be read over and over again.
