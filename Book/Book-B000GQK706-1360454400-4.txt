review/summary: Literary classic in modern formatreview/text: I love the Lord of the Rings and to be able to read it again on my kindle fire and my android phone is a wonderful convenience. The way that you keep your place between devices is fantastic feature. Its easy to read anywhere anytime because you alays have one device or the other available. I have these books in paperback but this modern way of reading is worth the money to purchase them again.
