review/summary: A Timeless Classicreview/text: The classic Little Women is a phenomenal book that anyone who is coming-of-age should read. It is definitely worth it reading all 444 pages. Little Women leaches lessons, and tells a thoughtful story of a family who comes close to losing everything but manages to live happily and love each other no matter what. Some tragic things happen, but the March family definitely cares about everyone that comes into their lives and stays strong even while the man of the house is fighting in the Civil War. I highly recommend this book to anyone who would love to read a story about this strong family. The author, Louisa May Alcott, is very talented.
