review/summary: A lesson in historyreview/text: I read a German translation of Huck Finn as a teenager. When my husband found a pristine copy at a yard sale I cracked it open and was immediately captured by Mark Twain's miraculous gift for expressing the Old South in language and decided to read it again--this time the authentic version. Not wanting to dog-ear my husband's copy, I chose to buy it for my iPhone.My favorite part of the book is the long journey down the great river that moves slowly past villages and cities and it's human drama, past foolishness, kindness, and malice alike. I was not fond of the protracted adventure of breaking Jim out and did skim a little to spare myself some of the thoughtless cruelty he is put through for Tom Sawyer's entertainment, who enjoys the adventures of complications, even if he has to create them himself. But I have no objections to this part of the book, nevertheless.The historic business of human cruelty and thoughtlessness as expressed in the enslavement of Africans is more fully captured in the uncensored version and, reading Huck Finn, I wanted as accurate an accounting of it as Mark Twain originally provided. I believe if this version is read by a child, there should be supervision and discussion as it may otherwise lead to hurt and confusion. Or perhaps it should not be read by a child. But I think this unedited version is an excellent learning tool for teenagers and adults alike. Mark Twain is astoundingly good at limning the emotional and historic space of the Old South of slavery, using the tool of local language.After reading most of the book, I found myself becoming simultaneously numbed toward and hurt by the plight and blight of slavery, getting a chance to experience my own humanity. It's hard to believe we ever did this to anyone. And I think we should not forget. The original Huckleberry Finn in an instrument of remembering.
