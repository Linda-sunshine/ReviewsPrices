review/summary: Better the second time throughreview/text: It has been several years since I read or seen The Hobbit, so I thought I would re-read it before seeing the movie this week or next. I had forgotten how much fun the story is and how witty and wise Mr. Bilbo Baggins is throughout the tale. I've enjoyed the re-reading thoroughly!
