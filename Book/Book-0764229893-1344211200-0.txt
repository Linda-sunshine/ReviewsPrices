review/summary: Christreaderreview/text: I'm not even finished reading this book and couldn't wait to write this review!Based on what is written in the Bible, combined with a little artisitic license, Lynn Austin's creation of the rein of King Ahaz and his son Hezekiah has been VERY entertaining. Half way through the novel, I picked up my Bible and began reading about King Ahaz and had to stop reading or give away the end of the Novel. I love books like these!! I already purchased the next Chronicle books. If you don't get some kind of conviction about our position with the one true God, then you'll probably be able to identfy with the High Priest Uriah in this Novel.
