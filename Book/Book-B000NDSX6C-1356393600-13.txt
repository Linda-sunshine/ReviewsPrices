review/summary: New Every Timereview/text: I read this book with my mom as a kid and enjoyed the adventure. I read it again as an adult and have enjoyed it on a whole new level. Tolkien's writing style isn't for everyone so I'd recommend trying a sample first. I'd also recommend reading it before you see the movie, as I've found it difficult to get through LOTR now that I can just watch the movies.
