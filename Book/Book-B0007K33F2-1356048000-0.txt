review/summary: One of the great ripping yarns....review/text: I had seen at least a couple of the movies when I was young. Then I heard a dramatization for radio done by the BBC. But neither can do justice to the book. If you love books by those contemporary writers like Ken Follett, whose imaginations span distances and ages, you have to read this. It has to have been the inspiration for many of the modern great writers. The story is gripping. The dialogue is witty. The retribution is mighty....How many books do you read that you just don't want to put down? This is one.
