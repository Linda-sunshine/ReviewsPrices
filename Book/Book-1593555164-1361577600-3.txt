review/summary: love the Jack Reacher Characterreview/text: I loved the book and the Character. I love the intro by the author. But I keep having to see a 6'5&#34; Tom Cruise, which gets hard sometimes. We all know Tom Cruise is what 5'7&#34;? But i am getting into the author's way of telling the story.
