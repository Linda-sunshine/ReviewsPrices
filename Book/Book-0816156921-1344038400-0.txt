review/summary: Nobody Does It Betterreview/text: What can I say? Bram Stoker is the master when it comes to vampires. No one has managed to do it better despite the many imitations (I am yet another author who has tried to follow in his footsteps). I absolutely loved this story from the moment I was first introduced to the junior version in primary school. In hindsight it seems like a very strange choice for young children, but I'm not complaining. The whole books is so steeped in Victorian sexual repression and desire that it is great fun to deconstruct, which I did much later as an English major. Forget Twilight and it's shallow, obvious themes and read a book with real depth and something important to say about the culture that it was created in. I've got to admit it does lose me a bit when it turns into a "boys-own" type of adventure towards the end, but it isn't enough to detract from its overall brilliance. Bram, baby, you're the best!
