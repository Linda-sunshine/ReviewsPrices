review/summary: 19th century meet Kindlereview/text: Moby Dick is written in a style that hasn't been in style for over a hundred years. So, you need to adjust the overly long paragraphs to the Kindle screen, unless you want to swipe the screen every five seconds and lose your place. Tiny type suits the work better than giant type simply because the work, by any modern standard is "wordy". This particular version of the Melville novel works well to adapt itself to your kindle. I do not believe that a lot of footnotes explaining context are needed for Moby Dick. It is written in a such a vernacular way that not knowing what some colloquialisms mean actually enhance the story. It's simply a good read of a classic book. I recommend it.
