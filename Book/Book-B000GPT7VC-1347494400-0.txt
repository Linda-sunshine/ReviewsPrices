review/summary: Snapshot of 1850's Americareview/text: This book was a wonderfully invigorating snapshot of the mid-1800's American slave system. Stowe enthralls readers with her vivid depictions of various scenarios relating to the wretched, corrupt establishment. Her knowledge and application of Biblical Scripture is refreshingly interwoven throughout the story, and serves to expose and convict the hypocrisy of human merchandising. Amongst the plethora of characters is my personal favorite, Augustine St. Claire, who ultimately succumbs to the crushing realization that even a "good" master is plagued with the inherent wickedness of the horrific business. Of course, the novel's title character, Uncle Tom, is a gem; enlightening the reader to true spiritual conversion and self-sacrifice, as he followed the example of His Lord and ours, Jesus Christ. Though this "fictional" work stands brilliantly on its own, it is imperative to mention that one year later, in 1853, Stowe released a non-fiction explanation, through her publisher, entitled "A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin - Presenting the Original Facts and Documents upon Which the Story Is Founded, Together with Corroborative Statements Verifying the Truth of the Work." It seems to me an absolute necessity for posterity to own this companion piece, lest we ever forget the veracity & relevence of the original.
