review/summary: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn - Purchased on Amazon's Kindlereview/text: I have read this classic several tmes during my life. I own hardback and paperback copies of it. The book was published in 1943 and I first read it a few years later, probably when I was 12 or 13. I became so engrossed in the story I once sat on our very small porch rooftop to be like Francie, who read on a fire escape she could reach from her apartment window. The story of young Francie, a voracious reader, who lives in Brooklyn with her poor family - an alcoholic father, an always-exahusted hard-working mother - is one of the best books any woman, young or old, can ever read. When I discovered it was available now on Kindle, of course I bought it. I'm now 76 and can't wait to share Francie's life once more.This is not a child's book. It is about a child who makes her way in a difficult world and neighborhood, with help from unlikely caring people along the way.Thank you to Betty Smith, the author, and to Kindle for making it easily available to thousands of us.Janice Kirkland, Salem, Oregon
