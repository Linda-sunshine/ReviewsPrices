review/summary: Draculareview/text: It served as a fun romp during the Halloween season. It dragged a bit in the middle, but I enjoyed comparing it to the landmark movie of the same name that starred Bella Lagosi in the early 30s which spawned the vampire genre for future books, movies and TV shows.
