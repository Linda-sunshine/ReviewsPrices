review/summary: Works well on all devices -- no format errorsreview/text: I'm a super-duper geek. I read on my kindle fire, wife's iPad and my droid phone. The book lays out perfectly on all three formats.Ayn Rand's writing is what it is --&#62; the overall of the book is OK but there are certain chapters I read again and again.
