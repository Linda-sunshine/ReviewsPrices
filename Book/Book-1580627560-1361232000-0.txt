review/summary: Heck Yeahreview/text: This book is a great tool for women who are used to dating jerks. It takes you up off the doormat and gets you to being a Babe In Total Control of Herself. It gives you tips to holding your own in a relationship, and makes you realize, hey, I'm worth it! For the ladies who tend to be pushovers (I'll admit I am) you got to read this, its really helpful!
