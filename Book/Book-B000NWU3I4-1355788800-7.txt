review/summary: Great!review/text: We bought this for our nephew who seems to be enjoying taking adventures through books. This is one of our very favorite books, and I can't wait until our kids are old enough to read it. I think everyone should read this book, and feel sorry for all the people who sat in the theater around us who have never read it.
