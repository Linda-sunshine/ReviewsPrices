review/summary: An important look at American society.review/text: Told from the point of view of an not always unbiased narrator, this novel captures the essence of the 20's as well as an earlyview of the divide in our country. Aside from the social aspects, it also tries to show the individual's responsibilities incontributing to that society and the failure of many of taking responsibility for anything other than personal needs.It is easy to see why this book is often used in literature classes and I would recommend it to serious readers.
