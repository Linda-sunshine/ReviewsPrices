review/summary: Boys and their adventuresreview/text: Twain's classic story about being a boy and having adventures is as relevant today as in Huck's time. We actually experience Huck's activities through his eyes, with his thoughts and the reasoning behind his actions. Twain captures perfectly the thought process of a (13 year old?) young man. Yes, it takes place during slavery period, and, though some of the language may be objectionable by today's standards, it is a story worth reading and enjoying. There is a lot more than what is ever shown in any of the movies made from this book.
