review/summary: TIMELESSreview/text: MY 6TH GRADE TEACHER READ THIS TO THE CLASS BACK IN THE DAY. IT WAS SOMETHING I COULD NEVER FORGET. I READ IT FOR MYSELF AND I AM STILL BLOWN AWAY BY IT. IT IS HEARTBREAKING AND INSPIRING, FILLS YOU WITH FURRY AND TRULY MAKES YOU THINK. IT IS TIMELESS. THE IMPACT THE RELEASE OF THIS BOOK HAD ON THE PUBLIC MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING.
