review/summary: This is a kids storyreview/text: This is the first time I've read this. This comes after reading GRRM, Rothfuss, Hobb, Brooks, Goodkind, etc so when I got into this book it was very light reading indeed. I love world building and great characters and it can be difficult to have those things in a book under 300 pages. It read like a quick, young adult or kids story leaving a lot of detail out, but I guess that is to be expected in a shorter book. I just didn't get into it.
