review/summary: Beautiful book, perfect for any Tolkien fanreview/text: I purchased this to replace my paperback editions of the LOTR series which I purchased, after watching FOTR. I greatly enjoyed reading, and re-reading The Hobbit and the three LOTR books, and as a result wanted something that better represented the literary classic than a paperback with images from the movies on the side. This was well worth the purchase.
