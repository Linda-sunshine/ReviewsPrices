review/summary: The Hobbit on Kindle...thou shall not pass the test.review/text: I downloaded my favorite book, the Hobbit to my Kindle Fire. Sat down for a evening of reading pleasure before the fireplace and three chapters into the book I had to shut it off in disgust. The lines throughout those first chapters were often repeated, misplaced, or just plain missing. I could have found the One Ring faster than try to follow the bad editing mistakes from one page to the next. I do not know how the written work is transferred from book to e-book, but when they did the Hobbit, someone hit the mead a bit early. It is a shame to take any author's work and make this big of a mess of it. Stay with the RL books for this selection.
