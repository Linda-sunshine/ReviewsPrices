review/summary: Great to finally read the original.review/text: I grew up with the animated version of this story as well as the read along book that came from it. I absolutely loved the imagery and humor of the story but had never had the chance to actually read the original book. I have to say I absolutely love it and wish that I had gotten to reading it years ago.
