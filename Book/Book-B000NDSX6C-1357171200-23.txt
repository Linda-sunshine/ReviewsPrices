review/summary: Timeless Epicreview/text: This is a fantastical tale for the young and old, as ageless and marvelously inspired as the decade it was written. Classic writing, fanciful poetry, and timeless heroes, villains, and those in between. A positive review for the indomitable force of story weaving and deep immersion into the richly developed world and peoples of Tolkien 's tales.
