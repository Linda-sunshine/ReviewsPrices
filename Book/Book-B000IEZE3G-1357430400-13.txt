review/summary: This is One You'll "Wand" to Buyreview/text: In this adventurous novel by J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter feels like there is no hope for him while he is living with his unbelievably cruel and unfair aunt and uncle, the Dursleys. Oh! How could I forget about his selfish, ignorant, stubborn, crybaby of a cousin, Dudley. You can't help to feel sorry for Harry...until a surprising arrival of a letter is addressed to "Mr. H. Potter, The Cupboard under the Stairs" (Rowling 34). Uncle Vernon refused to let Harry open his letter. Thousands of thousands of letters quickly arrive at the Dursley household for Harry. Moving away to avoid the continuous letters Harry gets a visitor, Rubeus Hagrid. Harry is told he is a wizard which surprises his "family" more than anyone. Harry is sent to a school for wizards where he learns all different types of wizardry such as flying a broomstick, different spells, and potions.J.K. Rowling does a fantastic job of foreshadowing what is going to happen. Harry is basically bowed down to as a great wizard without even knowing anything about the wizard world and the fact that there is an antagonist named vol- or I mean he who remains unnamed, a great wizard at a point who went rogue, you can tell that at some point the two will meet. J.K. Rowling also uses theme to show how a young boy overcomes adversity.This novel is fit for everyone it has the cool, majestic ideals of a young child and is written well enough to keep an adult's attention throughout the book. Grab your brooms and join Harry on his adventures through Hogwarts, his new school.
