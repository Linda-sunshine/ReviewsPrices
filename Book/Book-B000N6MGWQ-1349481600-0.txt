review/summary: Great Bookreview/text: No "shoot-em-ups. No political intrigue. No Aliens. Just a good, strong story line with a few twist and turns. Pleasurable reading with some basic morals to be taught. Albom does a great job in painting memorable mental pictures with his words. I can still close my eyes and see the old Carnival by the water...
