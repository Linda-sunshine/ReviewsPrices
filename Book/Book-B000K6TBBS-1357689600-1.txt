review/summary: Fun, enjoyable, and entertaining....I'll read every one of Lee Child's &#34;Reacher&#34; Novelsreview/text: Any adventure, crime, detective, mystery buff will love the Jack Reacher books. The character is likeable, definitely masculine, and does what many of us only dream of....it is easy to imagine being in his shoe's, if only we were as fit and talented.
