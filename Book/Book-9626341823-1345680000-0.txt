review/summary: A Christmas Carolreview/text: Absolutely the finest Christmas tale of all time, and amazingly, one which has more often than not been successfully transferred to screens of varying genres, ages and formats for an enormous number of decades.Move over "A Night Before Christmas" cos daylight finished second in this enduro and even the best of the rest are so far to the rear as none might reasonably be considered for a place!Absolutely awesome, absolutely feel good and absolutely unmawkish too.
