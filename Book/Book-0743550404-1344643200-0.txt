review/summary: The Colorado Kidreview/text: I enjoy the TV show "Haven" which is based on the book "The Colorado Kid". It was interesting to see how it came about and to meet a few characters of the show in the book. This book is not for everyone and definitely not a typical Stephen King novel. It makes you think and leaves you to keep on thinking about it.
