review/summary: Great Novel, glad I bought the book to see what I missed in the movies!review/text: I bought the Hobbit by Tolkien and really enjoyed the book. After reading the Hobbit I decided I wanted to read the Novel to get the full story. I really enjoyed the book and was amazed at how much was left out of the books.I will say some of the writing in the 'medieval' style was a little difficult to comprehend at times but still it was a very good reading and enjoyed every bit of the book.
