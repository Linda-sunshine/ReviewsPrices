review/summary: A man way ahead of his timereview/text: I am both very disappointed and glad that it took me so long to read this book. Disappointed because I am absolutely in love with it, and though I just finished it yesterday, want to read it again. Glad because I read it when I was old enough to really understand and value it.Huxley was writing dystopian novels before there was a WORD for dystopia. He was writing about a birth control pill BEFORE there was birth control. He was writing about how controlling governments will destroy society BEFORE the 2012 Republican candidates pretty much decided they wanted to take rights away from everyone, all the time. This man is so far ahead of his time, and so many people draw from his work, but no one really gives him the attention that they should.Besides its awesome story line, the book is written in such a fascinating way. The writing itself sounds mechanical, like the people living in his world. It's repetitive and monotonous but always enthralling. How he manages to accomplish both is completely beyond my scope of understanding. And yet in the middle of that he creates several characters that you are both attached to, and also disgusted by in some way. But you feel bad being disgusted by them, because they can't fight their conditioning.It's terrifying in its accuracy of what will become of the world, and brilliant in its use of science to show that nothing is more dangerous than our own ambition. If I reread this book today I am certain I see even more things that I missed before. I anticipate this being one of the most-read books in my life.
