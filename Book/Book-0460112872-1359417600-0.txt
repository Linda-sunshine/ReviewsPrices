review/summary: Looooved it!review/text: This is the second time I read this novel and it never gets old. it is most definitely one of the few pieces of literature that has won a place close to my heart. Jane Eyre is a hero in my eyes. I felt as if i lived through her struggles and i was always glad of the choices she made. Her witty, intelligent character is very refreshing. She is a lovable protagonist.
