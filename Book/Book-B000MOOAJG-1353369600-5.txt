review/summary: Should be required reading! Definitely on my top ten ever list!review/text: Great story, but more importantly a very thought provoking book that really makes you think about the underlying causes and effects in pitting socialism against capitalism. The extreme circumstances in the book underscore the importance of thinking about the downstream impacts of well meant decisions. Wonderfully written, thoroughly enjoyable.
