review/summary: Laughed all the timereview/text: Great read, highly recommended. Fun, well-written satire. Characters were great and I laughed out loud every few pages. I have never encountered a character in literature quite like Ignatius Reilly, the protagonist, and his personality resonates shockingly well in 2012, many years after publication.
