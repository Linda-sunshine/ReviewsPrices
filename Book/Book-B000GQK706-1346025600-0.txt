review/summary: Kindle Versionreview/text: Tolkien's writing is, as we all know it, amazing. I really think anyone impassioned by the Fantasy genre has to read his work (not only Lord of the Rings), so I've nothing to complain in that regard. The only reason this gets 4 stars is because the graphics are very hard to view on my Kindle Keyboard.
