review/summary: A funny, smart, sad and brilliant novelreview/text: I would love to teach a literature class on historical fiction that was actually written a long time ago. It's so interesting to see how writers from a particular period saw an era that came before them.For example, The Last of the Mohicans was written in 1826, but takes place in the 1750s. To Kill A Mockingbird was written during the Civil Rights Movement, but takes place in the Depression. And now, I just finished A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. It's a great book that holds up incredibly well, but one of my favorite things is how the novel is a view of life in 1912 that's written from the perspective of someone in 1947. You can see both eras--the one being written about as well as the beliefs of the writer who came later.This novel is an absolute work of genius. It's completely addictive, beautifully written, funny and sad. The characters are so real that I felt as if I knew them, and while they don't always do what's right, they are heartbreakingly human and vulnerable. A truly fantastic read.
