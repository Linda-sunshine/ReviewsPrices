review/summary: Kindle Version even better than I had hoped!review/text: I just wanted to reassure those thinking of purchasing the Kindle version, that yes, all appendices of the books are included! I was concerned that they may not be, and truly delighted to find them in full, along with maps, etc.! While I will also purchase the print version, I really wanted the Kindle version while I traveled through the holidays. And I am delighted to say that it was all that I hoped for and more! If you enjoyed these books, do not hesitate to acquire the digital. This all in one version translated beautifully to Kindle digital. Happy reading!
