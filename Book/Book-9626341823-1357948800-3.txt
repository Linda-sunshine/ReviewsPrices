review/summary: Still a great storyreview/text: Every Christmas season I watch various versions of &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; either on TV or as movies and I just wanted to remind myself of what the original was as to structure and storyline as each of the movie versions has its own take on the import of the story.Charles Dickens crafts a wonderful story that should be read by all to remind us of the wonderfulness of the season
