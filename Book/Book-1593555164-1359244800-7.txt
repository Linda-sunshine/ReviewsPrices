review/summary: Better Than the Movie, Very Good Page Turnerreview/text: I have read several Lee Child &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; novels, and this one I read knowing that I would see the movie afterwards. The book is a page turner, focused more on action than on the psychological character of its main character, Reacher. All one needs to get about Jack Reacher is is basic profile -- the strong silent type who is very observant, very street-smart, and deadly effective when under pressure. He is a 6'5&#34; guy who just wants to travel the country and mind his own business, but circumstances and his innate sense of justice always seem to pull him into conflict. Without going into the story, I can say that this book is just as effective a thriller as past and future novels by Lee Child. The movie with 5'9&#34; Tom Cruise also was quite good, but the movie-script is not exactly the same as the book, which is okay with me. I'll also add, that I was not distracted by the difference in height; Cruise is a professional and does Reacher justice in portraying him on the screen for the first time. I very much liked this book. It's not 5-stars, but 4-stars is still quite good.
