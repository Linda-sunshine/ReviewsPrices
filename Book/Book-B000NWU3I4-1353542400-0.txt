review/summary: A well-crafted storyreview/text: The Hobbit is one of those stories that most people have read at one time or another in their lives. I am glad that I, too, have read this story - it is well-crafted and takes you to away to a place of fantasy and wonder. I cannot wait until my daughter is old enough for me to read it to her.
