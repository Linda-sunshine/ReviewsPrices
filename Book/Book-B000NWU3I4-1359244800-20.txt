review/summary: Best Books Ever!review/text: The Lord of the Rings (and The Hobbit) are my favorite books of all time. I've read them at least every five years since I was fifteen. There are no words to express what these books mean to me except that they inspired me to start writing myself.Lucifer's Pocket. The performance of Rob Inglis was very good and convincing. He actually did a very decent job singing the songs rather than just reading them, which added a lot to the feeling of the recording. The packaging has a little to be desired being made of a cheap thin cardboard with cutouts for the CDs to be put in. I just don't think it would protect them over time and a lot of taking them out and putting them back in.
