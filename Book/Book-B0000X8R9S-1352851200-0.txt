review/summary: "Hatchet" by Gary Paulsenreview/text: Even if your child or especially if your child is not a reader, introduce him to Gary Paulsen's books. While they may seem to be written for young boys, girls and adults will also enjoy these adventures. I recently gave "Hatchet" to an adult male friend who thought the idea of reading a youth to teen book rather silly; he read it at one sitting and agreed it was a very exciting, adventurous read. Gary Paulsen has quite the imagination and can captivate any age reader with his writing.
