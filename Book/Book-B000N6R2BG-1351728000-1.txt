review/summary: Loved, loved this bookreview/text: Jody Piccault is such an expressive writer. I truly enjoyed this book. I think it will appeal to anyone, no matter your religious persuasion or views. The heroine, Faith, is both realistically childlike and adult at the same time. I rooted for both her and her Mother the entire time and was not disappointed in the outcome of their situation.
