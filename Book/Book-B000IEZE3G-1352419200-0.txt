review/summary: I'd heard some buzz about this bookreview/text: My friend told me I might like this book and I heard that it would be part of a series, so I thought I'd give it a go.THe story is good. Engaging, really. But the problem I have is with the cover. This is another example of an author with an ego so big he or she feels compelled to put their name on the cover. I'm hear to read books, not author names. If Mr (Ms?) Rowling ever decides to remove their name and just let the reader enjoy the story, I'll give this another star.
