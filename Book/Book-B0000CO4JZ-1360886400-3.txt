review/summary: Boy + Girl + Bad Boy + Money = Classic Storyreview/text: Gatsby continues to be popular (no doubt even more so with the moving coming this summer) because we all know the characters. The hero is just that, a hero but he's in love and will do anything to make his girl happy, which in this instance Gatsby thinks is money. Enter nosy neighbour, add a bad boy, throw them all into the same place at the same time and watch the fireworks. While the formula is a known one, it is F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing that makes the novel worth while. Please, please, please read this BEFORE you see the movie. It will no doubt be spectacular but all the more so with Fitzgerald's words swimming in your head.
