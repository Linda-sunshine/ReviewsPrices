review/summary: Terrific bookreview/text: I read &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; when I was in college and thought it was an awful bore! I decided to re-read it and am I glad I did. I have a much greater appreciation for Jane Austen now than I did as an 18 year old. I am sure I will re-read it again in a few years......
