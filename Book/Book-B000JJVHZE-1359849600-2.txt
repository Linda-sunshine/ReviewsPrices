review/summary: Great book!review/text: To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee, is a classic set in the hard times of the Great Depression. While reading this book, you get a real sense of what life was like during that time of hardship and racism. I liked how this book gave a wonderful view of a young girl growing up, and trying to understand this big world around her.Scout Finch is being raised by her father, Atticus, along with her older brother Jem. Scout is very much a tomboy, who would rather run and fight with the boys, instead of grow up to be a proper lady. When Atticus, who is a lawyer, is put in charge of handling a case for a black man, that's when the racial trials start. Scout and Jem watch as their father defends the innocent black man, even though it risks his friendships, respect around the town, and even his children's safety. Through this book, you will see an honest father, trying to raise two young children in a time of great issues.Young Scout starts to understand the troubles in this world, but also the good in it. She sees bad people who like to manipulate, and put down others; she also sees people like her father, who are honest, and truly kindhearted. By the time the book ends, Scout has seen a lot in her young life, and through her family, friends, and her sense of humor, she starts to learn how to handle any situation, as well as be a young lady, which will set her up well for her adult life.Overall, this is a wonderful story. You will love certain characters, and dislike others, but you will always enjoy Scout and all her opinions. This book gives you a good view into the everyday life of a child growing up in that era.
