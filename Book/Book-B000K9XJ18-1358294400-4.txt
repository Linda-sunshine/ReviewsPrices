review/summary: Jack Reacher definitely does not like the FBIreview/text: Jack Reacher is living in his house at Garrison and still going out with the beautiful Jodie Garber that we met inTripwire (Jack Reacher, No. 3)when Reacher gets forced intohelping the FBI catch a serial killer. The killer seems to be targeting previously harassed women from the army but is that really what the murders are about.However when the FBI finds no evidence left at the scenes of the crimes and the victims are dying in undetermined ways Reacher needs to act quickly in orderto prevent any further killings from happening.The fourth in the series of Jack Reacher novels is fast paced with Reacher doing what he does best - killing bad people. However Jack definitelydoes not like the FBI.If you like Jack Reacher novels then this is deifnitely for you.
