review/summary: Parenting is a tough job!!review/text: As a Christian, I wasn't sure how this book was going to treat this issue. I don't want to give anything away for a new reader, but I was glad that the title is accurate - we are still "keeping faith". The characters of the story were fascinating to follow - the weak, yet surprisingly strong mother protecting her child, the child in the middle of a media frenzy, a father consumed with guilt, the anti-evangelist with an achilles heel - and all the other catalysts to the action. However, my heart went out to the mother of Faith, for her vulnerability seemed very real. I thought the author did a better job of creating her character, and the other characters were more wooden players created to cause her to react and reveal more of her inner strength. However, the story was very fascinating and kept me engaged to the end. It had a few surprises, so that I wasn't certain how it was going to be resolved. And the author allowed me to continue to believe that miracle do indeed still happen.
