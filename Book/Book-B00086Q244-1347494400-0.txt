review/summary: AN OLDIE BUT A GOODYreview/text: This is a good reminder of how to interact and treat people, something that is often lost on today's iPod generation. Even us pre-iPod'ers have forgotten how to actively listen. I recommend "How to Win Friends & Influence People" to everyone, especially those in high school.
