review/summary: Great bookreview/text: The book was great. Only issue was the author changed a few things about jack for instance he now wears a watch. I was really looking forward to the movie until I hear Tom cruise is playing the part of a 6' 5&#34; tall 250 lb guy. Really could they have found anyone smaller to play this part. Now I think I'll just stick with the book!!
