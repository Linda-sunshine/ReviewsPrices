review/summary: Alice's adventures in wonderland was...review/text: A quite a fascinating book and very intresting in many ways .I would personally like to thank the great Lewis Carroll. P.S my favorite part was the chapter when Alice has tea with the mad batter and the mad hare and of course not the sleepy dormouse
