review/summary: Good storyreview/text: I read this (like many of the other classics that I got) because I had never read it before. The story was okay. I know that it is supposed to be a classic, but I found it to be very depressing. But, a lot of the stories written at that time were on the depressing side. I am glad that I read it, but probably would not read it again.
