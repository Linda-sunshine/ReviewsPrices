review/summary: Relevant Messagereview/text: Austin has created a user-friendly interpretation of the events and prophecies detailed in the Old Testament, weaving them together seamlessly in a format easily accessible to the 21st century reader. Her characters are believable and the dialogue is engaging. There are a few anachronisms (such as the use of post-Exilic terms "Abba" and "Rabbi" in a pre-Exilic setting) but they do not detract significantly from the verisimilitude of the period. The thing I most enjoyed about this story is the way Austin shows the relevance of the Old Testament to our own culture . . . we too engage in the sort of compromise and idolatry described by the prophets (especially Isaiah), and their message is one we need to hear more often. I found myself reexamining my own thoughts and actions after reading this book, but Austin's tone is never "preachy."
