review/summary: An old favoritereview/text: I remember first reading this book when I was in high school. The story of this girl fascinated me. I loved the language and emotion, and the beautiful picture of a life well lived that the author has managed to depict so carefully. As for this edition, there are a few errors, but the narration makes up for it. Even when I first read the book, I was not so completely immersed in the story as I was this time with the narration. I found myself not knowing what happened next, as excited to find out as the first time I'd read it. I have enjoyed every second spent reading and listening to this beautiful story.
