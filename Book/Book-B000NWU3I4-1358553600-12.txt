review/summary: Much better than the moviereview/text: Although one might consider it a children book, the mature mind can find lots of subtilities which may not be obvious for the young eye. Its value increses with age, this is why I believe it deserves to be read on both ages, child- and adulthood.The writting might be &#34;difficult&#34; for the picture-focused new society, but it is so elegant and I felt the hard work behind it. And this comes from an average english speaker.The story itself is captivating, and drives the reader into its flow.
