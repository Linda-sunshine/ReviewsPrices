review/summary: The Best ever madereview/text: This book has all I wanted to read. Great characters and perfect story in my opinion. There are many parts I love in this book, like the part from flies and spider(chapter 8). I definitively love how I can understand the book really well (I'm 11). This book has the perfect number of pages a person want to read. I really love everything but for the fact that Azog wasn't in the book but in the Lord Of The Rings Return Of The King Appendix A Durins Folk.If any person read this book age 9 or up, they definitely would love a book like this. I recommend this as one of the books to get and read plus watch the 3 part trilogy movie of Hobbit. My Rating is 10 out of 10.
