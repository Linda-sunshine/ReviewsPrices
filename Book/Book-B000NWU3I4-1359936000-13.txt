review/summary: A children's talereview/text: Since the modern movie remake, I felt I should revisit this story that I read when young. The story is as J.R.R. Tolkien said it was; a story for his grandchildren. It should be read by all who love the movies if for no other reason than a person should read the original source that started it all.
