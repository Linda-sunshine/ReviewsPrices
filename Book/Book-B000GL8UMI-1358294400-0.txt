review/summary: I'm a big fan of Bradburyreview/text: I think his writings are amazing. I know many differ on that opinion but I truly enjoy his works. 451 is my favorite of his writings. I think it is fascinating to see how much the time influenced him. How so many things you see in the movie are now in creation like the wall tv (our flat screen now). This book was required reading in my youth and I feel it should be required today as well. It's a view of a world which could easily occur if we allow our rights to be flushed basically. How we could easily fall into a dystopian world if we become complacent and lack knowledge. I highly recommend this book!
