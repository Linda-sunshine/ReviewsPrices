review/summary: not sure I would trust this sellerreview/text: We orderd a book from this seller and waited the 20 days they said it would take to deliver. After 23 days with no book I contacted the seller and they said they werent sure what was going on and could not even give me shipping information on the product. They did say they would expedite one out the next day but could not because of a negative review I gave them. They asked for me to remove review so they could ship the book, so I did, I emailed them to let them know that the review was removed and to ship out the book or just refund my money. I know they received the email because I got the confirmation the email was sent and opened. The next day I got an email saying I did not answer them and they would refund my money (which is what I wanted to begin with). This tells me they had no intention of sending this book which is why I would not buy from them again nor do I trust them.
