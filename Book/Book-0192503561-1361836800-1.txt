review/summary: Could be Austen's bestreview/text: Persuasion has been on my must-read list for a long time, ever since I read Sense and Sensibility and became an Austen fan. This edition is easy to read because the print is just the right size. The novel is one of if not her shortest and this version has very thing pages making the entire book weight nothing. I read it on my trip from the USA to the Caribbean and it is a page turner. I couldn't put it down even though I was tired and it was a night flight. The cover's very cute design is icing on the cake. It now occupies a space in my permanent library collection.
