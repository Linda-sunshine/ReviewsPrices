review/summary: Complex relationships with women makes this a somber talereview/text: Our hero, Jack Reacher, always treats women well, and author Lee Child writes strong women characters that often match our hero in intelligence and determination. For the first time Child presents us with a really nasty female. At the same time Reacher is shown sympathetically dealing with rape victims and their long term problems. The book has a claustrophobic feel, as it is set in the city, Reacher wrestles with the horrors of home ownership, a love that might lead to real commitment, and a &#34;locked room&#34; room puzzle of a mystery. One can hardly wait until Reacher is back on the road and far from New York.As always the language is what helps mesmerize readers. &#34;He killed the motor and heard nothing but fog hanging in the air and the crunch of boots on his driveway.&#34; Then the reader learns the physics of attacking with a bat, done with dispassionate seriousness that makes Reacher intellectually appealing while he beats bullies half to death.
