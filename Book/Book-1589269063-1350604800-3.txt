review/summary: learning my spouse's love languagereview/text: I've been married over 30 years and during that time I didn't know my wife's love language and she didn't know mine. Why did we wait so long to read this book? Since reading it, and talking about it - my love meter hovers between 3/4 and full tank. When I read the chapter describing my main love language, I started crying because I felt exactly like the people described in that chapter. My wife said she also cried when she read the chapter pertaining to her love language. We highly recommend this to others. Don't wait 30+ years into your marriage to read it, but if you do, it's still not too late.
