review/summary: Impressed in an unintended wayreview/text: The love story between Catherine and Heathcliff was largely unimpressive and exceedingly disappointing. I immensely suspect that confederates of Heathcliff have either not read the second half of the story or are ignorant to the terrors of domestic violence. Where the plot lays asunder, I'd remark that Bront's ability to truly abhor me in the chilling degradation of Heathcliff and the ghastly haunting story that ensues, greatly pulls together an all around unsettling finish to an otherwise unremarkable tale. Over all while I can only fault the book for the story, the writing was much to my liking and I may very well come back to it in later years with a different eye. I think it's worth venturing a read, but I'd say not to get your hopes up on everything everyone sells Heathcliff to be.
