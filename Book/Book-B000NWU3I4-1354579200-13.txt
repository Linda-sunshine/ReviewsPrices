review/summary: Beautifully Practical Editionreview/text: This has long been a favorite book of mine. These days, I mostly read Kindle books, but my oldest boy is about to turn 9 and he wanted to read the Hobbit before the new movies come out. We opted for a real book and I must say that this edition is exactly what I wanted. The book seems very well bound, the type set is crisp, and the jacket seems durable. It was cheap enough that I didn't mind giving it to a child knowing it might get destroyed (though he usually reads with us or has us read to him as Tolkien is a real challenge for him.) It is nice enough that he views the book as a prized possession worth caring for and keeping for years. I'm so glad I didn't cheap out and buy a trade paperback edition.
