review/summary: Picture of Dorian Grayreview/text: A change from Oscar Wilde witha touch of the fantasy and the pursuit of eternal youth. The character lack depth in description,but one always has the immagination. There is a homosexual relationship if one sees it and probably the reason for eternal beauty for strong relationships.Romatically macarbe!
