review/summary: A great classic personal development piecereview/text: I read this book as part of a professional and personal development reading list I received from a friend when I was starting my own business. It was a great read from front to back. Also just recently I saw a suggestion on a blog to read one chapter every day for the rest of you life. I don't know about the rest of my life, but I'll start rereading one chapter a day until I realize the principles are ingrained in my mind and actions.
