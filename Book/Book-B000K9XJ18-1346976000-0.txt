review/summary: Title of Book Could Apply to the Readerreview/text: While Jack Reacher always remains true to himself, in "Running Blind" he veers off course a bit, gviing the reader something else to think about...which, of course, sets the reader off on a "blind run".The opening is enough to get you to turn the pages rapidly and the overall storyline is as unconventional as Lee Child has been in a long time. Bottom line: a page turner with enough curves and blind spots to satisfy the most ardent Jack Reacher fan,,,you'll love it!!
