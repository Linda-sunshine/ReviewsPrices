review/summary: Christmas presentreview/text: I wanted to offer my older brother a nice gift, but was not sure what to get.Then, I saw this book, and remembered his love for real books. It's been a while since the last time he got a real nice book, so I figured out it was the good opportunity, as he likes reading J.R.R. Tolkien books.The book is really nice, the packet was perfect, really good quality.We missed the touch and the smell of real books those last years, and it's good to get back at it, especially with really good quality like this one.Enjoy your reading!
