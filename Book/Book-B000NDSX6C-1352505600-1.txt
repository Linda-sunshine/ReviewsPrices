review/summary: Gift Review on The Hobbit 1973 editionreview/text: I have read The Hobbit before and for the purposes of this review, will assume that either you have read it, or have gathered sufficient plot information from other, more detailed reviews. This particular edition has some lovely illustrations, some seem to be Tolkien's work and there are some others done in full color by other artists. The font is larger than is commonly used today, as is to be expected from a children's book. It would be easily read by young and old alike. The text is distanced from the edge of the pages somewhat by about an inch and a half which makes reading a bit awkward at times but is otherwise merely a matter of style. As for giving this as a gift I would recommend it to those that are probably over age 10, and with caution at that, as a younger sibling might take revenge on the older by destroying the book, which is rather nice. Preferably it would delight the heart of an older Tolkien fan, a teenager or older, One who would appreciate what it is. As far as for what occasion it could be given, telling you would be rather pompous of me. I myself have chosen it as an anniversary present.
