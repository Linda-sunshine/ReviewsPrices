review/summary: Mocking take on the ever relatable "me against the world" motifreview/text: A mocking take on the ever relatable "me against the world" motif, this novel held me in constant anticipation of what might go wrong next for its antihero of all antiheroes, the larger than life, always gassy, condescendingly intellectual Ignatius J. Reilly.I particularly enjoyed Reilly's ongoing writings: his book within the book and his correspondence with Myrna Minkoff, a far away partner in their own brand of civil disobedience. Within these passages, the protagonist seemed most comfortable, most himself.Though often exaggerated, Toole's depiction of the various people within New Orleans' society felt authentic to me, from bartenders and street vendors to factory workers and one factory owner / owner's wife. For the most part, I felt as if every interaction between these ancillary characters could just as easily occur today, giving the book a sense of timelessness within these capitalist times.Such a shame Toole took his own life at such a young age, I would've loved to read whatever he would've written next. Thank goodness his mother managed to find a set of eyeballs willing to give the manuscript a shot, and thank goodness for what's happened since.
