review/summary: Some interesting insightsreview/text: This book would be interesting for someone who is really into the psychology of going through trauma. It really analyses what people go through in their minds during trauma, especially during the Holocaust and concentration camps. It was interesting at times, but for me it was also very slow. It took me awhile to finish it, sometimes because it gave me a lot to think about and other times because it didn't quite hold my interest. It inspired me in many ways because it focused on how you can have an optimistic attitude during really tough times and that this attitude can help you find good in every situation. It is definitely deep and I am glad I read it, but not one of my favorites.
