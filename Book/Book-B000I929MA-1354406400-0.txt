review/summary: Did a friend a favorreview/text: The daughter of a good friend of mine had had no luck finding this book. Her mother is a non-computer person (I'm being kind!), so when I mentioned Amazon.com as a possible source, she had no idea what I was talking about. I told her never mind, I would try to find it. And, of course, I did. Amazon.com NEVER fails me! My friend's daughter was so pleased with her brand-new, mint condition copy, and her mother thinks I'm a miracle worker! Thanks, Amazon.com.
