review/summary: Brilliantreview/text: Just re-read this book for the second time. I love this book. I LOVE this book. This time around I really found that Lee was reminiscent of Mark Twain. It makes me think of growing up and summertimes in north west Florida.I'm bumping it up a star. It was a great reminder of what I started law school for.25 Jun 2009I shockingly had never read this before. I picked it up because it was recommened as so-called 'legal fiction', and while I probably would fail to categorize it that way, it's still an amazingly elegant and brilliant book.
