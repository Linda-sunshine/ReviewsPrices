review/summary: Classic. Must read (or listen)review/text: I used wispersync to read parts of the book on Kindle and listened to most of it with Audible. The story is well thought out. the characters are developed so well that you will feel that you know them all personally. It is probably the longest book I will ever read but it was worth the time and effort. I would recommend this book to students of business and those who love manufacturing. There was just enough drama and conflict between characters to keep my interest. It is not the kind of book that is hard to put down. It is the kind that you might read (or listen to) just to fill the time you have available.
