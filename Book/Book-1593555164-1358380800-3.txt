review/summary: good bookreview/text: this book ws well written. the only thing I did not like was there that it would draw out for a whole chapter. it needed to cut the pages from say 300 to 200. I would purchase another one when it comes out. If I had a choice of a John Grisham book and a Jack Reacher book, I would take John Grisham
