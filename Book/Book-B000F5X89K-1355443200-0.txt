review/summary: Fascinating Storyline, Ridiculous Charactersreview/text: Most movies are true to the basic storyline: A young scientiest, Victor, commits scientific hubris by creating a monster that would eventually murder all his loved ones. If you like horror, this wouldn't be so bad a premise, although the true message of the book seems to be more "take responsibility for your actions" rather than "ambition is evil", which Victor practically says in the end.The biggest problems I had about the book are the characters. It was almost ridiculous how one of them could have stopped what was happening or at the very least their own deaths - Henry might have come earlier, Justine needn't have given the necklace straight away to the authorities (if she'd lived there her whole life, shouldn't she have known how unfair they would be?), Elizabeth or Frankenstein's father would have noticed the string of unfortunate events and would have concluded that something very, very wrong was going on and ordered extra protection. Besides that, Victor tended to view them through rose-coloured glasses (understandably, I suppose), making them almost perfect in his eyes.How he introduced external pieces of information was a little hard to swallow, too. For example, Elizabeth's letter about Justine. The amount of story fixed to characters who don't really matter - such as Felix's family - is very trying. Maybe the author went on about them in length because she wanted to show how the monster could somehow talk like a Shakespearan actor; but no matter the way you look at it, it is a little ridiculous he managed to talk that way with just about a year's study, unless you accept the movie-verse information that it was more of the monster remembering than learning.Other than that, it was kind of interesting, though it would've been better if the characters were given more personality so the audience could care about them, too. It's worth reading, definitely; a tale of very serious consequences of an act not all too thought out.
