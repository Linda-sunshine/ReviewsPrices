review/summary: Books by Jo Rowlingreview/text: Jo Rowling is a wonderful person and her fingers tell us so. I admire her beginning with her pencil and reporters pad and endless cups of coffee,dragging baby Jessica to the cafe everyday to scratch a few more lines. The grind paid off Jo, I love you for it. I myself am attempting to put thoughts to paper. I am 78 years old and have been there and done it mostly. I have read your HP books 9 times and am about to embark on my 10 adventure. Whoever classed your books as Children's books obviously had not read them, they border on the classic's and are for everyone. Thank you again Jo. deepest regards to You your hubby ,Jessica , David and Mac.Peter
