review/summary: Little Wome (Kindle's Newest Format)review/text: A true classic. Had the hardcover when I was a kid. Was my mother's, sister's and my favorite. Brings back wonderful memories of my sister, mother and me reading it over and over. A cozy treat, especially on a cold winter's nite. Very heartwarming. Will always love this book!
