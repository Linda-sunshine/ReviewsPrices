review/summary: A great book for young readersreview/text: When i picked up this book I had just seen the movie. I can assure you that if you liked the movie you will love this book. If you have yet to see the movie (which is based off of the first third of the book) here is the main plot. Bilbo Baggins, a respectable hobbit, is visited by Gandalf, a wizard, and is asked to come on an adventure. Bilbo eventually agrees after several dwarfs come over to his hole for a party. He agrees to be there burglar for a fourteenth share of the treasure they are goin to reclaim from the evil dragon Smaug who killed Thorin's father and grandfather, making him the dwarf king. As they set out on there adventure they encounter many perils. Most notably and very importantly, while the rest of the group is held captive by goblins, Bilbo has an encounter with Gollum, a creature of unknown origin and is obsessed with his "precious" or the ring. Bilbo takes the ring, which turns out to be able to turn him invisible. To learn more about this tale, I'm afraid you will have to read this timeless classic for yourself.
