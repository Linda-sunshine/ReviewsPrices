review/summary: Can't put down bookreview/text: Jodi Picoult is a master story teller! She weaves characters together to hold your attention and you are never quite sure how it will turn out in any of her books. Keeping Faith is a wonderful story,and thought provoking for those who do not believe in a higher power. A must read.
