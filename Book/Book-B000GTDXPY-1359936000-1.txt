review/summary: Wonderful!review/text: Loved this book. A &#34;not regular&#34; type girl who wants the same thing in life that other girls want but things just don't work out like a fairy-tail. It is a great book to read, makes you laugh, makes you wonder, glad you read it at the end. Want more Calamity.
