review/summary: Excellent storyreview/text: Took a little while to grab my attention but once it did I was hooked. I usually only listen to audiobooks at work. I have a job in which I can listen while working but cannot read. Le Conte snagged me and on more than one occasion I had to listen on the way home in the car. Much different than the movie; better than the movie. If you have a large amount of time and want an adventure, then this book should be on your list. Predictable but also with lots of surprises.
