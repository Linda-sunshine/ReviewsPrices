review/summary: Imagine a world...review/text: ...where everyone is taken care of. Infants are never neglected, are always well fed, and are always raised by parents who want them. Old people are never neglected, not just taken care of but entertained and comforted in every way possible. People thrive in workplaces that they are well suited for, and no one is "better" than anyone else, all are healthy and thrive. Well, unless you don't "fit in"...This book really roped me in. It's easy to read and the characters make you want to root for them. It's hard to put down. I have just one complaint.WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. It should be a Kindle single. It only takes 3 hours or so to read in entirety. So then you download the second of the quartet (which is a whole different sort of reality, but characters are just as wonderful and the tale just as compelling) and that's another $7.51 or something. The last of the quartet is almost $10 because it's new. All four of them together can easily be read in a week even for slower readers, and it costs about $35.00.So I'm a little upset because I started 2 days ago with the first book and am 77% through the second already and really shouldn't spend so much money to finish the series, which I will surely do anyway within the next few days. I might suggest to others using Kindle that maybe they should wait until the whole quartet is available together at a reduced rate, because you will want the whole quartet anyway.
