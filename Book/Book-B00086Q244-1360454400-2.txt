review/summary: Essential lessonsreview/text: Carnegie's book is a classic for a reason. His advice and practices will seem like common sense when read but are so rarely practiced in every day life. This book is indispensable and should be a mandatory addition to every personal library. Do every graduating student you know (high school, college, grad school - doesn't matter) a favor and give him or her a copy of this book as a gift.
