review/summary: Pride and Prejudicereview/text: Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice is, in my opinion, one of her best works. It includes the story of a family who holds the possibility of falling into financial trouble. In order to maintain financial stability and remain in line with the standards of society, the daughters are pushed into marriage. This novel recurrently explores the theme of if one should marry for true love or if it is acceptable for the daughters to marry in order to fit in with society and attain financial security. Jane Austen does a great job expressing the ideals of her society in a creative and interesting manner through her novel.
