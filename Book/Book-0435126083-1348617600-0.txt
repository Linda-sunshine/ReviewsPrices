review/summary: Book better than movie!review/text: Read this book for book club. Bronte was sizzling. Really enjoyed the story. Heathcliff is a very dark and ruthless character and Bronte pulled no punches. The movie seems so tame now! Had to brush up on my vocabulary but thank goodness dictionary.com is part of the upload options. I am moving on to "Tess the U'bervilles" next!
