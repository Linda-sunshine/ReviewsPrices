review/summary: Frankensteinreview/text: Undoubtedly one of the most widely read horror classics ever penned, in my opnion the original Frankenstein still ranks as the ultimate Frankenstein in its sheer ability to inspire terror and strike fear into the reader's heart. An old print edition of the book I'd bought some years ago has traveled around with me, and has kept me entertained in planes, trains and hotel rooms. Its timeless appeal can be shown by the fact that it has been borrowed by more people than probably any other book I own.
