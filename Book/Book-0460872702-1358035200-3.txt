review/summary: wonderfully writtenreview/text: Having previously dismissed the GG as a pleasant but inconsequential and overrated book , without, of course, having read more than the beginning), I now take it all back. It is beautifully written, with a delicate, light, captivating and enchanting touch, much like Daisey's laugh. Hemmingway's remark that Fitzgerald wrote like the gossimer wings of a butterfly is completely accurate. Even the gritty and morally dissolute segments which provide a balance to the unreality of the upper class dream world of Gatsby, Daisy, and Tom are rendered vividly but lightly. The meaning of the novel is multifaceted as all truely great books are. Enjoy!
