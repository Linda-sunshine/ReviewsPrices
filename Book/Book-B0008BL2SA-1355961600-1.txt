review/summary: Classic!review/text: I hadn't read Little Women since I was in middle school so it was nice reading it as adult. I was planning a trip to Concord, MA so I wanted to read it prior to touring the actual Alcott house. I think I enjoyed it so much because of the combination of seeing the historic house and my perspective as an adult. It is a solid classic American story and if you have never read it, you should.
