review/summary: Austen in e-book form is greatreview/text: I loved reading Persuasion on my Kindle! So often when publishers print Jane Austen in book form it's on "old-timey" paper with tiny print, and it was really enjoyable to read her writing in clear e-ink. I read it much faster and very much enjoyed it.
