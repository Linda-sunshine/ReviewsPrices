review/summary: Page Turner, Better Than The Moviereview/text: This is one of Lee Child's best, so it's no wonder Cruise decided to do the movie. I recommend reading the book first, before seeing the movie. Jack Reacher is at his best. I'd rank some of the other Reacher books as 4 stars. If you are new to Reacher, then you are about to get hooked, so you may want to go back in time, and them in order. You can pick up the older books used on Amazon. Enjoy.
