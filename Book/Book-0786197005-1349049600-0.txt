review/summary: Dusting off the Sci-Fi Rosetta Stonereview/text: It may have been the pulp of its time, but you can see how it captured something special - not only of the broader genre, but of a very uniquely American spirit. It reminded my of all the great stories I read/were read to me when I was a kid, and I'm glad to now be rounding out my frame of reference with it!
