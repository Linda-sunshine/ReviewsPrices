review/summary: Classic Dumas, GREAT storyreview/text: Again, classic Alexandre Dumas and a great story. Oh, and it's free. What more need be said? It's still good reading, 30 years after I read it the first time. A new twist I appreciate now, that I didn't as a teen, was exactly how rich the Count was, and what it enabled him to do - interesting with recent economic/class comments and strife.
