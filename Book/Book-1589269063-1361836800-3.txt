review/summary: Good advice for those datingreview/text: I think people have a unrealistic view of how difficult TRUE relationships are. I would advise dating couples, and couples considering marriage to read this book early, to avoid trouble later. If your ready to die for the one you love, this book will strengthen your dedication.
