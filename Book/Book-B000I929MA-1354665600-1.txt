review/summary: Shocking read that makes you analyze eventsreview/text: This book knocked me off my feet. The horror that the world could turn into that in a blink of an eye. This book was written in the 1950s, but if the events of September 11 happened how it was "supposed" to go, we might be here. Who knows? The prologue was confusing, but otherwise I was captured by this book and its style. You have to keep up with it, but it isn't terribly difficult. This should be mandatory high school reading or college. (There are some curses and sexual suggestions.) As a woman, I am PROUD to say I make my own money, support myself and can make decisions. This book shows what prejudice and racism can lead to.
