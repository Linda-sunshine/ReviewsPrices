review/summary: Good novel, pleasantly surprisedreview/text: I figured this would be a mostly action based type of novel, but was pleasantly surprised at the cleverness of the detective work. The plot was a foregone conclusion mid way through, but the details Child included made the unraveling so much fun to read! Book reads like a movie, definitely. My only issues with the story are the cheeziness of Reacher/female romantic interactions and some of the ancillary characters lacked the depth one gets in the Bourne series. However, I'll definitely continue reading this series of books because of Reacher.. really cool character who is way too good of an assassin with the limited background information given. Hopefully Child expounds on this in his following novels.
