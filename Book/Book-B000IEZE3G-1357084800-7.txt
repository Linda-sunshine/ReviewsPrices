review/summary: A piece of art!review/text: I just finished reading this book and I have to say I am hooked! I LOVE it! Beautifully written and has a great plot and moral! It is really piece of art. Their were so many times when I just understood what the characters were going through. The plot of the story kept me at the edge of my seat waiting for what was going to happen and it wasn't something that was easily predictable.Would recommend for ages 9 (possibly 8) through adulthood.
