review/summary: Thought provoking readreview/text: Ray Bradbury's last published book is a great thought provoking fantasy. What if we lived in a world where books were considered dangerous contraband and firemen weren't hired to put out but to start fires? We're already starting to experience news in shorter segments and everything's being reduced to soundbites. Will our attention span start to deteriorate to the extent that it is normal to only be able to focus for a few short minutes?Guy Montag is one such fireman whose wife subconsciously tries to commit suicide, and who after meeting a young neighbor, Clarisse, starts to think and question the world in which he lives. When he starts to steal and hide books in the walls of his house, he meets an old professor with whom he tries to formulate a plan to change the ruling regime who instill the fear of books among the population. But someone knows about his secret and soon Guy is on the run as a fugitive.
