review/summary: Easily my most favorite book of ALL time!review/text: What do I even need to say about Jane Eyre? Anyone who has ever read it should be able to clearly notice it's underlying message about redemption and second chances. I personally love that Jane is not some beautiful, perfect heroine, but is flawed and considered &#34;plain&#34; by her peers. Her personality and attitude are what entices Mr. Rochester to fall in love with her, not what she looks like. Their love overcomes so many obstacles, it's ridiculous. I was forever changed by this book. Probably why my standard for a man was raised so high...lol! Anyway, read it! You'll love it!
