review/summary: Wuthering Heightsreview/text: Last read Wuthering Heights as a teenager, now at 69 enjoyed Bronte's classic even more. The depth of the characters and their interactions heightened my senses. Bronte's words were so descriptive they inspired me to continue on my journey through rereads.
