review/summary: I can see why film makers keep returning to this classic.review/text: Great story told in an ingenious way, diary (journal) entries, letters, captains log, newspaper cuttings and business transactions. Pity I already knew the plot, must have been terrifying when it first came out though. Also provides a snap shot of class and gender relations in Victorian Britain, which for all their horrors can't compete with the Count.
