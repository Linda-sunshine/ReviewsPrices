review/summary: I like this bookreview/text: I love Jane Austen's books and Pride and Prejudice was the firts one I read and I fell in love with it. So I wanted to have this one on my Kindle. I've bought my Kindle recently so i wanted to know how it will work. For me, everything is alright and Pride and Prejudice is a classic. I also own this book in hard cover. Plus, it's for free.
