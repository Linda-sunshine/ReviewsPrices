review/summary: Great book, shame about the movie!review/text: I was absolutely astounded when I read that Tom Cruise was to play the role of Jack Reacher in the tie-in movie version of this book.I have read all of Lee Child's books about Reacher. That six foot five inch not so handsome hunk who weighs 220 pounds.Why on earth would you put Tom Cruise in this role when he had to wear high heeled shoes when photographed next to both his former wives.Shame on you Lee for letting this happen.
