review/summary: Free!review/text: Free... You can't beat that! Works well on my iPad Kindle app. Plus the book is funny! I noticed that I loved every quote from Oscar Wilde I'd ever heard and wanted to know more of his works. A free introduction sounds too good to be true, it doesn't seem to be in this case! Enjoy!
