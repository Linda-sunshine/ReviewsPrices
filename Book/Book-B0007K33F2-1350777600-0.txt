review/summary: How can you go wrong?review/text: Beloved classic literature for $.99! I had already read the book at least 3 times over the last 55+ years, but I wanted it on my Kindle so that I could read a chapter or 2 between reading through other books in my library (Sort of a change of pace kind of thing). It's not like I don't know how it ends. I started reading it after knocking off 2 of Dean Koontz's "Odd Thomas" novels. Rather than starting the latest "O. T." thing, I started re-reading the "Count", and became too engrossed in it to go on to something else.What I like most about the Kindle edition is being able to get a dictionary definition of many of the archaic and out of use words that must have been commonly used in the 19th century.The use of the word "Illustrated" is a little misleading - I've read over hallf of the book and found only 1 small drawing of the publisher's logo at the top of the beginng page. However, this edition includes an excellent foreward with numerous links to Wikipedia, that gives the reader a sense of the times in which the story takes place. I suppose the foreward "illustrates" the history of France in those times.
