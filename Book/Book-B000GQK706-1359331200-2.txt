review/summary: Excelent editionreview/text: Very high quality presentation. The leather feel of the box and the cover of the book is very nice. The gold leaf pages look great as well. The maps, which are attached in the binding itself, are a bit difficult to open without damaging them. Other than that, the maps are large with rich color. There is enough extra paper around the perimeter of the maps that I am considering cutting them out of the binding. However, I have not done so yet. There is a section in the beginning of the book that explains the newly revised text. Unfortunately, I have not read any of the introductions nor any of novels in this particular book yet, as I am still in the process of finishing The Hobbit. All in all, a great purchase, considering the original list price was nearly 100 USD.
