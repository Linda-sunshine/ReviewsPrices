review/summary: Tolkieen's Hobbitreview/text: I like the book, it is easy to read and makes you feel that you are part of the story. It is much easier to read this copy compared to the earlier books of the Hobbit. The characters are always getting into something, and its fun to see what they got themselves into now.
