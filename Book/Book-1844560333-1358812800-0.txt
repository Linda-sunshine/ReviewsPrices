review/summary: Great Classicreview/text: Great story for anyone who has had to deal with the convoluted workings of a family. Meeting new people, making friends, or falling in love is never easy and it's made even more difficult by the human failing of not being able to be open and honest with others from the beginning of the new relationships. This book is more than a window to the past, it is a relevant look at how many relationships florish or fail in our own times.
