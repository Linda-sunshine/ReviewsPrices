review/summary: Required Reading (that I actually enjoyed)review/text: This novel is a timeless classic. Many people, including myself, are required to read this book in high school. I normally HATED all of the books that were required. I went in with this attitude when first reading the book, but I actually found it interesting. It introduces racism from that time period, through the eyes of a child. Because it was a little easier to read than most required books, I really enjoyed it. I even read this book a second time in the same year, which I never do, especially with required books. I came from a conservative home and this book brought to light some of the issues that even occur today with racism, just not as harsh. I believe the harshness of the book opens many people's eyes to what occurred during that time period. If I ever have the time to, I would read this book again and again.
