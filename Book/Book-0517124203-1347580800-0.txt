review/summary: 'Drink me.' Said the small bottle.review/text: This is more of a warning than anything else for the somewhat over excited fans.I bought this without a second thought, I like the publisher, and absolutely always will love the novel and poems in this book.However, THE BOOK IS TINY. I mean it fits in the palm of my hand. And being as jam packed as it is with wondrous things the print is quite small as well. So, simply, buyer beware of that fact that I over looked.
