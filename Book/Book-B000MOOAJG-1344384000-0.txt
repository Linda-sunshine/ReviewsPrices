review/summary: Very good novel.review/text: This is an excellent novel that I thought would take me forever to finish. Rather than weigh the reader down with obsessive amounts of detail Rand uses a perfect amount of information to tell her story. Although I personally do not agree with Objectivism, I found her novel very compelling and read for long stretches at a time. Her characters are very easy to picture, though can be hard to fully relate to.I recommend buying the e-book version. I have found that longer books are easier to read without the constant pressure to check how many pages you have left or carrying around a novel bigger than your head.
