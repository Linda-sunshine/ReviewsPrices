review/summary: An obvious First Attemptreview/text: A good story in its own right, it provides a bit of a backdrop and some foreshadowing to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, a much more &#34;mature&#34; story. The Hobbit is very obviously a first attempt at world-creating, and a bit &#34;juvenile;&#34; the subject matter is not childish per se, but the style of writing is a bit so, perhaps more suited to a fairy tale...perhaps that was his original intent?
