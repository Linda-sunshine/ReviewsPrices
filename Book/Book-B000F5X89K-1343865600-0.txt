review/summary: Far Removed from the Classic Filmreview/text: It was the discovery of Frankenstein that prompted meFrankenstein's Daemonto write a sequel to this revered classic. What revelations blossomed when I read the book. Who knew the monster could communicate so eloquently. Like many, my acquaintance with Victor Frankenstein's creation came from Hollywood. Mary Shelley's novel is far removed from those onscreen versions. Many books have been written on Frankenstein: its themes, its place in literature in the broad historical perspective. Literary commentary on Frankenstein seems to be born daily. I had somehow escaped the required reading of Frankenstein in my high school and college days and my sympathy for the monster was rather muted based on film. However, Shelley's novel gripped me from the beginning. Despite what may be taught in literature classes across the world, a few points about the novel struck me. Readers must remember that Shelley wrote the book based on a kind of parlor game. Was it a mark of her genius that she was able to abstract her concepts from essentially a "waking dream?" The themes gathered in this book, for the time, are truly remarkable. Also, who is the villian here, if one is needed at all? If there is one, the answer is not clear cut. You must read the novel yourself to make the determination. While Karloff elicites a bumbling sympathy for his monster, Shelley crafts a complex creature who feels pain acutely - so acutely that he displays a wide range of human characteristics. He is, after all, a thinking, feeling creation. Love, sympathy, betrayal, murder,and gothic elements that veer into melodrama populate Shelley's novel. However, it is a great work and one, perhaps, that does not need a sequel - unless the desire to learn the monster's fate is too strong.
