review/summary: Pride and Prejudicereview/text: Jane Austen had great sociological, cultural and anthropological insights at her time. However, most of her works sound quite applicable and reasonable today as well, so many years onwards, i.e. after her. Nonetheless, her literary talent and skill are still unsurpassed. This story in particular is told in a very intuitive and psychological way, being very personal and touching, at the same time. The author is constantly flowing in the realms of human mentality, feelings and emotions; whereas keeping very sound and practical judgments on the wide social world surrounding the protagonist. Overall, it is a lovely story involving a whole spectrum of human moods, feelings and conditions, such as: love, romance, grief, happiness, longing, desire, rivalry, remorse, achievement etc.
