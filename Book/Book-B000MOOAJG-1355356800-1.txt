review/summary: One of the Most Overrated Books of All Timereview/text: Don't get me wrong, I respect Atlas Shrugged for the moral and philosophical points that it brings up, but it doesn't work as well as an actual story. It's overlong, bloated and filled with incomprehensible dialogue that really takes me out of the world the author's trying to create. I like some of the dystopian art deco imagery but it all just feels like it would've worked better as a non-fiction with some characters to use as examples to drive the message than its own fictoinal entity.
