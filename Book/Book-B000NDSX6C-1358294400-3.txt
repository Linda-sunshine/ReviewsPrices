review/summary: Not crazy about fantasiesreview/text: Would not have read this if not for book group. (We invite the kids to our group in December, thus this choice.) Will never reread and have NO interest in Lord of the Rings after reading this because all those in the know say this is the most &#34;realistic&#34; of all the books by Tolkien. For years I felt guilty that I had not read this classic. It is just not the kind of story I can get into.All that said, I did read to the end and found parts very enjoyable. Was distressed that all the adventures and learnings by the Hobbit did not bring any change to those around him.
