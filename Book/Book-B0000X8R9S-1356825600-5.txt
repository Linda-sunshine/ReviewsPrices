review/summary: My 11 year old...review/text: son loves this book. He read it twice and did a book report on it atschool. Apparently, there are sequels to this and he is eager to getthem. I know bits and pieces of the story as my son would keep meupdated; usually when I am on the phone or trying to find out the endof movie I had been watching for 2 hours. It sounds like it has agood innocent plot with a possible bambi moment but I like that myson is reading this instead of asking for grand theft auto. I give it5 stars for the impact on my son. :)
