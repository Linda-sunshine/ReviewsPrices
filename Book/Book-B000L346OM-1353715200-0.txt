review/summary: Found my meaningreview/text: This book helped me to find my meaning or I should say my purpose of living. It's an awesome account of what concentration camp prisoners had to deal with but not solely geared toward that alone.There are comparisons on their life and a average person's life in which one can relate to his and the other, experiences.For the price even if you don't find anything you like about it, it wouldn't be something you regret but that's up to your discretion. I think it was a awesome book and I have referred some of my friends to it already.
