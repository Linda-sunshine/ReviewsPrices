review/summary: Not unabridged....review/text: I read "The Christmas Carol" in its original, unabridged text every Christmas season. Outstanding writing and word usage, to say the least. Moving descriptions within a theme that is, well, "the theme of our time". I unwrapped this CD eagerly and started the CD player. NOT unabridged, I quickly discovered...and much to my disappointment. I'll save it for my grandson as an early experience of this Dicken's work. The experience left me asking: how could they advertise thisd CD as "UNABRIDGED"? Does anyone have an answer to that? Please?
