review/summary: The Rarest Kind of Questreview/text: This unique novel by Tolkien is of a rare and respectable kind. It lacks the action that many quests today are expected to have, and the appearance of some kind of damsel in distress, but instead provides a deep plot with varying characters and an enormous setting that engages the imagination and fills the mind with wonder and even awe. This story could give enjoyment and interest to people young and old, and fills the thrill that any quest can give, as it did for me.
