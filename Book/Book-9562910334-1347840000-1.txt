review/summary: Dystopian Masterpiecereview/text: If you haven't read this superb novel you should, if you already have, you should read it again. There is much prescience in this book and in many ways it's more poignant today, than it was when it's first edition was immediately censored upon publication in 1949. Orwell writes with nourishing intensity rarely ever seen in other writers and his sentences are pregnant with meaning and depth. Orwell creates a believable dystopian world with pervasive micro video cameras and giant flat screen tv's that reminds us of the post 9-11 world we live in today, where there is little privacy and extensive spying on the citizenry by the government.
