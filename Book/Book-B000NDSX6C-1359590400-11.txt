review/summary: Great Story!review/text: A great book. I had read it years ago and now that as a retiree, I have some time on my hands to revisit some old friends. So, I returned to a faraway land to journey with companions of my youth. Tolkien really was/is a better writer than I remembered. I now plan on reading/rereading his other works.
