review/summary: I know is a classic, but not my stylereview/text: The book is slow, takes a lot of time in details that I supposed where very important for the time, but for me they are not. I just think if your are looking for historic novels you can find something better. If you're looking for a love story very romantic and classic, I supposed this is the right one; I have to say that all my girlfriends love it... so I supposed it can be very enjoyable for some kind of people, not for pragmatic people like me.
