review/summary: Love it!review/text: As a new parent I didn't have a clue how to get my baby to sleep and keep her that way. Her pediatrician recommended this book after seeing my bags under my eyes from lack of sleep. It took time to perfect the techniques but once I did she was sleeping through the night. I recommend it for all new parents out there without a clue.
