review/summary: Must read book, more relevent today than when it was first written!review/text: I could not believe the parallel of thought presented in this book written in 1957 had with the world we live in in 2013. I had been told to read this important work many years ago, just had so many other books I felt were higher priority at the time. Wish now I had read it in the '60's I would still have marveled at how the ideas still shape our world today.
