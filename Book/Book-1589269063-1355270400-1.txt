review/summary: Satisfying and helpfulreview/text: I've been wanting to read this book for quite some time, as I'm one of those people whose love language isn't obvious. The chapters on the five languages themselves were very satisfying and helpful (except for physical touch, which mentioned the obvious point that it isn't all sexual yet failed to really expand on that) and I walked away feeling much more certain. Some of the chapters afterward were helpful, but I didn't feel compelled to read them as in-depth. His approach isn't the end-all-be-all to a happy relationship, but I believe it's a huge part of it.Though Chapman writes the book from a Christian point of view and religion does play an appropriately heavy role, I would step out on a limb and recommend this book to non-Christians as well. The basic premise remains the same regardless of your faith or non-faith and it would be a shame to miss out on such an eye-opening concept just because of that.
