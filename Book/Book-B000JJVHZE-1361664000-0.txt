review/summary: Worth the Waitreview/text: I've been an avid reader for most of my 45ish years, and can't believe that it took a divorce (after 20 years of marriage) to get me to read this wonderful book. But the fact is that so many of the women I've been meeting mention this as one of their all-time favorites that I figured I should read it: also, it is a legal thriller of sorts, and I love legal thrillers. Well, I read it, and I loved it. The eyes of a child are the window through which we see the events unfold in this tale, and that child's viewpoint is honest, open, and innocent. The town comes alive, as do all of the characters, and you start to feel as though you're also part of the town. This novel will have you laughing, crying, and tug at your heart-strings. I no sooner put it down then started to reread the first chapter, this time picking up nuances I missed the first time.Truly a book whose hype exceeds its content.
