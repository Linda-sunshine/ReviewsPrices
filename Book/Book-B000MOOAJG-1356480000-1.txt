review/summary: I have read it twice!review/text: If I had read this book a few years ago, I would have thought the scenarios presented were impossible and completely off base. Now I view it as a most accurate prognostication of the inevitable end our fiscal and social policies are taking us and any nation that follows this path. Corruption, stupid political fear slogans, and many other means to confiscate the wealth and talent in the name of the collective. WE ARE BORG!
