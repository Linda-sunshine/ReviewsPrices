review/summary: Very addictingreview/text: The Giver documents a boy coming of the age where he will be told what he will do with his life. The leaders of this world watch the children as they grow, and decide for them what their lives will be. Personality traits still exist, levels of intelligence still exist, but things that are common to us--like colors, pain, and independence--do not. Sameness is the goal of the community, and everyone is treated the same, if you're too different, you might get `released'. Jonas is burdened with the career of Receiver of Memory. With new understanding of the world, Jonas has to decide whether to accept the disguised brutality of the community around him or to try to make a difference with his knowledge, though its might get himself `released'.The story is very moving, you really feel sorry for both Jonas and The Giver. It's also very addicting, and I had a hard time putting it down. I would recommend for preteens or teens around the 7th-9th grade area.
