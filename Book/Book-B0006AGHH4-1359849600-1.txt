review/summary: Uncle Tom's Cabin should be required reading.review/text: Our historical society is sponsoring a two year series on the Civil War in recognition of its 150th anniversary. We had an historical interpretor of Harriet Beecher Stowe and it was enlightening to read Uncle Tom's Cabin in conjunction with this commemoration. I'm sorry I haven't read the book previously.
