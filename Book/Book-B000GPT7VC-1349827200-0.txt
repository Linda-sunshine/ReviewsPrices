review/summary: Great theme and storyreview/text: Really enjoying what I have read so far. The dilemma set up is intriguing and I bet at the time was groundbreaking. The writing style is not particularly impressive, but I also have to say I'm no expert in that department. I've enjoyed books that most critics have said are 'poorly written' and not liked books who had the opposite reputation.
