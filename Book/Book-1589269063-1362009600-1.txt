review/summary: Intriguing, Wonderful, and a Great Book for a Long Lasting Relationshipreview/text: The man I am interested in (now boyfriend) recommended that I read this book. I've also heard it referenced several times on K love, I looked up info online, I've heard him in an interview, so I finally got the book. I have to say... I am impressed. I research love and relationships because the psychology of a long lasting marriage intrigues me. Point is.... My boyfriend and I have a great time filling each other's &#34;tanks&#34; and asking each other what we can do to fill it. I couldn't ask or pray for a better man. And I don't know how I do it but I fill his tank all the time and he is so appreciative! It doesn't even feel like work. I recommend this book to anyone who is in a relationship, single, divorced, etc. It's important to see what you're language is and what you need out of a relationship.
