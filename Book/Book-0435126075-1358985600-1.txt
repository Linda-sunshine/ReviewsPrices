review/summary: Le bookreview/text: Freaking awesome, but a little less romantic than I expected. It tends to focus on other people's affairs just as mush as the main characters, and at one point I skipped through some of that extra jazz. It makes for a good read though, and gives really good insight to how society was way beck when.
