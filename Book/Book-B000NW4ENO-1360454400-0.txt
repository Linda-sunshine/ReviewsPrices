review/summary: Gone With the Windreview/text: Gone With The Wind is one of my favorite books as well as a favorite movie. Margaret Mitchell has relayed thestory as though she was actually there. How does she know so many small details? Are they real or imaginary?Well, fiddle dee dee! They do seem real. This will be the 4th time that I have read the book. Saw the movieat age 14 on my first date. Cried and cried. And when we broke up that boyfriend told me that frankly, hedidn't give a damn.
