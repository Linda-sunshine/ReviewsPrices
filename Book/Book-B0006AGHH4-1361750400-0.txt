review/summary: A Must Readreview/text: Uncle Tom's Cabin was required reading when I was in high school about my junior year. Well, it seems I am getting around to catching up on my doing my homework some 51 years after the fact. I regret it has taken me so long to pick up a book that I would have thoroughly enjoyed. Ms. Stowe has a compelling story to tell of the period during slavery, and it brings to light the tragic abuses that went on at that time. This inhumanity to man I am glad we are beyond in our country, but then again look how long it has taken for us as a nation to mature to become a tolerant society. Oh yes, I am aware of what occurred at that time hearing and being exposed to slavery in movies and other readings. As I read about the key character, Uncle Tom I was pulling for him and hoping he would be able to reunite with his wife and family after their long separation. It just was not meant to be and his tragic ending. He was such a god fearing man and I hoped for such a better ending. The work of abolishing slavery by so many unsung heroes, I am so great full for their sacrifices and sensitivities.
