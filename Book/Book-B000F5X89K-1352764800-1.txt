review/summary: Strangereview/text: A book that I always wanted to read, I should have left it on the shelf gathering dust. A very lengthy Preface, the name Frankenstein was not used until late in the 3rd chapter. First 3 chapters were extremely difficult to follow. The author's style was a bit bizarre. I think I'll stick to the movie for this one. I'm hoping it gets better the further in I go. I'm amazed they were able to write a screenplay based on this book. WOW.
