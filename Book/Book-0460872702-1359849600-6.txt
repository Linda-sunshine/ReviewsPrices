review/summary: First time reading this book.review/text: I can't believe I haven't read this book before now. I was inspired by a trailer for the upcoming movie. While I enjoyed this book, the way it was written seemed like a rough draft. Maybe there are better copies? Either way I enjoyed it, I recommend it, and I look forward to the movie in May 2013.
