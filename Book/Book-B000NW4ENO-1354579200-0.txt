review/summary: Wowreview/text: I remember seeing this film about 40 years ago in Las Vegas. It was showing at the Las Vegas Cinerama next to the old Bonanza Hotel. It took me a couple weeks to read this book, but I really enjoyed it. Mitchell's depiction of the South after Civil War was very accurate as some of my family was from Arkansas and Mississippi so I have some idea of what that mindset was. This is a book that I will probably read i again sometime. I also found that ordering a used book through other dealers via Amazon was very effective and very easy. I will certainly use this service again.
