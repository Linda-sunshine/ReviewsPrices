review/summary: Ugh.review/text: Sorry , but I truly could not abide the narrator. Smarmy beyond tolerance. It the March girls were 5 or 6 years old I could perhaps understand the way their voices were characterized but considering they are teenagers.....well, intolerable. I really tried, but I could not listen for more than half an hour and then I was done. Too bad they didn't find a better narrator.
