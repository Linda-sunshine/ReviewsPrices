review/summary: Great Literature in a shiny new digital format you can put in your pocketreview/text: While "Pride and Prejudice" itself needs no review, since it's the best loved romance novel of all time, it's nice to have it available in a format my telephone based reader can handle. Now, even in the can, I'll never be without refined reading material!
