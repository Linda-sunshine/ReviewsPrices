review/summary: FAST-PACED DYSTOPIAN-FUTURISTIC NOVEL!review/text: First I am an adult that enjoys a good book no matter who it is written for. I enjoyed the "Hunger Games" series very much and watch for similar series that will catch my interest. This one did and I am now on the third installment, "Specials". This was originally planned as a three book series, but the popularity of it convinced the author to write a fourth book which I have already obtained for my pleasure after reading the "Specials".I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a fast-paced exciting read with well written but not preachy attitudes of how our past world (the world of today) wasted and destroyed our environment.I am not what one would call an environmentalist, but I do feel that we should use what we have without waste and plan for future needs. This story does bring some of this up in a fantastic story that moves along and keeps one glued to it to find out what will occur next. I hardly ever pay full price for a book and will get one at the library if at all possible, but I was unable to obtain the second of the series in any way but to purchase it. This in itself shows how much I wanted to continue reading. By the way there are NO VAMPIRES which is unusual in YA novels these days. Thank goodness for that! LOLMy recommendation: Obtain this series and enjoy!!!
