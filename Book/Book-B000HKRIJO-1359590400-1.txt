review/summary: Would recommend to anyonereview/text: Lewis is one of my favorite authors. I always get something from reading his books. A few years ago I was assigned &#34;The Screwtape Letters.&#34; I decided instead to purchase this complete book because there were more selections that I wanted to read. I read every book within this collection. They are presented in their entirety. I have returned to a few of the selections again and again. The book is the size of a textbook. It has a ribbon bookmark which is quite helpful. This is a book you do not let sit on the bookshelf. This book I would recommend to anyone. I was required to read a few of the selections for my studies in Christian Ministries, but I think C.S. Lewis could and should be read by everyone.
