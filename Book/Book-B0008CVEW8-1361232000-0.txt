review/summary: Truly a Classicreview/text: I've never actually read the story before. I have seen various versions of it on TV. One with Mr. Mcgoo. But I'm glad I finally read it. Many stories are written so that the reader knows the outcome half way through the book. But this story isn't one of those. There are so many twists and turns in the story, you don't know what's going to happen to Long John Silver until the end. Jim Hawkins is an amazing hero, and one of the big reasons this book is so special. If you like adventure stories, you'll love this one.
