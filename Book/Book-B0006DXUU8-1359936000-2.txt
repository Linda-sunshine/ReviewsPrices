review/summary: So Much Better Than Any Movie Treatmentreview/text: There is so much more to the story than any adaption can cover. To their credit: Alister Sim's version, Albert Finney's musical performance, and George C. Scott's performance are commendable (Bill Murray in Scrooged was humourous, but...). However, lIke any adaption they must edit for timing so I recommend a thourough reading and re-reading of A Christmas Carol.
