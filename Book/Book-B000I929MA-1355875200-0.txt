review/summary: Not sure why folks are so upset...review/text: This is about America being overrun by the &#34;Christian Taliban&#34;.People who want America to be a Theoacracy don't understand that this is a possible &#34;outcome&#34; of trying to run this country based on a set of rules that worked to keep a tribe of slaves under control 2300+ years ago over in the birthplace of civilization.There is nothing specifically wrong with the book, but it is confusing a bit at times the way it is written.This book does NOT deserve the negative press it receives.
