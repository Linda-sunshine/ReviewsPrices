review/summary: Fill each others tankreview/text: My sister had recommended this book to me. The counselor asked her to read while going to marriage counseling. It helped her understand her husband's way of saying I love you and her love language. It has helped my wife grow closer by speaking our love languages to each other. It may sound like a simple concept but we had missed it for so long. No matter what shape your marriage is in this book can help you improve it. However, like everything else you have to put the effort in it.
