review/summary: Beautiful On My Shelf or In My Handsreview/text: I'm a huge fan of LOTR and have various copies...I had to have this as a keepsake item more than anything. It's beautifully bound and looks fabulous on my bookshelf; also nice to have all three books in one place for reading (though it's heavy, of course). A perfect gift for any big LOTR fan.
