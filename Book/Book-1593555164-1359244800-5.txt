review/summary: Jack Reacher ONE SHOTreview/text: A very exciting and incredibly well written book on discovering the real idenity of the killer/killers. Did the story droll on, heck no!! You got a real page turner here, I couldn't stand to put it down! Now I must see the movie to see how Tom Cruise creates the character of Jack on the big screen. I love reading the books before seeing a movie!!
