review/summary: Wowreview/text: This makes me think how much they went through and still continued to share His word with all who was willing to listen.What an amazing true story. I have always thought of her as a hero. It is a book you do not want to miss. Read it and I am sure you will not be able to put it down and thank God for our freedom.
