review/summary: Serious help for figuring out the hidden linkage between faith and secular experiencereview/text: This is a tremendous book, very easy reading, but could be very deep, and could provide life changing experience. I, as a serious Christian, sometimes struggle with my faith and reality of the world. This book helped me tremendously to find the bridge between the two, so I experienced the great freedom!
