review/summary: Great bookreview/text: I am a first-time grandma. Dr. Karp gives you insight into why the baby needs the "4th Trimester" and a set of "tools" for how to re-create the conditions of the womb to calm and soothe the baby. It works like a charm and I am very much in demand as a baby-sitter!
