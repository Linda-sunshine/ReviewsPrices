review/summary: Sweet and Insigntfulreview/text: This book was so well written! It is the sweet- sometimes sad- story of a man and his life interwoven with scenes from heaven. The threads of this tale are masterfully woven together and gave me great appreciation for how my own story is woven together in ways I can't yet see. It's a fast read. And afternoon well spent.
