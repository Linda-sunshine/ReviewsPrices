review/summary: Great book in simple language and examples!review/text: Love this book! It reminds me how to have meaningful communication with my wife in a language that she understands.The idea may be simple. But when I read through it, some good examples illustrate the points in my simple language.Fully recommend it even if you have been married for many years.
