review/summary: The Greatest Political Novel of the Twentieth Centuryreview/text: George Orwell's "1984" is the greatest political novel of the Twentieth Century. Period.No other political novel in the last one hundred years has come close to having the impact and insights of this novel. The book introduced terms into the language that are still current usage, primarily the term "Big Brother" and the phrase "Big Brother is watching you."Orwell's description of the deliberate corruption of language by the Inner Party in his nightmare world, the concept that the shrinkage of language could be deliberately used to narrow the range of human thought, is reflected in today's stunted and idiotic American political discourse.The use of language by an all-powerful government to hide the truth and create a false reality in the world of 1984 resonates today in the use of terms designed not to illuminate, but obscure. Atomic bombs are "special weapons," civilians killed in air strikes are "collateral damage," and illegal invasions of other nations are "preventive interventions."But it is not just the insights Orwell had on the misuse of language, the abuse of surveillance technology (technology available today which he would have been scarcely able to imagine), and the power games of the great Twentieth Century superpowers (e.g., the "China card" played by the United States as between the Soviets and the Chinese), it is the sheer personalized terror of the dystopian world he created which gives his book power.As a personal note, I first read this novel when I was seventeen years old, a senior in high school, and I was shaken to my core by Orwell's frightenting vision. I have reread the book every three years, because I can always find another insight in it that applies to the current world.There are other great political novels of the Twentieth Century, for example, I would rank Arthur Koestler's "Darkness at Noon" as very close to (and in some ways similiar to) Orwell's great work. But no other political novel of the Twentieth Century has come anywhere near the insight, the impact, and the influence of the novel which Orwell first titled "The Last Man in Europe."
