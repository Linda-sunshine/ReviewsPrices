review/summary: A man before his timereview/text: He was an icon in France. He spent years there and the people loved him. His electricity demonstrations inspired many to pursue science. You have to admire someone who would board a leaky boat to cross the Atlantic in the winter to go to Amsterdam to get financial help for the revolution. The boat was way off course and sank in sight of land. He made it to the shores of Spain and since the last caravan had already left, he had to cross the Pyrenees Mountains by himself using a donkey. He made it to Amsterdam after a long journey to make his case for financial help. He wasn't a quitter. He started the American library system, fire department, postal system, etc. Inventor.
