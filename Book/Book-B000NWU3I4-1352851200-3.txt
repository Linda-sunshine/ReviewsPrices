review/summary: From a Tolkien Connoisseurreview/text: I have read every word published under Tolkien's name. i have seen every movie and documentary associated with his works. This book inspired it all, though. My mother first read it to me and my sister on a long car ride through California and I remember begging her to keep reading even though her throat got dry. I've read and re-read it, memorized the poems and riddles, and yes, I've already purchased my ticket for the new film coming out in December. This book, this delightful fairytale, is perfect for children starting around age six or so, and a must-read if you started with the Lord of the Rings films. But don't think that its deceptively light-hearted nature doesn't contain a thrilling adventure for adults of all ages! Be sure to look for the pearls of wisdom about friendship, loyalty, and honesty, applicable to anyone and everyone.
