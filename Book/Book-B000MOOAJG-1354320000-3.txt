review/summary: Unfortunately appropriate for our timesreview/text: I first read Atlas Shrugged as a high school student, in 1961. At the time I was trying to appear as a precocious intellectual, and (although I enjoyed the book) I thought that Ayn Rand was describing an unlikely society set in the future.Three years later I read it again while an engineering student at the University of California, Berkeley, amid a liberal majority, led by professors and teaching assistants who were still mourning Khruschev's condemnation of Stalin. I now thought that perhaps Rand was describing a potentially likely society.I read Atlas Shrugged this time in the gloaming of my life, with grandchildren and great grandchildren. I realize this time that Rand described a society that we have, in my lifetime, come close to realizing.Even in 1964 no one could believe that we would sometime have a president who proclaimed, "You did not build that!", who would bail out failing businesses on the backs of successful ones, who intentionally hindered functioning energy sources to favor non-performing ones, and would proclaim that the 50% who pay no income taxes are noble and good, while the 10% who pay 70% of income taxes are dirty dogs.There are a dozens of bumper sticker gems here:"To demand rewards for your virtue is selfish and immoral; it is your lack of virtue that transforms your demand into a moral right". She could be describing the 2012 presidential election campaign.Or:"Whatever the value involved, it is your lack of it that gives you a claim upon those who don't lack it."Or speaking of the state of American socialist public education:"Men would shudder...if they saw a mother bird plucking the feathers from the wings of her young, then pushing him out of the nest to struggle for survival -- yet that was what they did to their children."Regardless of your personal philosophy, this is a "must read" book. Unless you are one of the 50% riding in the wagon (as opposed to the 50% who are pulling it) you will agree.
