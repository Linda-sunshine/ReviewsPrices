review/summary: Well crafted, as usualreview/text: Fans of this series will enjoy this book. Grant provides the usual exposition for those who may not be familiar with the Reacher character. The plot is well crafted as usual and while it follows the pattern of having not much mystery, there's plenty of action, a little sex and a satisfying conclusion in which the villains get what's coming to them. The Reacher novels are fun to read and addictive, more violent than John D. McDonald's Travis McGee, or Parker's Spenser, but much influenced by both of them. An excellent Kindle choice for travelers.
