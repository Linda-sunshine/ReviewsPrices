review/summary: Excellent!review/text: This book was excellent. I've enjoyed all of her books, but his one kept my interest on the edge, and I didn't want to put it down. Putting children first in a divorce situation is definitely something all parents need to consider. You will stop and think while reading this riveting storyline.
