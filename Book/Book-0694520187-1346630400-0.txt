review/summary: Moby Dick; The White Whalereview/text: The book was exceptionally well written. Authors do not write in this fashion any more and our literary experiences are the worse for it. The narratives are colorful and richly descriptive. It is amazing to see some of the speech patterns and descriptions that were in use during the time period that I never would have thought would be used. One has a detailed narrative given in the story and the immagination is encouraged to build, if you will, the environment within the depths of the mind, picturing the quaint towns of seafaring folk; of a cannibal tattooed and speaking pidgen-english; of the salt-spray of the waters and pitching deck of a small (by today's standards) whaling boat; and the terror of the deep -- the great white whale.Moby Dick; the Great White Whale is well worth the time to read it. I encourage you to go a-whalin' with Melville today.
