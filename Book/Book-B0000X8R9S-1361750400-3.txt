review/summary: Very Interesting Bookreview/text: Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, is a survival book that I would recommend for ages 8 and up because some parts of the book can get a little gory. The main character of the book is Brian Robeson, an average kid with divorced parents and a secret. I would describe the plot as fast paced, exciting, mind blowing and surprising. Most of the setting of the book takes place in the Canadian wilderness.In my opinion, the conclusion of the book starts out very interesting and detailed. Gary Paulsen unexpectedly ends the book, in my opinion. This is a great book for everybody, especially if you love action and detail. I think what is unique about the book is the author's writing style and point of view. They're like a cross between a journal entry and a narrator. Over all, I thought Hatchet was a good book.
