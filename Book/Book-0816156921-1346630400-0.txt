review/summary: I shared this with a Cousera.com Classreview/text: I have just re-read Dracula, using a variety of different media including a hard cover book, paper back, audio versions (Robert Whifield's is the best in my humble opinion) and now this version. I read all of these versions because I'm taking a course from Coursera.com (which you might still be able to join, depending when you read this) on Fantasy and Science Fiction.This book includes seven maps and illustrations that are downright interesting. Everything is in the public domain, but it's great to have a well formatted book that I can use on the Kindle and make notes. Audio books are great, and it's possible to bookmark them if you have the right software, but there's nothing like a quick bookmark and the ability to search the text of a book when I'm studying to improve my writing skills.Well done formatting too!
