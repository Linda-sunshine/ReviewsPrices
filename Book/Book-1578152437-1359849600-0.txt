review/summary: Great writing but a cold, ugly and cruel world that I do not want to revisitreview/text: Of course I generally knew this story but I had actually never read Charles Dickens before. I guess it was time and I looked forward to reading this classic. I sure was disappointed because I hadn't realized how depressing it was. Dickens' England was not a kind and gentle place. It was cold and ugly and many people were very cruel. The story was sad and my heart went out to the poor orphan Oliver. But he was not the only one who lived a sad life. All the characters were caught up in a web of unpleasantness and cruelty was everywhere.O.K. Dickens is a fine writer and I understand how his works have met the test of time. But life is just too short for me to try to read any Dickens again.
