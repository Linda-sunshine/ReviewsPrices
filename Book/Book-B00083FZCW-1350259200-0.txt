review/summary: Angel Experimentreview/text: I would have liked a different ending. It was way too abrupt and left one wishing for more answers to unanswered questions. Left me wondering what the author was thinking when he ended the story the way he did. Wasn't happy at all with the way Mr. Patterson left it.
