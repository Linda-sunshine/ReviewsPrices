review/summary: Amy Kreview/text: "X" marks the spot, and if you are looking for a great adventure tale, look no further!In Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, we meet Jim Hawkins, a sheltered young man living in the18th century in a small European town, whose life will be forever changed once an old, high-strong seacaptain stumbles into his family's inn one night. After staying in the inn for weeks, the sea captain dies inthe inn's tavern, and Jim discovers a treasure map hidden away in the captain's treasure chest. Lookingfor an adventure, Jim decides to head out in search of the captain's fortune, assisted by Long John Silverhimself.As I read Treasure Island, I was captivated by the author's vivid descriptions of settings and characters.Stevenson used the element of flashback to tell the story. For example, the books opens with Jimrecalling, "Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full ofdangerous animals that hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange as ouractual adventures," which definitely gave the narration a more prevalent voice. As with most otheradventure novels, exploration is definitely a strong theme throughout the plot, however, not only isexploration of land important in Treasure Island, but also exploration of yourself and who you are.
