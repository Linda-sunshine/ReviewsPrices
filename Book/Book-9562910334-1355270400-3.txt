review/summary: 1984review/text: I read this book 50 years ago and decided I needed to renew my acquaintance with &#34;1984&#34;. I think it is apropos because the UN is considering a non-binding regulation of the internet and the prevalence of spying on citizens in many countries of the world, even in democratic countries. Consider Vic Toeves, Canada's Public Safety Minister, proposed bill C-30 which would have given the police and security officials more power to monitor internet and phone communication. I fully agree with the necessity to investigate crimes and particularly child pornography which is rampant on the internet, however the tools used to accomplish this monitoring must be very specific and not intrude on the majority of Canadians.Orwell, I think, hit the nail on the head. He had no idea of the technological advances of the 1990s and 2000s but he certainly knew the human mind. If you have not read 1984 give it a try.
