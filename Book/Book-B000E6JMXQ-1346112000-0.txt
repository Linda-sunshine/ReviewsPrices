review/summary: "Twenty-six miles across the sea, Santa Catalina is awaitin' for me." Song lyricsreview/text: In 1866, there are a number of sightings of an unexpected object in the ocean. Some of these sightings are far apart from one another. With no other logical answer, some fear that it might be a sea monster.An expedition is established under Captain Farragut, with the U.S. Naval frigate, Abraham Lincoln. They are firm in their resolve to find this monster.Professor Pierre Aronnax of the Museum of Paris had written articles about the phenomenon of a possible sea creature and he is asked to join the others, as is, his man, Conseil, and the Canadian harpooner, Ned Land.Once they are out to sea and have traveled far in their search, something is sighted. Ned, Pierre and Conseil take a small boat from the Abraham Lincoln with Ned's harpoon. Ned tries to harpoon the object but their boat is overturned and they are picked up by the submarine, the Nautilus under Captain Nemo.They are held in polite captivity as the Nautilus travels the world. Captain Nemo has constant proclamations of where they are and Pierre tells the reader the importance in history of what they are seeing, such as, a sunken ship with riches in it. The men are anxious to be free and have their escape at the earliest opportunity.The writing style is dry and without much emotional comment. The style is so different from much of today's literature that it is challenging to get into the story line and become involved with the story.It is interesting to see Jules Verne's ideas of deep sea diving equipment and his idea of 20,000 leagues under the sea-which is more than the circumference of the earth. It is also noteworthy to see where literature and adventure fiction has come to in the last one hundred years.
