review/summary: Cruise bad choice as Reacherreview/text: I read the book "One shot", and I wanted to see the movie for a comparison. I think that Cruise as the producer of the film, should have seen that casting himself as Jack Reacher just would not work.We who have read the book, know that Reacher is a huge man...6" 5" tall and weighing 250 pounds....come on Cruise as Reacher, that's too big a stretch. the book was an excellent read..I enjoyed it..the film was a re write of the book, using about 3/4 of the book material than condensing some of the book material...It was difficult to sit through the movie, because I kept thinking a muchbigger actor should have been used. I hope the Jack Reacher series will stay popular after seeing Cruise as Reacher...
