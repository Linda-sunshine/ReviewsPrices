review/summary: Treasure Islandreview/text: A tale as old as time. A book i first read as a child and imagined myself to be Jim Hawkins himself as the tale unfolded.As story that never grows old no matter how many times you read it and i reckon i must have just read it for the tenth time.I have seen all the T.V. shows and movies of this great adventure story and never tire of them. Be you young or old get this for a great read.Derek Cocking
