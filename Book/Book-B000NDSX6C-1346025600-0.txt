review/summary: A great read for everyonereview/text: I got hooked on this book last year when I read it, and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the lotr. I myself have never been a huge lotr fan, but I think that may change! This say this is a beautifully written classic, even after years of loving Harry Potter.
