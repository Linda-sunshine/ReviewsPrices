review/summary: Funny if you look at it the right wayreview/text: Moby Dick: or, the White Whale is one of the few American classic novels that I actually enjoyed reading. When it comes to classics, I usually enjoy European novels the most. Herman Melville writes with a dry sense of humor that I enjoy.
