review/summary: Good, but the next book gets betterreview/text: I enjoyed reading this book. I think it brings up a lot of great questions about how we perceive ourselves and others, and I liked the environmental ethics angle as well. Westerfeld did a nice job with the world building here. The whole concept of creating "pretties" completely freaked me out, and I felt a distinct sense of horror every time the characters spoke so casually of the horrific procedure that leads to becoming pretty.I did feel that some of the characters were a little flat throughout most of the book, especially Tally, but I did see growth there by the end of the book. For most of the book, I was more invested in the plot than the main character, which is unusual for me. Tally struck me as selfish, shallow and one dimensional, and I just couldn't make myself care what happened to her. It really bothered me that the most important thing in her world was getting this ridiculous surgery, so much so that she was willing to betray her only friend to get it. I was more invested in Shay, who seemed to have a lot more depth and frankly, a more appealing personality. By the end of the book, however, I noticed that I had started to identify with and care about Tally. She changed so much over the course of the book and I found myself hoping that she would be able to outrun the consequences of some of her bad choices.At the end of the day I thought this series had an amazing premise, but to me this book was good, not great. It was fun to read, and it was definitely a page-turner, but I didn't feel like it was the kind of book that I would still be thinking about weeks after finishing it. It was really the dramatic ending of the book that compelled me to give Pretties, the next book in the series, a shot. As you'll see when I post that review, I am so, so glad that I stuck with this series!
