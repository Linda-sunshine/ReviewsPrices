review/summary: Deeply Satisfyingreview/text: As a mystery novel, Lee Child's "One Shot" is deeply satisfying, a suspenseful and taut balancing act that is delightful to read.A sniper fires six shots into a crowd on a Friday afternoon, leaving five dead. Within a few hours, in a textbook case of police detective work, the suspect is apprehended, and because the evidence arrayed against him is so overwhelming is only a trial away from the electric chair. A casual acquaintance and former enemy Jack Reacher comes into town, and with a news anchor, a lawyer, a private detective, a former marine sharpshooter, and the accused's sister as unlikely allies uncovers a deep treacherous conspiracy.While the novel tries to be as tightly close-ended as possible there are invariably a lot of loose ends and questions unresolved. The conspiracy at the heart of the novel seems a bit far-fetched and overwrought, and you have to wonder why extraordinarily cautious, experienced, and intelligent men would go to such lengths to cover up what is ultimately a stupid and unnecessary crime.Nevertheless, this is an entertaining novel, and Jack Reacher a compelling hero.
