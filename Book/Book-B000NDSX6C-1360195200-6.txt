review/summary: Love the Hobbitreview/text: Everytime I read these stories I see something new and this story is no exception . Every word is woven into a picture and Tolkien tells it in the style of the days when stories were told instead of being written down. I reccomend these stories to any one who loves fantasy. My children are grown and have childre4n of thier own and still remember me reading this story to them and the Lord of The Ring set.
