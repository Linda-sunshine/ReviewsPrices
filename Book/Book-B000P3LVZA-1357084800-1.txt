review/summary: Thought Provoking but Lacking in Narrativereview/text: If you like a good novel that makes you think - pick up Brave New World! If you're looking for a satisfying narrative, you may want to look elsewhere. The first 3/4 of the book were interesting and well done, but the story rushed to a conclusion that didn't feel satisfactory in any way. Not that I need to have happy endings, but it felt rushed and incomplete..
