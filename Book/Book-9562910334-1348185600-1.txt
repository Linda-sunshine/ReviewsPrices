review/summary: Much Better the Second Timereview/text: My daughter was reading for school, and I picked it up again to assist her with writing about it. I remember reading this in high school, but it didn't make an impression on me at the time. Now I am 30 years older, and I REALLY enjoyed this book. Having seen the world a bit and watched the advent of the information explosion and how it has affected the way governments interact with their citizens, I find that we need to think about the themes that this classic brings up. Read it again. You will like it.
