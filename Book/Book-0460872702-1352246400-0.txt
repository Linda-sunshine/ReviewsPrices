review/summary: Why?review/text: I was not forced to read this in school. I choose to read it, and I am not entirely sold on the idea that this book is some kind of master work. Since I have to take some time to think about the book and characters, I suppose it is worthy of some praise but I do not know exactly what to say about the book. Questions left unanswered. No answers can be found.
