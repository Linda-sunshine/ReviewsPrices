review/summary: Interesting readreview/text: This book is perfect for new couples as well as long time married couples. It explores many depths and feelings. It really makes you think about what is important in a relationship and how to take full advantage of the tools you already posses. I would highly recommend reading this when there are doubts in a marriage. Great to have on hand to refer back to.
