review/summary: A classic of English literaturereview/text: "I hate him for himself, but despise him for the memories he revives."Published during the Great Famine, Wuthering Heights is considered by some to be the best book written in the English language. I haven't read the others, but it is definitely my favourite so far."I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth."
