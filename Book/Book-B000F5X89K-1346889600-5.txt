review/summary: Worst Book I have ever readreview/text: The worst Frankenstein movie is much better than this book. I realize that the prose is from the 1800's, but if anyone ever actually spoke or thought like the characters in this book they would be laughed at by everyone who heard them. Frankenstein creates an 8 foot monster and then, after bringing it to life, he totally abandons it and never sees it again for 2 years. Don't waste your time on this book - I can't believe I actually read the whole thing, but I kept thinking it must get better at some point.
