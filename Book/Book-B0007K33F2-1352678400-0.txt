review/summary: Suspenseful and Cleverreview/text: Before I started this book, I had planned to only read a few chapters before I prep for bed. A couple of odd hours and and twenty something chapters later, I was HOOKED. Dumas story-telling captivated my imagination and instantaneous I began a personal connection with the main character, Edmond. I grew wiser as he learned, and wept as he lost. This book is powerful and I recommend it to all who seeks knowledge!Aaron Le
