review/summary: Simply one of the best stories written in modern historyreview/text: Who has not seen Lord of the Rings? Have you read the books? They are much more detailed and had more deminision than in the Lord of the Rings movies. Can you imagine more and deeper deminision, how delicious, for these stories are a gift to the world. Stories so rich, so deep. The whole history of Tolkien leading up to this Lord of the Rings is mind numbing. If you have read and watched The Lord of the Rings to the point you are craving more go for"The Slimarillion" It gives the history since the beginning of time. Fantasitc. The quality of this particular set of Lord of the Rings is quit acceptable, nice slip cover. Nothing fancy here but good readible,sturdy copies that I feel you cannot beat for the money. I would have liked to have better quality copies of this triology but the price and availabity of quality copies is high and hard to find. Maybe someday, for now at least I have the books to enjly the stories.
