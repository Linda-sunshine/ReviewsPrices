review/summary: Beautiful, but choppyreview/text: Stoker starts off slow and smooth as an innocent protagonist travels to Dracula's castle. There's some creepy little details of foreshadowing. Of course, nearly every reader already knows Dracula's secret, but the creepy little details still work just fine. The slow pace of Harker's journey enables the author to build a wonderful, immersive stage setting in the Carpathian mountains. The creepiness mounts to outright horror as Harker learns the Count's secret and has dangerous encounters in the castle.Unfortunately, at this point, the book abruptly switches from rural gothic Carpathian countryside to Victorian England. I found this jarring. Also, the epistolary format does not really help, and sometimes interferes with the flow of the story.Eventually, though, Stoker rebuilds the terrifying atmosphere. He's good at it, too -- hints and clues of vampire activity building up to chases, ambushes, and fights. However, the final chase and fight just felt rushed.There's plenty to like here, including some qualities of vampires that were new to me. However, the abrupt transition after Harker's first journey plus the rushed denouement detracted a little.
