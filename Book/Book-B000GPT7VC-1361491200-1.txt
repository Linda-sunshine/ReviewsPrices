review/summary: A classic and always a classic!review/text: The book is fiction based on much fact of course but I found the author didn't have to magnify the difficulties (horror?) so many black people endured. And...there are good guys who are white and I'm sure it was the same back then. I just like to read books that continue their relevance and interest even 150 years later.
