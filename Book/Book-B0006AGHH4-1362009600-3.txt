review/summary: Unexpectedreview/text: Wow, I was so surprised by this book! All the things I'd heard about it over the years - nothing seemed to apply. The actual book itself is much more evangelistic than I expected. Uncle Tom is NOTHING like I thought he'd be. The writing is much more - idk, but it was better than I expected. She made almost all the characters sympathetic, played on the use of the omnicient narrator in such a way that sometimes it seemed she was telling secrets, other times teaching, and often just described the events and people, leaving it to you to decide what you thought. I really liked it and have recommended it to many of my friends. But yeah, totally not what I thought it would be.
