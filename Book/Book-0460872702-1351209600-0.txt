review/summary: Bought (again) the Great American Novelreview/text: I again bought copies of "Gatsby" at Amazon for my sister, an English teacher in a mission school in the jungle of Peru. She, like me, experienced this classic in our respective junior years at River View High School with Roberta Ashcraft, our Latin and English teacher. Mrs. Ashcraft was ahead of her time! Oddly, during the several years Sis did not teach at the school while home-schooling her own kids, her previous copies disappeared from the school, so perhaps not everyone agrees with the need to teach this work. You can say what you want, but this is still an example of the "Great American Novel;" I still teach part-time as a retired music education professor, and I expect my university students to know any incidental references to characters/situations in this work.
