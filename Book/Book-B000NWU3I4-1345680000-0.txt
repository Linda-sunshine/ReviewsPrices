review/summary: Memories in the making!review/text: With Peter Jackson's motion picture trilogy out this December, I thought I'd download the Kindle edition of The Hobbit and read it to my two young daughters beforehand. We are having lots of fun and they are excited to read with me every night! Great memories in the making! Thanks!
