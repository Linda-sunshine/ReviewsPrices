review/summary: Disappointing Dystopiareview/text: I'll start off this review by saying I love reading dystopian novels. I also don't mind stream of consciousness writing, which is the style used in this book. However, while Atwood had a very good concept for a novel, it was poorly, poorly executed. In this American future, society has been based around the Bible story in which a handmaid is impregnated by a husband whose wife cannot conceive. Every woman in this new society has a very specific role, and none of it is very interesting. Thus, following our protagonist Offred, a handmaid, through her relatively boring life becomes excruciatingly painful in its banality. Offred's continuous bounce back and forth from reality to her memories make for a very confusing read with a lot of attempts at insightful prose. There is so much fluff and so little plot line in this novel, that about halfway through I began skipping all her recollections and half-page long descriptions of the garden just get to the meat of the story. It was passages like this that made me want to shake Offred:"The Commander is the head of the household. The house is what he holds. To have and told hold, till death do us part. The hold of a ship. Hollow."And also a lot of:"Here's what I like to tell.""This is the story then.""Here is how it goes."Not to mention an entire passage about her encounter character, just to have her say, "I made that up. It didn't happen that way. Here is what happened," and the whole situation is repeated again.Sadly, I really, really wanted to like this book. I'd heard so many great things about it, but in the end, between the author's choppy prose, no explanation of how society could go from normal to extreme without any opposition, and a completely unsatisfying ending, I could not convince myself to like something this terrible.
