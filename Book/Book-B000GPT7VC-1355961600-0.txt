review/summary: A classical must readreview/text: I am surpised I didn't read this book years ago. Harriet Beecher Stower demonstrated uncommon courage in writing such a novel challenging the institution of slavery during her day. Sometimes I thought the characters seemed very real but at other times they were a bit too over drawn, (Tom was too good, and the little girl much too angelic to be real). However, overall, I thought it was a good read. Some people might think it too moralistic, however.
