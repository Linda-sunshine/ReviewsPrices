review/summary: Colorado Kidreview/text: This is a good read especially if you're following the TV show, "Haven", which is supposedly based on this novel. While I realize the TV show is based on the writer's idea of what might have followed this book, I think the TV show has gone too far in interpreting the results of the book.
