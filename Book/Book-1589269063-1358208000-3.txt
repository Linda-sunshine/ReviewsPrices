review/summary: A Great Eye Openerreview/text: A great book to understand the reasoning behind the difficulties we face in marriage or a relationship. Some people do not recognize the cause of the difficulty. Others do and tend to ignore them. This is an upfront explanation of how we react to other peoples actions, namely our spouses or significant other, or choice not to react. A good read!
