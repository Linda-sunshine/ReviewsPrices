review/summary: Just an amazing topicreview/text: The book takes a a little while to explore the 5r Love Languages, which we all have at least one primary one; 1) Acts of Service, 2) Words of Affirmation, 3) Quality Time, 4) Gift Giving, 5) Physical Touch and Closeness, but is an entertaining read. The message though, is amazing.As an example; I thought my wife's love language was Acts of Service so I would constantly be up and doing stuff around the house for her. Sure she appreciated that, but what she wanted first was quality time over coffee, etc. Just learning what speaks to each other the most is extremely effective in improving the marriage relationship.There is no weird "psycho babble" here. I strongly recommend this book.
