review/summary: Gripping Story!review/text: This is a GREAT book with a gripping story; it's beautifully written and full of suspense. You don't have to be a fan of the Old Testament to enjoy this novel, but if you like historical fiction of any type, I highly recommend it. The characterizations are spot-on, the scenery and historical details are vivid and believable, and the story unfolds like a suspense thriller. You literally cannot wait to find out what happens next!I originally downloaded this eBook with some trepidation because it was a free kindle download and let's be honest, there are a lot of lousy free eBooks out right now. But the publisher's marketing ploy worked, because I loved Gods & Kings so much that I've now purchased the next two novels in the series and I've already finished the second one. Now on to the third! Consider me a loyal fan of Lynn Austin. She's a terrific writer and a great storyteller. I'm eager to start reading all of her other novels.Sharilyn Miller, author of the Arty Jewelry series
