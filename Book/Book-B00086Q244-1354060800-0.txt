review/summary: Recommended by Warren Buffet!review/text: I purchased this after watching a documentary on Warren Buffet. Turns out that Warren Buffet was having a hard time selling his ideas to people in his early 20s. He bought this exact book to learn how to... well... win friends and influence people. 10 years later he was a billionaire.I'm no billionaire, and I can guarantee I never will be, but I found this book useful.It basically tells you how to reshape your frame of reference, paradigm, or whatever you want to call it. While telling entertaining anecdotes (as Dale Carnegie always does), and learning about a bygone era (it was written in 1938), you obtain a clear path to reinventing how you see and interact with people.
