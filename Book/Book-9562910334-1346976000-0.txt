review/summary: It's still 1984.review/text: It's still 1984 today. Look around you, friends. You go to the doctor and instead of receiving the kind of care that is best for you, you receive the care that the doctor's peers have agreed on will be least likely to get them sued. Even though the care is substandard and may even be quite harmful, your welfare is not as important as their standard of care. This same kind of thinking is seen everywhere. Big brother is indeed watching you.
