review/summary: Old Schoolreview/text: I have loved this book since I was a little girl. My favorite character will always be Jo March. As you read you can just visualize her strong will. I cried when she didn't marry Larie, but she truly loved the professor. The book reminds me of growing up and the relationship with my sisters. A must read!
