review/summary: Enjoyable Readreview/text: I have now read 4 of the Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child. This is the one that I enjoyed the most. The plot was cleverly laid out and the amount of research that went into it must have been considerable.This made for a very good read and despite working a 12 hour day i managed to read the novel over a 4 day period. The only down side now is that having read 3 others before the movie was released I find it hard to visualise Tom Cruise in the leading role as each book describes Reacher in detail as a 6 foot 5 inch giant.Having said that I will go to see the movie.
