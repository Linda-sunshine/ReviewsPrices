review/summary: Alice in Wonderlandreview/text: This was really interesting. There was a lot more in common with the Disney movie than i anticipated, though there are differences. I think it's a bit more clear as the story progresses that this is a dream. A rather fantastical dream. Some thing from the Disney feature are missing as well. You should follow up with Through the Looking Glass for a deeper look into Alices dream world.
