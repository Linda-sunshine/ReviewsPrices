review/summary: Intriguing storyreview/text: This book was extremely intriguing. It really kept my interest. I learned about the author on the Oprah show and couldn't move from the tv watching the interview about his life. This is actually the first book I've ever be able to read as I have a terrible reading concentration problem. So thankful to have learned about his life.
