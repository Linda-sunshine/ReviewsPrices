review/summary: Good Readreview/text: I have only been married for 3 years, no serious problems in the relationship at all. I found this book helpful and will be passing it on to many family members (who also don't seem to have any love/marriage issues). It is just a good read to learn more about yourself and your partner and to help guarntee that you will continue to have a marriage full of Love.
