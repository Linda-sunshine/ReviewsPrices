review/summary: Great Adult Fantasyreview/text: I'm the wife. I bought the book for my husband and myself. My husband bought a copy and read it many years ago, but we lost it. He loves the story and is reading it now. I read it first. I'm a teacher's aide, and will be reading it with students soon. I also wanted to read it before we see the movie, which comes out soon.
