review/summary: Not What I Expectedreview/text: This book was surprisingly funny, but I went into not really knowing what to expect beyond that it's a "classic". The plot revolves around the rise of a young man, Pip, in society due to a mysterious benefactor. The subplot of Miss Havisham in her lonely house is creepy and introduces us to Estella, the love interest of Pip. At times the writing felt antiquated and I had to reread some passages to get the gist of the meaning, but it was fun to feel sort of challenged as a reader.
