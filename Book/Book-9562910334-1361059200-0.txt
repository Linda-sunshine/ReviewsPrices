review/summary: A must read for our timereview/text: &#8220;1984&#8221; by George Orwell is a dark prophetic look at the life of Winston Smith, the protagonist of the story, who lives under the rule of Big Brother who is the figurehead of the Party, the evil totalitarian government of Oceana. The story is told from Winston&#8217;s perspective as he falls in love with Julia, which is forbidden as all devotion must be reserved to the Party. He also has an unusually warm relationship with an Inner Party member by the name of O&#8217;Brien who turns out to be Winston&#8217;s ultimate antagonist as he represents the Party in his every action. The reason that this book is such a timely piece of literature for today is that the world around us is going through dramatic changes in its structure. None of us could know where this cycle will lead, but Orwell provides us with a nightmare of where the tide of history and government could come to rest and how an average man may live and feel under such conditions.While this does not naturally appear as a love story, it does actually take an important look at a dark side of love and devotion. The Party demands more than absolute obedience; it demands the love of every subject. Even to the degree that no other love interest can be maintained. It is a very religious theme, similar to what you might hear during a Sunday morning sermon or straight from the Bible, &#8220;Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me [Jesus] is not worthy of Me&#8221; (Matthew 10:37, New International Version). Winston&#8217;s love for Julia is ultimately the reason that Winston is tortured mercilessly and his love for her is what is used to finally break his will at the climax of his incarceration in the Ministry of Love.Winston also maintains a curious relationship with the stories antagonist, O&#8217;Brien, throughout the story. Early in the story, the two of them share a glance which indicates to Winston that they have similar interests regarding the overthrow of the current system. As it turns out, O&#8217;Brien has been working throughout the book to entrap him and presumably anyone else who might be caught up in ideas of overthrow. He is ultimately Winston&#8217;s interrogator, torturer and re-educator. However, even as he is being horribly tortured, Winston continues to hold a very high regard for O&#8217;Brien as he notes, &#8220;The peculiar reverence for O&#8217;Brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy, flooded Winston&#8217;s hear again&#8221; (Orwell, 1949, p. 225). Winston would go on to betray Julia, but would never lose his admiration for O&#8217;Brien.Orwell&#8217;s story takes the idea of &#8220;big government&#8221; to its most extreme conclusion. The story is particularly timely in a day when our own nation has clearly voted in recent months for a larger, more intrusive federal government. America has shifted over the years from larger to smaller, less regulated government and back again throughout our history. However, it is interesting that Orwell gives an idea of how one party was able to stop the pendulum from swinging by ensuring that average people were stopped from obtaining wealth. Orwell (1949) uses the following passage to describe the process used to obtain total control of the society: &#8220;It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste&#8230;In the long run, a hierarchal society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance&#8221; (p. 156).In the end, Winston is a beaten man who has failed to stand up to the power of Big Brother in any way. His character represents the limitations of the individual against an all powerful government. His mind is coerced and his love confused. The Party has done with him as it has with all others and will continue to do. And the story concludes with no hope for a positive resolution. This is a story which should be read by everyone to ensure an understanding of the evil capable of a powerful government.REFERENCE:Orwell, G.
