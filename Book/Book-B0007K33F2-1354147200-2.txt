review/summary: Count of Monte Cristoreview/text: Since I was a child, I've heard of "The Count of Monte Cristo" but as I grew into my teens and became an avid reader, I never gave a thought to reading it. For some reason (perhaps because the name was familiar to me from childhood), I saw it as a young readers book. Now, at the wise? old age of 69, my daughter, who is also an avid reader, suggested that I read it. She claimed it was one of the best books she's read. Normally, we have the same taste in literature. My daughter has read most of the "classics" and read the majority of them one after the other several years ago.After reading several pages, I gave up on it. While it is a fine work of literature for sure, I found a lot of the descriptive paragraphs to be repetitive and interrupted the flow of the story. Another issue for me personally was the amount of French content which I realize, is no fault of the author but a fault of my own for not knowing how to pronounce the French names, places, references etc.Another reason I gave it up was that while I found it to be a very cleverly written book, to me it was a childish/simplistic storyline.If it had been a smaller book (it's huge), I probably would have persevered.
