review/summary: A Classic Actreview/text: This classic novel was totally enjoyable! Although I have seen and loved several movie versions of the story, I had not read the novel since I was a young schoolgirl. Having watched my favorite version of the movie, I got the bug to reread the book, so I ordered the Kindle edition. It was wonderful! The illustrations were beautifully done, and the book was a fun and quick read. It doesn't get much better than this - a Christmas classic, which takes only a short time to read, added to my enjoyment of the holiday season. Five stars for this classic!
