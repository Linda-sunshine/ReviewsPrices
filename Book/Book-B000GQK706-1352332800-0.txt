review/summary: One Volume was convenient, arrived fast and in good conditionreview/text: This book was purchased for a grandchild for required reading for his high school class. He is required to make annotations in the book which the instructor reviews. This was all in one volume making it convenient to use. It wasn't too large, too heavy or cumbersome. It arrived quickly, as scheduled, in time for his class, and in excellent condition.
