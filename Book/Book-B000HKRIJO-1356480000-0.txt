review/summary: WONDERFUL book/coverreview/text: This book was so wonderful that I purchased one ...looked at it...and then ordered yet another for our pastor! There are so many quotes and Christian perspectives in C.S. Lewis's writings! This holds all the stories that I wanted! I LOVED IT! IT was much larger than I thought it would be; the quality of the binding / cover was gorgeous and it was a gift I was glad I had purchased. Thinking of ordering yet another for myself!! You can't go wrong with this book if you like C.S. Lewis!!
