review/summary: It is easy to see why this is a classic.review/text: What can I say that you don't already know about this book. It lives up to its reputation as classic, high fantasy complete with all the trolls, goblins, elves, dwarves, dragons, and of course hobbits that could possibly fit into one volume. Good for just about any age, I read it for the first time when I was 9 or 10, and have enjoyed it throughout the years and still enjoyed it on this last read through. Some things seem new every time I read through it. If you like fantasy or magic, this is a must read.
