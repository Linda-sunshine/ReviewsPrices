review/summary: Great Readreview/text: I wanted to read this book before I see the movie and had no problem reading it it 3 days. I sprang for the narration and I highly recommend you do the same, it was absolutely captivating. Now I am ready to dig into the whole series. No other book held my interest quite like this one did an I normally don't like fantasy stories. Read On!
