review/summary: Pride and Prejudicereview/text: The book was written more than 50 years ago, but can still be like today. Pride can get in the way of almost anything, and so can being prejudice. The modern spin is called Prom and Prejudice. The people changed to fit the time, but not the message. It is a wonderful book worth reading.
