review/summary: No need for a reviewreview/text: This timeless story requres nothing else from me, other than to say that the images it invokes in the reader's mind cannot be portrayed on the silver screen, regardless of the talents of Hollywood's finest. I actually do not plan to see the movie because it could only disappoint.
