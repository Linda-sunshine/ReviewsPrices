review/summary: One of Oscar Wilde's Best Playsreview/text: I have a passion for theatre (and also amateur performer) and I must admit that Oscar Wilde is oneof my favorite writers. And I confirm this feeling with this play I really loved. It's funny to noticethat the play is already 100 years old and still seems like it has been written a few days ago.The style of the dialogues is pitch-perfect. I've never found such a mastery in Wilde's dialoguesin his other plays, maybe except in Salome. It is quite easy to read, and absolutely hilarious fromthe beginning to the end. The author shows with a great sense of humour through a smart use of wordsthe triviality of social conventions during the Victorian period. The irony is often present, as wellas the twists and turns.Maybe can I only regret it was quite short, and I would have appreciated to be immersed a little bit longerin this delightful atmosphere. I really recommend this play for all ages. In particular if you have neverread any play before,this one may definitely convert you to become a theatre lover.
