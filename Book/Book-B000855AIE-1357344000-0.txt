review/summary: Well worth reading and rereadingreview/text: This book is my bible. It was given to me by my father when I was 16 years old. I had no idea of the meaning of the book until I was 35 years old although I had tried to read it numerous times over the years. It is a most positve way of living your life. Although it was writen over a hundred years ago it is timeless.
