review/summary: Gothic and beautifully writtenreview/text: Beautifully written in 19th century prose--atmospheric, gothic and creepy. This is the original--All the lore of the vampires is in this book: the effect of sacred relics and symbols, garlic flowers, the ability to change shape to wolf or bat (but only at certain times of the day or night), how to kill a vampire, mirrors, flowing water, mist.... The book is written in the form of diary entries and letters from the viewpoints of all the main characters. There is a wonderful suspense as the character of Dracula is revealed; first as an old man, then becoming younger as he feeds on his victims. He is Nosferatu: Undead. I loved it!
