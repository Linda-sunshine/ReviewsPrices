review/summary: it stays with youreview/text: I believe that are very few books that touch our lives books that stay with you for the rest of your life even though it been years since book have read the book. I read the in sixth grade it opened my eyes to a new way to look at the world. This book to me shows that there is no perfect world that something is always missing and we should never let go of our emotions good and bad ones. They are what make us human. This book often comes to my mind when my life is going the way I want it to. It reminds me that that we as humans aren't perfect and we must be careful and grateful for live we live. The world is changing I am not sure where its headed bad or good but this book has given me hope and taught me to be grateful for everything.
