review/summary: You Don't Want To Miss This Adventure!review/text: Tolkien is a masterful story teller. I chose to read it for the first time before the movie comes out next week, and I am so glad I did. Loved the introduction to Gollum, and another look at Gandalf is always an adventure. Thorin Oakenshield is a whole 'nother level dwarf, and Bilbo Baggins is simply charming.I gave it 5 stars because that's all they allow. :)
