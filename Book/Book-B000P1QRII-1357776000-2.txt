review/summary: I had never read this in high schoolreview/text: BUT I wish I had. This was a great book and such a great idea of how to describe a dystopian society. To imagine that certain talents that a child has, which is only one talent, is a job for the rest of your life. But to not have any emotions or feelings and learning how to manage that and what to do with it given you can feel has been written incredibly in this book. Love it and would recommend to others. I recommended it a friend who continued to not want to read it but when she did, she could not put it down and wanted to read the rest of the quartet!
