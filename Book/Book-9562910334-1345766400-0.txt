review/summary: A Solid Bookreview/text: I have been reading this book over the last week. I am currently 88% finished according to my kindle. As was stated in a previous review I have read on this version (the 99 cent kindle version) there are several errors. While it is slightly annoying that the version does tend to combine words, aka leave out some spaces between words, it is definitely readable. Since this book was a mere 99 cents I have no problem in forgetting these errors. It is a great book riddled with thought provoking passages and is a must read for anyone. I would consider it one of the better deals I have gotten in my life; fully worth the dollar I spent on it. Although I believe that the errors could be corrected (easily) by amazon, I wouldn't ruminate on that fallacy for a moment. This book is definitely a buy. I would be willing to spend at least 10 dollars on it, errors or not.
