review/summary: The literary equivalent of a turd in the punch-bowlreview/text: I simply cannot understand how people can take such juvenile rantings seriously. I really do wish the moochers who call themselves "capitalists" would go Galt all the way.They'd be eaten by bears.Seriously, a 64 page speech at the end? Galt = Castro.One can only imagine the PowerPoint version of Atlas Shrugged. It is one book THAT DESERVES to be made into a Really Bad PowerPoint version.Rand's "philosophy" is idiocy, by the way. Go read some real philosphers instead of this garbage.
