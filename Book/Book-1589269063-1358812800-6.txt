review/summary: A marriage strategy that is worth consideringreview/text: I have often wondered what it is that punches my wife's buttons but so far that has remained elusive. I thought there was no harm in reading this book to derive some insights that I could potentially harness. I think the philosophy articulated in this book is certainly rational and logical and it struck a chord with me. I only wish that I had read it a number of years ago. Perhaps I would have been a far better husband?The five languages is a simple and easy book to read and one that has armed me with a strategy that I can try to help resolve differences between my partner and I. While it is not a guarantee to keeping any relationship going, it at least provides a tool to help others help themselves. The questionnaire in the back of the book will enable you to determine what your primary and secondary love language is. In addition the book provides a number of FAQ, which help reinforce the books key messages. I would recommend this book to others even if their marriage was not in trouble. In this case I would classify this as a risk mitigation strategy.
