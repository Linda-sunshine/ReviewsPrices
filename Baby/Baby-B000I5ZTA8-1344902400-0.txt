review/summary: Best purchase I've made during pregnancy!review/text: I already had chronic back pain issues, but this has helped SO much. I have used it from the beginning of my pregnancy and continue to use it every day (I'm 6 months now). I weighed about 141 at the start of my pregnancy, and a medium fit me on the tighest setting. The latches are spaced out a little too much, but I had to buy extenders for my bras anyway, so I use those with this when I'm in-between the different latch settings. I really can't express how much this has helped though, but it literally holds my belly up for me so I don't have to break my lower back off :).
