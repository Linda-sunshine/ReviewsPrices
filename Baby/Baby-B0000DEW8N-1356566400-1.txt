review/summary: Better than a highchair.review/text: We mostly eat dinner at our island. We use this attached to a bar stool with a back. Its soooo much better than a highchair-and no more floor space is taken up than it ever is-because it is attached to the chair. This is my second fisher-price detachable seat.WHAT I LOVE:- It has a detachable tray (easy to clean)-It has food plate that attaches to detachable tray. (even easier to clean)-The detachable tray has a LID-so, if they don't finish eating -you can just put the lid on the detachable tray and throw it in the fridge.-the whole thing breaks down enough to put in the dishwasher.-the straps are adjustable-my baby is off the charts height/weight-so where the straps not adjustable(like so many are) we couldn't use it.-It inexpensive enough that if it looks horrible in a year or so-buying a new one isn't that big of a deal.
