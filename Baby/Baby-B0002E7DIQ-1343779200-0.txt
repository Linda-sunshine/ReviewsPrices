review/summary: Pretty good but not perfectreview/text: I never got around to buying a pregnancy pillow with my first pregnancy but since I'm already having a hard time getting comfortable in bed this time, I figured I'd go with the big guns. So I have nothing to compare to and while it's not perfect, it sure beats using multiple pillows and having to rearrange all of them every time I roll from one side to the other. I don't at all find the seam to be a problem, something a lot of other reviews point out. I do, however, find having to keep your bottom arm under the pillow a bit awkward at times. I'm not sure what the perfect design would be and may try this with the opening at top, using a regular pillow for my head so I have more freedom for my arms (with space between the pillow I use for my head and the one I use for my belly, etc.), but that is my only piece of negative feedback so far. I love having both belly and back support - this keeps me from rolling onto my back and I think I've woken up less since it's so much easier to roll from one side to the other, again, without having to rearrange a bunch of pillows. Also, I have a queen bed and this takes up just about half, so my husband has plenty of room. It would work better with a king and I definitely wouldn't get it if you have a full/double, but a queen is definitely doable. If you want belly and back support in one, this seems like just about the best all-in-one option out there.
