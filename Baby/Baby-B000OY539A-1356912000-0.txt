review/summary: BEST. PRODUCT. EVER.review/text: Our 5 week old loves to constantly be held tight, but hated swaddling. We got this just as a "We'll give it a shot" thing, but I can't believe it took us 5 weeks to realize it's magic. Our fussy girl instantly calms down and sleeps really well. It's really not hard to tie at all, but it is super long, so have it on before you go out somewhere. No cons. Now only if Moby could work it's magic with car seats too...
