review/summary: Inspect on Arrivalreview/text: The first seat I received came with a molding defect. This made it impossible to snap the seatback into place. I returned it right away, and within two days received a new seat that was in perfect condition. The whole return process couldn't have been smoother or faster. This could have been a very annoying experience, instead it was no problem at all. Thanks for the great service
