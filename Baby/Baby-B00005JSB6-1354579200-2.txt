review/summary: The only diapers I'll buyreview/text: I have 2 kiddos in diapers and refuse to buy any other brand than Huggies. You just can't go wrong! They hug their little bodies, keep the mess in and don't cut into them. The material is very strong and you can tell that their is quality to the diaper; it's soft, yet sturdy and strong :)
