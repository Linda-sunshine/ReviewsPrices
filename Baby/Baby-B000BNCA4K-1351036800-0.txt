review/summary: Great toyreview/text: My husband bought this toy for our 3 month old son. He had not shown much interest in any toys up to this point so we were looking for something that would encourage reaching and holding. The Winkel did the trick. Within 2 weeks he was not only reaching and grabbing with one hand, but was grabbing the winkel with both hands and lifting it to his mouth. I would highly recommend this toy.
