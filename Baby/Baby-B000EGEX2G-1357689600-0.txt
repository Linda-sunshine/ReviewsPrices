review/summary: It'll do....review/text: This is an inexpensive glider. Could I nit pick it? Of course....But honestly, it is perfectly fine for what it is.The definite pros of the chair are:Inexpensivefunctionalbasicexactly as describedlarge enough for my &#34;bigger&#34; behindThe pocket hanging from the arm of the chair is very nice.Cons of the chair:Not &#34;fall asleep in it&#34; comfortableNot the same color as the picture shows (it's more like ecru or eggshell colored cushions on white furniture....there's nothing &#34;brown&#34; or &#34;beige&#34; about the cushions).Not really meant for tall people (I am 5'10 and hubby is 6'). The back of the chair feels very short. I imagine that when baby is born, if I fall asleep in this chair, I will suffer from serious stiff neck.In conclusion, for the cost and in comparison to the other &#34;cheap&#34; chairs I checked out locally, I feel like I got exactly what I ordered and paid for. I will sit in my more expensive recliner in the living room if I'm looking for $1000 comfort, but if I'm looking for $150 comfort and function, this chair will do quite well.
