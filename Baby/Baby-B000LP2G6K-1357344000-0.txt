review/summary: Worked wonderfully for 9 month old grandsonreview/text: We purchased this for overnight sleeping and naps for grandson's 4 day visit. We also purchased and used the Dream 3&#34; Mattress, the mattress pad cover and the American Baby Co. Organic Cotton fitted sheets. Make sure those items are the size for the pack n play. This worked out great! Of course we used the lowest setting and he is too big to use the younger baby items that came with this pack n play. This was exceptionally easy to get out of box and set up....Thank you Amazon for shipping directly to our house, online shopping is fantastic!
