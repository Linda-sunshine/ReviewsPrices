review/summary: Perfect! And a great price!review/text: My 2 year old son loves it! The lights inside are LED so the batteries last forever. The 3 different color options are perfect because the green in relatively bright, the blue is dimmer, and the orange is very dim. This gives you some control of how bright you want the stars to be. The 45 minute timer means I don't have to remember to sneak back in his room to turn in off later. I love it! My brother bought a similar one, paid twice as much, and it has a small, incandescent bulb that gets hot and drains the batteries in a week. I couldn't be more happy with my choice.
