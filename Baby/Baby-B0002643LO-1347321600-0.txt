review/summary: Work for Us!review/text: Both of my kids (a boy and a girl) have used Pampers from birth. I like the Baby-Dry, they are nicely absorbent and seem to fit well. There was a big jump in size from 5 to 6. The 5s were getting small, the 6s are still quite big and she's been wearing them for about 3 months now. Because they are bigger, they have plenty of room for all the overnight filling.
