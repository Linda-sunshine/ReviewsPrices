review/summary: Great for the price!!review/text: First I'd like to point out that this glider is 130 dollars. It's not going to be amazing and the best chair you've ever sat in that being said....The wood is a good quality. If you compared it to my 800 dollar crib you'd never know that it wasn't top dollar. The bottom, ottoman and arm rest cushion are like memory foam ish. The bottom is a little hard but i think it will get better with use and if not easy to replace. The back cushion is very plush and comfy.I was worried about the size. I'm a little bit on the fluffy side. My hips are wide (wear a size 16) so I was worried I'd be to big for the chair. It wasn't a problem at all. I have a little wiggle room. I'm 5"4' and my head hits the perfect spot on the back.It is a tad bit creaky when I sit down or get up. Not enough to bother a normal person but I'm sensitive to creaks speaks and whines.Well see how it holds up but from what I can tell it really is a steal.
