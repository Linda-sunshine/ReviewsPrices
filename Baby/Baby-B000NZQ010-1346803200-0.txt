review/summary: My son loves this toy!review/text: My, almost, two year old son loves this toy! I must admit that when he pushes it on the floor it makes much more noise than his Vtech train, but honestly I think that is why he likes to play with it more than he does the train. I think that he thinks it sounds like a car. He pushes it around so fast while making car sound and then yells "beep, beep." You can't go wrong with this toy.
