review/summary: why are they still selling this?review/text: Hi,I am from Australia I've purchased a Back 'n Belly original pillow for my wife a few days ago from Amazon US.However she finds the seam in the 'U" part of the pillow is digging into her neck when she sleeps on her side :( .A quick search in Google shows that a lot of people also complaining about the same problem, I also found out that the improved "chic" version eliminates this issue.What I don't understand is why Leachco still selling the product that has the "digging" issue when you already have the version that eliminates the problem, so people can buy the not so good product and while some is not affected by it others will be greatly affected?Their customers shouldn't have to research which of your Back N' Belly pillow is better the original or the "Chic".They should be able to buy one Back N' Belly pillow and that should be the one without the issue that Leachco have acknowledged and rectified in the improved "Chic" version. IT JUST DOESN"T MAKE ANY SENSE.I used to associate Leachco brand with quality pillows and not so much anymore.Anyway, enough rant as there is nothing that can be done except for trying to re-sell it here locally as it will be too expensive and difficult to return to the US and a "Chic" replacement cover will not fit the original pillow.Overall I'm very dissapointed.Thanks for listening,
