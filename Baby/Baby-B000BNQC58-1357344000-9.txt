review/summary: So much fun for me and the babyreview/text: We bought this originally for the baby's 1st camping trip and we were so amazed on how it lite up the trailer now as he has gotten a little bit older he has learned to turn it on and hold it up to the ceiling and look at the stars, well worth the price
