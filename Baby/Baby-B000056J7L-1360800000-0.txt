review/summary: Good Quality, But Not For My Little Onereview/text: I was very satisfied with the quality of this potty chair. However, my daughter used it as a piano bench for her toy piano and nothing else. Then one day I took her to a family restroom that had a little potty in it and she ran for it to go sit down. I immediately bought her a potty chair that looked more like a real toilet and found that she actually was interested in potty training, she just didn't realize this chair was supposed to be a potty.
