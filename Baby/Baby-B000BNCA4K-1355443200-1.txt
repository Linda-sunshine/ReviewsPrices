review/summary: Totally adorablereview/text: I liked this so much that I bought two of these for my daughter. I got this one and the bright colored (with bright pinks and hot oranges). It's a great toy because it's not too heavy for the wee ones to shake, and it's AMAZING for helping to facilitate bilateral hand usage.
