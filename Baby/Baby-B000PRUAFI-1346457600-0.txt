review/summary: Really great. Glad I read reviews on these.review/text: These are really great. Relatively easy to install. They swing both ways! I kept reading in the reviews saying that is an important feature and it sure is. Once installed properly, they are sturdy. My daughter hangs on it and tries to pill it down. It doesn't even budge. The doors close easily and has the feature that makes it stay open yet be able to be closed with an easy. If we eren need more gates, we will get these same onesw
