review/summary: An absolute must!review/text: I have used Halo Sleep Sacks from the time my son was born, and I loved the fact that there were no loose blankets in his crib. Most babies kick their legs in their sleep, and they can't kick off this blanket! . He is only 4 months old, but a big and long baby, so when he grew out of cotton infant size Halo, I ordered 2 fleece blankets in XL. They are perfect- warm and extra long, with large arm holes, so he can grow into the length. Hopefully they will still fit next winter. The fleece is warm, so the layer underneath should be light. The color is adorable, and I love that the zipper unzips from the bottom, making the night time diaper changes easy.
