review/summary: Best Diaper Ever used!!!review/text: My daughter has 19 month old twin boys and I buy a case of these every month. My daughter won&#34;t use any other brand of diapers but Huggies. She used Huggies for her 9 year old son first. We had tried Pampers and Luvs and they needed to be changed more often. I would highly recommend Huggies for any baby who needs one.Thank you from Ohio.
