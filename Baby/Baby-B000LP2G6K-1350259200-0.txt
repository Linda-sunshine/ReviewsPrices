review/summary: Good qualityreview/text: It's a very good quality for the price. Spacious playground and also makes for a comfotable temporary bed for a 2year old baby that was visiting at our house. We also bought the Dream On Me 3" Extra Firm Playard Mattress, White to make it more comfortable to sleep in. It's compact and easy to store when not in use.
