review/summary: Fisher-Price Healthy Carereview/text: I liked the item because it helped in feeding my baby and I can set it on top of a chair or on the floor.The only problem with this item is with the feeding dish where in the baby can take off the cover by himself in addition to taking off the white feed plate placed inside. I would prefer having a stronger lock on the feeding plate.Other than this, my baby is one year and a half and he is still using the same product and I do recommend it to all mothers who would like to add some control on their children&#8217;s behavior during the feeding time.
