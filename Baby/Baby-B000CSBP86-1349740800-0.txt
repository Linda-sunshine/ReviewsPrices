review/summary: So Convenientreview/text: This carrier is so convenient! From around the house use, to outdoor use, we love our baby bjorn. It makes being "hands-free" so much easier. Plus, it's wonderful to have your baby so close. Baby Bjorn products are always so easy to use and cater so well to the busy Mom.
