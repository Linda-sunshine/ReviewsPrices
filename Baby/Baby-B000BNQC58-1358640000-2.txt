review/summary: NITE LIGHT TURTLEreview/text: I PURCHASED 2 OF THESE TURTLES FOR MY TWO GRANDAUGHTERS AGE 7 AND 9. THEY LOVED THEM! THEY JUST STARTED TO SLEEP IN SEPARATE BEDROOMS AND ALWAYS WANTED TO SLEEP WITH A LIGHT ON. NOW WITH THESE NITE LIGHTS WE DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE A LIGHT ON AND THEY HAVE A TIMER AND GO OFF AUTOMATICALLY IN 45 MINUTES. PLENTY OF TIME FOR THEM TO FALL ASLEEP!
