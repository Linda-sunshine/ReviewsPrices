review/summary: Not the same diaper you buy in the storesreview/text: I have been using Pampers swaddlers size 1 for weeks now and ordered the big box. They didn't seem to fit right and my baby had two leaks in the first day of using these. They were also very tight around her legs. We compared them to a box we purchased at the store and they are not the same diaper! They are much thinner and smaller and cheaper feeling. I am very disappointed with this purchase and will not be buying more.
