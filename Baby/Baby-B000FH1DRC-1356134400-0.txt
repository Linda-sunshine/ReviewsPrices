review/summary: Great for new moms and dads, but I now prefer Pampers Baby Dryreview/text: Let me start by saying that I don't think all diapers are best for every baby. Meaning, what's best for my child isn't going to be what's best for someone else's child, simply because our little ones come in all shapes and sizes! We first used Pampers Swaddlers in the hospital because it's what the hospital provided. Therefore, I continued to use them when my daughter came home from the hospital. As a new mom, I saw what worked, and went with it. I loved the fact that I didn't have to guess, or feel, if she was wet! Better yet, neither did my husband - who had never been around a baby before in his life. We used Swaddlers in the newborn size and size 1. However, when the size 1 were too small, and I moved to size 2, they were too big for her (she's in the 50th percentile for weight and 75th percentile for height). We had problems with stuff leaking out around her legs. The other problem I began having was leaking at night. She would wake up in the morning and her onesie and sleeper would be completely soaked! Someone told me that her daughter had the same problem, and recommended that I switch to Pampers Baby Dry at night, which offers 12 hour leak protection. I am so happy I did! She hasn't had a leak at night since. For daytime diapering, I began using Luvs, which I really like. The Luvs and Baby Dry both have a pleasant smell, where as the Swaddlers have a chemical smell. I finished my box of Luvs, and still had all of the Swaddlers Size 2 to use up, so I am back to using Swaddlers until they are gone. They fit her better now that she's a little bit bigger, but I am looking forward to when they are used up, and I can completely switch over to Pampers Baby Dry, for daytime and nighttime! I will say that no matter which diaper you choose, order them from Amazon, especially if you have a Prime membership! It's cheaper and very convenient!
