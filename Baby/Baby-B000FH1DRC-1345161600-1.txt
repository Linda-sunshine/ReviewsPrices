review/summary: Best pampers everreview/text: I absolutely love pampers swaddlers. They are the best at keeping my baby dry overnight. I bought numerous brands and sizes of diapers prior to having my baby and by far these are the best. I wish I had known how good these pampers we're and we would have stocked up solely these. I love these over the pampers baby dry.
