review/summary: comfy for mom, comfy for babyreview/text: i wish I had this with all of my babies! I bought this when we were expecting our fifth child knowing I would need to be able to be hands free at times. Also, my last 2 babies had had pretty severe reflux, so I was hoping that this would be a comfy way to keep baby upright. I had another carrier that I had used but found it wasn't that comfy for baby and didn't hold baby securely enough to really be able to about any kinda of normal work.. This works from day one with the newborn hold. If baby was fussy I could slip him in and he would be sleeping in minutes. It holds the baby so snug and close to mom. Now that he's a few months old, he's out grown the newborn hold, but I just tie up the wrap a little different and he's in a position where he can be awak or lay his head down to sleep. It is a lot of fabric so when you're putting it on you have to be a little careful that you don't drag the ends on the floor, but it is not really a problem. when I'm going to the grocery store or where ever, I just put it on before I leave the house so when I get in the store if he gets fussy I can just slide him into the wrap. would tell anyone thinking about this wrap to spend the money and get it. It is worth every penny
