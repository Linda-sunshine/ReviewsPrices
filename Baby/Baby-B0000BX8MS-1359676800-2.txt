review/summary: Love this but...review/text: I love the idea of the Sleepsack. We use it every night. Before we had this in medium, we had a small on in another brand that doesn't make them anymore. The other one had a piece of material on the inside that you secured by velcro around the baby. My baby is a mover and loves to kick her feet in her crib. We lay her one way in her crib at night and she ends up sideways by morning. As a first time mother, the material in the other one gave me peace of mind that the sleepsack wasn't going to come up over her nose and mouth. I just wish this one had that material in the middle too.
