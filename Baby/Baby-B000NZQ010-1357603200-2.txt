review/summary: Awesomereview/text: This was Christmas gift for my daughter. As soon as she saw it, she lovedit. It plays a ton of different songs and is very educational as well. She loves the phone and all of the buttons she can push. The only thing I would change is, all of the shapes have a string they are attached to the toy, where as the phone does not stay attached. It keeps getting lost. Maybe it's a safety thing or something but I wish there was a way to keep it attached.
