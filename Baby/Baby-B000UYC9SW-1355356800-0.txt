review/summary: too smallreview/text: I like this carrier but unfortunately it came in so small. My 10lbs baby couldn't fit in the XS comfortably so I returned it for a bigger size Small. It still doesn't fit her. My recommendation for other buyers is to buy two sizes bigger than what you need. I will try to see if I can return it for a bigger size. I just hate the hassle of returning and re-ordering it.
