review/summary: The only place my baby will entertain herselfreview/text: I bought this for my daughter when she was 3 months old and I was totally exasperated because I couldn't put her down anywhere - she had suddenly decided she didn't like her bouncer, and whenever I put her on her play gym she would roll onto her belly and then cry. She also has bad reflux so I really wanted a way to keep her upright without having to hold her after feeds.When she first started using the Jumperoo she just enjoyed being able to sit upright, looking at the lights and listening to the music while swaying around a bit, but after about a week she figured out how to jump in it and that's when the fun really started. Watching her bounce around with a huge grin plastered on her face and her arms thrown up in the air was a total riot, and she would be happy in it for 20-30 minutes at a time which was a reeeeeally long time for her.One of the nice features of this Jumperoo is that it has different toys that will appeal to different ages to help keep their attention over time. Now at 4 months old she's more interested in chewing on the bug toy and spinning around the little alligator than she is in the music and lights. Unfortunately she has lost some interest in jumping and will now usually only stay in the Jumperoo for 10 minutes or so unless someone is sitting right there with her talking to her, but that's still better than nothing.One note is that even though my baby is on the bigger side and is the weight and length of an average 5-6 month old, she still can't quite reach the floor on the lowest setting. It isn't a big deal though - we just put a pillow under her feet and that solves the problem.
