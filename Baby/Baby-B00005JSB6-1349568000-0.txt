review/summary: Wish they were softerreview/text: I am an overall huggies fan but I just wish that the snug and dry diapers were as soft as huggies little snugglers. They are really rough compared to other diapers but they don't seem to bother my son, just me. Once again I'd just like to add that the huggies leak lock design along the back on the diaper can be a life saver from blowouts!
