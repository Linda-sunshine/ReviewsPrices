review/summary: Love these diapers!review/text: Love the wetness indicator! No, you don't have to change the diaper at the first sight of a blue line, but it is really nice that it helps you discern if the diaper is wet vs. just bunched up from wear. I love the soft feel of these as well - much nicer than baby dry or huggies.
