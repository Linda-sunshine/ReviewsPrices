review/summary: Great choice!review/text: I bought this Jumperoo over the newer models based on the great reviews. This Jumperoo meets all my expectations. My baby loves it! She plays with all parts and evens enjoys looking at the hanging toys. One note, I thought the dragonfly was broken because the picture shows it standing up. A call to Fisher-Price revealed this is just for the picture and the dragonfly is suppose to hang down. My baby loves holding onto the dragonfly so it works well!
