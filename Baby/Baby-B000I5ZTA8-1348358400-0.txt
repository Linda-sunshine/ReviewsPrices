review/summary: This has actually helped me!review/text: I have been wearing this for a week. Use of a maternity "support belt" was recommended by my doctor and several others because I have had relatively debilitating abdominal tightness for nearly my entire pregnancy. I have essentially stopped walking and standing for long periods. At 30 weeks, I purchased this belt out of desperation. I was hesitant to buy it, even with the recommendations, because my abdomen already felt so tight and tender and I couldn't imagine putting anything restrictive around it. However, I will say that for whatever reason, this belt is actually helping me. I still have tightness, but it isn't nearly as constant and I feel much more comfortable walking short distances. I can wear it all day while sitting at a desk with no problem. After reading all of the reviews, sizing was a concern -- so I bought both the small and medium. I agree with those reviewers that said it runs small. I am 5'7" and currently around 155lbs and the medium fits perfectly on the "middle" set of hooks (there are 3 rows of hooks), so I have room for more growth. I also agree with other reviews that I can't understand why there isn't less space between the hooks/more sets of hooks to allow more customized sizing. Luckily, the middle set fits fine for me, but beware that some sort of an extender/adapter may be necessary to customize for your size. I find that his belt is a great width and is not noticeable under my clothing. I am really happy I purchased this product.
