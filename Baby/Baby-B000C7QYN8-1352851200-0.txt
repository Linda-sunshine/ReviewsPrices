review/summary: Not the same as the storesreview/text: Our child has sensitive skin so we chose to use these over the cheaper ones that contain perfumes and such. Overall, we're really happy with this product. The one odd thing, though, is that the 7th generation wipes that you buy in the store are not the same as these. The store-bought ones are thicker and quilted. These wipes are much thinner -- I would guess perhaps half the thickness. I don't mind that though. It actually seems less wasteful since with wipes you're not really worried about absorbency or durability ... at least I hope not.
