review/summary: Finally Comfyreview/text: I am finally comfortable at night. I love how it supports my back just like I needed after long days of work. The only downside is that its hard to get out of in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom but that would be any pillow. I still wouldnt trade it for anything.
