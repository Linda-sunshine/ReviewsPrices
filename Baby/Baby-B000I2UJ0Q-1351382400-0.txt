review/summary: Love it!review/text: I love the jumperoo and I wish I bought this earlier. My son started using the jumperoo when he was 5 1/2 months old. He had great neck/ head support by 2 months. He would have love the jumperoo at 4 months or maybe earlier since he love to stand and tried to walk with support at 3 months. My son is 10 months now and he is outgrowing it but he still enjoys the toys on the jumperoo. Great toy and an amazing bargain.
