review/summary: Great blanket alternativereview/text: Since you are not supposed to use blankets in the crib, I love these SleepSacks. They are the 3rd layer I put on him at night and he stays warm and toasty and safe. I have to say the picture doesn't do this design justice. Once I got it, was when I realized how cute this print really is. Washed it before first use, it was super soft and had no issues with anything come apartment or threads coming out. (I am still using the ones I bought in 2008 so these are super durable!)
