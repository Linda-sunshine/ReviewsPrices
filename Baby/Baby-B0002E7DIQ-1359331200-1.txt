review/summary: Pregnancy Mustreview/text: I'm only about halfway through my pregnancy at this point, but I'm already loving my body pillow (and so does my dog.) I'm usually a side sleeper, ever pre-pregnancy, so being able to roll from side to side and still have support is great. Since becoming pregnant and getting up to pee constantly, my sleep has been more broken. Not having to break my sleep to move my pillow from side to side as well is a big benefit! The seems that falls on teh inside of the pillow all the way around is quite taught and hard if you pull the pillow too close under your arm that supports your head while you side-sleep. However, I'm only 5'4&#34;, so I don't feel the need to pull it down so far for support below my calves, so it doesn't bother me often. If you're tall, note that you'll only use this from head to knees. A longer version for tall people or people that like cushioning from head to toe probably wouldn't be a bad idea. Note that this does take up quite a bit of room. My husband, dog, and I all share a King bed... but me and my pillow now take up almost half. It would work with two people in a Queen (NO dog.)
