review/summary: didn't fit snugly at the bottomreview/text: The diaper didn't fit snugly at the bottom. It caused my baby to get creases and a sore bottom from too much diaper. She fit the waist size. The absorbency was fine, but they didn't seem comfortable. I will stick with the other major brand of diapers instead.
