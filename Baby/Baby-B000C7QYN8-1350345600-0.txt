review/summary: WONDERFUL and thank you!review/text: Very happy with these wipes from Seventh Generation. My son has sensitive skin and it has been all we can do to get rid of a daily diaper rash that changed every diaper! We switched to these wipes and Seventh Generation diapers and the rash is gone! I like that the wipes are not excessively wet or leaving a residue on his skin. He appears clean and happy after all changes and wipe usage. Thanks Seventh Generation - And thank you Amazon for carrying these diapers! Such a relief to find something that works so well after trying numerous other brands of wipes and diapers.
