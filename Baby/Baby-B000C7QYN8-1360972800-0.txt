review/summary: good basic wipesreview/text: These are something that buying in mass quantities just makes sense. My son has sensitive skin and these have never caused a reaction of any kind. I like that they are chlorine free and after the subscribe and save discount they are about the same as generic wipes I could get at a big box store.I do recommend buying a hard box of wipes at the store and then using these as refills, the huggies brand seems to make the nicest reusable box and it's easier to access these one handed that way. Just sayin. . .
