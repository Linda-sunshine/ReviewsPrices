review/summary: Our baby loves a Glider....review/text: We ordered this product and assembly was easy, and within minutes we were rocking our baby to sleep. Other than the white color which I treated the fabric with scotch guard, we were happy. Flash forward to a month later. On the glider, both wood support pieces on the right side cracked. I don't know if we just got a lemon, but I won't be replacing this item with another one from the same company. I guess I will go with the I got what I paid for, and just invest in a better one next time.
