review/summary: So essential, I bought two!review/text: Our little guy can only lay on his back on the play mat for so long, but loves sitting in this chair. And the toys hanging from the bar are so captivating, he started batting and grabbing at them far earlier than we expected him to. It was so exciting when he started pulling the ring on his own to make the music play - he'd laugh and we'd cheer him on. Ahh, the things that thrill us now as parents :-)Also, it seems like the vibration feature is rechargeable (even though I know it's not) because I've left the chair on vibrate all night by accident and we still haven't needed to change the batteries once since July! That's pretty amazing.This is so indispensable in our household, I bought an extra one to send home to Gramma's for when we visit!
