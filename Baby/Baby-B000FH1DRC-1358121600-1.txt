review/summary: Mesh keeps #2 awayreview/text: These are more expensive, sure, but they are worth it. The mesh lining on the inside keeps #2 off my baby's butt. So if he goes during the night, he won't have it sitting against his skin the entire night. Makes everyone happier. The blue indicating strip is not necessary however - you can tell the diaper is wet when it swells in volume in the crotch area.
