review/summary: Sometimes it tips over!review/text: Great playmat all in all, but not the most stable. It is designed to light up and play music whenever the foam support bars are slightly jostled. This would really get my daughter going as she learned kicking her feet would play music. Problem is that the connector for the two bars at the top wouldn't always stay locked in. This would cause the two foam support bars to tip over after baby would kick it to play music. The bars are light enough and padded very well so that it couldn't harm the child, and their orientation kept them from falling on her, but it would often scare her as it would come tumbling down. You would think that something that's designed to be jostled would have a better connecting mechanism to keep this from happening. This didn't happen all the time, but did happen more than a few times. Know that your child would still be safe playing with this though.
