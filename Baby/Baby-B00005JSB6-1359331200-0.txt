review/summary: Great diapers!!!review/text: Great diapers. They hold in the pish perfectly at 6+ months. Work better than other brands. Only thing is the price always seems to change to being a great price on Amazon.com to one you have to shop. Costco and Amazon.com seem to go back and fourth. If you are price aware keep that in mind. But the product is awesome. Been using Huggies for all three of my children once they start eating solids at 6+ months. When you're changing diapers every hour we always got the super cheap ones at Wal-Mart or Costco where they work best. But when you start feeding them solids watch out those cheap ones don't work and you get pish everywhere!!! That's when Huggies kick in and hold it in! Unless of course they are in a jumper and that stuff just seems to ooooze out the back. Keep that in mind.
