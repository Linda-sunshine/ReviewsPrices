review/summary: NO BATTERY - WATCH OUTreview/text: Assembly is not easy. It took me a while to make sure - the pieces fit together. Its Asymmetrical design and requires FisherPrice to hire someone who has basic intuitive approach to design. Its few bars with some crappy shaker - which doesnt come with a battery - how outrageous.After all the putting together effort - its useless until I go out and find a battery, buy it and then use it. whats the point of having ordered through amazon.com.beware - pretty flimsy design. I am not going to buy another fisher-price item not even if its fulfilled from amazon.comgo buy something better from brick and mortar stores......
