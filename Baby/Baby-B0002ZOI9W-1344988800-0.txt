review/summary: Not good for children over 1review/text: I thought this chair would be great for my 15 month old but it is not. You cant remove the harness so it is uncomfortable for him to sit in it with the harness still being on the chair. It is not very sturdy and I think this should not be advertised as a toddler chair as well as infant chair. Not worth the money and if I still had box I would send it back.
