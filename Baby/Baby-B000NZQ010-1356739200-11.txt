review/summary: VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walkerreview/text: A Christmas gift for my 9 month old granddaughter. She loves the music, pushing colorful buttons, chewing on the phone, and using it to stand. It is sturdy and the locked wheels great. Her three year old brother enjoys it as well...he loves talking into the phone and pushing the Stand around the house. A great toy for the price.
