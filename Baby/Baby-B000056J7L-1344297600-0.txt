review/summary: Not for Boysreview/text: Although this potty did get my son interested in using the potty for a short time(because it was something new) the pee guard for boys does not really protect any accidents from spilling over, it is just a raised flat piece but I think it would be better if it had a lip to help keep the pee in the toilet. It is made nicely that is why I did give it a 3 star rating but I just would not recommend to any of my friends with sons.
