review/summary: Perfect for our needs!review/text: These are GREAT for blocking/sectioning off large areas that are too awkward or tricky to really baby proof. We are military and move a lot so I don't like to invest in a million baby proofing gates that I don't know if I'll need in 6 months. This has worked out perfectly for a certain area of our house. Definitely recommend!
