review/summary: Worth a try!review/text: I am a die hard Pampers fan - I tried all the other brands with our first son no success, just lots of extra laundry - We use the Baby Dry for my older son and they are different than the Cruisers. They do not feel as heavy duty, but we have never had a leak, so I love the savings! I was a bit nervous to try them on my infant son as we've been using the higher quality Swaddlers, but I figured we'd give them a go, with Amazon's free returns, there was nothing to lose really. I am very happy with them. You get about 40 more diapers for the same price and we have had no leaks or issues with them! Even when my son chooses to go (nearly) the whole night! I am very pleased with the cost (especially when you combine the Amazon Mom discount and subscribe & save) and they don't leak. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for an extra week of diapers for the same price as the Swaddlers.
