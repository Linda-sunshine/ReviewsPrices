review/summary: Overall satisfiedreview/text: This carrier is very user friendly. I'm able to put my baby boy on it without any assistance. He enjoys facing front looking at the world but not so much facing me. The only negative is that it does put quite a bit of strain on your shoulders after some time. So this product is really not meant for carrying your baby for long periods of time.
