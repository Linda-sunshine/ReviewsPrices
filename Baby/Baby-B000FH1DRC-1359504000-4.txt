review/summary: Great Diapers!review/text: I didn't anticipate needing to buy newborn diapers again so quickly as everyone told me my baby would grow so fast I wouldn't hardly see her in anything newborn long. Well, my tiny girl is almost a month and still needing smaller sizes, so I am thankful for this product! I love the wetness indicator, I wish all diapers had that little feature! Plus, these are super soft and smell like baby powder, before use of course!
