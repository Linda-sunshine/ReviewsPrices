review/summary: more aesthetic than anything elsereview/text: I got this second hand and it held up well to my friends 2 children and mine. It looks beautiful and matches in well with the rain forest theme that we selected. However my son got bored very easily as he couldn't reach the butterflies and when he got older there wasn't enough to keep him stimulated. There are better products out there, even better ones made by fisher price to keep your baby stimulated. my sister in law gave us one that had the Alpherbet on it so it was a fun mat as he got older the toys span by themselves and with the child's help and the toys were in a better position for a small baby. over all the product was good but i wouldn't buy it.
