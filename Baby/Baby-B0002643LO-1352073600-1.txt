review/summary: Leaked after 4 hoursreview/text: We accidentally bought pampers dry instead of cruisers diapers, so we decided to try them. I immediately noticed the odor of urine. When out with gramma, they leaked after 4 hours of wear. We normally use cruisers and they have provided us consistent coverage and have never failed. Cruisers seem to cover more surface area and last for 12 hours through the night. I also do not notice the urine smell as soon as the diaper becomes wet with cruisers. We will be using cruisers from now on.
