review/summary: My fav!review/text: When I had my daughter 2 years ago, I borrowed this from my sister. My daughter LOVED it. It kept her attention as early as 2 months old! She loved the music and lights and used it right up until she could sit and play with the toys. I just recently had another baby and went out and bought my own because I LOVED it so much and it is still my fav floor activity gym. My 3 month old son loves it as well. The lights and music are a MUST when trying to entertain a young baby.
