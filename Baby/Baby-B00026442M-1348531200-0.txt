review/summary: poorreview/text: I was not happy with pampers diapers. I was using huggies before and after I switched to pamper, there were more leakage accidents. Plus the side wings broke couple of time while putting on diapers. So overall I was not happy with the pampers this product. I had used pampers with my first child few years ago and they were fine.
