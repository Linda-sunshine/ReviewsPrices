review/summary: LOVE this seat!review/text: This is one of the best baby purchases I've made so far. I decided to buy this "booster seat" instead of a high chair for my daughter. We waited until she was 6 months old before starting solids, so she was able to sit up on her own without problems. (I don't know if it would work as well if you are starting solids before baby can sit on her own.) She has been sitting in this chair since 6 months and has never had any difficulty sitting in it/staying upright/not leaning over, etc. I love it because it is so easy to clean - there is no fabric for spills to soak into. No, I do not worry that baby is uncomfortable because there is no plush seating -- how can an infant know the difference? Plus, she's only in it for 15 minutes at a time. It is portable and so easy to set up and take down, we always bring it with us when we travel. I would buy this seat again in a heartbeat, especially knowing that it can transition into a booster seat (without tray) for the years to come.
