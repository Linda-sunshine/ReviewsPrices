review/summary: Fisher Price Rainforest Jumperooreview/text: I bought this for my grandson he was about 5 months old it kept him very busy and he loved it. He still loves it at 1 year old and it keeps him busy. It has a lot to do on it and is very good quality. I think it is one of the better jumperoos and I recommend it. My neice also bought it through my recommendation. FIsher Price has great quality toys for kids.
