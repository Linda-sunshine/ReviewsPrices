review/summary: Good product. Would buy again.review/text: my son has been using this ince 3months old And still uses it to this day for over 3 years. Battery last quite a bit since I find in the morning still turned on. The light defaults to green, which is the brightest, when turned on, and you chan change to blue (little dimmer) and yellow (bit more dimmer).Good alternative to night light. We've taken this to camping with us. I have given the this one, a sea turtle and lady bug as a gift to friends and family
