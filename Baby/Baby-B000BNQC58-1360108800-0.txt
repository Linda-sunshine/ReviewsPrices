review/summary: Great Night Lightreview/text: This was a great purchase. The batteries last forever long. The choice of three different beautiful colors worked out well. The turtle is in my little ones bed and she can easily use it as she pleases. The auto shut off is long enough for her to wiggle about and fall asleep comfortably. The stars look great and give a warm light.
