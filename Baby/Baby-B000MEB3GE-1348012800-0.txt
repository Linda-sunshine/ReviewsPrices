review/summary: Not needed with all the much more useful baby apps out there.review/text: My mom bought this for me and when I first saw it I thought it would be incredibly useful. I started using it right when I brought the baby home from the hospital. within a couple of days the clip broke off the back. Then I realized that whenever I needed it, it was always in the other room. Plus, it was aggravating that it has no way to store data. So I still had to write stuff down if I wanted to keep track. Within 2 weeks, this thing was forgotten about and I was using the feed baby pro app that cost $1.99. I recommend that app to all my mama friends who rave about it and this thing is long ago in the trash. Since I've always got my phone, I'm not juggling another electronic. Plus the app stored all the data since I bought it and I can sync the data between devices! The app has diaper, breastfeeding, formula, sleeping, pumping, growth, and solid food trackers and many different charts and graphs to see what your baby does day to day. It's so much more useful than this expensive piece of junk!!!
