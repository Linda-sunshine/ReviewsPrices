review/summary: Horrible chair!!!review/text: My husband and I ordered this chair to rock our newborn son in. We have had it a week and already had three springs break and a button pop off. My husband almost took a hammer and destroyed the chair after the last spring popped and almost broke his finger. Neither me or my husband are over 115-120 pounds so weight was not an issue. I am very upset with our purchase and feel that our son's safety was in danger. I am returning the chair and would not recommend this product to anyone!
