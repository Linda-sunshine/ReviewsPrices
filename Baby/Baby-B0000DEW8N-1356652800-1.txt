review/summary: A must-have baby/toddler itemreview/text: I purchased this when my older daughter turned one. I was tired of dragging around the giant free-standing high chair I just HAD to have when I was registering. This little thing is awesome. Here's why:* portable- I have actually taken this to restaurants, relatives homes, the park and the beach. It folds down and you can use the safety straps like a carry strap. Love it.* easy to clean- it's plastic. The tray drops in the dishwasher and the seat gets hosed off right in the sink. Love that! You will too if you have a kid like mine who can smear sticky substances with the best of 'em!* snap on tray- when I'm at the table with her she uses this as a booster. If we use it freestanding I snap on the tray. There's enough room to let her sit and color as well. Did I say I love it yet?* adjustable height- has 3 levels so you can get a good fit for the table you're using. Yes- I love it. I love it a lot!* durable- we have used this thing A LOT over the last year and a half and it practically looks new still. LOVE!I have a 6 mo that is just beginning solid food. I have decided to chuck the behemoth that cost 4x as much and am buying another of these. MUST. HAVE.
