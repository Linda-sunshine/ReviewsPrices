review/summary: Good product for bigger kidsreview/text: I purcased these diapers because I have a big 2 1/2 year old and needed diapers that would fit his larger frame. I tried other brands but they were too narrow, thus causing more diaper leaks. These fit my son well and are a less expensive option to Pampers Cruisers. However, I do think the tabs need to be roomier. One advantage Huggies diapers has over Pampers are their tabs - they always seem to be big enough, wheras Pampers have to be fitted just right. Evenso, I still recommend these diapers. They are slightly cheaper than the Huggies Snug and Dry and I think Pampers are more absorbant.
