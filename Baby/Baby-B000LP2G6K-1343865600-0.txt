review/summary: Easy to use, wonderful for travelreview/text: I purchased this exact same Pack 'N Play at Walmart. It's wonderful to travel with. Folds up easily, and it was comfortable for my son to lay and sleep in. He's older now, so he can sleep in regular beds when we travel, but it was awesome to have when he was a baby/toddler.
