review/summary: Great Product!review/text: My 2.5 year old daughter recently wanted us to leave the light on at night. I purchased this with hopes of setting her mind at ease. Unfortunately she still wants the light on.The product itself is great. The green, and purple LEDs are very bright. The orange is roughly 50% as bright. She loves her &#34;Tommy&#34; and quickly figured out how to turn him on/off and switch through the colors. She loves huddling under the covers and seeing the stars move around.
