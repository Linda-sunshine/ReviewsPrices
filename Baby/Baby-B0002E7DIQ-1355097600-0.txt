review/summary: Made sleeping while pregnant so much betterreview/text: This pillow has been a life saver. At just over five months I started to be uncomfortable sleeping. This pillow has made it so much better. If you have reflux it's great at keeping you more upright but not so much that you cant sleep. If your hips hurt, this pillow helps. The back support is wonderful and it holds you in all the right places.I can recommend this enough... Well worth the price.
