review/summary: Oh Snoogle, You Sly Little Thing You!review/text: Whoever invented this deserves the Nobel Prize.. okay maybe not that prestigious but at least something of sort. This was a life saver for me when I was pregnant. Being of petite frame, the pregnancy wreaked havoc on my back and my sleep. My husband researched around and alot of his coworkers who were mothers or was pregnant themselves suggested I get a Snoogle.Googled it and found it on Amazon with the best pricing (shouldn't be surprise at this point). Received it a week later and immediately used it that night. The Snoogle was totally what I needed. Not only did it supported my legs, because of it, it helped alleviate the back pains I was experiencing due to my growing bump. Snoogle eventually became my partner on the couch, in bed.. even in my office chair! It provided all the right support for my back and legs throughout and after the birth of my daughter, it also provided support to help me with feeding her.As my daughter grew and hit each stage of her life, the Snoogle came into play a few more times (i.e. supported her head for naps, elevated her for tummy time, acted as a cushion as she practiced sitting up and crawling on her own). This thing is a miracle I tell you! &#60;(^.^)&#62;
