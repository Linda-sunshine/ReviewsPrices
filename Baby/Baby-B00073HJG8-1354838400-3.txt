review/summary: Great buy for the money!review/text: I needed a place for my child's stuffed animals and the toy hammock was perfect. It was easy to install and it is holding up about 10 HUGE stuffed animals and a lot of small ones too right above the bed. I picked this one over the others since it was a larger net. Great buy for the money!
