review/summary: Nice product but follow size chartreview/text: I followed everyone's advice to order a size larger. I am a size 16 and 200 lbs (pre-pregnancy) which would put me in a medium. I ordered a large instead and when I got it, it gave me no support at all because it wasn't tight enough. Instead of sending it back and waiting for a different one to come in I took the last set of hooks off and sewed them back on the other side to make it tighter. After I did that, it works great and I have noticed relief from pelvic muscle pain and pain in my back.
