review/summary: Can't make it work for mereview/text: I read the reviews of this product pretty thoroughly before purchasing and I really wish I didn't feel like this was a total waste of money. I have several problems with this product, none of which I anticipated prior to buying since I am a first time parent:1) It now seems like a terrible idea to make a baby wearing device out of jersey knit (stretchy material). This material really loses its shape and stretches out between washings. So, it ends up loose in some places and doesn't provide enough support for the baby. It's not an issue of my having purchased a size that is too big. I am 5 ft. 9 in. and wear a size 6/8, so I ordered a size small.2) The loops for the carrier twist around on themselves. It can be difficult to tell when this has happened, since the insides and outsides of the loops are the same color.3) My baby is a good size (over 11 pounds at just under 5 weeks) and he keeps slipping down into the carrier and disappearing. Since I am using a size small, I really don't see why this should happen other than faulty design.4) I have spent a good amount of time trying to get this carrier to work, thinking maybe it was user error on my part. It may still be user error, but if that *is* the case, this is still a poor product because what new parent should have to spend a ridiculous amount of time and energy trouble shooting this thing!!! I am really frustrated because while I want to wear my baby around the house while going about my business, this is such a poor choice. I have an Ergo for going out with the baby, but I am simply going to have to purchase another type of sling / soft carrier to use around the house, since the K'Tan is so ridiculously difficult.Simply "ugh."
