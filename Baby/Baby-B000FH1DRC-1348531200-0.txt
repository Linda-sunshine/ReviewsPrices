review/summary: not like the swaddlersreview/text: The diapers were ok but not the same swaddlers sensitive w the wetness indicator and a lot less leak protection. I am looking into swotc,hing to a new diaper evenn thoough I have useed pampers since birth, I just need the papmers swaddlers sensitive to stay the same past size three and four. Great diapers but I paid extra to have the extra wetness protection inside the diaper and the wetness indicator. Thnaks
