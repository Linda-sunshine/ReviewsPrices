review/summary: Great for awkward spacesreview/text: We have a few awkward spaces with large gaps that we wanted to keep our child from. I had to look around to try and find some kind of gate that might fit one of these space without us having to mount something to the wall. I did not want to have to do a hardware install for something I will have up for only a limited time. We bought two of these and they have worked great. We were able to take some large gaps and make an effective barrier to keep your child out. Sometimes we had to be creative with the angles and placement of the gate but I don't think I could have found another product that would do the job.The biggest con here is that they can be hard to open and close which is probably a good thing since it makes it harder for the child to do so. That said it can make setting this up and taking it down a bit of chore. Not sure if anything could really be done to fix this.
