review/summary: Great for the moneyreview/text: It is easy to collapse and to change from the elevated position to the lower. It seems sturdy and the pad is good. Firm, but soft enough. The only thing that bothered me is the smell of the pad. It smells the chemicals. I wiped it down, aired it out and put a clean sheet over it, but you can still smell the chemical smell a little. Not a real problem though. My baby slept very well in it after outgrowing her bassinet. Now she is in a crib, but loves to play in it.
