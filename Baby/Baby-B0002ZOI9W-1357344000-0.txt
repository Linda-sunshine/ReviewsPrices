review/summary: Good multi-purpose and long-term use chairreview/text: I got this chair because of the good price point and the multi-purpose use, as well as it's long-term potential as the chair can be adjusted to grow with the baby. My 3 month old son likes being in this chair. It doesn't bounce, but he never seemed too interested in bouncy chairs anyway. The dangling toys intrigue him, but I wish the center toy that pulls had a more musical song rather than a low quality beeping version of the Three Little Monkeys tune. When my son gets bored with the dangle toys, I replace it with the Tiny Love Sunny Stroll arch, which fits well and keeps him entertained.The seat cover is made of polyester so it washes well. However, the bottom of the seat is supported by a hard board, so when my baby gets excited and kicks, his feet bang against a hard surface. I put a soft fluffy blanket over the seat to help cushion the seat more.The rocking feature works well, especially on hardwood floors or other non-carpeted floors. The kickstand is great for reclining the baby and having them nap.I think this is a better investment than a bouncy chair, especially for babies that could care less about bouncing.
