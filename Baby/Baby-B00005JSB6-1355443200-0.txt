review/summary: It's a trade offreview/text: I bounce between purchasing Huggies and Pampers depending on which is cheaper. As a matter of opinion, I slightly prefer Pampers, but I'll use either.Huggies are better constructed, they fit my son better than Pampers, and they seem to do better in terms of overnight use. The tradeoff is that, in our case, Huggies have a slight urine smell soon after they've been peed in. I've never noticed this with Pampers (except with overnight use). They're not nearly as bad as Luvs, which I absolutely detest, but I would choose Pampers over Huggies if the former were cheaper.On a side note, Amazon is the absolute best place to buy diapers! I have not been able to find diapers cheaper anywhere else.
