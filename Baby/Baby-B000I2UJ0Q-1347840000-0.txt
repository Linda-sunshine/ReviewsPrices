review/summary: Best Jumperoo Out Therereview/text: I was given this FP Jungle Jumperoo as a hand-me-down gift. I also bought a door swing/jumper and a Baby Einstein Jumper. This FP Jumperoo wins, hands down.Cons:Big and cumbersomeTakes up a lot of room, does not fold easily like the othersYou cannot take out or change the toys.Pros:Very sturdyGives the most bounce to my baby (4-7 months)He likes this one the bestThe music plays as he jumpsI would strongly recommend this one to anyone who is not sure which is the better purchase. Also, if you can find it slightly used, it seems to last a long time. The Baby Einstein does not last long.
