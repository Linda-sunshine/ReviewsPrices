review/summary: Good product but sizing recommendations definitely offreview/text: This product is good and easy to wear under clothes. I do notice some difference wearing this whenever I go on longer walks and around the office all day. The sizing is definitely off, I am 150lbs in the third trimester and comfortably fit into the medium on the tightest setting. When I get really close to the end I can see myself putting on the second setting if it got too tight.UPDATE:I'm towards the end of my third trimester now and I still occasionally wear the belt, though to be honest my stomach is so huge I'm not sure that anything could help at this point.
