review/summary: pampers size 1 234 packsreview/text: The hospital our child was born used pampers and gave us an extra pack when we left. We liked it as it did not leak comparing with a couple other brands we tried using at the beginning. So we designed to stay with this. We also liked the indicator design. So we bought this bulk pack (size 1 234 pieces) when the stock was running low the first time. But the first week we were using it, it leaked 2 - 3 times already, not sure why this would be different that those we got from the hospital.
