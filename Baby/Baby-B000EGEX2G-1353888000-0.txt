review/summary: Good size, smooth rocking motion, well constructedreview/text: First, I must report that my brother in law was thrilled when this was an easy-to-assemble piece. He's been putting together furniture and baby gear at a pretty good pace for several months now, so he's become an expert at it. He wasn't nearly as happy with the assembly required on some of the other things they have received.This was a gift for my soon-to-be-born niece. It's already in their home, and we have put it to use already to rock the niece who was born two months ago. It was comfortable to sit in, and very soothing to my niece.My only concern with this particular model: I can already see where this one might be difficult to keep clean, so perhaps getting one of the other versions than the cream cushions might be a better move. If you're ok with the every day baby results on the cushions, it's a perfect choice. I think by the time baby number two comes around, my sister will be less concerned with beauty of the furniture and more concerned with a good print pattern. :)
