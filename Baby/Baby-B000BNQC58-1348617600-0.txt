review/summary: Great Gift for the Baby's Big Brother or Sisterreview/text: I buy this ladybug night light for the big brother or big sister of the baby! This way, when the package arrives for the new baby, the big brother or sister gets something special, too! Both of my kids adore their Lady Bug Night Light and we enjoy looking at the constellations together. We have owned ours for about 2 years and it still works as great as day one. The lights can be switched to green, red, or blue and gradually fade so the batteries don't run out. Kids are out before the lights are. Really a great quality item! LOVE!
