review/summary: Really Great Onereview/text: I really love it and happy about getting this fantastic learning walker for my kid...Cute games with sounds in front of the walker makes more fun to her...This helped her to learn to walk well earlier itself.... now she can walk fast when using this walker...she's very happy to pick up the phone in front of it and play with it most of the time...I am very much satisfy with this product and would like to recommend to everyone ...
