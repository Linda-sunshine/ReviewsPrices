review/summary: Very thin and cheapreview/text: We had Huggies One and Done, then 7th Generation. Huge difference. 7th feels cheap and sometimes the sheets are not properly cut (stuck together). See the images I uploaded for comparison. The opening is a thin, cheap piece of tape that is hard to reseal between wipes. Compare to Huggies' well-constructed plastic covering that can be properly closed and opened for secure closure, it is no brainer that you should not waste money on this product, no matter how much less chemical it is used. Everything has chemicals in it, whenever you buy a processed product. Unless you mill your own paper and produce your own baby wipes, chemicals are in everything. Don't believe the hype of chemicals not in this product. They all do. Just use less and you're set.
