review/summary: Best night lite!review/text: We now have 2 of these - they are so calming and neat to look at. My 2 yr old sings herself to sleep every night singing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star! The batteries last for quite a while and it has an automatic shut off. This is a great gift for children ages 7 and under!
