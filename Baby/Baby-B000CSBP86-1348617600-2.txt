review/summary: Great Productreview/text: Our Baby Bjorn Baby Carrier came in the mail yesterday. The material is durable with a lot of cushion. The carrier was very easy to strap on and adjust, and comfortable to wear. We were originally going to go with a different carrier for a little less money, but we are glad we spent the extra to go with the Baby Bjorn. We are very happy with the product.
