review/summary: Great carrierreview/text: I have been using this carrier for my 2 month old for the last month. She loves it. It is a little hard to get her in it but once you figure it out it's easier. The material does stretch out like other people have said. But other than that it's a great little carrier. I also like that it's easy to pack in the diaper bag since the entire thing is just made of material, no straps or padding.
