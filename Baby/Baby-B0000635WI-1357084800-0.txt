review/summary: Highly recommendreview/text: This Leachco Snoogle is comfortable, been sleeping on mine for 6 months now and pretty soon when baby is born I will use it to wrap around and nurse! Good for more things than one ;) Helps support my hips, back and neck! I have lost all the hip pain from this pillow, life saver.
