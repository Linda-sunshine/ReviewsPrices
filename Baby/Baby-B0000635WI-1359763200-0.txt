review/summary: Good purchasereview/text: This pillow works well with my body.The pros: First, I never slept on my side before pregnancy and sleeping on my side started to become very uncomfortable. The pillow supports my back and legs while I use another pillow for my baby belly. I'm a girl hitting 230 so it helps me a lot.The cons- It's frustrating trying to turn or change positions with the pillow, but overall, it's a minor problem. And secondly the pillow case takes forever to get back on. But again, that's a minor problem.I reccomend this to any women who are having trouble sleeping.
