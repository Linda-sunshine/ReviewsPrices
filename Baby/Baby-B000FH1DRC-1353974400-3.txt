review/summary: Pampers all the way.review/text: My baby has transitioned to Size 3 now, but I've tried 2 other brands before this and both have either leaked or was plain useless. I've stuck with Pampers since and he's had no issues.I'm not sure how these are made versus the other brands, but this one holds up; even through the night. The blue line indicator is a nice little feature and the tabs hold up well.
