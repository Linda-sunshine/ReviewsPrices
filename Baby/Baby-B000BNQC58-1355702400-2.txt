review/summary: this is junk. don't buy it.review/text: I bought this for my 3 yr old daughter last year at this time. My daughter really liked this thing for about two weeks. After the 2nd week of use, one of the three colors quit working. In another week we were down to one color. And then none shortly thereafter. It has been broken on my workbench for months awaiting a repurpose craft project (whenever I figure out a project to use it for).
