review/summary: Thank goodness for the Itzbeenreview/text: At the hospital the nurses had us in the habit of tracking our sons feedings and diaper changes. When we got home we were doing this manually then I remembered hearing about the Itzbeen from a coworker. Im so glad I bought this! It's been so helpful and we would really be such a mess without it!
