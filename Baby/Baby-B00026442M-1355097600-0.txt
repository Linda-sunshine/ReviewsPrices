review/summary: Good price, good productreview/text: Overall the Pampers Baby Dry diapers are pretty good. They are a good price compared to Swaddlers or Cruisers. The big bummer is that I find the tabs don't stick well & tend to come undone at times, creating leaks. I used to get these from the Amazon Warehouse Deals, as they were a good price, but the customer service is HORRIBLE. I was sent a box that had been urinated on (I'm guessing by a dog) and returned to Amazon. They then sent it out as a Warehouse Deal. I don't need diapers that have already been pee'd on!
