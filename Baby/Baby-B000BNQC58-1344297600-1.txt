review/summary: So cute but horrible battery lifereview/text: I was so excited when I found a pink animal night light for my daughter's room and she loves it! I have had this for 45 days and the battery has already died several times. When you replace it, they never last more than a couple of days. It is a great product but make sure that you have a surplus of batteries on hand because of course you never realize that it is dying again until you turn it on for bedtime. My daughter will not go to sleep without it. It is very cute and durable and I would absolutely recommend this product just be aware of the one major downfall.
