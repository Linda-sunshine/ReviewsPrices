review/summary: My first grandson slept overreview/text: I only have one daughter and her family lives in Kentucky, so when they came to visit I had to make sure my grandson had a little place to sleep. This Pack n Play was perfect for him to sleep in while they were here. The price was perfect and the quality is excellent. Very happy with this purchase.
