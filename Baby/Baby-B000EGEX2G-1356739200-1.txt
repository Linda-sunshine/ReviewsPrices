review/summary: Nice Chairreview/text: It has a smooth rocking motion and the rocking ottoman is nice too. The assembly instructions could have been a little better but I got it together no problem. We rock our baby to sleep in it every night and in the middle of the night when she wakes up for feeding. Its comfortable and relaxing.
