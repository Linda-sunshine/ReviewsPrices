review/summary: I love pampersreview/text: I have been a Pampers mom since the birth of my firstborn. I like the baby dry better than the cruisers because these fit her better. They seem to be slimmer and longer (sits higher on the waist). We are nearly done with diapers for the older one now, but I will buy them again for the baby when she grows in to 5's
