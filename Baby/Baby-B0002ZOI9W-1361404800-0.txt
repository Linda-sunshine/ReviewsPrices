review/summary: Great for families with multiple young kidsreview/text: I have a 2 year old and a 5 month old and bought this because my toddler kept sitting in all his old baby toys to protest our family's new addition. I needed a bouncer that wouldn't break when he sat in it. Enter this little beauty. The first time my toddler sat on it, looked at me for signs of distress, and saw nothing but peace was a five star experience.
