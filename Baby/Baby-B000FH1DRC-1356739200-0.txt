review/summary: Perfume so overwhelming they were unusablereview/text: Had used swaddlers in the past b/c I loved the wetness indicator. Bought this economy box and have no idea why but these have a very strong powder scented perfume that makes my eyes water and itch and my nose run when I am in the same room with them. I don't normally have allergies either. What a waste of $50
