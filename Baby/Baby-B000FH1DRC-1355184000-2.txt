review/summary: Great productreview/text: This is a great product but I think that the number it contains is a bit much for a growing baby. Our little one has grown SO fast that I'm still trying to squeeze her into a size 1 diaper, when I think that a size 2 would fit her much more comfortably. :-) Not Pampers fault, but now I have a lot of left over diapers.
