review/summary: Great funreview/text: My son loved bouncing on this Jumperoo. He used it since he was 8 months old for the next 3 months. We could leave him in there playing and discovering for 10-20 min daily. The music is bearable and volume is adjustable. The height is also adjustable to suit the age.
