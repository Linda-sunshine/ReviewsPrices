review/summary: Awesome, compact, and easy to clean chair!review/text: This high chair is wonderful! The tray and chair back fold in to make it easy to take for a trip. The adjustable seat height is nice so that it will work with your table. AND, the best part, it is so easy to clean. In our dining room chairs it is a little low so our dogs get a little closer to his food than I'd like but that's b/c of our chairs and not b/c of this chair. It's the perfect seat! And he can continue to use it when he only needs a booster seat.
