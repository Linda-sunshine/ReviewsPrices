review/summary: Love itreview/text: We love the pampers swaddlers there nice and soft. Our favorite feature is the line that lets you know when it's time to change them! My husband loves that line! Most importantly they can hold up. I've never had leak out or poop out! I just wish they made them in sizes 4 and 5!
