review/summary: Easy to Use and Compactreview/text: Our Son likes being in the Bjorn, especially facing in (he even get sleep for hours in it). This carrier is easy to put on and take off and quite condensed. He is still two months so I am not sure if it will be this comfortable as right now if he is already over 15 lbs.What I like having it is that I can go for walks and get errands finished around the house. I tried it at the store and at the mall, but after a while my back started hurting. My son was actually pretty happy in it. My husband wore it a few times to and he said it was comfortable.
