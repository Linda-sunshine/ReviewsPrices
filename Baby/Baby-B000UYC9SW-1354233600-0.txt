review/summary: Worked but tricky....review/text: I've tried slings, baby hawkes, those Bjorn type carriers....I'm a petite 5'1 and most times, carriers are too big. The two carriers that I absolutely love are the baby hawk and this. Baby hawks are similar but let me review this carrier. Its made of tshirt material and looks like an infinity scarf when you put it over your head and around your neck. I ordered it in xsmall and have washed it several times. It hasn't shrank. You definitely have to watch the video to get how to use it. Once you understand how it works, it's easy. It is easy on the shoulders as long as you spread the material out. It isn't figure flattering because I feel like I have major muffin top going on when I tie the support fabric around me. Who cares! I have a quiet sleeping baby and I can finally grocery shop in peace! If your baby doesn't like to be held, this may not be for you. But if your baby is a snuggle bug, this is the perfect rug to bundle her up in.
