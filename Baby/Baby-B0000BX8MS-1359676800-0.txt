review/summary: X-Large is too largereview/text: I love the Halo sleepsacks in general, but the extra large is just enormous. My child is one year, and I thought the X-Large would be good for 1 year to 18 months. Intsead, it looks better suited to a 2-year-old. I returned it and got a large, which is great.
