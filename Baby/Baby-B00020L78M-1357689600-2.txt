review/summary: just another baby product that is crapreview/text: this was the first play yard my wife and i purchased for our one year old. Guess what after opening and closing the play yard a few times the product broke at one of the joints. Like allot of people have said the product is light and flimsy. Besides if you do not want your child to climb out of the gate dont buy this product. So instead we purchased another gate system that we returned and finally settled on the north states gate system 3 in 1 metal. buy this instead
