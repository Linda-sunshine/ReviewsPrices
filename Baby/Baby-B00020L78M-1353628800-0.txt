review/summary: Safety Hazard!!!review/text: I bought this item about a month ago and really have loved i it. A nice spacious area for my 6 month old to play in safely....until I tried to fold it back down to travel for the holidays. The 8 panels are connected with joints. Unfortunately, in trying to fold the joints, the panels did not fold at the joints, instead the plastic seemed to just snap. This happened in 6 of the 8 panels. It produces sharp shards of plastic. Clearly not something that is safe for use around a child.I am disappointed because it was great having a large area for my daughter to play in. But, it certainly does not open up easily or fold down without issue.Back to looking for another safe play yard!!
