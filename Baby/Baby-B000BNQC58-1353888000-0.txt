review/summary: what i expected and morereview/text: i had been looking at this toy since before my daughter was born and i got it for her first christmas. i know its rated for age 3 and up but it is a pretty amazing nightlight for now. i love that it changes color and you get a little book that shows and explains all the constellations and has a cute little story about the twilight ladybug itself.
