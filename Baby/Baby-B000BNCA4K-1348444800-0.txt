review/summary: Proud Grammareview/text: I bought this toy for my 4 month old granddaughter.She loves it and it goes everywhere with her. It is small enough for her to hang on to and she chews on it steady. She is now 6 months and teething so this toy is a life saver. I would recommend this toy for any infant. It is the best.
