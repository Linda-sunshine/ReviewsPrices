review/summary: Simple yet geniusreview/text: Awesome device for new parents even for experienced parents like myself. Sleep deprivation is physically and mentally straining. With my first son, I wrote everything down. This little device helps you remember when was the last time you fed, diapered, slept and for me, pumped last. It's cute, small, simple. Husband loves it. A must buy! You won't regret it.
