review/summary: cutest thingreview/text: We have a video of my grand daughter at nine months trucking across the room walking with this toy. So cute. It was only a few more weeks and she could walk on her own. She is 14 months now and still plays with the shapes and levers on the front of it. Every now and then she will still use it as a walker. I suppose she thinks it is like daddy's lawn mower. We also are still on the first set of batteries. When she started standing up and walking around the edges of furniture I went looking for a toy for her to use as a walker. This was a good choice.I am allowed to mention that I am published by Amazon.
