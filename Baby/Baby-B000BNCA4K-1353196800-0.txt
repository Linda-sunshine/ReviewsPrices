review/summary: Hours of enjoymentreview/text: I purchased this toy so my son (approximately 6 months old) would have a new toy to keep him entertained during a two-day car ride. He really enjoyed the toy both during the car trip and afterwards. While he can't really tell me how great it is, he did want to continue playing with it after the car trip, which I take as a good sign!From a mom's point of view, I really like the toy because it is easy to wipe down and because it doesn't have any sharp edges.
