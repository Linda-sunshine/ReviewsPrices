review/summary: Great for Sensitive Bumsreview/text: We're so glad that we got a subscription to these wipes! Our son has very sensitive skin, and we found that out when we first started using Kirkland wipes, which caused major irritation. After Kirkland, we used Babyganics, but those still irritated my son's bum. Also, we didn't like the rough texture of those wipes. After Babyganics, we tried Pampers Sensitive, and although a little bit better than the previous two, our son's skin still became irritated. One thing we disliked about Pampers Sensitive was the wetness of their wipes. We would have to use a tissue to wipe off the excess moisture, which sealed the wipes together (hard to separate from the package). Finally, we decided Seventh Generation Free & Clear Baby Wipes. We noticed a visible difference in our son's skin within a day - no joke! The moisture in the wipes is perfect - not saturated but just enough to gently wipe and clean. The texture is nice and soft, too. I've used the wipes even on my son's face, and no irritation. My husband doesn't like the smell even though the wipes are supposed to be fragrance-free, but I have a sensitive nose and don't mind it at all.
