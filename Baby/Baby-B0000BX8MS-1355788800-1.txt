review/summary: Peace of Mindreview/text: These are a great product. My son grew out of a swaddle quickly. These are an excellent alternative. He rolls and turns all night in bed with no chance of this getting over his face. I initially bought a larger size thinking he could grow into it. I don't recommend. Buy the size your child needs otherwise it defeats the purpose of a safe blanket.
