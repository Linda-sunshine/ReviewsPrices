review/summary: like all diaper brands, they leak - but whatever...review/text: as a mom of 2-year-old triplets - the chances of at least 1 or 2 of my kids at least once per day will leak through these, but out of all of the brands we like these the best. There is just no fool proof diaper out there, sadly.
