review/summary: Xsmall buyers beware!review/text: I rarely write product reviews, but had to comment about the sizing regarding this product. I am 3 months post pregnant, 5"1 and currently weighing 115lbs. I ordered the xsmall as recommended. I don't know if it's just my big baby (17lbs at 3 months) but the fit is way too small & tight. I also can't see how this product can last up to 35lbs. I ordered this to use just around the house to wear for short periods of time. I tried placing my baby in it for not even 5 minutes, to only have her start squirming uncomfortably & crying. The fabric dug into my baby's shoulders and chubby thighs. I have already washed it so I can not even exchange this for a bigger size. I tried to manually stretch it out, but it was still too tight. I wish that I could have tried a size small instead. But I know that this this type of carrier is more suitable for lighter babies, so perhaps that's why it didn't work out for me. If you have a newborn or smaller baby this might work, but keep in mind that the sizing the company recommends based on weight/height is a little tricky.
