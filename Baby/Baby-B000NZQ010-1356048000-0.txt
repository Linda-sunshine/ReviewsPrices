review/summary: Great for Little Ones Just Learning to Walkreview/text: I purchased this for my 10 month old granddaughter. She loved it :) I liked this one over other toys that help to learn to walk because it does not tip easily. Some tip over when they are trying to stand or if they turn a corner to quickly but this one stayed stable even with the play center off.The play center is a great separate toy with lots to keep little ones interested.I will definitely be buying this one again in a few months for our new grandson,
