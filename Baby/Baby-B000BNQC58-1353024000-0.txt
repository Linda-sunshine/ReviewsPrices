review/summary: We don't have bedtime without his turtle!review/text: I bought the turtle for my son when he was about one years old and its a year and a half later and he still loves it. It has become a part of his night time routine to turn it on and put it against the wall. He rotates it to see the stars turn and move the turtle to make the stars smaller and larger. It has an auto shutoff which is nice. But Be forewarned parents, your child may wake up in the middle of the night and cry to have you it on again.
