review/summary: Best baby toy ever!review/text: Buy this. It is so much better than other bouncer/jumpers because the seat actually moves so it's comfortable. My baby was not interested in toys at all, just wanted to look at people. He would push toys away, but he is obsessed with this! We put together a bounce bounce baby after so we could have one in the kitchen and he hates it. There is no way he will ever like anything as much as he loves this jumperoo! Absolutely awesome!
