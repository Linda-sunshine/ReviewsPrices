review/summary: worth the $review/text: This play yard is worth the money! My husband and I purchased it for our 7 month old son. We use it to block parts of the home we do not want him exploring such as the fire place. The panels are easily attached or detached to cover wide areas or narrow doorways. It is the only product that I found that could cover the area we needed without having to buy several of the flimsy little wooden gates.
