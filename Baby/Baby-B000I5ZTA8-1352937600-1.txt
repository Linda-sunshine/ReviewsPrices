review/summary: Simple and Effectivereview/text: One of the best maternity purchases made. I wore this every day, especially around the house or when wearing non-maternity clothes. I carried low and all of my gained weight gain seemed to be front and center. I really needed the support to help relieve pressure and the feeling of my skin stretching. It seemed to help lower back pain, too. It is super soft on the inside and really easy to use. It was firm yet had lots of give. I adjusted the position based on how I was feeling and it always stayed in place. Sometimes when I was sitting I would feel pressure under my bump and if it was bothering me I would simply pull the band over the top of my belly. Not noticeable under my cloths, but I do not wear lots of super snug clothes, either. Hard to believe that such a simple elastic band could do so much good, but it really does!
