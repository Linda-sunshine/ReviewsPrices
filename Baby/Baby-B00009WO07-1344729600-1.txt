review/summary: Pampers Economy Pack Plusreview/text: When my Grandbaby is happy. I'm happy. I've always liked Pampers for many years with my kids and now I'm using them for my Grandbabies. The Pampers Economy Pack Plus is really nice. Why? Because it keeps me from running back to the store which save me gas money and it's also saves me money going with the Economy Pack Plus. Thank you Pampers for being there when we need you. =)
