review/summary: Very Cutereview/text: This was as cute in the picture as in person. I like that the shell changes colors with the stars. Its super soft and I like that it has a switch in the bottom that turns it off so the buttons on the top don't get accidentally turned on.(you can't tell by the picture, but the back has 4 buttons, a little moon to turn it on and 3 round buttons to change the color. I also like that the batteries are beneath a latch that is screwed in so my kids can't get them out and lose them. Its a little smaller than the DreamLites but I like the design better. The stars shine sharp and fill the whole room - walls and ceiling. The only complaint I have is that there is a slight delay when you push each button to change colors. Nothing is wrong with that, its just the design of the electrical system. Very happy with the purchase.
