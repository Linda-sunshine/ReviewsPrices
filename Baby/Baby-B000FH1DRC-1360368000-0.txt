review/summary: Roomier and Less Leaks Than Pampers Baby Dryreview/text: I have used both Pampers Swaddlers and Baby Dry for my newborn. I have never had a leak with Swaddlers (with Baby Dry newborn liquid poop often shot right up the back of the diaper and onto baby's outfit) and the same size in the Swaddler style seems to be a lot roomier than the Baby Dry style. There is a slim indicator strip on the front of the diapers to indicate whether they are wet inside but to be honest by the time I have taken pants off or opened up the onesie to allow me to see the indicator I am already pretty much clear the diaper is wet. One complaint is that the top layer of the inside of the diaper has netting that wicks away moisture (to avoid leaks and keep baby's bottom dry) but also serves to dry poop bits which makes them stick to baby's butt. Cleaning takes more time because you aren't just wiping; you are also scrubbing dried poop bits.
