review/summary: Perfect for petsreview/text: Great product to use for pets! My pug now has his little play area safe and sound away from any electronics, wires, or anything else harmful to him. And as always, I could rely on Amazon to deliver on time and it made its way to Guam without any damage to the product.Pros: Helpful and useful for pets.Cons: A little flimsy, but its plastic so what would you expect. If you are looking for something more sturdy or solid in frame, shop for a wooden or metal version of the play yard or other products similar.Thank you Amazon!
