review/summary: Love it!review/text: After having a very hard time sleeping during pregnancy and onset of sciatic nerve issues during my first trimester, I purchased this pillow. It is very good! I use another pillow below it for my head, and use the below portion between both legs and the edge to support my growing belly. The pillow is very comfortable, and I sleep better. It also provides back support. During the second trimester, doctors recommend sleeping on the left side. This pillow is great for that. Sometimes I turn over my back because sleeping on my left with my arms hanging out causes squeezing of lungs and makes it hard to breathe, so I tend to turn on my back a bit while sleeping which is not good for the baby. The back support here prevents me from laying completely on my back. I only wish the back support were a bit firmer, it would have provided more support. Also, having the lower portion between the legs causes a bit of strain since there is only enough to go between the thighs, since the rest of my legs are at a different angle it causes pain and strain. I use another pillow below this one between the legs but it keeps coming off, so that is the only change I would have preferred. Overall I sleep better with this than without it. It comes with a piece of paper with instructions on various seating and sleeping positions, the seating positions are not that comfortable.
