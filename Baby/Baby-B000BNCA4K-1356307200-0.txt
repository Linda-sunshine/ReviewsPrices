review/summary: Not for babies 6+ monthsreview/text: This is a cute toy- it is very similar to the 0-ball rattle in that a young baby can grasp it easily as soon as they are physically able. however, like the o-ball rattle my son is no longer interested in this toy. It was useful for maybe only a few months. If you're looking for toys that will keep babies interest as they grow this isn't it.
