review/summary: Best Diapersreview/text: Among the Pampers Swaddlers, Costco Kirkland, and Huggies Snug and dry, this is so far the best and I am 100% satisfied and don't even want to try other brands. It is the softest one, even better than Pampers Swaddlers. It smells good but I think a little bit too strong. Use it for my baby day and night. Don't even to buy the night diapers. It is pretty dry even after the whole night.
