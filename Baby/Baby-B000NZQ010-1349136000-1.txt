review/summary: Best Sit to Stand Walker!review/text: My mom purchased another sit to stand walker and it is not very sturdy but this one is great. Panel can be removed for play without the walker. Purchased this for my son when he was 8 months old and even though he could not walk he quickly mastered pushing this around the house. We have alot of laminate flooring and it's perfect for him. He is almost 10 months old now and loves to push it around and around. Very sturdy, very colorful.
