review/summary: My daughter loves it!review/text: We just got this for our 9-month-old daughter, and she really likes it. She is pulling herself up and walking using the couch or her crib, so we figured she'd be ready for something like this to help her out. She likes the songs and all the little buttons and things to play with - it keeps her entertained for some time. She likes pushing it back and forth, and is starting to use it to walk around. I'm sure she will use the walker more as she gets a bit steadier on her feet.The only thing I will say about this is it will roll pretty quick, even across carpet. So you just have to determine if your baby is steady/strong enough to use the walker without falling too much. It's fine for my daughter, but I could see it being a slight problem for babies that aren't quite ready. But even if they're not ready for the walker, the detachable activity part is great for just playing on the floor.
