review/summary: Not safereview/text: I had to take this away from my son because it would tip over backwards. It was otherwise really nice and he loved the activities and songs on it, but I would strongly urge you not to buy it. After the second time my son tried to pull himself up with it to walk around and ended up smacking his head on the ground because it tipped right over on top of him, I decided it had been a waste of money.
