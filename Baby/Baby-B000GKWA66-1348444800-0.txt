review/summary: It's Magic! The One thing you NEED to get for baby!!review/text: I purchased this based on reviews and because I wanted something that had white noise on it for my newborn. He is only 5 weeks and has colic and gas problems. This was the best thing ever and as soon as I turn it on he goes to sleep within 2 minutes or less. Last night he was fussy and it put him to sleep in 5 seconds (not exaggerating in the slightest).Pros:1. It has other melodies besides white noise, which my little guy loves as well. (4 total sounds)2. The batteries last a long time! (we use this at every nap time and all throughout the night for 3 weeks now and have not changed batteries once!)3. It has a VOLUME CONTROL! (this is great for when the other kids are really loud, and it doesn't get too loud that it might hurt his ears being next to it).4. LOVE the 23 and 45 minute timer. We never use the 23 minute one :) And are thankful that there is 45 minutes of noise for him to last throughout his naps!5. Love the Velcro loop so that we can hang it and carry it by that too. My husband has been known to loop it around his belt loop while he carries the little guy around when he is in one of his colicky hours. :)Cons:I really can't think of one. I know that sounds crazy...maybe when I wash it the mane might ball up, but that is the only thing that I foresee that might be an issue (but haven't washed yet, so I can't for sure say that it would even be an issue).In Summary; this is the best thing that I have ever purchased for any of my children, and really wish that I had found this with the other kids instead of my last one. :( But thank goodness that I found it now!! If you get anything for your new little one, or have a colicky baby, please give this a try, we did and we are sooooo thankful for it!! :)
