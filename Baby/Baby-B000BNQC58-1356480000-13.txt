review/summary: Adorablereview/text: This item is better quality than its popular counterpart - Dreamlites. Its not as cheap looking, its softer and the range of &#34;stars&#34; is greater. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 instead of a 4 is because I was expecting actual constellations. In reality, it's just star shapes and crescent moons. Still very charming, and helps my little one sleep in the dark.
