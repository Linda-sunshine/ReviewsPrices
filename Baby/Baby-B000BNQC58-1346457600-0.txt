review/summary: eased the transition to the cribreview/text: At 17 months, our daughter still slept with us and woke up several times per night to nurse. We are expecting another baby in a few months, so needed to get her in her own bed and sleeping through the night. We used The Happiest Baby Guide to Great Sleep by Dr. Harvey Karp to make this switch. Karp recommends a lovey and a nightlight (among other things). We didn't have either, so we bought the Twilight Turtle to fill these roles. Our daughter LOVES Twilight Turtle! We put the turtle in her crib with her at night so that she can turn it on as needed (I realize the age says 3+ but not really sure why...the battery cage needs to be unscrewed with a screwdriver and there are no small parts). She also asks to play with the turtle during the day (the stars show up in daylight at close range). It's true that the constellations are hard to find and that amber doesn't show up very well; despite this, the turtle serves its purpose for us. Definitely buying a second for baby number 2!
