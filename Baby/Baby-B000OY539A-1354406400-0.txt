review/summary: Entirely too complicatedreview/text: This was entirely too complicated use it a whopping 2 times. I would spend 20 minutes each time trying to place it and my baby correctly and still did not feel safe carrying her around in it. Conceptually it seems awesome, but way too much work than i really want to spend when there are other products that are cheaper, faster, easier, and that my baby liked more. I preferred a baby carrier instead.
