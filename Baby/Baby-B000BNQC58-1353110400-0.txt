review/summary: GREAT AS LONG AS IT'S CLOUD B BRANDreview/text: I purchased two of these and in searching the reviews, I learned that there is a "knock off" brand being being sold in some stores - such as Walmart and CVS - not sure of other locations. MAKE SURE YOU BUY THE CLOUD B BRAND or you'll be sadly disappointed. The others are poorly made and just look cheap. Amazingly, the prices are not that different. But, the Cloud B. brand is well made and marked on the box. I couldn't wait for it to get dark that night so I could try them out. I have to say, I could see why some adults admitted in their reviews to buying them for their own beds!! The stars are very well defined and all but one of the colors are very defined and clear. The red stars are not as easy to make out, but they become more clear as your eyes adjust. The other stars light up the ceiling and the upper part of the walls extremely well and my grandchildren will LOVE them. Don't think these are cuddly little pillows - they are not. The backs have a hard shell from which the stars emminate while the bottom, head and legs are soft to hold. They seem to work best if they are placed toward the middle, to the end of the bed; depending on where the bed is placed in the room.You can actually find the constellations by using the book that accompanies each animal. I can't wait for my Grandchildren to see these. They've been asking for them since they were first advertised. You push each button to change the star colors and one button adds a moon shape. (THE KNOCK OFF'S DO NOT HAVE THE OPTION FOR THE MOON)I would also recommend them for babies since they can be placed away from the crib so there is no danger to a child - only a soothing light shining on the ceiling. They don't move or make music and they go off automatically in 45 minutes if you don't turn them off. You won't be disappointed in this product IF you buy Cloud B. I would not put them in a baby's crib.
