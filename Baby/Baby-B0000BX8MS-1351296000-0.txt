review/summary: Great blanket for babies and toddlersreview/text: We have used these sleepsacks for both our first and second kid. We think they help our kids sleep longer at night (both our kids sleep about 10-12 hours a night) because they can't lose the blanket and wake up cold since it is zipped on. I would highly recommend this product for anyone with babies or toddlers.
