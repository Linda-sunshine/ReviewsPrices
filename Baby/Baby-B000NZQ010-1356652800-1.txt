review/summary: LOVE ITreview/text: THIS IS THE FIRST TOY MY GRANDSON PLAYED WITH OUT OF ALL HIS CHRISTMAS PRESENTS. HE IS ONLY 6 MONTHS OLD, SO WE LEFT IT IN THE FLAT POSITION. HIS DADDY SAT WITH HIM, AND HE PLAYED WITH IT, AND REALLY ENJOYED IT. I'M SURE IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A GREAT INVESTMENT, AS HE GETS OLDER, AND WE PUT IT IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION.
