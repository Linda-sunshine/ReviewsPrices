review/summary: Great 2-in-1 toyreview/text: My almost 9 month old loves playing with this toy, which is detachable from the walker. It is basically two games in one. He can sit on the floor and play with the game, and he can also practice his early walking skills by standing behind the walker and pushing it along. I love that the wheels on this walker have two speeds - pretty tight and slow for early walkers and normal speed for more advanced walkers.
