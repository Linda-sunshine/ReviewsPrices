review/summary: Huggies are greatreview/text: I've been using Huggies for the most part since my now 14 month old son was born and we have not had any problems with the quality or price. The Snug & Dry are especially good for nighttime once your baby is sleeping through the night. These kept my son's PJs and bottom dry after about 12 hours use overnight when my son started sleeping through the night.
