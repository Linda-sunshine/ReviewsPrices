review/summary: Best toy for the money!review/text: I waited to get this walker because I was actually duped into thinking cost has some reflection on the quality of an item. This is a great toy! It is totally interactive and teaches colors, shapes, songs, animals and their sounds, and more! My Little One is practicing standing so we haven't used this as walker fully yet but out of all of her Christmas gifts from Santa this is one she just can't take her eyes off of! I was able to get it as a daily deal and it was a steal! I am probably going to purchase a second for my mom's house for when we visit during the week, yes it's that super :-) You won't be disappointed!!!
