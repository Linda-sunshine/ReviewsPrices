review/summary: Easy to usereview/text: I tried every carrier I could get my hands on, an ergo, moby, jelly bean and a couple of other slings. This was the only one that was easy to use and my baby liked. I think the ergo will be useful with an older child, but we were able to use the k'tan starting at a month and have just graduated to the adventure position at 10 weeks. The design is very easy to use.
