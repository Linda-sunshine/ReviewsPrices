review/summary: like itreview/text: I have a mixed feeling about this carrier. I purchased this carrier after I found out I can use this carrier for a newborn. I carried my baby around and did house chores. At first my baby fussed and cried, but eventually she fell asleep after I carried her around about ten minutes.I also walked about a mile carrying her in this carrier. She slept the whole time I was walking and it was comfortable to carry her. However, my back starts to hurt as my baby getting heavier. My baby weighs over 12 lbs now and after carrying her about ten minutes my back starts to hurt. The pain lasts the whole day. TO be fair I do not have a strong back, so that could tribute to the back pain. I do like this carrier, but I don't know if I can use this carrier anymore because of the back pain.
