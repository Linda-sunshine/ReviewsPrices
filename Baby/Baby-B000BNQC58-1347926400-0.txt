review/summary: Roofeneareview/text: I bought this for my four year old daughter for her birthday and she has absolutely loved it. Good quality, love the 45 min. self turn off feature and choice of three colors of lights. The stars are pretty and even though I wish they were more familiar consellations, like the big dipper, etc., it is still interesting to find the ones they do show. I would purchase it again.
