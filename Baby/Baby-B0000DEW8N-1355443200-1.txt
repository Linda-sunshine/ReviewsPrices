review/summary: Perfect seat for a growing toddlerreview/text: Our two year old was getting tired of sitting in his high chair, but wasn't tall enough to sit in a regular chair. This booster seat is the perfect compromise. We have it set to the lowest setting and he is able to sit right at the table (without the tray) and eat with everyone else. The straps make it super secure on the chair, but it also seems pretty easy to take along with us when traveling. Great product and a great value.
