review/summary: Pampers makes.our babies screamreview/text: I really wanted these to work, as our hospital uses these diapers. We tried them at home with both of our young sons. However, we would find them waking up frequently screaming and crying. It took a while to figure out that the problem was the diaper. Peeing into these diapers was waking them up. Once we changed diaper brands, the screaming immediately stopped.I write this not so much to complain about Pampers as to advise new parents to consider that a possible source of their very young child's crying and interrupted sleep could be the particular type of diaper the baby wears. Every child is different. I am still on quest to find a reliable diaper for baby #2. We've tried at least 10 brands, and every one has issues. However, Pampers is the only one to provoke screaming.I give Pampers one star for the very helpful wetness indicator and one star because the overall quality seems decent. They just don't work for us. Good luck in your quest to find a diaper that suits your needs. If you are unsure, try a small pack first.
