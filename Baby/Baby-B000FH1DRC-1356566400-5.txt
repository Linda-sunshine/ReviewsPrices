review/summary: Not as good as the Swaddlers supplied by the hospitalreview/text: The Swaddlers we received when we ordered from Amazon are not the same as the Swaddlers package supplied by the hospital.The purchased Swaddlers are thinner, they do not have as much absorbent material and have a much stronger scent. My wife found the scent to be intolerably strong. The packaging is exactly the same as the hospital supplied diapers, but the product is not as good.
