review/summary: Easy assemblyreview/text: We gave this to our God daughter for Christmas. She is just learning to pull up. She enjoyed sitting in front of this and playing. She and her older brother like standing up behind it as well. It has lots of different features. It was simple enough to put together that her mom did it in only a couple of minutes. It isn't massive either; so it is easy to store and doesn't take up a ton of space.
