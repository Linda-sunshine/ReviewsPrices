review/summary: Good Product over all, Fast and timely deliveryreview/text: gave it only 4 stars,The Graco Pack N Play Playard with Bassinet, Pasadena came with a thinly made &#34;mattress&#34; which consisted of a piece of cardboard covered with fabric. Would highly suggest purchasing the Dream On Me 3&#34; Foam Playard Mattress for the playard. It fit perfectly.Hanging toy bar consisted of (3) stuffed fabric stars - which attached flimsily with small strip of Velcro.All in all, effective as a travel bed, good colors, but no frills.
