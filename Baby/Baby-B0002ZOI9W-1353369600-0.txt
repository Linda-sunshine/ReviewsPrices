review/summary: Real good Chairreview/text: Better than bouncer for my 4 month baby, He has a typical bouncer but starts to weight too much for it, then this chair comes to the rescue, when he fall sleep just lift the front tube and make a little bed, is light weight easy to carry to my friends house without problem, easy to clean at washer and dry fast on low heat dryer, nice quality, nice toys, it can be use to feed him or see his favorite tv show (Mickey) mantain my baby safe meanwhile I take a bath or cook with security belt.
