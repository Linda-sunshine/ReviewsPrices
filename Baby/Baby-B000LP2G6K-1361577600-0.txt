review/summary: Good productreview/text: We recently started daycare for our Grandchild when her mother returned to work. We purchased this Graco Pack N Play Playard with Bassinet along with other items to assist us in her care. As our Grandchild is only 3 months old, right now we are using primarily the bassinet. It is wonderful. You can rock it gently to assist with baby falling asleep. It provides a safe place for naps and play if I must briefly turn my attention to something else. It is secure and safe. Easy to assemble and disassemble. I recommend this product.
