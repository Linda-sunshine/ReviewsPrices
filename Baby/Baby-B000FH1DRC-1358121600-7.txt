review/summary: These diapers are greatreview/text: Been using &#34;swaddlers&#34; since my daughter was born and have never had an issue. Having the blue line indicator is helpful too. We tried two other types of diapers in a pinch, and both didn't fit very well and seemed uncomfortable. These fit well and stay in place
