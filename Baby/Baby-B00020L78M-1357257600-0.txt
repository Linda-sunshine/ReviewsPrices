review/summary: Versatile! More than I expected.review/text: I bought the 8-panel Superyard Play yard thinking my 9-mo old could play in there while I cook dinner. However, upon receiving it, I realized it was WAY too big for our dining room. However, rather than send it back, I broke it down to a 6-panel or oftentimes two 4-panels. I use it in the restroom while I dress. I also use it to surround the cat food and/or litter boxes to keep my little one away. I am amazed at its versatility and feel it was a fantastic steal.
