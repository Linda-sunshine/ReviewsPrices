review/summary: These are not normal Swaddlers - no blue linereview/text: I ordered these thinking they were the regular Swaddlers, which they are not. Found they didn't have the awesome blue line wetness indicator, and said "OH HELL NO". So I returned them.Are way softer than the normal Swaddlers, which is OK, but I don't really like them. They almost felt mushy to me.I'm sure they work as a diaper, but man that wetness indicator is nice to have!
