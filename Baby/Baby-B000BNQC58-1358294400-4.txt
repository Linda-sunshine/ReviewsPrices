review/summary: Sure Thingreview/text: Each of my three year old nieces got one of these Night Lights when they were born. They now put them in the bed with them. Still loving the stars. My newest niece is only 6 months, but she is also fascinated by the light show. Well made, cute and popular. Very good choice for a newborn or later.
