review/summary: Great play yardreview/text: This is the second Graco Pack 'n play play yard I have bought for my grandchildren. We keep one at our house for visits, and it works out well. It packs up into a compact size and is easy to store between visits in the stuff bag. My grandchildren are ages 4 and 11 months, and it is a good size for both.
