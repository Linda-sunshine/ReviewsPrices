review/summary: A great playard and a bed!review/text: i bought it for my son, he's 4 months now. he LOVES this bed and sleeps there perfectly. me and my wife LOVE this thing because it's light, easy to move arround and VERY easy to setup and pack!guys, if you are looking for something that will be great for you and your kid, get it!the only disadvantage i got was the smell of plastic... but i set it up, left it standing there for about a week without my son being there and the smell was gone. in fact, mopping it with a wet soft cloth helped a big deal. have a great one! :)
