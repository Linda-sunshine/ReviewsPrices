review/summary: Daughter loves itreview/text: My daughter has been playing with this since she was 8 months old and loved the part that pops off that has all the buttons and other games on it. She is now starting to stand and has taken a couple steps with it. She gets really excited when playing with this either sitting, kneeling or standing.
