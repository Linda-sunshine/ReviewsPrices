review/summary: Very dissappointed - not all Pampers are made the samereview/text: We had experience using the Pampers Swaddlers and thought that we would try the Dry. My son is almost 20lbs and these days he likes to roll around a lot. These diapers have poor absorbancy and they are constantly leaking. I am very careful whenever I put diapers on. The Velcro must meet each other in the front and I make sure everything fits securing around the back, legs and hip. These diapers will do it's job during the day time. But during the night time (when my son sleeps on his tummy off and on), they will leak. Every morning when I go change these, the pee is up to this chest. I have to change his clothes every single morning. Extremely frustrating.Prior to using these, I was using the Kirkland (Costco) size 3 ones which was actually doing a fantastic job. Me being curious and always trying to find something a little better, decided to try Pampers Dry. Can't wait until the package is done, then I will for sure go back to Kirkland.
