review/summary: The best carrier on the market hands downreview/text: I got this because I wanted something that I could use as a sort of seatbelt for my son on an airplane trip. Something that I could still nurse him in and carry him in between flights. Well I'm smitten with this! It has so many different position options, it's so comfortable to wear, and my son loves it! I had some concern with size. In the "adventure" position it feels like my son sits pretty low. I contacted customer service through the companyand they were so helpful. Ultimately I decided to stick with the large size as I think I'm currently inbetween sizes. He sits fine in all the other positions and it's pretty snug. Plus my son is 21 LBS plus so I figure that must play into the fit. I'm a size 14 in jeans at the moment.I love the portability of this. I love the pouch and the ease of use. I would definitely recommend this to anyone on the carrier hunt!
