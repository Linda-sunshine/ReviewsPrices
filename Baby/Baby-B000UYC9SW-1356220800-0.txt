review/summary: Nice so far!review/text: So far I really like it. The only problem is that my baby needs to grow into it. I noticed that it is a size 6-8 and I'm a size 4 (depending on you know...the company or what have you) so it's a bit big for him right now. He is 7 and a half pounds and leans out just a little too far for me to feel comfortable wearing it all the time. It has been great for a short while, when I needed both hands and my son didn't want to be put down. I think I will be using this a lot more when he gets a little bigger and fills it out more.
