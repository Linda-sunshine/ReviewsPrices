review/summary: Best carrier ever !!! Love itreview/text: This is the best item I bought ever for my baby. Everyone including my baby likes this product. Its so comfortable that you do not even realize the weight of the baby. It is enough cushiony that my baby loves to be inside too. Best carrier if you are taking your baby out for a walk or when you want to use your both hands while carrying baby. I surely recommend this product and brand above any other based on my experience. Some of the best features are, head support for newborn, adjustable straps, adjustable carrier size, extra protection, ease of loading the baby and taking out, ease of plugging the carrier once baby is on the carrier. I surely recommend watching this product video, as it gives some tips to get the baby into the carrier.
