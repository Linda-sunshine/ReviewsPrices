review/summary: Too complicatedreview/text: I bought this because of all the great reviews. When I received mine, I was surprised at how complicated and time consuming it is to put on. It is basically a long piece of fabric that you need to wrap around yourself. Since a lot of parents seem to be happy with this sling, I'm wondering if it's just me that finds it too fussy to use. Being made of cotton, I can see how this can be comfortable for the baby. However, if you are like me who wants to put a sling on easily and quickly, I would suggest going the Baby Bjorn route.
