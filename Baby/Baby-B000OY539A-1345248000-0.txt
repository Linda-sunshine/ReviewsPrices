review/summary: Loooooong learning curve..review/text: My daughter is still settling down from 3 failed attempts. I am a very coordinated guy. I can figure out anything. I swear I can pack 3 car loads of groceries into one.I watched the videos then tried to get her in. Mind you she is a very quiet baby, cries only for the basics, diaper, hungry ect. First try she was upset, second she was distraught, third she was clearly pissed.If you can figure this out your a genius. God bless you and the week you took to do it.I gave it two stars because I found a wonderful use for it. I cut it up into blanket sizes and the elastic properties make them into wonderful swaddles. Heck I might just by more for that. I mean it is what 15 feet long.
