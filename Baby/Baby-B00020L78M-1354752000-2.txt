review/summary: Plastic seems a bit flimsyreview/text: The gate is a bit long and the panels feel kind of cheap. Mine was shipped to me damaged and i had to get a replacement. Overall, ive been using this product for a few weeks now and it does its job. I recommend this product if you have a big indoor space for your kids/pets or its a good playpen to take with you outside. Its a bit on the heavy side so pls becareful
