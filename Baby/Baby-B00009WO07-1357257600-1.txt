review/summary: Baby dry is not as good as swaddlersreview/text: I was a new mom and therefore pretty tired. I didn't notice that there was a difference between baby dry and swaddlers and accidentally bought baby dry. They are more plastic and didn't seem to let my baby's skin breathe nearly as well as the swaddlers. I won't buy the baby dry again!
