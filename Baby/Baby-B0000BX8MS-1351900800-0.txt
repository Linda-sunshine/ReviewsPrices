review/summary: Safer for babyreview/text: I bought this because my 4-month old didn't stay warm enough in heavy pajamas alone, but kept getting tangled in the blankets when I used them. I found him a couple of times with the blanket wrapped around his head or neck. I was worried about his safety. This was the perfect solution! He has worn this every night for the past four months. There is no way for him to get it over his face and it keeps him warm. My only criticism is that after a wash or two the material is not as soft.
