review/summary: Good Training Pottyreview/text: We got this for our 14 month old boy and he quickly got accustomed to using this. It is very easy to clean and is low enough to be very comfortable. He grew too tall for it within six months and we had to get him to the baby potty seat, which was another training curve. I liked the product.
