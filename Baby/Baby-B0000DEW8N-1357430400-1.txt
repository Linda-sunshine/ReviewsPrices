review/summary: Best thing ever!review/text: This booster seat is great! It's compact and easy to take with us. When we go over to someone's house who doesn't have a high chair, we have our own!Best of all, it gives our child a clean place to sit and eat. No more sticky booster seats when we go out! AAA+++!!!
