review/summary: Comfy Baby seatreview/text: This is a comfortable larger seat than most baby seats but after about 6 months it is really not very sturdy when the baby moves around. I am afraid to leave him alone in it to go make a bottle when he is crying because I am afraid he will tip it over. So, great seat for infants up to about 6 months but I will be putting this away very shortly.
