review/summary: overall great carrierreview/text: I wasn't going to get a bjorn at first because of the complaints of back aches but I saw a great sale and had a gift certificate so I went for it. Love it! Yes, my back hurts after carrying her for a while but I haven't noticed any long term problems, and I don't carry her from morning to night. It's so easy to use once you get the hang of it and it's very secure feeling. Never felt like she was going to fall out. I would take this to gatherings when she was young and throw her in it when she got tired. She'd sleep and I could walk around and enjoy the party (i.e. shove my face full of food). Now that she's almost 1, we don't use it nearly as much as we did, but it still works and she still gets excited when she sees me pull it out.
