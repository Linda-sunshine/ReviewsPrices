review/summary: Just buy an Ergoreview/text: This carrier was fine when My son was tiny. It wasn't perfect but it worked. It doesn't distribute weight very well and was hell on my back. Recently I had to use a Bjorn again. We went to a museum and I forgot my Ergo (GASP!). Strollers were not allowed in the main building. The museum was gracious enough to allow me to use their Bjron for free. After that I will never forget my Ergo again! Carrying my 25lb 1 year old around in that thing was worthless. My back was killing me after about 10mins. No matter how I adjusted the thing it just wansn't working. I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Ergo. If you can get your hands on a consignment/used one, AWESOME! If not, its totally worth every penny!!
