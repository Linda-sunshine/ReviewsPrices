review/summary: Comfortable and helps expand wardrobereview/text: I have been using this maternity belt since about the 15 week mark with my first pregnancy. I am now 34 weeks and still use it everyday. Not only has it helped me feel more supported and helped relieve back/pelvic pain, but it also kind of helped to keep some of my maternity pants up before I was big enough to fill them out :)
