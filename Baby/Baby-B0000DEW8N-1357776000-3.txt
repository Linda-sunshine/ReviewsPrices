review/summary: Works great!review/text: We bought this so our 6-month-old grandson could join us at the table when our kids and spouses join us each week for dinner. It's literally a snap to use. It fastens securely to our chairs using the back and seat straps. We even took it to a restaurant and strapped it to their chair for him! As it's all-plastic, cleanup is a breeze.He's happy in it, which makes mom and dad happy that they can eat with both hands again.Highly recommended.
