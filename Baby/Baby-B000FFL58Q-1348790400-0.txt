review/summary: I guess I'm happy if he's happy.review/text: My son is 5 months now and he's enjoyed the mat the whole time. I've never changed the batteries and the music stays on for quite a while, so there's no running over to reset it.He's rolling over and pulling at everything and stays on it for about 30 mins solid each time, which is nice.It really bothers me that the butterflies on top do not spin. They just sit there, blocking 1/2 of the blinking lights. He doesn't pay any mind to the little things sewn into the mat itself, just the things dangling. I did take off a few of the toys and added my own, which he likes. The parrot does nothing, and the monkey does nothing, but he likes the other parts.I guess I'm happy if he's happy, but I feel like there's probably a better choice out there.
