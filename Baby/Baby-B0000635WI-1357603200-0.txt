review/summary: Amazingreview/text: I am thirteen weeks and a stomach sleeper. I was having a hard time sleeping on my side, but with the addition of this pillow I am sleeping SO WELL. I would highly suggest getting this pillow if you are not ordinarily a side sleeper. Sure it is expensive, but isn't a good night's sleep priceless?
