review/summary: Great alternative to traditional blanketsreview/text: The AAP recommends not using loose blankets at nighttime. There aren't a ton of options for wearable blankets. I have three of these - one in Small, one in Medium, and one in Large. Ever since we stopped swaddling our daughter, she has slept in one of these every single night. It's also recommended to keep the baby's bedroom cool, so we keep the air temperature such that she sleeps in one of these sleep sacks and a footie pajamas. I think my daughter now associates the sleep sack with sleep.The sleep sacks are very soft and cuddly. They're not super thick, but are a bit heavier than a couple of other brands I've seen.
