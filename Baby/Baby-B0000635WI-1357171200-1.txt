review/summary: Fantasic Pillowreview/text: I'm 25 wks pg with my 3rd. I finally got a "pregnancy pillow" and I have to say I love it. It helps keep my hip from hurting so badly. The first night I never even woke up! That's really saying something. I usually have to wake up to roll over once one hip goes to sleep. It's huge and takes up a ton of room but I am really enjoying it. I co-sleep a small amount of the time with my older too and they both love it too, they like snuggling up to the other side.
