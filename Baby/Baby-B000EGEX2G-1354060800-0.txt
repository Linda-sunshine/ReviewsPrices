review/summary: You're you're smaller, and ok with small defects it'll doreview/text: Just put this thing together, pretty easy with basic instructions. Noticed right off the bat, the side cushions aren't long enough to snap into place and therefore i'll have to stretch them out somehow to make them snap on. Also, I'm 250---and when I sat down gently in it. I could hear crack, creek. Granted, this is for my wife but brand new out of the box having this problem tells me its good for smaller people, won't last long, and well poor quality.
