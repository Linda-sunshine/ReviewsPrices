review/summary: So sweet!review/text: This little bug is so sweet and the stars/moon are bright and fill up the entire ceiling. The colors are soothing and I love that the stars make actual constellations! Such a sweet little gift to help little ones sleep. My almost 2 and almost 3 year old nephews LOVE theirs!
