review/summary: Almost 6 month old loves it!review/text: My husband and I bought this for our son for Christmas. He was around 4 months old and at first he didn't care for it. Now at almost 6 months, he is loving it! We have it set at the lowest setting but still have to place a pillow under his feet in order to bounce. He doesn't seem to mind though. He will play by himself for approx 20 mins before he starts fussing. I would definitely encourage others to buy this jumperoo.
