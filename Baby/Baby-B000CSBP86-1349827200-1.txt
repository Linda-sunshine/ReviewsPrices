review/summary: Perfect!!review/text: I used to use this babybjorn when took care of my first nanny baby. I could not imagine how I would take care of the baby without it because the baby love to sleep on me, but I sometime had to clean and do other thing. So what I did was I put the baby in this babybjorn and let him sleep for as long as he want,and that way I can do my other shore. And to use this one is perfect because it is very easy to use plus this babybjorn is very breathable. The baby could sleep in that for 2 hour with no problem. I love this product! And now I am using this exact same one for my baby since this is the best!
