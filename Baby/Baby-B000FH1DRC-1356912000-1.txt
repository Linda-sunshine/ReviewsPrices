review/summary: Worked as Expectedreview/text: When I bought these diapers for my grandchildren, I hoped that they would last until Spring. Unfortunately, we were unable to get any of these diapers to last even a day. Most of them became unusable after a couple hours. We threw them in the rubbish. Maybe the next box of Pampers that we buy will last longer, but I doubt it.
