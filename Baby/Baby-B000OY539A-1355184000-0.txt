review/summary: Unusable wrapreview/text: I had high hopes for this wrap. My baby was fussy and liked being upright, so I thought that this wrap would work out. Before it arrived on my doorstep, I watched at least 5 different youtube videos (including the one by the makers of Moby Wrap) on how to tie the wrap. By the time the wrap arrived, I had no problems tying it. I also followed the instructions that came with the wrap. The issue was that no matter how tight I tied it, my baby would sag in the wrap. If I tied it really tight, then I also had problems putting him in the wrap. The wrap did not provide sufficient head support for my baby, he would sag in the fabric, and I kept worrying that he would get smothered easily. I always had to keep one hand on the baby while he was in this wrap. I returned it back to amazon.I'll still list the Pro and Cons:Pro:Baby would fall asleep in the wrap within minutes.You can breast feed your baby in the wrap.Con:Poor head support, baby nearly got smothered. Yes, baby was over 8lbs.You have to gauge how tight to tie the wrap every time you put it on.You have to put it on before heading out the door. The fabric is 10ft long, so if you try to wrap it in a parking lot, it will get dirty.The fabric +baby would get very hot. I bought a lighter color so that the baby would not over heat in the sun. Still the wrap was too hot inside and outside (in 60F weather).
