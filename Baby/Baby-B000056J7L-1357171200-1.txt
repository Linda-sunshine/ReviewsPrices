review/summary: very pleasedreview/text: I am very pleased that I went ahead and purchased this potty as opposed to what I usually get at the local Wal-Mart. This potty is a great size and shape for my girls. I primarily use this for my youngest (now 7m) for EC, however my oldest (2.5) who is almost done potty training likes it also and has used it several times! I like the high back, makes it easier to keep the baby seated, and my oldest seems more comfy having a higher back to lean against. Am probably going to get another to keep at the grandparents' house. Would definitely recommend!
