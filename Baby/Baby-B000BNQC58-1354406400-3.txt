review/summary: Daughter loves thisreview/text: My 2 1/2 has been using this every night since she was 1. She loves to play a game of- find the moon. We had to get a new one a few months ago, because the light either burnt out or somehow we broke the insides of it..... she hit it on the ground a couple times.
