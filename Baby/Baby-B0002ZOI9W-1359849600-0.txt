review/summary: Baby loves it!review/text: This is a good size rocker. I bought it for a 4-month-old baby and it's perfect. Assembling it was quick. Instructions were fool proof. Baby especially loves the musical thingie in the middle. Only problem is that it only plays music for about 1-2 minutes then you have to pull on it again for the music to play and there is a Velcro on the back to fasten the fabric together that doesn't hold up well.
