review/summary: Tight armholesreview/text: My LO hates his sleep sack. The arm holes are extremely tight on him and he fights me each time I tried to use it (I stopped). The couple nights we put him in this he didn't sleep well at all. If your baby has &#34;chunky&#34; arms at all, I do not recommend buying it. It did keep him warm, but again he didn't like it.
