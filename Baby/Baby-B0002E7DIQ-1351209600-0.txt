review/summary: Having a Baby soon!review/text: Wife asked me to buy this after her own research and loves this pillow. Says that it helps her sleep much better. Comes with a cover that can be removed and washed. Shipped in a huge but lightweight box. The only complaint is where her neck meets the pillow. The stitching / pillow case has more room so the stuffing material slides inside a bit but the pillow case or cover's seam remains stiff and press against her neck while sleeping. We tried wrapping the neck/head portion with a soft towel as fix for now. It's hard to describe and I hope you get what I mean. I haven't checked but it could be the cover and not the pillow itself. Regardless, she won't use the pillow without the cover so, it is a problem and loses one star. Otherwise, it is a great product that helps her very much.
