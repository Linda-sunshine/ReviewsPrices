review/summary: Used for an 18 month old's hospital stayreview/text: I've wanted the Twilight Turtle for my son's room since he was born, my Mom recently ordered it for him because we're getting ready to have one of his kidneys removed and the hospital is a very scary place for my 18 month old son. This turtle creates such a calming atmosphere for him that we have absolutely no worries about the upcoming stay! Have 0 of the mentioned problems in the negative reviews, everything with it has been perfect. It should be common sense to not allow any child under 3 to actually PLAY with it, overall GREAT product, considering ordering the Ladybug as a baby shower gift for a friend!
