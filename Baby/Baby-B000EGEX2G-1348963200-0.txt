review/summary: Much better than I expected (after reading other reviews)review/text: We just brought triplets home from the hospital this week. My wife's hospital room, during her three week stay, had a glider chair in it and we decided we wanted one in our nursery. I selected this chair (beige fabric/cherry wood) because of the price ($129 in this combination), figuring if we got a year out of it that would be great. I read the one and two star reviews that discuss the squeaks, but decided that we'd live with it if we had to. And I figured, knowing about the squeaks ahead of time, I would be careful during assembly to try to minimize their occurrence.Here is what was delivered last week:The product is delivered mostly assembled, to my surprise. The ottoman is completely assembled, and all of the glider parts of the main chair are pre-assembled. My only tasks were to attache the chair back and two arms. The screw holes are pre-drilled with, i think, an embedded nut so they screw in quite easily. Cushions snap and tie on easily. I had the chair assembled in less than 30 minutes with minimal sweat (I didn't use the included allen wrench; I used my own ratchet, which helped a bit.)I have assembled A LOT of Ikea and Home Decorator furniture. I expected this chair to be of that quality (or less due to the low price). Instead, the piece appears to be of higher quality; more solid; better milled; better joinery; and more pre-assembled. I was VERY PLEASED with the item (and very surprised by how nice it seems.)Two points:1. We've only had the chair a week. No squeaks, but I can't speak to whether it will develop them down the road.2. We like the chair so much, today I bought a second one identical to the first. (With triplets, we've found too many occasions already when we want to both be sitting there feeding them at the same time.)
