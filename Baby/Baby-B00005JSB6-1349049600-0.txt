review/summary: awfulreview/text: These diapers are like paper. The material is so hard and rough compared to others I feel terrible putting it on my child's rump. On top of being so papery, they have leaked every time I used them. I though huggies was a good diaper brand... oh how wrong I was and now I have 400 diapers in the trash to show for it!!
