review/summary: Great for baby who already walksreview/text: My daughter and nephew love this toy but they were already walking when they began playing with it. I agree with previous reviews that it is light weight and can be dangerous for babies trying to pull up and lean on something. For toddlers and early walkers though, it is a fantastic option with lots of engaging activities.
