review/summary: Not just for pregnant womenreview/text: I bought this for my pregnant daughter. She LOVES it.Comes with a washable cover and filling is just right. Not too much, not too little.I have tried many &#34;body&#34; pillows for myself and they always seem to flatten out quickly.I tried my daughters pillow one night and it was PERFECT for my sleep needs also! This is a perfect pillow for ANYONE that needs/wants the support for back, hips, knees.After nine months this pillow is still holding up and not flattening out.LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!
