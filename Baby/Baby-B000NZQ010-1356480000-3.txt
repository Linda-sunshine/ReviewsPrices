review/summary: Perfect for our prewalker!review/text: Our little guy is 10 months old and was &#34;walking&#34; by pushing a chair in front of him. As soon as he got this he knew just what to do and was off! There are two tension settings on the wheels which give him the resistance he needs now that he is still quite wobbly. The white panel on the front is really cute and has many different things he likes to play with. I also like that the sound can be turned off when mom and dad have had enough. The panel comes off too for him to play with while he sits on the floor. I love this toy! Awesome find!
