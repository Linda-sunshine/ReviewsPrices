review/summary: In 16 months very few "issues" to report!review/text: After trying a few different brands we settled on Pampers and haven't looked back. The mess they are able to contain is sometimes unbelievable and we've only had a couple of "blowouts" in 16 months which seems like a reasonable success rate considering that's close to 5000 diapers. With Amazon Mom/Prime and subscribe and save I've never found a price that comes close to these.
