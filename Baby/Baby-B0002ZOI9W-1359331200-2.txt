review/summary: Better than a bouncerreview/text: We LOVE our rocker. We have both a &#34;snuggabunny&#34; swing and this rocker. We use the rocker ALL the time. My daughter is 7 weeks old and I would say we use it more often then our swing. It is easy to move from room to room, and into the bathroom while I am in the shower. When on a tile floor she can rock herself by just moving her feet around, on the carpet she cannot do this, but the vibrator keeps her perfectly content too. We've only replaced the battery once since we've had it (at about 6 weeks) It uses only one C battery. We LOVE this thing... Its definitely my going to be my go to baby shower item from now on.
