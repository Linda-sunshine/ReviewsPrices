review/summary: Super Cutereview/text: I like this product, but haven't had the chance yet to use it like I'm suppose to. It's smaller than I expected, but it's perfect sized really. Does not come with instructions though and it really should because it's super confusing as how to work it. But you just go to the site: [...] and it'll show you how to use it. Just print off the instructions. Can't wait to actually use it though looks like it'll be really handy later on when the baby gets a set schedule for things.
