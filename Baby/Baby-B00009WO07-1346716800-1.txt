review/summary: Quality is great but LEAKAGE..review/text: We have tried different diapers, we really liked the built of Pamper, the quality of the materials is best (light weight and very soft) however it leaks badly so we had to change whole cloths of our baby time by time which is frustrating!! We pay more for Pamper diapers to get some good things however for some reason it doesn't worked for us.. Still we are using Pamper as it's very good materials. :(
