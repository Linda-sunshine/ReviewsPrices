review/summary: Inconvenientreview/text: GOOD ENOUGH TEMPORARILY! Because these baby wipes have polyethelyne (PET plastic #1) in the material, you can't let it get too warm or it will release a toxin called antimony. It is inconvenient that I cannot keep these in the place where I want them, b/c it is a room that can get very warm. I have to keep them in a very inconvenient place. The rest of the ingredients (besides the other safe plastic #2 they put in it) are natural. I really like the price and I hope they remove the PET plastic in the future, so I can continue to make purchases- I have written them. In the meantime, if I ever come across any other natural baby wipes with all safe ingredients for close to the same price, I will definitely change my brand.
