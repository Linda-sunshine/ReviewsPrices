review/summary: Baby dry, my buttreview/text: I love swaddlers, so after finally getting to the end of the initial stash of pampers from the baby showers etc, I started purchasing them. They cost more than other diapers, but oh well I was hooked.I got the grand idea in my head that &#34;Oh, baby dry? they must work even BETTER than swaddlers, DRY is right in the name!&#34;Wrong. In a swaddler my kid could pee 2-3x and no leakage. In the baby dry, I don't know what it is about them, if she got to peeing a second time? Good lord get that thing off of her quick or she's going to leak or please no zues, oprah, or a tiny baby jesus, don't let her poop because it IS coming out the back even if I have her in a size too big without the back rolled down.I ened up using these as Daycare diapers, because there she got changed ever hour (No worries, I usually check her ever 2 hours max or at the first whiff of poop at home but that wasn't enough for baby dry)Not ever getting those things again and if they're gifted I am regifting.
