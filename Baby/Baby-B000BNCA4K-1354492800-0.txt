review/summary: Great toy but not for teethingreview/text: I bought this thinking it would be good for a teething toy but it isnt, the tubes are a bit too thin to really be a good teething toy, my baby gets frustrated when she chews on this because it doesnt do much. Other than that it is a great toy, easy to hold on to and makes a fun rattle sound when she shakes it
