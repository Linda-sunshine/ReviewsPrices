review/summary: I had bad luck with the zippersreview/text: I had problems with the zippers on two micro-fleece Halo sacks. One was gently used for 3 mos by my best friend and the other was brand new. On both, the zippers stick all the time, which is a real nuisance with a squirmy baby. I actually just broke the zipper on the used one trying to un-stick it last night. (I'm not a violent (un)dresser.) And last complaint: if I failed to line up the zippers properly (surprisingly easy with a squirmer), I might "think" it was zipped and discover he unzipped it from the top later... The fleece was okay, nothing special. I'm here looking for another brand because I love the idea of the sleep sacks. I'm just not a fan of this brand.
