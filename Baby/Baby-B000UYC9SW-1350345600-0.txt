review/summary: Buy this, not the Mobyreview/text: I am a first time mom and I was looking into the Moby wrap. It is very hot where I live, and I was mostly concerned about the absurd amount of fabric that comes with the Moby. I figured I would get comfortable with the tying techniques and get it down so that wouldn't be an issue. But then someone told me about the K'Tan. Luckily I didn't purchase a Moby, I went straight to a K'Tan. No tying. Baby loves it. I've been using it since he was 4 days old. And as for the heat concern, it is warm, there's no denying that, but I just dress lightly and dress the baby lightly, and consider the K'Tan as an extra layer of clothing. On the super hot days, he goes in just a diaper! Everyone who sees it asks me what it is and I just love telling them that yes, I put it on by myself, and yes, it is comfortable!I did have some back pain using the kangaroo hold, but recently switched to the hug hold because my little guy is a little bigger, and with the use of the sash as extra support, it is much more comfortable. I use it at least 4-5 times a week, and look forward to using it for years to come.
