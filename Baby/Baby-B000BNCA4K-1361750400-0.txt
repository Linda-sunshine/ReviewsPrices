review/summary: Perfect for teething, play and learning!review/text: I purchased this after reading so many great reviews, and was not disappointed!!This is the perfect little toy for little hands. I got this for my 8 month old and wish I had gotten it sooner. She is now 10 months old and still likes it. It is the perfect feeling soft material for touch as well as chewing!! Little fingers can hold on to the many loops of this toy very easily and it is bright and colorful, so it draws her attention quickly.It also has a little rattle feature in the center block of the rings and provides just enough of a soft rattle for those little ones who like to shake it up!Easy to clean and could easily be attached to a strap or toy rings to keep handy and keep from falling if need be.Would reccommend to anyone with a little one!!
