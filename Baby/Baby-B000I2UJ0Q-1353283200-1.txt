review/summary: Over a year with our first and buying a second!review/text: I bought this Jumperoo 3 years ago for my now 3 year old daughter and I just purchased a second one for my new baby (since I was dumb enough to give the first one away when my daughter outgrew it). Though after a year of use with the first one, this is what I found:- Durable! After a year of constant play and the rough housing of an older sibling on it, all we broke was the rainbow part (which still held on but was a bit loose).- Very entertaining. My daughter would scream every time I took her from the toy because she loved being in it so much.- Easy to clean. Once you get the hang of unsnapping the seat (which you can toss in the wash) it's real easy to clean.- Not terrible to transport. I wish it would hold together better while in it's collapsed state, but considering the size of this toy, it wasn't terrible to take with and it fit pretty easily into my car. We took it to every family holiday and babysitter.- Sturdy base. Even with an older child pushing on it, it never once tipped or seemed unsafe.- Worth the money. My daughter played in this at least once a day for over a year. She loved it and I had a safe place for my child to play while I tossed in some laundry or grabbed a quick shower.Can't wait for our new one to arrive. I hope my new baby loves this even half as much as my daughter did.
