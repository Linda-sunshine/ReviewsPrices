At first I thought it was just minor dirt from the factory but then I turned it upside down and the little feet underneath it are filthy and show clear signs of being worn down. I guess when someone uses it and decides to return it, amazon just repackages it and sends it to another unsuspecting person. I would give zero stars if I could
