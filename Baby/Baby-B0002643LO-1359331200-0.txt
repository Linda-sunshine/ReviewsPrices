review/summary: Big Disappointment !review/text: I have been using Pampers Cruisers for the longest. One night I ran out and I had to run to the store to buy some more. They did not have the Cruisers but instead had these. I purchased them thinking if I had as much success with the Cruisers then these should not be much different from those. W R O N G !! I couldn't wait to get rid of these !! EVERY Morning my son would be soaked through the diaper, sheets all wet, and very smelly ! These hardly hold anything through the night ! The name is not fitting what so ever ! I actually can't believe that Pampers would even put their name on something like this ! The diaper is thin, cheap, and honestly a headache! If you want something that is guaranteed to hold through the night, without any of these problems, go with the Pampers Cruisers ! Because these right here are a total waste of money, manufacturing, and time ! Major Fail !!!
