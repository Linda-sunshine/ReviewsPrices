review/summary: Love this gate!review/text: We bought this gate to keep our two dogs separate from our African Grey parrot. We were looking for a gate that was easy to maneuver and could take a great deal of traffic. North States Supergate fills our needs completely. We love how easy it is to open and close and especially love how it has a stay open feature. It was simple to install, by myself, in less than 15 min. I love it and when needed, will replace another gate (an Evenflo) that we have in the house with this very same model because it is so much easier to use.
