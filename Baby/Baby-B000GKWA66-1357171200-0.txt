review/summary: great sound machinereview/text: I think this is a great sound machine. It has a timer on it, which we use every night. I particularly like the rain and wave sounds, which relax my son. We've had it hanging on my son's crib since he was born. He's now 16 months and still uses it. We just bought another one for our son who will be born in February. I like this one better than the giraffe version - of which we have the travel size. The sounds are much more soothing than the giraffe. The giraffe has more &#34;play&#34; sounds than &#34;sleep&#34; sounds.
