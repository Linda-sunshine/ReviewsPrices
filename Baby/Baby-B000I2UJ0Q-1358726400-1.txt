review/summary: Son Loves Itreview/text: First off, the unit is pretty easy to assemble. The only challenging part is the seat and cushion. If you can figure that out, then the hardest part is getting your kid's legs to stay straight so they can slide right into the seat. My son loves sitting in the jumperoo, and jumping around . . . . go figure.
