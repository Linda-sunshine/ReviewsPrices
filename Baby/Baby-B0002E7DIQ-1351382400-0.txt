review/summary: Great for napsreview/text: I was so excited to get this pillow that when it arrived next day, I went straight upstairs to take a nap with it. For short periods of sleep, this is totally ideal. The one part that I find really uncomfortable is the lining around the neck. It is very tight and digs into the neck. It shouldn't be this way, I'm assuming. What I mean is that its really hard to snuggle deep into and have your face on the top part of the pillow. This pillow would be 100% perfect if it weren't for this one flaw.
