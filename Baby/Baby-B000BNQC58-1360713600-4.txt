review/summary: Cloud B is a wonderful investmentreview/text: This turtle was a gift to us over a year ago, it has been through all of the abuse you can imagine with a 3 and 1 year old. I HIGHLY recommend cloud b over those cheapy pet thingys. My daughter recieved one of the pets and it was broken within a week. I bought her the other cloud b turtle as a replacement and she adores it more than the goofy pet.
