review/summary: Perfect!review/text: I love the Halo sleepsacks. This is not a swaddle sack, so don't get confused! The swaddle sacks were pretty worthless for my Houdini baby, but once we broke him of the swaddle I started using these Halo wearable blanket sacks. They are the perfect weight for cooler nights, and they hold up through many washes and wears.
