review/summary: Great Gatereview/text: I was able to install this gate in less than 15 minutes. I did not use the screws and it is quite sturdy and, trust me, my son tried. I love that it locks by itself and stays open when you want. Great gate. I wish the one we had in our kitchen was like this one. I spent a lot of money having someone install that one. Had I known how easy to install and how great this gate is, I would've saved myself 200 bucks! Oh one of my cats made the leap over the gate with no problem.
