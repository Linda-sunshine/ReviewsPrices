review/summary: Not just for infantsreview/text: This seat was my Lifesaver when my little girl was in her first months of life. We lived in a one-story appartment so when the seat is in the rocking position is was easy to drag around like a sled. I could pull her around to watch me as I cooked in the kitchen, then if she fell asleep I could just push or pull her to the next room without waking her up. It was also great for setting her in the bathroom so that I could shower. Admittedly there is a stage babies will go through where it's not safe because they sit up and lean forward, tilting the whole thing with them. Just put it away for a while and when they are walking around pull it out again as a toddler rocking chair. My daughter is now 4 years old and though we've put the attachable toys away, she still fits in it.
