review/summary: Love them!review/text: My daughter started to develop a rash after using Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive size 3. She never had a problem before, but we tried Huggies Pure and Natural and they leaked!! These are fantastic. They fit her much better (she's pretty short and slender) and they are so cute too! Love that they're thin and easy to pack in the diaper bag and much cheaper than the other Pampers. Only thing I miss is the line to indicate if they're wet, but they're so thin that it's not too tricky.
