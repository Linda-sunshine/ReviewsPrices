review/summary: perfect for travel!review/text: We got this booster seat when my son was about 8 months old to use when we went on vacation. The tray pops off so that you can fold the seat back down. Then, you reattach the tray after rotating it 180 degrees. This makes it the most compact for storage and travel. My son is now 18 months. I'm not sure how much longer he'll be able to use it with the straps because we have them as loose as possible, and they are starting to get snug. This booster has worked very well for us. It straps easily to chairs, both around the seat back and the seat. We've even strapped it sideways on a picnic table bench.
