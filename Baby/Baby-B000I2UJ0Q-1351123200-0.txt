review/summary: AMAZING PRODUCT!review/text: This is a great product! My 4 month old loves this! It really keeps him busy with all the activities attached and seems to stimulate him more than the other 100 toys he has:) it's well worth the buy! I purchased this when he was 3 months because he had good head and neck control, he loved it then as well. It has a high back which really supports well. When he was younger, we used a Wii fit board(forgot the official name) underneath his feet so that he was still able to touch and bounce. All in all, awesome product!
