review/summary: Wonderful, simple, easy to use...review/text: This is the cleanest, simplest and most efficient training potty out there. It doesn't have silly bells and whistles, but rather gets the job done well and fits my son comfortably. It's super easy to empty/clean and doesn't distract from my clean decor at home.
