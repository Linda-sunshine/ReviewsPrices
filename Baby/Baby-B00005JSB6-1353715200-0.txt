review/summary: leaky diaperreview/text: I have twin girls and made the mistake in buying these. We couldn't wait for the box to be empty. The girls always needed out fit changes due to the diaper leaking through the layers. One expects some leaking around the edges but right through the diaper. I will never buy again.
