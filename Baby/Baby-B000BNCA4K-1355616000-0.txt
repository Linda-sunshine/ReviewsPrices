review/summary: Amazing fun toy!!review/text: My 1 year old loves this toy! It is easy to pick up, it is fun to shake, and he loves how it bounces when he throws it. It is soft enough to not hurt anything or anyone when tossed, but strong enough to be pulled and chewed on without being damaged. Of course, once he's older, I'll also be able to explain how the loops look just like magnetic field lines!,
