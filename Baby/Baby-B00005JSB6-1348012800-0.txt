review/summary: Not what they used to be...review/text: Now we've used Huggies with our oldest son who is 11 now and let me tell you, they are NOT the same quality anymore. Back in the diaper game with our 2 month old daughter. We got a pack of little snugglers for baby shower and used them first. Leaks all over including escaping poop EVERY TIME. Sure, we thought maybe going up the size will do the trick and last minute decided to go with Pampers Swaddlers which we LOVED. Grew out of size 2 and were very disappointed we couldn't find Pampers Swaddlers in size 3 at any local stores. While shopping at Sam's Club we saw a deal of huge 222 count pack and decided to go with it because it turned out to be 0.17 cent per diaper. Oh boy, what a mistake. You get what you pay for! They are horrible before you even put them on the baby. Not sure if there's such thing as spoiled baby bottom but these diapers are so stiff and feel like over processed recycling paper. They fill up (expand) faster than other brands because there is just no way our daughters urine output could have increased dramatically overnight. I'm stay at home mom and change her quite frequent. I cannot wait for these diapers to be gone so we can go back to Pampers.
