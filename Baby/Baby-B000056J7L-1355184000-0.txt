review/summary: LOVE LOVE LOVE!review/text: We love this potty!! We're doing elimination communication (&#34;EC&#34;) with our daughter so we started &#34;pottying&#34; her almost as soon as she was born. Because we didn't know any better at the time, we first used a toilet seat reducer or just held her in the infant-in-arms EC position. Luckily, at around 4 months, we found this potty and have never looked back.The high back is perfect for infants who aren't able to sit up yet fully unsupported. We still needed to closely supervise, as she would sometimes lean forward and, once, she took a dive and ended up bruising her forehead on the bathroom floor. I blame myself fully, as I had looked away momentarily. Now that our daughter is older (11 months), her feet touch the ground, so she's much more secure in the seat. She still needs close supervision though, as she likes to try and stand up out of the seat.I also love that the insert is easily removable. We just flush the &#34;contents&#34; and rinse the insert out with water in the sink. Every now and again we'll let it soak in warm soapy water, but if it's washed right away after use, it stays quite clean.All in all, this is a great potty and we're very happy with our purchase. Thanks Baby Bjorn!
