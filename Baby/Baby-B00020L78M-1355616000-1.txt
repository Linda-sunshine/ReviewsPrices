review/summary: Short window of usefulness - mixed feelingsreview/text: We bought this to use as a fence around an area of the living room that was a little dangerous for our son who nine months old at the time and starting to really get into everything. It filled the purpose we hoped it would fill for a couple of months, but as our son got older, stronger and more determined, he found ways to circumvent it.He would push and pull to move it around, and when used as a fence he'd push the end of it around and slip past it. It was still more useful than not, but after about six months the level of usefulness started to drop.Then by the time he hit one and a half years old, he found out he was able to climb over it. That ended the period of its usefulness. He can now get out by climbing whenever he pleases, which simply adds the danger of a fall to whatever danger we were trying to keep him away from in the first place. And there is danger of a fall. Sometimes when he got to the top, he'd get an "oh no, what do I do now?" look on his face.So we got nine months out of this playard/fence. Not too bad, maybe, and it did keep him significantly safer for maybe about six of those months, before circumventing it became a lot easier. If you are on a tight budget, you might want to think about this level of investment for so short a time.
