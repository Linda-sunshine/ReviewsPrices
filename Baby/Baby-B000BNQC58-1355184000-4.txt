review/summary: Awesome Funreview/text: I wanted some stars to stick on my ceiling for my little one.....But i loved this idea of portable stars. My little one stares at the stars all the time at night and it helps her fall asleep. I Love the green and Blue colors. The Amber is not very impressive color as you cant see it clearly, but otherwise great product. I have ordered one for my nephew who enjoys Astronomy. He loved it too. Overall very happy with my Turtle.
