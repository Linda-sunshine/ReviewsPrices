review/summary: Was great at beginning, lights burned out quicklyreview/text: My kids loved to look at the constellations on their ceiling. The colors were blue or green. It helped them to get to sleep. It does not work at all after a few months. The lights do not burn brightly enough to shine on the ceiling.
