review/summary: Perfectreview/text: I love these sleep sacks. We have two daughters, 8 month old and 2 1/2 years old and they both wear them every night. It is great not having to use blankets that they will get tangled in or accidentally throw off. Washes perfectly. Great color. Zips from top down, so you can still change diapers without taking it all the way off. Roomy at the bottom, so my 2 1/2 year old can walk around in it.
