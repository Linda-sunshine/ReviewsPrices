review/summary: Great giraffe but seam torereview/text: I was given this giraffe at my shower. I love it and was hoping my son would too. Within 2 weeks of use (just for music as my son is too young to interact with it) the seam has opened up and the leg is falling off. I don't know how this happened as it hasn't been used much. I feel like it was just not stitched well. I have contacted the company so I hope they will replace the giraffe.
