review/summary: Great product, my daughter LOVES!review/text: I bought this product after reading the reviews, and decided it seemed worth the price. It is worth the price. My daughter loves to fall asleep looking at the "start" and the 3 different color options has spurred her to start recognize colors and choose which one she wants. Right now she is little (&lt;2 years), so she likes looking at the ladybug and doesn't notice that unless the room is pitch black there isn't a lot of light on the walls. But we do keep it on the floor so she can look at her ladybug. When she gets older I imagine it will get moved to a dresser, be closer to the ceiling, and therefore display more light on the ceiling.Overally a great product.
