review/summary: Great activity mat!!review/text: I got this for my son before he was born at a second hand store. He is now almost 4 months and he LOVES it so much. From day one he has loved the music, the lights and the toys. He started batting at the toys a while ago and rolling over...I think it has helped him develop his hand-eye coordination. Also, my son was 9lbs 2 oz when born and is very a big boy, and he still has plenty of room in this toy. :)
