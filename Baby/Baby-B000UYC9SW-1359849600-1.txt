review/summary: Better than the endless piece of fabricreview/text: A lady at the park recommended this when I asked her about her Moby Wrap. I am not really into baby wearing, but I have two kids really close together (20 months and 2 months) and I don't feel like pushing a giant double stroller around everywhere. So, when I need to, I wear the baby and put the toddler in the stroller.This is definitely easier than the Moby Wrap, and it doesn't swallow a newborn like a Baby Bjorn would. Overall, I'm pretty happy with this.
