review/summary: Sizing is WAY different from the Huggies S & D I bought in store!review/text: Bought these diapers because I use Huggies and have always thought they are great, however, these size 3's are MUCH smaller than ANY of the 3's I've bought in store and are almost too small for my 19lb baby! I'm so annoyed I bought an entire box of size 3's which SHOULD fit him well but don't! Also, the tabs are different, they are not rounded at all and are scratchy if baby touches them, they also rip off just opening the diapers.
