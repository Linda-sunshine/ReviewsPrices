review/summary: Not something I would buy ever againreview/text: The overall quality of Pampers has gone down so much and babydry is worse of all. after just two hours of putting it on, it breaks and actually all the inside material comes out. I had to vacuum so many times after having such incidents. no more babydry for us.
