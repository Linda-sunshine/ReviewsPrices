review/summary: Baby loves itreview/text: I am intimidated by wraps. I like easy and simple. Especially with a crying baby you don't want them to wait. I have baby bjorn, great for bigger baby, and Ella roo also great for babies who can hold their heads up. I tried this Baby K tan because I wanted to carry my newborn. It was easy to use, machine washable, soft and baby loves it. She sleeps in it while I go out to dinner. I have freedome of both hands to eat and do stuff. Best gift for new moms.
