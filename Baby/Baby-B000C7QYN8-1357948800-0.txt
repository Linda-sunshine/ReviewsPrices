review/summary: Best wipes everreview/text: I love these wipes and I am VERY sad that they have a &#34;new and improved&#34; version. The new ones are soaked way beyond what they need to be and they are very thick. I dont mind the thicker part but they went way over kill on the moisture part. They remind me of Earths Best wipes and though I love having a all natural option free of mad chemicals, I hate those wipes too :( I do use and love the Seventh Generation wipes (the old ones) when I can find them and I also use the &#34;new and improved ones&#34; even though I cant stand them. They still serve their purpose, just a little more waste then needed.
