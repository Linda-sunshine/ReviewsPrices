review/summary: I wish it was more absorbant on the back...review/text: I used Pampers Swaddlers for my son 5 years ago, and now I'm using them for my daughter. I like the softness.It seems like they reduced the size of the absorbing pad(?) on the back, though. I think it's fine for a boy who tends to shoot up, but for my baby girl it's a problem because her pee runs down when she is sleeping on her back. Sometimes she wakes up with her back soaked, and this is only after one and a half hour of napping. When I put her diaper on, I pull the back side as high as possible, but still leaks sometimes. And her poop (also my son's 5 years ago) leaks quite often from the back...
