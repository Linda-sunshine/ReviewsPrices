review/summary: Nice!review/text: Bought this in blue because I have 2 baby/toddler grandsons and figured for the excellent price, it might be nice. It appears comfortable, tall enough-I was afraid it would be too short but it is not. It is easy to assemble-two pieces!!- and easy to clean. Some potty chairs do not have a contoured area in the front to accomodate little boys when they are sitting, but this does thanks to the design. Now if I could just get more consistency of use by the 2 yr old!! :)
