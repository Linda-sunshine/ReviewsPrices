review/summary: Great jumperooreview/text: I bought this based on the recommendations. My son used it from about 5 months old to 10 months so it wasn't used a ton but it was good when I needed to get stuff done and he could play or bounce. One tip-if your baby is not able to touch the floor (as mine couldn't at 5 months old), put a pillow underneath their feet and the'll be able to use that to touch.
