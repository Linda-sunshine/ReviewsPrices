review/summary: Great noise, poor quaityreview/text: My litte guy has to have this soother on to go to sleep, the sound is perfect for him. That being said, the qualityof the plush giraffe is lacking. The velcro straps have already come off and other seams arepulling apart. We have only been using this for 1.5 months and we started having these issues around 2 weeks. If the giraffe stayed togeter this would be 5 stars!
