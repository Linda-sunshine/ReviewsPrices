review/summary: Son loves it - but it eats batteriesreview/text: I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old. He absolutely loves it and it does light up his whole bedroom ceiling. My only complaint is that when it arrived from Amazon the batteries were dead. If it would have come from a store shelf I would understand but thought it was strange coming from a warehouse. Also within a month the batteries were dead again. He does turn it on a lot but I don't think it is on enough to die that quickly.
