review/summary: Am happy with it, just not over the moonreview/text: I have been looking for a pink toddler rocker for ages so ordered this from Amazon.com instead of Amazon.co.uk as it was cheaper. Item arrived in good time. It's a lovely chair but wish my daughter could sit more forward in it. She always seems to far back and I have to prop the back up with a cushion. She's only 7 months so once older can use it as a chair but for now it's great for her to watch a bit of tv or to sleep in. Picture of mouse is lovely. Music is annoying as daughter constantly pulls on the toy.I would recommend it though.
