review/summary: I'm not sure the ease is worth the valuereview/text: I decided to do subscribe and save for diapers. However, this last box of diapers we received we probably "wasted" about 1/4 of them because the sides would rip off. We are on our next box and I will be observing teh quality. If this quality of box is the same I will just go back to buying them in the store. Though I'm all about a good deal and ease of delivery, to waste that many diapers is frustrating and a waste of money.
