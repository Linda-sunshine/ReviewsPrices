review/summary: Convenient chairreview/text: We are happy with this purchase. The chair was not difficult to assemble and seems like it will be a nice piece to have as our baby boy grows up. Because it is a toddler rocker, it is a bit wide, so our son ends up tilting a bit to the side since he isn't wide enough for the chair yet and isn't quite strong enough to sit straight on his own. The recline and upright angles aren't very different from each other, but they work just fine.
