review/summary: Finally sleeping the whole nightreview/text: I absolutely love this pillow, but I think my husband loves it even more because I'm no longer tossing and turning all night. Plus I don't have to get up and go to the bathroom as much since I'm not waking up a dozen times trying to get comfortable. There is a bad review due the seam, but I didn't even notice it. Not sure if the pillow has changed since then, but it's certainly not a problem for me.Why I love this pillow:1. Slept many nights all the way through without waking up (but some nights duty still calls)2. No more tossing and turning3. No more cramping in my back and belly when sleeping on my side4. No more snoring - As a prego you are suppossed to sleep on your side but this was very uncomfortable for me. I'd always seem to end up on my back and then I'd start sawing logs, which leads me to the next one.5. My husband is happy because I'm no longer waking him up6. Great for propping yourself up for reading or watching tvThe cons:1. I ordered a red pillow, but they sent me a white one. Not really anything faulty with the design, but just a mix up.2. I haven't had to wash it yet, but I can tell it's going to be a bit of a struggle to get the slip cover back on after cleaning.Overall, I just know that I'm sleeping better and so is my husband and that to me is worth 5 stars.
