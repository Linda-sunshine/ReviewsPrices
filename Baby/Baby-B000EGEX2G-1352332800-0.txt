review/summary: Excellent Glider!review/text: Was apprehensive after reading reviews on this model regarding a stiff seat cushion and low backrest. For this price you shouldn't expect too much, but we are satisfied with the product as a whole. Being 5'8", the backrest is very comfortable and it comes to about 3"-4" below the top of my head. To alleviate the stiff seat we took a spare piece of memory foam and put it under the seat cushion. Very comfortable overall and untouchable if your looking for a good chair at a budget price!
