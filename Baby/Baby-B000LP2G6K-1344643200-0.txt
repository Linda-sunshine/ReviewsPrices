review/summary: Mattress bunches upreview/text: Maybe ours was a dud, but the mattress bunches up after putting on sheets, causing a large bump right in the middle. It's impossible to place our child sleeping not on the bump, so I imagine sleeping in the Pack 'N Play isn't very comfortable for him. Fortunately we are only using it on trips.
