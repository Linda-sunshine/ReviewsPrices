review/summary: Huggies superior to pampersreview/text: Initially, we started using Pampers diapers, however at one point they changed the quality of the diaper and we were forced to change. We have three young children, and we have found that out Huggies diapers seem to work the best. They don't seem to leak as much or get soggy, and using Amazon's Subscribe and save program makes it incredibly easy to get these diapers. I would recommend these diapers to any parents with young children. They seem to absorb liquid without causing a significant diaper rash.
