review/summary: Hugs your baby well and blue line indicator to show liquid plus economy size saves money!review/text: Pampers swaddled are very good. The blue line helps out a bit but I usually can just feel that my baby peed. Wife uses the line more than me. I would suggest these because they hug your baby very well. I started using these on my 6.5 to 7 lb newborn and still were good.The economy package is great because it saves money. It divides the diapers into three vacuum sealed bags.
