review/summary: Cutest Night Light Ever!review/text: I bought this for my daughter for her first Christmas. She's two years now and still loves it! Every night she has to touch the moon and one of the stars before going to sleep. It's become a comfort for her at night. I've only had to change the batteries once, after a year of use. Absolutely adorable with a sturdy plastic shell.
