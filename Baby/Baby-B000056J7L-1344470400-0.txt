review/summary: BabyBjorn Potty Chairreview/text: This is a great little potty chair. I like its two piece design, and how easy it is to empty. I like the high back, and so does my son as he likes to "lounge" as he uses it. The only downside is that the piece the comes out does sometimes stick to his behind so when he stands up there is potential for a mess, but this will be true with any two piece plastic chairs. I really like the no slip grips on the bottom of the chair so my son can't scoot it across the floor. All in all, I would probably buy this chair again.
