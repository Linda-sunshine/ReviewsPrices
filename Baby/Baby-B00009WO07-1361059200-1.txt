review/summary: Ok for daytime use; NOT for nighttimereview/text: I figured that these would be good diapers for day and night for our 12mo, but nope. Almost every other day we find her onesie or sleeper with a big pee spot on it. For daytime use, these diapers are great, just don't expect them to work for 12 hours.
