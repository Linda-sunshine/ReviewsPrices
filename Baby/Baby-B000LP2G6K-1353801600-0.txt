review/summary: Great value!!!review/text: This is a wonderful pack n' play! I bought a &#34;fancy&#34; one several years ago for my first granddaughter, but didn't really need all of the &#34;extras.&#34; Since that first playard is now &#34;under new ownership&#34; I purchased the &#34;On the Go&#34; playard, which uses the same sheets, is extremely sturdy and was just what &#34;grandma&#34; needed for their Thanksgiving visit. It doesn't have the napper or the changer, but that wasn't a problem at all. I appreciate this product as it was affordable and very well constructed. Nice colors too:)
