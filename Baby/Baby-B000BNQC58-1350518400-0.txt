review/summary: Kids loves it, cheap productreview/text: My son absolutely loves this turtle. I loved it as well, until it was time to change the batteries. The screw stripped on the second turn when trying to get the battery compartment open. I've tried so many things, but it's just stuck. The turtle was cool until we couldn't use it anymore.
