review/summary: Box received was defectivereview/text: I've been using Huggies brand diapers in various sizes exclusively for over a year. This is the first time I've ever received a box where at least 1 out of every 5 diapers has one of the velcro tabs missing which makes them unusable. I realize with mass production things can be missed but I've never encountered so many defective diapers in one box. Considering the huge price increase on this item, I'm hopeful this is a one-time occurrence and not something that will become a problem with every order.
