review/summary: Have already bought one for each nephew and will buy more for any other children that come into my lifereview/text: This is by far THE BEST gift I have ever been able to give to a young child. I got one for my 3 year old nephew last year for Christmas and he still talks about it and can't be without it- especially at night time. I got a second one for him to share with his 2 year old brother for his grandmama's house so that they can have one at home and one there. Again, neither can be without it. Some of the color options for the lights show up better than others but for a normal sized room with the lights off this works great to create a starry sky and inspire imagination and also sooth any fear of the dark.
