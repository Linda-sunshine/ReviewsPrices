review/summary: Better than the competition!review/text: We've been using a different brand for the first 1.5 months of my sons life, and really struggled with it. Tons of straps, it took two of us to get him in and out, and the support was questionable. We switched to the Baby Bjorn and absolutely love it! It's much easier to use, easy to adjust shoulder/back size for my wife and I to both use, and the support is much much better. This supports the neck and chest area for younger kids who may not have the strongest stomach/shoulder muscles yet.In addition, the Baby Bjorn is made of solid and sturdy material that I'm sure is going to last for multiple kids! I absolutely recommend this product over other baby carriers.
