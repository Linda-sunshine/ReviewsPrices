review/summary: Very cutereview/text: I put my 22 month old's toy balls in here. It holds all of them and my 5 year old's basketball (don't ask lol) easily. It was easy to install - with a drill of course, not included (haha!). I know the competing brand (name?) has much worse reviews. I don't know about that brand but Prince Lionheart's toy hammock works great!
