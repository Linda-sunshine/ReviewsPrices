review/summary: Love it!review/text: Purchased this product for my niece as a Christmas gift, she loved it. I chose this product over the more popular brand because the product projects actual constellations, as opposed to a random mix of stars. The light is interchangeable, blue, green or amber. all project well in a dark room. I purchased the classic mocha, it is well made. I am super happy with this purchase.
