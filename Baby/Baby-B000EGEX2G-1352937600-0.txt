review/summary: DO NOT BUY! POOR QUALITY! Read this before purchasing!review/text: I never usually write reviews on items purchased online, however, I feel like I must warn anyone interested in this product. My husband and I picked this glider out online thinking it was perfect to match our baby girl's nursery. I even read the reviews and thought 4 out of 5 stars means it must be pretty good. I was wrong. We just received the delivery yesterday and put it together about an hour ago and already I'm dissatisfied.First when unpacking the items from the box, we noticed lots of scuff marks and chips on the white wood finish. They were all over the bottom chair piece and the ottoman. It bummed me out but decided it might be better to touch up the imperfections rather the going through the hassle of returning it.Then we put it together, assembly was fairly simple. Except the arm covers seem a little too short to snap on but after stretching it out we got them on. The seat cushion was horrible quality, super thin and cheap looking. the beige material had wrinkles in it as if it was not sewn properly. Not to mention the chair height was kinda on the short side.After chair was put together, my husband sat it and it made the most annoying squeaking noises. Then I tried it and same thing. I couldn't imagine trying to rock my baby to sleep using that chair. We thought maybe the screws were too tight and that didnt fix the problem, the squeaks were coming from the chair backing (where the rods were) which you cant really fix that issue) Being a first time mom and having a baby on the way, the last thing I need is to worry about going through the hassle of return such an expensive big item. Not happy at all! Really disappointed. I cant figure out how to post pics to review but Im posted to customer images of product.
