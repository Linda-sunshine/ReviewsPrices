review/summary: Great fun but music box is faultyreview/text: i just want to start this review by stating the my little one loves the toy. we sing a little song when it's time to go jump in the jumperoo and she gets very excited. for the play aspect of the toy, it certainly gets 5 out of 5 stars! The jumperoo has so much to offer Little that it can keep her busy for hours, though we do follow the recommendation of only 30 minutes twice a day. it's sturdy construction, bright and colorful design make it a great purchase.that being said, though, i am very disappointed with the music box on this toy. for the first couple of days that we had it, it played the music correctly. it was responsive to Little's movements and did everything that it should. but after a couple of days, it would restart the sounds in the middle of a song. when Little would spin one of the toys, the music would cut out or restart. at times, the music would just stop playing all together. the lights would still flash and the animal affects would still make noise, but the music was gone. it was a bit frustrating for the adults. Little didn't notice it, but for the price, i wanted a toy that worked properly. we exchanged it (i love amazon exchanges, so easy) and after a few days, all the same problems returned.would I recommend this toy to another parent? honestly, i don't know. the music thing is really annoying, but the design and play is quite awesome. tough call.
