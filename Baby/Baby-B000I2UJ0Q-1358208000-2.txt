review/summary: love it!! i strongly recommend itreview/text: We bought this product when my son was 3 month old and now he is 6 month old and he loves it. Its really nice and easy to set up. It's safe and secure for any baby. My son play everyday for at least 2 to 3 hours in it. The toys are great and the music is cute
