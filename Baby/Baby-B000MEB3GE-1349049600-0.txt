review/summary: Very simple and usefulreview/text: My husband and I use this every single day. We can easily see how long it's been since our son ate, since I have pumped, etc. You can also set an alarm to sound after a certain amount of time. Totally useful and easier than watching the clock, because the times start running together after a while.
