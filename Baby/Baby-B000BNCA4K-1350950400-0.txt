review/summary: Excellent!review/text: We received this toy as a gift for our (then) 2 month old. She took to it right away and it has become her favorite item to play with and engages her for the longest. It's incredibly easy to grasp, or even just stick a fist through and easily fits into the mouth. I anticipate that as we move into the teething stage it will become even more useful as a teether. The colors are fun and engaging and she'll stare at it for a good long while (for her, lol)At a mom's meeting it even had another baby her age staring at it from across the room! Definitely a great toy, good for developing basic hand/eye coordination and gripping.
