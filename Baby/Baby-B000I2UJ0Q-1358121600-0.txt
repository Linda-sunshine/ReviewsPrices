review/summary: Toys? What toys?review/text: My baby seems to enjoy the jumperoo, she is 5 months old, but I wish I would have really considered the toys before purchasing this jumper, as most are out of reach. The rainbow color wheel, tiger that you have to push to pop up and even the lizard in the rolling ball, are not very visible or reachable to a baby. The edge of the seat is so high it blocks her vision from even seeing the toys properly! And I can't forget to mention the turning elephant that is facing the wrong way and nearly impossible for a baby to turn. I am disappointed in the purchase as there are others out there that has toys that are actually visible for the baby to enjoy.
