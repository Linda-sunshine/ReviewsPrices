review/summary: It definitely is a toy with a multitude of activities, it is HOWEVER, not-so-good as walker...review/text: Maybe because my children both took initiatives toward walking just after six months and the baby has been walking over a month and is 10-months-old, but this is not the safest toy, on hardwood or laminate flooring, for a child without sturdy ankle-supported shoes and some directly-behind-or-nearby adult supervision. It tends to slide uncontrollably, which is obvious, but may explain why their are so many different range of reviews. It does not do that well on thick carpeting and is best on a flat area rug, in my humble opinion, unless your child is no longer a pre- or beginning walker but has is experienced with walking.It does help after they get their balance but not as much as just walking on their own, barefoot, with adult supervision and encouragement.I love the faux piano the shapes and other features such as songs. It even has an old-fashioned fun.On a side note, the whole toy has features that are not cohesive as an overall thematic idea. I guess for babies and tots it does not matter, some may say, and I could see that, but if you compare this other large vTech and competitive toys, well, it's just a tad stranger than most to the eye and to figure out the educational value as a whole, altogether, combined.
