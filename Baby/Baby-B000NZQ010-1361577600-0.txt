review/summary: So fun and colorful!review/text: We bought this for our 8 month old son and he loves it! The shapes at the top keep him well entertained and he loves pulling off the phone. Now that he is pulling himself up on stuff, he loves to stand and has even started taking steps with it. It has 2 speed settings on the wheels which has been nice for a beginner. We weren't sure if we should buy this one or one that was about 10 dollars cheaper and we are glad that we did!
