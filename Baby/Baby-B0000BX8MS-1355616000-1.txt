review/summary: Pretty Solid Sleep Sackreview/text: This was a good deal, so we tried it out. It's been a pretty solid sleep sack for our 8 month old. However, the zipper has had it's ups and downs as far as functionality goes. Overall, it's done what it was advertised to do, and our baby sleeps great in it.
