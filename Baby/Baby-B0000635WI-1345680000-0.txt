review/summary: Not ergonomical and very uncomfortablereview/text: I was so excited when my family bought me this pillow. I'm 33 weeks pregnant and definitely at the point where solid sleep is hard to come by. I thought this pillow would ease some of my discomfort, but instead it added to it. Not only is the pillow case material scratchy and annoying against my skin (as many of the other reviews say), it's not ergonomically correct! After the first morning of trying to use it, I woke up with the worst pain in my neck and had to go see my chiropractor for an adjustment. The pillow forces your neck to lay at a weird angel instead of straight in line with the rest of your spine. Also, I haven't had much lower back pain during my pregnancy, but using this pillow triggered it for me. I had been sleeping just fine with a pillow between my legs before I got this one, so that wasn't the issue. I'm 5'4" so maybe this has something to do with it, but I can't afford more chiro visits. The pillow itself is very uncomfortable with really tightly sewn seams that cut into any part of your body that touches it. I tried everything to fix the problems, including trying to use a separate pillow for my neck the 2nd night. I slept even worse than the 1st night. Very disappointed in this product. Sending it back.
