review/summary: We cannot stop jumping...review/text: We bought this because of all the great reviews. Even when looking at other products most reviewers always came back to the Rainforest Jumperoo. It was very easy to assemble and my son was sold from the beginning. He will jump like crazy and it brings such wonderful smiles and laughs out of him. He will also just sit and play with the toys as he turns around to find more and more. The seat is very easy to remove and clean which is a huge plus!
