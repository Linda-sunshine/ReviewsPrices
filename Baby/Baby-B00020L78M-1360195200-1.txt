review/summary: Works very wellreview/text: My little one is busy. She loves to get into everything she can find. I use this block off then living room exits rather than in the octagon shape. We use it everyday. The only down side is that it is sometime hard to open and close. I would love a gate option. Over all I would go crazy chasing a baby with out it.
