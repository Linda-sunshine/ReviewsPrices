review/summary: Awkward to transport but baby loves it!review/text: The only reason I gave this 4 stars is that it is VERY difficult to transport. Taking it from room to room isn't that difficult but from car to house it took me 2 trips and the base kept flopping all over the place. If you never plan to move it and don't mind the bulky storage, these problems can be overlooked. I'm still not sure it's worth the 80 bucks but my 6 month old is in love with this. He is slowly transitioning from his playgym and this toy allows him to sit/jump while playing with lots of fun toys. My favorite feature is that the seat rotates 360 degrees so that if he grows tired of one toy he is instantly re-interested with the next.
