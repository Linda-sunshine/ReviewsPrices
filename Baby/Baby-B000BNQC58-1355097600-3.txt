review/summary: Very cute!review/text: My two year old niece loves this, as well as my 26-year-old best friend! I got my niece the ladybug and my friend the turtle. There's something ageless about this that is a bit counter-instinctive but I truly appreciate what a wonderful idea this is. I will probably be getting more of these in the future! :)
