review/summary: Wish it came smallerreview/text: The carrier is perfect for an 8 lb baby or larger but my little guy is only 6.5 lbs. I'd love to be able to carry him around and still have my hands free but he is just too small for the carrier. Wish they made them for smaller babies. The actual construction is very good; sturdy material. Can't wait to be able to use it.
