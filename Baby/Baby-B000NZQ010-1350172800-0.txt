review/summary: Five-star toy for beginning walkersreview/text: I bought this for my niece and she loves it! She is learning how to let go of items and walk on her own, so this is great for her because she has to let go of the handle to play with the items on the front of the toy. The item is colorful and teaches all kinds of stuff from numbers to letters. My niece would push it around like a shopping cart.
