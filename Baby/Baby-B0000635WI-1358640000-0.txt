review/summary: Almost perfectreview/text: I've been using this Snoogle pillow since about the 12 week point. This is my second pregnancy and I knew how important a good body pillow was going to be so I didn't wait. Last go around I used a Boppy body pillow, but I wasn't entirely happy with the way that one held up so I switched to the Leachco. Overall this pillow has performed very well. It is firm and holds its shape well. I can fit the whole pillow in my standard size washing machine and it comes out fine. My husband has already called dibs on it after the baby is born :) Fat chance I'll give up my "nest" anytime soon though. I would recommend getting a second cover right away. They are reasonably priced and it does make laundering more convenient.
