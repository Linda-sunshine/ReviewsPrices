review/summary: Wasn't as good as I hopedreview/text: I thought I would really like this one, but I found that I was constantly fighting it. I hated washing the cover, because it was such a huge pain to try to get it back on. Also, half of it kept sliding off the bed. It wasn't as comfortable as I hoped, and I couldn't seem to get it positioned correctly to help support my growing belly.
