review/summary: So cute! Wish it lasted longer....review/text: My 2 year old adores this ladybug! I got her the blue-green one, and I was very excited about the new colors. She slept with it most every night, but now after 4 months the bulbs in the lights have burned out, and there is no way to replace them. I am so disappointed! We will try getting one of the originals this time, as they seem to get better reviews for lasting longer. I sure wish the ones with the cute colors were made to last!
