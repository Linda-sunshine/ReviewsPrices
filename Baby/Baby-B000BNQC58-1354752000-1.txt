review/summary: A Very Cool & Soothing Toy!!!review/text: This is such a cool toy!!! This turtle's body is soft & plush with a durable plastic hard shell:) I was going to purchase a couple of the Dream Lite plush toys that projected the starry night for my two nephews, but I read that product's & this product's descriptions and reviews and decided on purchasing this one:) Anyhow, Dream Lite projects "stars" and a "smiley face", but the "projected stars" don't seem to have any "constellations" within them for future "star gazers" while the Cloud B Turtle has eight "constellations" (star patterns) within its stars as well as a small paper "story book" that describes them:) Plus I think that the Dream Lite has only one color with it while the Cloud B Turtle has three "soothing colors" (there's a reason that they picked these colors for soothing effects): amber - color of twilight & a soothing fire, green - color of healing, rejuvenation, and the color of life, and blue - the color of the peaceful sky and sea:) The shell also lights up in these soothing colors as a cool "night-light" - it also shuts itself off after an hour:) The battery cover has a screw to hold it in place so that it can't come off as well as soft "flap" that velcro's over it:) The ONLY THING that I didn't like about it was that it included three batteries in it that didn't have a piece of plastic between them so that it wouldn't be activated in shipping - so the batteries were dead and I had to change them out... That's o.k. though because I was very surprised that there were three AAA Batteries included with it - even if they were "dead"!!! LOL:) I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COOL & SOOTHING PRODUCT FOR ANY CHILD - IT ALSO HELPS THE FEAR OF THE DARK OF SOME CHILDREN!!! Oh yeah, one more thing: I am into Astronomy as a Hobby and although I didn't expect the 8 constellations to be in the right area of the sky, but after a couple of nights of checking it out - I noticed that the constellations seem to be "backwards" - that is, they appear to be the right way on the "Turtle Shell", but when it is "projected" on the ceiling, they appear "backwards"!!! It still is a nice present though:) Enjoy It!!!
