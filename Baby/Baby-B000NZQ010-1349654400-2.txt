review/summary: My 1 year old daughter LOVES it.review/text: My daughter loves to push the Vtech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker around our kitchen and family room. The expression of absolute joy on her face is priceless as she looks up from her walk. When she is not grinning madly and walking, she also enjoys reaching around and playing with all of the interactive buttons and knobs.One minor criticism: The wheel resistance could have been a little greater when my daughter was first getting the hang of using walker. She never wiped out, but she came close a few times. (quick hands caught her)
