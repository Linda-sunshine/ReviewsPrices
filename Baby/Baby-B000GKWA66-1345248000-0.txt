review/summary: Nap Time Palreview/text: I ordered this giraffe for my grandson's 2nd birthday. It has 4 sounds that makes for a wonderful nap time pal for him. The only sound that is not soothing to me is the heartbeat, which sounds like a pacemaker ticker, otherwise than that, my grandson takes his pal everywhere he goes.
