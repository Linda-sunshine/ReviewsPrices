review/summary: Finally some relief!review/text: I am 26 weeks along on my 4th pregnancy. I weigh approximately 140 lbs and I am a little under 5,3&#34;. After reading reviews about the sizing I decided to buy a medium. I have to wear it on the smallest closure but I have room to grow. I think I could have bought a small and it would have worked well also, but I wanted to buy on the larger size just in case. I think how you carry your baby and your body type goes into play when buying this product. I think it is safe to say that buying one size up from where you would be according to the size chart is a good idea.I wish I would have bought this with my last pregnancy because I was in so much pain all the time! This product lifts and supports your growing belly and takes the pressure off hips and pelvic area immediately! I can't believe the difference it has made for me in the last 24 hours of wearing it! I even wore it to sleep in because I hurt rolling from side to side almost like my pubic region is broke. I didn't have that last night at all! Amazing! My body fells more rested today even though I got the same amount of sleep I normally do. I also noticed a difference walking up my stairs in my home. It normally hurts (pubic bone) but I have very little pressure if any today.I would highly recommend this to all those mommys-to-be looking for relief &#34;down under&#34; if you know what I mean! I really wish I had this before so I didn't have to suffer through all the pain for nothing!
