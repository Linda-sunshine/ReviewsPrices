review/summary: Big part of our little one night routinereview/text: My 17 month old has a cloud B turtle and we got this ladybug for my 4 month old little guy for christmas.We love how bright it makes the room and to watch the stars in the ceiling of the room. Since my oldest was about 5 months old every night just before I leave his room I turn this on and he just goes to sleep, he knows that once the stars appears its time for bed, no complaints, no tears.We haven't had to replace the batteries yet which is great and its also great that it has more than one color option for the lights, we never use the red as I don't care for it but love the green and blue. In the turtle the blue is the light that comes on once you turn it on but on the ladybug the standard on color is red so I have to switch it, again, that's just me as I am sure that neither one of my kids would care what color the light is.By the way, it may be a coincidence but since we got this my little guy has been sleeping much better.In short, great product, strongly recommended.
