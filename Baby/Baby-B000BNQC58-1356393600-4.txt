review/summary: Christmas 2012review/text: I purchased the cloud B turtle for my Grandson, who is 3, for Christmas this year. His bedroom is fairly dark, he only has one window, but we had no problem seeing all the colors reflecting nicely.I was worried about the lighting quality from others reviews but even if it hadnt been bright,which it is, Im not sure a small child would care. The fact that my grandson could switch colors was nice & he enjoyed that part of this toy. The cloth head, arms & legs are very soft which is nice. The shell is solid plastic but it still was small & light enough for him to carry around under his arm. He loved it and wanted us to stay in his room most of the time to "check it out". I saw dreamlights in stores, they cost more and I really like the cloud B better.I would reccomend this night light to anyone who has a child who loves the moon & stars.
