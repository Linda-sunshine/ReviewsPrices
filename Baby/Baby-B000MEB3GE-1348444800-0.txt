review/summary: It may not seem like it, but this little thing may become essential when taking care of babyreview/text: I ordered this item weeks before my due date because I felt like I would need something to help me track my baby's feedings. I'm so so so glad I did. I simply love this little timer. It has made my life so much easier. The different timers are not the only good thing about it. The nightlight function has worked wonders when my little baby asks for her milk during the night. I can feed her without turning the lights on so she can go back to sleep easily. Another thing, this product is incredibly resistant. I have dropped it to the floor like 5 times and it more still works. Of course, it suffered some damage, but it is still highly functional. I would recommend this to anyone who's about to have a baby. I never thought this thing would be so useful!
