review/summary: Totally Love it!review/text: My daughter is 4 years old and I bought the pink ladybug for her birthday. She loves her ladybug. And sleeps with it every single night. She watched me order it online (most reasonable price and better selection) and this child asked me each morning when she opened her eyes if her ladybug was here yet.That said..Ours has 3 color lights. Red, green and bluish purple. It has a 45 minute auto off switch (internal). I do wish there was an option to allow the colors to automatically alternate. That is just a personal preference. Also something to keep in mind, the more round the shell, the more scattered the stars. We like seeing them on the walls AND ceiling.All in all this is a 10 star toy for kids from ages 0-10. Fabulous newborn night light too. Great baby shower gift.
