review/summary: The best diapers we've used. And we tried them allreview/text: The Pampers Swaddlers are by far are favorite diaper.Pros:Wetness indicatorSofter than othersMesh lining seems to keep him dryer (no rashes using these diapers), had major issues using other brandsGreat absorption - Wears them for 11 hours at night with no issuesCons:Feel a little thinner and the back is not elastic like Huggies Snugglers.Overall, these are the best diapers out there for our son. Huggies Snugglers leaked, Huggies Snug N Dry made him cry as soon as he peed because he hated feeling wet. It also gave him diaper rash. The Luvs were the worst in that he got a rash after just 4 hours wearing those. Anyway, you'll find what is best for your child. For us, the Swaddlers are the best.
