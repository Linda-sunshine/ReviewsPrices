review/summary: Pretty Night Lightreview/text: Pretty Night Light. I bought an extra for when my granddaughter comes over. She is almost a year old and is just intrigued by the moon & stars cast on the ceiling. It helps occupy her until she realizes she REALLY is tired and falls to sleep. It turns itself off after 20 minutes. Battery operated, so it's mobile.I really like it. It has been a great buy!!!
