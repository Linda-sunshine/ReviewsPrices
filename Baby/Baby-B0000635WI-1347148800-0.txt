review/summary: LOVE ITreview/text: I think its awesome I have never slept better while pregnant...I will say there is one con with me and its just that the pillow can sometimes be uncomfortable on my neck and when I want to turn around at night and need to move the pillow it can be one hell of an effort especcially since I'm pregnant but yeah other than that LOVE IT!
