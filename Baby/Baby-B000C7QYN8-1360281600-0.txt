review/summary: Disappointed by the "new and improved" wipesreview/text: For 9 months, we loved Seventh Generation Free & Clear Baby Wipes. My son did not get diaper rash and the wipes were the perfect consistency between soft and moist. In my latest order, the package touted a new and improved wipe that was softer, etc. We found quite the opposite with the wipe being too wet and too hard. My son then started getting diaper rash so we had to stop using the wipe. I am really hoping they either go back to their old formula or tweak the new one. Until that happens, I have sadly stopped using the Seventh Generation wipes.
