review/summary: fabulous, fabulous toyreview/text: My son got this toy as a gift when he was 5 months old. He is 1 year old and still loves to play with it. It is fantastic in every way and i highly recommend it. Do not waste your money on Leapfrog toys. Horrible customer service and cheaply made toys.
