review/summary: Great for hip pain!review/text: At about 20 weeks into my pregnancy, I started to suffer from terrible hip pain/aches at night. I've had this pillow now for 2 nights and have had NO pain at all. When on your side, it alleviates pain on your top hip because the pillow between your legs helps align you. As for my bottom leg, since my top leg is already supported by the pillow it's resting on, you can slide your bottom leg out from under a bit so it doesn't bear the weight of the top. No hip pain! The top part (the head pillow part) is very comfortable and the pillow does support belly weight well. The one drawback, probably shared by all such pillows, is that it's a little cumbersome to twist and turn at night. Hard to reposition yourself each time you try to shift around. Great pillow though for alleviating my hip pain though!!
