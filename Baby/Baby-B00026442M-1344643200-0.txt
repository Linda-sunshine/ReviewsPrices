review/summary: Not my favoritereview/text: I love pampers but these diapers are just not that great. We seemed to have a lot of blow outs with these. They just do not seem to be made as nice as their other diapers. In my opinion it is worth spending the few extra dollars and getting the pampers swaddlers! They just seem to fit a so much better, hold more baby surprises:), and have the wetness indicator which as an exhausted new mom is a really nice thing to have!
