review/summary: Cute Night Lightreview/text: Great night light, especially for the price. The kids (2 and 4) are going through a scared of the dark phase but I didn't want them to be tempted to play with a normal plug in one. This is a great solution cause I can put it up, but it wouldn't be an issue if they did play with it. They were so excited with the moon and star lights and the ability to change colors.
