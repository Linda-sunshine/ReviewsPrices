review/summary: The wetness indicator cannot be beatreview/text: We have been using pampers swaddlers diapers since our toddler was born. The diaper is good for our baby's sensitive skin, its soft, the value is great and the fit perfect. The diapers don't leak even under extreme conditions :) And the wetness indicator cannot be beat. It has been almost impossible for me to find these diapers in stores, and I am very grateful for online delivery. I only wish they had the wetness indicator on size 4 diapers.
