review/summary: Awesome for the pricereview/text: Bought this because I wanted the ottoman. At the store I could only get a set for about $250 and up. We need the ottoman for the babies room since we have a standard recliner with side leaver which is not easy to use when having a sleeping baby in your arm. I ordered this Saturday and got it Thursday. Minimal assembly was required, less then 10 minutes. Quality is as decent as I have found in stores. I would most definitely recommend this item for the price.
