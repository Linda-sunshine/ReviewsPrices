review/summary: VERY stretchyreview/text: I ordered two jumbo-sized hammocks because my kids have way too many toys. Honestly, this hammock was almost too big and stretchy. I placed it near the ground for easy access for the kids, but had to keep moving it up because everything made it sink to the floor. I'm very pleased, though, and surprised that this actually is &#34;jumbo,&#34; as stated. If I ever need to purchase more of these or order replacements, I'm definitely going with the same hammocks because it makes the out of control toy collection look like I have just a few.The material of the hammocks is a nicely done and good quality polyester; they should both last for a long time with continued use. The rope (mesh? I'm not sure what to call it!) is very sturdy, stretchy and durable. I love the product, but I'm not sure I accounted very well for the size. &#34;Jumbo,&#34; in relation to children, is usually such a loose term. Normally everything is just too small. Not this!
