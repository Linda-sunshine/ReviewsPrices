review/summary: playardreview/text: This is your typical playard, the only thing i don't like about it is it did not come with instructions, i know how to set up the general part but for the canopy part i wasnt sure where to put the poles. and if my baby is going to lay that high i want to make sure everything is set up right. might sound dumb on my part for not knowing but for now i will just put the extra poles and netting away, not a huge loss. but all baby stuff should have instructions. seems to be as good quality as others i have used/had in the past.
