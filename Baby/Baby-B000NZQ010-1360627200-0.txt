review/summary: Great Toy to Grow Withreview/text: My then 8-month old son received this as a Christmas gift. He was in the early stages of standing and this toy wasn't ideal, but it served it's purpose. He loved, and still loves, the "toy" part and the "walker" part helped him to balance himself more. He fell a few times, but what child doesn't when learning to stand and walk. Now he's 9.5 months and he still loves this item, both "toy" and "walker." He's standing well but won't take steps when we encourage him. But with this item he tries and you can see him figuring out how to walk and stay balanced while pushing the "walker."Every child is different and every parent even more so. I've enjoyed and I'm still enjoying the learning benefits of this toy. Whether or not it's for you and your child is really a decision you have to make. It all depends on where your child is and what your comfortable with "safety-wise." As I mentioned above, what child doesn't fall a few times at this stage of life.
