review/summary: love itreview/text: My 2 month old already loves this gym, and I am looking forward to when he can grasp the toys. He stays happy right now in it for about 10 mins on his own, longer if I play with him. He loves the music and stares at the lights. My only gripe is that it came with few toys, but that can be a good thing too because there are several places to attach your own and we filled it up! Great product. Also, it arrived on Christmas Eve, two days earlier than I expected. Excellent.
