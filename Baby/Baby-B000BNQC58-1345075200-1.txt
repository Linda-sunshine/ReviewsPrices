review/summary: Love it!review/text: At this point, I definitely like this product more than my infant daughter (who is not included in the recommended age), but I imagine she'll catch up to me. Works great to help see in the dark for diaper changes. Is also wonderful to look at while nursing or falling asleep. Can be educational when children are a little older and in the recommended age range.
