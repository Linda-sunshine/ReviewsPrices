review/summary: Great Night lightreview/text: We love this product! Our son is almost 2 and loves to watch the moon and stars when he goes to bed. He asks for it if we don't turn it on. It is also nice that it shuts off automatically.This is the 2nd one we purchase because the batteries melted in the 1st one. Not sure why. This why I give it a 4 and not a 5.
