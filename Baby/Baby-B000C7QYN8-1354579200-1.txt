review/summary: Perfect grandma wipes too! :-) for MAKE-UP, that is!review/text: What am I doing with baby wipes when my baby is in her 30s and the grandkids are hitting their teens? Well, for quite some time I have been hunting in vain for decent fragrance-free MAKE-UP wipes--and trying unbelievably expensive ones, too. I FINALLY recalled (I must do something about my delayed-action memory!) that back in the 70s when my baby actually was one, I used to borrow from her unscented baby-wipe packs for my make-up removal. So this time I switched my search to unscented baby wipes and found these right away. They seemed perfect for sensitive elderly face skin as well as for the other end of an infant. They arrived, I used them and they did remove the make-up, even from the eyes, with no resulting itch or dryness! Better than ANY make-up wipes I've used. And a goodly supply, too!
