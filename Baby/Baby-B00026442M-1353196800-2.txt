review/summary: White material leaks out from diapers and cause messesreview/text: This is the 3rd different package of Pampers diapers (size 5 twice and now size 6) the diapers opens and causes a mess of white fluffy material spread on my baby's body and of the floor. Difficult to clean, but no rash (I have seen some other reviewers mentioning rash on their babies).This did not happen previously when I used Pampers to my other 2 boys (9-11 years ago), so I think it has to do the factory and the diapers now are not sealed right.
