review/summary: Serves its purposereview/text: This product is fine. People complaining about it have legitimate points, but at the same time, they're points easy to go around. Some of the reviewers aren't happy about the general "dog-cage" appearance, and that it appears cheap. Because it is cheap, and it's obviously a "cage". It's a good product to buy if you can't spend a lot of money, but you need a little something to contain the little one in. These things aren't made to baby-sit your kid. It's purpose is to provide a temporary, safe location for your baby while you run to the restroom or are making food, etc. Any baby will be smart enough to figure out how to move the gates around eventually. Doesn't mean the product sucks.It works fine, and it's also versatile. It can easily be a wide gate to block off an entrance or just as a plain fenced-in pen. I'm satisfied with it. It's good for those times you have to take a quick break or need a breather. Keeping the little one in sight, but not having to worry about them discovering a corner you forgot to baby-proof. The product does great at accomplishing that task. And it breaks down, so if you hate looking at it, just tuck it away.
