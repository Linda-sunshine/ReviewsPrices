review/summary: Fabulous!review/text: Agree with all the positive reviews--this seat is awesome--it's compact (fits perfectly on a regular dining chair and is very easy to assemble/pack up), lightweight, and easy to clean (no fabric, yay!). The removable (dishwasher safe) tray makes it just that much easier to clean, which is a plus. Our large 8-month-old seems both comfortable and secure (hasn't found a way to escape yet). Plus you can't beat the price.
