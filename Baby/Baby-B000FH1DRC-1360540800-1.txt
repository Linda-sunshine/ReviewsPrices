review/summary: Smaller sized packs instead of larger onesreview/text: Not sure if this is the norm, but I received 7 packs of 20 diapers each, instead of 2 giant packs in a box. I liked that the packs were smaller as the diapers were fresher, instead of being kept open. I did not like the fact that the diapers did not have the baby sesame street characters in them. They look cute. But overall I did not notice any difference in performance of the diapers that I bought from the big box baby store. Therefore no points deducted from the rating. For the price, I love it and will buy again.
