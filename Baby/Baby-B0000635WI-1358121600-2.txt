review/summary: Good product for a good pricereview/text: I'm writing this review on behalf of my wife. I purchased it for her and so far, she sleeps with it every night. At first it was awkward for her to sleep with but now she has her regular sleeping positions and loves the pillow. She hasn't had any issue with the firmness or the feeling of the material on her skin, so I take that as her being happy with both. My only issue is that my space on our Queen size bed has been reduced with the addition of this pillow (minor discomfort for the spouse). I would recommend this product to others.
