review/summary: Perfect!review/text: I bought this for my son for his room as a night light. It is perfect! He absolutely loves it. It has a timer and will turn itself off, so the batteries will save life. There are 3 different colors and it can be put anywhere. We all love that you can see constellations and a moon.
