review/summary: Simple and fool proofreview/text: We ordered this crib a few months ago. It is easy to set up and take down. What I like most about this crib is it doesnt have all the "extras" that we will not use.I would recommend using the American Baby sheets not the Graco brand. The American baby sheets are soft and cozy. The Graco sheets feel like sand paper and had to be returned.
