review/summary: Too great for words!review/text: I have so many great things to say about the Baby K'Tan that I couldn't even think of a headline. I read so many reviews before purchasing one, and I didn't hesitate to order it.I received the product 3 days after ordering it. It was packaged very nicely. I took out the instruction manual and had the Baby K'Tan on with my baby nice and secure within five minutes. I've always been intimidated by baby carriers, but the Baby K'Tan is so easy to use!I took my baby out for the first time yesterday, and it took less than five minutes to get her out of her carseat and into the carrier. She slept most of the time we were out. I was able to breastfeed her as well without having to take her out. I wore her for hours and my back never got tired.I'm going to be recommending the Baby K'Tan to EVERYONE. It's definitely a must have for any mother.
