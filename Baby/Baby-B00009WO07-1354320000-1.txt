review/summary: Leaks a lotreview/text: My son is very active and notorious when it comes to peeing. This diaper does not hold as much as the swaddlers does. It also sags a lot. Total waste of money! We switch toCruisers and its way better he can swirm, run, jump and no leaks even when he poop. I recommend Pampers cruisers for a very active boy.
