review/summary: glad I got the large sizereview/text: This was a very good alternative to using blankets for my baby in the winter. Very glad I got the large size instead of medium when I purchased it. My baby really grew quickly into it. Love the zipper going from top to bottom, give easy access to checking and even changing her diaper in the middle of the night.
