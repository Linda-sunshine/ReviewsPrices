review/summary: Horriblereview/text: Several of these diapers broke at the side seams causing the gel material to fall out and leave a trail everywhere our toddler went until we finally figured out where it was coming from. Happened with three more diapers in order and after vacuuming for over one our we gave up and tyre the rest out.
