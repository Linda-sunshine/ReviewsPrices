review/summary: fun gymreview/text: My baby loves his Fisher-Price Rainforest Gym. There are so many parts for him to play with. One thing I love about this gym is it plays music and nature sounds. It can easily be folded and put away so it doesn't take up space when not being used. The mat can be taken off and machine washed which is convenient. There really is nothing bad for me to say about it :)
