review/summary: Just got it!review/text: I just got the Baby Bjorn as a gift at a shower and love it! While I'm only just "playing" with it (the baby isn't here yet) -- I've put it on, messed with the buckles, adjusted the straps, even messed around with a stuffed animal to see how easy the operation is one-handed. Pretty slick! I'm glad I went with the recommendation of so many others, including my brother and sister-in-law...can't wait to try it out for real!
