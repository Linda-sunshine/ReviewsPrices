review/summary: They leak, stink, and cause rashesreview/text: People kept telling me to try Pampers because they hold a lot of pee. We primarily use cloth diapers and our cloth diapers work well for nighttime (11 hours) but sometimes I just hate waking up to that ammonia stink. I decided to try some different kinds of disposables to see if I could find a brand that would work all night without a change. We tried Seventh Generation and Nurtured by Nature, and they work off and on. I thought I would finally give some Pampers a try and see if the package was right. It says these are good for 12 hours. Not for us! They leak worse than the chlorine-free disposables and stink like powder. My son's closet (where these are stored) now has a stinky powdery smell. Some people might like this smell, but to me it smells bad. I decided to use them up by using them during the day and they gave my son a horrible rash.Never. Again.
