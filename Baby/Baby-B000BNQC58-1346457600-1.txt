review/summary: A different Point of Viewreview/text: We bought the Cloud B Twilight Constellation Night Light for my new grandson. The only problem is that his big sister (3 years old) loved it so much her parents gave the turtle to her and bought a second one for my grandson who is still too young to realize his sister has the turtle. I would call that a good review!
