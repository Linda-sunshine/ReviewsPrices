review/summary: Nice highlights but music setting Too Loud!review/text: I bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. They love them! The light work great but the music setting is VERY LOUD! We can hear it downstairs clearly- our bedrooms are upstairs.As far as I know there's no way to adjust the volume.
