review/summary: My daughter would spend hours in this if we let her.review/text: My daughter is currently almost seven months old, and we've been using this with her since she was just shy of three months. She's loved it since day one.Yes, she was technically too small for it when we started using it. We had to put a small pillow under her feet to prevent her from dangling in the seat. But she was immediately enthralled with all the lights and toys when we first put her in it. Four months later, I'd say it's probably her favorite toy of all. How do I know this? If she's in the room with the jumperoo, she immediately gravitates toward it. We'll have her on the floor, and she'll roll over to it and get really excited, shaking her arms and legs until we lift her into the seat. Then she goes nuts bouncing and banging on all the toys, and shrieking like crazy.From a parent's perspective, it's been awesome watching her grow into the toy ... from barely understanding that she can make the toys move to her now consciously spinning the spinners and pushing the buttons, and knowing how to pivot the seat in different directions.
