review/summary: Made very well, & Not lightweight (A good thing)review/text: I received the gate today & had it installed in less than 15 minutes or so. Other revievers of this gate have mentioned that it looked bent when they received theirs. Mine looked bent too, buty there is a label on the package saying that it will look this way until installed. I guess the original packaging did not mention that fact and several people returned their gates and complained here about them.It takes a couple of minutes to get the gate mounting just right and for getting the latch mechanism to work smoothly, but really no big deal at all. I did not use the screws to mount the 4 mounting cups yet to the door jambs, but I will tomorrow. The pressure fit into the jamb is pretty secure by itself, but I will put the screws in, and it should only take about 5 minutes or so to do that.This gate is well made and should last a long time from the way it looks. It does have some plastic parts, but I think they should be OK; time will tell.I saw pretty much the same gate at "the" major pet supply store, and it was selling at almost twice the price as on Amazon. And Prime shipping is great too.
