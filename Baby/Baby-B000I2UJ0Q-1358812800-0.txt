review/summary: So much fun!review/text: I was kinda against a whole bunch of baby gear in my house taking up space - but I was running out of activites for the baby to do - and he has such a blast in this! He had the head control but was too short for a few months. We had to put the wii balance board underneath him so he could reach the ground. He now plays with all the toys and has an absolute ball.It is a little cumbersome to move around but it's not too bad. It gives us a 10-15 minute break to do something else while he has fun.
