review/summary: Worked great for usreview/text: I really liked the swaddlers diapers. But when we had to transition to larger sizes, we went with these. We have used them from size 3 to our current size 5. They have done the job. We are very happy with them, they do well with both #1 and #2. Love that Amazon has coupons on them from time to time, and that the large pack is much cheaper per unit than the smaller packs. We will continue to use them until he no longer needs them. My son loves the Sesame Street Characters. Makes changing time a bit easier on me.
