review/summary: eyes open?review/text: I wanted the purple turtle because it's eyes were open in the picture shown. In other places online I've seen what looks like the same turtle, with eyes open and others with eyes shut. I wasn't certain how this would arrive. So I was pleased that the purple twilight turtle I ordered DID come with 'open' eyes. The classic mocha twilight turtle from amazon arrived with closed eyes (again, as shown). This isn't truly a big deal, but it mattered to me- so I thought this info may be helpful to others as well. These turtles were given as gifts, so I can't attest to their performance or durability.
