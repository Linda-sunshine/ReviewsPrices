review/summary: Chair at Grandma's housereview/text: I bought this for my grandson's visits. I don't have a highchair and having this at my house keeps my daughter and son-in-law from having to pack up one more bulky item in the car when they come to visit. I like that it is adjustable in all the right areas. The bright colors seem to attract my grandson's eyes -- he looks at it like its a toy. We have never had a problem getting him to get into his &#34;chair&#34;.
