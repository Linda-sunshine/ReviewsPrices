review/summary: ehreview/text: This is a great idea, not in practice. I was not able to put it together, open it, anything. My husband had to do it all. It is not easy to open and shape as you want. It is good if you want to make it and leave it and just step in and out from over it. We wanted to use it in different shapes, against a wall, and then it was hard, it did not snap easily.
