review/summary: Versatilereview/text: Easily adapted to what ever changes I wanted to make. Used it to block off hallways by making a square and used it to block off furniture. Easy to step over and very light but very durable. One con is my kid was able to push the fence if it was on a hard surface. Problem solved by adding weights.I would buy again, but I don't need to as this one set made it through our first year.
