review/summary: Too complicatedreview/text: After hearing everyone rave about how great it was, I bought one of these while I was pregnant. Even then, I found it way too complicated. I read the book, watched all the videos, had people help me. I loved the idea of the Moby Wrap, but it was too much fabric and took too long to put on. I ended up getting an Ergo, and could not be happier. I can put my baby in the Ergo in a snap and it feels much sturdier than the Moby did. Wish I could say I liked it, but it just wasn't for me.
