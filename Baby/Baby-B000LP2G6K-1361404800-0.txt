review/summary: Sooo much better than the previous model!!review/text: Slightly smaller: allows for you to actually "pack" it up easily and "go"Wheels: allows for it to be easily moved from room to room. It's also sleek enough to fit through doorways!Infant level (elevated base) is more stable than previous model. Before when I had my other baby in the infant level it wasn't sturdy. The rods that supported it didn't do much. And the whole level swung back and forth. The new model has plastic clips that stabilize the entire level and doesn't "swing".Overall the structural improvements make this pack n play way more desirable. Plus the low cost is another added bonus!We were tired of sharing a pack n play with the grandparents so we bought this one. I loved the owls! So cute!!! I was hoping the 3 stars that dangle would have been owls but oh well. I still gift it 5 stars!
