review/summary: Sturdy gate, a little complicated to openreview/text: We have had a gate that was very similar to this one in the past, but that one wore out after 7 years' use. This gate is sturdier than the one we had in the past, and the part that actually swings open is wider, which makes it more useful. I also find the feature that keeps the gate open if you open it past a certain point but helps it close automatically if you don't to be a helpful feature. The gate is sturdy and easy to set up (althougth we are experiencing some problems with our slightly rounded baseboard in the doorway--but that is not a problem with the gate itself.)The two things that are not as positive: 1. You have to use 2 steps to open the gate--slide a small piece and lift up. It is complicated for my 4-year-old, who does not need to be kept out of areas, so I end up having to interrupt my work to help her open it, and sometimes I have trouble if I have something in my other hand, and 2. The bottom bar that keeps the gate stable is taller than my last gate, so I end up kicking it or tripping over it occasionally. This is probably the feature that contributes to the stability of the gate, so I'm not sure if it can be changed, but a lower bottom bar would be a bit safer (I also have older parents that baby sit for us, and I've been reminding them so they don't trip over it)Overall, a strong gate, and a good value for the price.
