review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I bought this for my son last year for Christmas in hopes it would help with his need to have a light on in his room. It didn't. Then after just a couple if months it stopped working altogether. Replaced the batteries and it still didn't work. I forgot about it and didn't email the company so I'm just out the money.
