review/summary: Pampers are a must for my familyreview/text: This is by far my favorite diaper for my baby. For our baby shower we received about 4 different brands of diapers and after trying all of them out this is the best.1. This diaper holds tons of pee. I've only had 1 leak after almost 6 months and that was because the flaps did not get pulled out... so that was user error.2. The fit of this diaper was the best compares to all others I've tried.3. My husband prefers this one because when he fastens the diapers he sometimes pulls too hard and rips the whole fastener off... and with how expensive diapers are it's a shame to have to throw it away unused. So far Pampers is the only one where that hasn't happened.
