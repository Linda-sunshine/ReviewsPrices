review/summary: Keeps the baby busyreview/text: I bought this for my three month old grandson. From the moment it was put together and he started to play with it....he LOVED it. The lights and music kept him happy and smiling for well over an hour. I couldn't be more happy with this product. It was quick to assemble with lots of great features to keep happy and busy.
