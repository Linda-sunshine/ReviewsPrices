review/summary: My daughter loves the moon...review/text: We were going on a trip to Iceland and I wanted to bring a sort of nightlight with us. Since my 2 year old daughter LOVES looking for the moon at night and I'd had this on her wish list since she was born I thought this would be the perfect thing to get. She LOVES it and wants to turn on her turtle before every nap and when she goes to bed at night. We find the blue light seems to work best for giving a crisper edge to the stars since we don't elevate it at all and she's gotten so used to them being blue that she turns it on and then hits the middle button for blue stars right away. We just put it on the floor in the middle of her room each night and the images are crisp enough.The turtle itself is very cute and has held up to her stepping on it to reach her light switch. I don't recommend this though! She just happened to do it one morning before I could stop her and it was ok. She's had a Cloud B Giraffe since she was born which is turned on every night and it has held up extremely well so I have high hopes that the turtle will too. So far the turtle has survived a trip to Iceland and back and 4 months with a 2 year old and it's in perfect shape still. She also throws things around when she is having a temper tantrum and turtle was thrown once, but the electronics and lights seem to be holding up just fine.It doesn't get hot at all and turns off automatically after 45 minutes which is usually enough time for her to fall asleep, except for the really awful days when sometimes we turn it on twice.
