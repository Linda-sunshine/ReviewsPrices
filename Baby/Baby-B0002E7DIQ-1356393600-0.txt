review/summary: Best thing to get yourself while pregnant!review/text: This pillow is the best thing I have gotten for myself during my pregnancy! I reluctantly purchased it when I was around 23 weeks and was suffering from severe backache. Now that I have been using this pillow for about 5 weeks, I must say that the quality of my sleep has improved manifolds! It has also helped my backache immensely! I am not very tall at about 5'2 and it's a perfect fit for me, but I am not sure how it would work for taller women.Since I am from Canada, the shipment cost me (about) the same as the pillow which was a bummer.. but in all honesty, it's worth each penny! Also, Amazon did a great job with shipping, as it arrived within 2 business days. VERY happy customer! :)
