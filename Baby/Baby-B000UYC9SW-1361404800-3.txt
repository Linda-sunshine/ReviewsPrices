review/summary: One of the BEST Baby Buys!review/text: I could not live without the baby K'Tan! We started using it when our baby was about two weeks old. The first time I put her in it she was crying and fussing and within two minutes she was calm and fell asleep. It happened so quickly that I thought &#34;That was a fluke. It couldn't have anything to do with the K'Tan.&#34; But, time and time again, the K'Tan proved that it would seriously calm her down and put her to sleep in three minutes or less. I immediately bought one for my husband as well. Now, after 2 months, it's still my go-to when she's crying and fussing. I use it on a daily basis.
