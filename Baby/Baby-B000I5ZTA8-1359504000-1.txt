review/summary: They should hand these out like candy!review/text: I have nothing but good things to say about this product. Right around 26 weeks (and about 23 pounds), I started developing serious pain in my SI joint, and was barely able to make it to work and home. My doctor recommended this product and within 15 minutes of putting it on I started to experience relief. I've been wearing it every day for about 3 weeks now, and I don't know what I'd do without it. It seems to provide me just enough support that my poor lower back isn't bearing the whole burden. I sit at a desk most of my day, and I find it just as comfortable to sit in as to walk and exercise in. I'm 5'11" and was right at 180 pounds when I bought the belt, so I purchased the medium and found the fit to be just fine. I wear it on the tightest setting, although now at 29 weeks I find I'm moving it down to the next lower position more often.
