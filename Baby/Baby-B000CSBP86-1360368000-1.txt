review/summary: I don't understand positive reviews.review/text: I truly don't understand the good reviews this has. If you research this product everyone says how it is not good for adult or baby. So I'm at a loss with these reviews. I honestly think people don't know better, I know I didn't. The product is easy to use and I thought there was supposed to be some pain, I mean after all you are carrying a baby. This was until I did some research and tried other carriers.I bought this while I as pregnant since it was a popular brand. I could last 10 minutes tops and my baby hated it bI've tried the ergo and the beco and they are a million better and my baby doesn't cry. Trust me its worth the money and time to research a carrier that works for you. I highly doubt the bjorn will.
