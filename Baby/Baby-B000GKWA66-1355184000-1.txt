review/summary: Malfunctioningreview/text: This item was purchased for my baby girl off of our registry. We liked it initially, but after five months of use the sound machine started to malfunction. The two sounds we used most often, showers and ocean, now only play for a second after pressing the button even though the timer is set for 45 minutes. We tried changing the batteries, but it didn't help. Now, a month and a half later, the other two sounds are going out too. We were not using the sheep an excessive amount, usually only 45 minutes at night time. Occasionally she would stir after 45 minutes and we would restart it.The sound machine is now useless and the sleep sheep is just a expensive stuffed animal. We've moved on to using a free white noise generator on the internet for bed time if she needs a little extra help falling asleep. I wouldn't recommend this sound machine. It is overpriced for something that only lasts a few months.
