review/summary: Worth the $$$review/text: I bought this pillow after many restless nights of hip and back pain. I like that I don't have to reposition my pillows every time I need to flip from side to side (which nowadays is very frequently!) My husband and I share a queen sized bed and find it to fit well. The pillow seems to get more and more comfortable as my belly expands. In fact it is so comfortable that when I get up in the morning my husband uses it! BUY THIS PILLOW. Don't suffer another night.
