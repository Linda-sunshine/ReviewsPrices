review/summary: Welcome to our learning farm!review/text: There's so much to show you! You will have this song stuck in your head for ever with this toy but it brings so much happiness to my daughter. It's become an ongoing joke when it starts talking on its own...kinda possessed at times but fun none the less. The only thing I caution is that you don't have your child play with it mounted to the walker part until they're totally ready to walk as it doesn't have brakes and will slip, even on carpet. We have it up against a wall so she can stand next to it...next stop walking behind it!
