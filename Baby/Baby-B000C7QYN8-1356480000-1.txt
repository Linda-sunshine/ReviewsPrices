review/summary: Good value good for babyreview/text: These wipes are big enough and thick enough to really clean up. We love that they are a more healthful alternative to all of the chemicals in the other products. I feel good about wiping up my sensitive skin son with these. Good value when you order the case on auto ship. They come out to 2 cents a piece making them the same price as the coscto (wharehouse) brand alternative.Update: they replaced these with a new package and the subscribe and save is now more expensive but still a good wipe. It takes a few for the poopy diapers but they are gentle and soft and great.
