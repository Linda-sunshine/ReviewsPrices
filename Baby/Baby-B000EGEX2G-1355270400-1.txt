review/summary: Cheap material and wrong item was deliveredreview/text: First let me tell you that I never write a review about anything before, but i think i have to do on this item. I ordered it twice from amazon and received the wrong color every time. luckily amazon customer service was easy on returns and fed ex came and pick the package up.the product itself looks cheap, the cushions smelled like a strong chemical or something. The holes on the hand rest and the back piece were not matching and it was hard to assemble the chair. and the button on one armrest cushions was getting loose.do not waste your time and money on this product.
