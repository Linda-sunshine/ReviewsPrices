review/summary: Critical piece of the extension was missing upon arrival. Now fixed.review/text: A small piece of plastic at the bottom of one of the extension bars was missing when the gate arrived.Considering that we paid for next day shipping (so that we could use the gate quickly), this merits a "fail".Gate looks sturdy --- it's too bad a more complete review can't be provided. Now we'll contact the mfgr. to see about the missing piece.----------------------------------------------Updated: A customer service agent in Minnesota found a replacement piece at HQ and shipped it to us quickly. The gate is now installed (the video in the pictures section helps) and the two Yorkie pups (6 months old) are now safely in their day-room where they have a bit more space (unsupervised) than their sleeping crate gives them.Kudos for the quick response, review has now been updated from one star to five stars.
