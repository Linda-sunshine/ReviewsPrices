review/summary: Instant Peacereview/text: At the recommendation of a few close friends we decided to try out the Moby. We watched a couple videos on which wrap techniques were best and/or easiest. Long story short, no matter how we wrapped her, our daughter instantly fell asleep once inside. This provides instant peace and increased productivity around the house. The wrap did not lead to any back pain or uncomfortable unbalance while using it. We would definitely buy again, our only regret is not purchasing this for our first child!
