review/summary: Great toy with extended use.review/text: It's hard to find toys that infants through toddlers enjoy. This is one of the items I purchased for use at my child care center and is probably one of the simplest and most used. Small infants can grasp it with problem and older infants through toddlerhood use it almost like a ball. It's brightly colored, holds up well to extended use, super easy to clean, and has a wide range of age interaction... and isn't over priced.
