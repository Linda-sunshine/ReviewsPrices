review/summary: I took the Huggies challenge and Pampers are the best Diapers!review/text: I took the Huggies challenge and Pampers are the best Diapers! No comparison! My daughter would explode out of the Huggies, but the Pampers Baby Dry work very well, no leaks or explosions. They also smell better than other brands. I have used Pampers with both of my kids, and have never had issues.
