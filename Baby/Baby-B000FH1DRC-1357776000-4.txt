review/summary: My favorite diapersreview/text: We've tried several brands of diapers that we recieved from our baby showers and these are my favorite. They fit my daughter well, do not leak, and seem to be a little larger than the Target brand diapers so we can use the same size for a bit longer. The wetness indicator is nice for quick checks throughout the day.
