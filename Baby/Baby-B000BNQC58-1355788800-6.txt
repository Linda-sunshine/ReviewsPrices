review/summary: Doesn't last....review/text: This really is pretty cute and neat the way it lights up the ceiling with stars. However, unfortunately it didn't even last a year before all but one of the lights went out on it and it wasn't used that much. They are LED lights inside which if were of a decent quality should have lasted for years. The paint on the shell also scratches pretty easily. For these reasons I have to give it two stars since it is just going to take up space in a landfill.
