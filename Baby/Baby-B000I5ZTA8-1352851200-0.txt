review/summary: Worth the $review/text: During the last trimester of my pregnancy, the baby was sitting really low and my hips hurt all the time. I ordered this and started wearing it whenever I had to be on my feet for a while or when I exercised. It felt like it took some of the pressure off my hips. However, I did not think it was comfortable to sit or drive while wearing it. The size chart is accurate and it was easy to wear. No one could tell it was under my clothes. I weighed about 190 pounds during my third trimester and I wore the medium (never had to use the loosest eyehook closures).
