review/summary: too dryreview/text: i bought a huge pack of these wipes. they are nice and thin but need a little more juice to them. when baby has some crusted poop you really have to scrub hard with these wipes to get it off due to the lack of moisture in the wipes. just tried the huggies natural care ones which are a lot better in my opinion.
