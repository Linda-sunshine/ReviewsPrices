review/summary: LOVES IT.....one of the &#34;best money i've spent&#34; itemsreview/text: My son has been in his since 4 months. He was so short when we put him in at first, had to put books under it for him to stand. he would bouce for a long time, happily. It was a great break and gave him mobility safely before he could crawl and walk. He's almost walking now, at 10 months, he's less inclined to get in as he wants to be able to move around, but he now loves to play with it from the outside, walk around it, and even hang out under it like it's a fort. He will still ask to get in at times, and when he does, bounces happily. It's definately a great buy for the baby from 4 to 9 to 10 months, helps strengthen the legs and gives mom a great break!
