review/summary: Watch out with the wheels!review/text: This is a great toy as previous people have said. The front detaches from the walker and your baby can use this while just seated at the table or just playing with it. The downfall of this product is that it advertises itself as a walker but there is no WAY that a baby that's learning to walk can use this without flying. The wheels aren't sturdy and my baby went flying and fell on his face. They should just fix that aspect of the product because other than that, it's a great toy.
