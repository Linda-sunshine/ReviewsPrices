review/summary: Leaked!!! Save money and aggrevation and try the Target brandreview/text: My husband got a 36 pack of Huggies Snug & Dry for about $9 at WalMart during our trip.They leaked two nights in a row. I had to put the baby through diaper changes and it took him 30 minutes to settle back to sleep, and I could not fall back asleep on one of the nights. It was very disturbing for a whole family during our precious vacation days, all because of the leaking diapers!These are neither snug, nor dry. I discovered the Target brand diapers at one of the forums, and after trying them out, I switched completely away from brand name diapers. Target brand are softer (even compare to premium Huggies - the Snugglers -which we used for several months in the beginning), and don't leak. And they are less expensive!
