review/summary: horriblereview/text: I ve always been a pampers user.. used cruisers size 5 for my son 2 yrs old and 32 lbs and they were great at daytime and used huggies overnight at bedtime...my husband got a giant box of these by mistake from a store , they were cheaper so I decided to give them a try.. BAD DECISION.. not soft at all and they leak after one hour of wearing them, terrible.. and they are smaller than cruisers so they don't fit well.. DO NOT BUY
