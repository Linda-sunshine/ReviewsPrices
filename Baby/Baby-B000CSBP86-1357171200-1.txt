review/summary: Love these carriersreview/text: These carries are comfortable to the wearer and the little one they are holding (my 6 month old told me plain as could be that he loved sitting in it--obviously not, but he sure seemed happy when strapped in it on several occassions). Works well to free up your adult hands for doing whatever you need to. It is well built, and will not leave you with any concern about your child not being safely held and supported.
