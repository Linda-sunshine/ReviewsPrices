review/summary: Only toy my 3 month old can play withreview/text: My 3 month old son is just learning to grab at things and this toy is impossible for him to miss. It's so easy for him to get his hands in or fingers around and then bring it to his face. The tubes are soft/rubbery, so there are no bumps and bruises and he loves chewing on it. There is a light rattle that is stimulating for him, but not loud enough to make me want to "accidentally" lose the toy. Because it is not cloth, I can wash it off easily and it does not pick up everything on the carpet the first time my son plays with it. I have not had any issues with colors running... not sure how that could possibly happen with toy. This is a fantastic toy and can be used from a very young age.I also use it as a gift topper... just add some curly ribbon and you have a show-stopper!
