review/summary: Best disposable diaper I've tried on my baby!review/text: I've been using huggies snug and dry since I ran out of random baby shower diapers ! I love them for my now 17 month old son. Never a leak or a diaper rash and I save my huggies points for rewards at huggies website. I've tried less expensive diapers but nothing compares to the fit and holding power of the snug and dry!
