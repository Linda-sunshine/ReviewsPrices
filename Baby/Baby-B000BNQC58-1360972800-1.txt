review/summary: My girls love their turtle!review/text: We got this when our twin girls were babies...at the time it seemed useless. We started using it every night when they were about 2 1/2. They absolutely loved it and asked for it every night. While the amber is impossible for us to see unless it's very dark, the green and blue are beautiful. The girls are six now, and we have had the turtle on every night since we started using it - and they still ask for it every night! I like the auto-off feature, and the buttons are easy enough that if one of the kids wakes up in the middle of the night, she can turn the turtle back on by herself if she wants it.
