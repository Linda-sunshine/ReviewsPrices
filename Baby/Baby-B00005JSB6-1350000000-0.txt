review/summary: Too stiffreview/text: I bought this for my son in size 3 after using the little snugglers which i loved. It does the job great especially with overnight, he has had no blowouts ( and he goes maybe once a week so its a huge mess when he goes), there have been one or two leaks, but that may have been my fault, I gave three stars because of the quality of the diaper, it feels really stiff to the touch, i want something soft on his soft skin, so nexttime i will go back to the huggies pure and natural as the snugglers end in size 2 .
