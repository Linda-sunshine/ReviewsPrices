review/summary: Love Ladybugreview/text: My daughter loves the twilight constellation night light ladybug. We love to look at the stars and the moon while we are going to sleep.The only thing that is bad with this item is when the light bulb goes out you can not replace it you need to buy another one. This is the 3rd one in the last 1.5 years. Our daughter loves it so we will keep buying:)
