review/summary: Easy to graspreview/text: My son loves this. It is easy for him to grasp and gum. He is 5 months old and loves to reach for this toy and put one of the loops in his mouth. It is small enough that he can gum the loops in the back of his mouth as well. Lots of toys don't fit well in his hands and mouth, they are either to bulky or awkward. But, not this toy. It is so easy for him to grasp and then keep hold of it. I said it is one of his favorite toys.
