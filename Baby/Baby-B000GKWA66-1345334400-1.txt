review/summary: Not sure if the baby likes it but I do!review/text: I can't really tell yet if this helps my son sleep. However, since he sleeps in our room I am now addicted to the rain sound and need it playing to fall asleep myself! Minus two stars though for not having continuous mode or fade out! This has woken me up before and i have to reset it. I have tried other sound apps on my phone but the rain sound is never as good so I'm stuck with the sheep for now..
