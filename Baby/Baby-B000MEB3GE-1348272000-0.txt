review/summary: could live without itreview/text: I absolutely LOVE this. I used it all the time when my daughter was a newborn to time out her feedings, how often i was changing her, when I should pump and I used it when taking medication too. didn't use it too much for napping but I STILL use it everyday for her feeding schedule. I accidentally broke off the clip on the back but I didn't use it much anyway. It has been 4 months and I have only changed the batteries 1 time. HIGHLY recommend this for any mom with a baby, especially new moms like me.
