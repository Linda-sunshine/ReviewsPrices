review/summary: Perfectreview/text: We inherited a sleep sack from a friend and loved it so much we wanted to buy another one, so we chose this. My daughter is really long (three months old), but the size small has lots of room both horizontally and vertically to grow. It was a little weird have it zip down at first, rather than the traditional up, but I like it now. It keeps me from worrying about the zipper handle-thing flipping up and poking her in the chin and being uncomfortable. And the fabric is so soft! It makes me wish I had something so snuggly.
