review/summary: Great for broken sternum and pregnancyreview/text: I had the misfortune of breaking my sternum at ~ 7 months pregnancy. After the break I found that moving the one pillow I was using to support my leg when I layed on my side was too hard for me so I tried sleeping with 3 pillows but that too was too hard since the pillows moved and yanking them into place was hard. So I bought this pillow and found how miraculous it is to have a pillow that is in place and only *I* have to move in its center. I find it comfortable for supporting my legs and my top arm (that top arm being supported is critical for comfort with a broken sternum) when sleeping on my sides. I also sometimes use it for modified back sleeping with the bottom loop under my knees and one side propped under one side of my back. The one draw-back is that the head rest part is not always the right height but I don't know how they would/could fix that. I think this pillow could be useful for non-pregnant patients with broken sternums as it helps make the 3 available sleeping positions (back and two sides) more comfortable. Also note that this pillow comes with a white pillow case so you don't necessarily need another one. I put a king-size cotton pillow case on it where my head rests and wash that part more frequently than the regular one. (Plus the regular one seems to be polyster so it doesn't breathe as well as my cotton one.)
