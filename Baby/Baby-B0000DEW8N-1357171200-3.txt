review/summary: Danger of baby getting hurtreview/text: The top tray fastens to the product on the inside towards the baby. If you try to remove tray when baby is in seat it will hit baby in the face when it snaps off! I tried to remove the tray to clean the surface and was extra careful not to let the tray hit my baby's face but it did anyway.Also the bottom tray that fastens on the sides does not come off easily. If you encounter a choking situation it is not easy to remove baby from seat quickly. I will be returning product.
