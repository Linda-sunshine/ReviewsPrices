review/summary: best diaper for after 1 yrreview/text: I was always using Pampers dry for my little one, untill it started leaking for her. I switched to huggies snug dry and no more leaks. Though I always found pampers to be more softer on the skin then huggies , but its less leak proof then huggies. With huggies snug dry I never had a single leak incident.
