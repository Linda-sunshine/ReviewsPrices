review/summary: Sizing is right on.review/text: I haven't used this sling product for very long, but so far it's helped with some of aches and pains of 3rd trimester.One note on the sizing: some have said that they needed a size larger than what the package would indicate. I did NOT find this to be true. I'm 5'4&#34; and about 145 lbs (29 weeks pregnant) and I feel most supported with the small size set at it's smallest. I tried the medium cradle first because of the reviews, and it did not provide enough support. I am in good shape and do a lot of walking and jogging, so that could have something to do with sizing.
