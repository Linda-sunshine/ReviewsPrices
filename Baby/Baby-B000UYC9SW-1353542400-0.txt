review/summary: Like best for "wearing" baby on hip, but not a must-havereview/text: When registering, I imagined myself using this carrier more for infant carrying and saving the Ergo for when baby was older. My actual experience has been the opposite.I originally had this carrier in size small, but felt it was too big for front-wearing my baby so I exchanged the carrier for extra small. Then it was too tight and thus difficult to get him in and out of the carrier without quite a struggle (I typically wear a size XS on top for reference; 33" chest and 26" waist post preggo). When he falls asleep in the carrier (as he likes to do), I certainly can't get him out of the carrier without waking him, unlike with the Ergo.So up until recently, I used the Ergo carrier almost exclusively for front-wearing my baby, as it felt more secure and properly sized. Now that I'm trotting around the house with my little guy on my hip, I started using the K'tan carrier again in the hip position and am happy I kept it. I especially like that it's one continuous piece of fabric and there's no wrapping or tying involved. It does the job, but I don't think this carrier is a "must have" - I'd save that honor for the Ergo, which I'm still using as well both in and out of the house.
