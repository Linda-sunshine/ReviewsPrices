review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I was excited to use the bjorn but found the design to be flawed.1. The baby seems to be hanging in the seat. This does not seem to be a proper design for the baby's comfort.2. The neck piece got infants has plastic on either side do babies face is digging into plastic when they sleep3. TERRIBLY uncomfortable for mom (5'4") small frame. I hated it. Would suffer after an hour or less of use.One pro is the forward facing option for older babies but I couldn't stand having my 10lb baby in it.I wouldn't recommend :(
