review/summary: Great Pottyreview/text: I got this potty after reading reviews on all the potty's on Amazon. What a great potty. My 18 month old son loves it. He is just starting out with his potty training. He pooped and peed on the second day of training and just loves the idea on sitting bottomless on this potty. He has had zero issues with it and I have no complaints. Great potty!
