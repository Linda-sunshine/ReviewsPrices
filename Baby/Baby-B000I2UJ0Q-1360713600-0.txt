review/summary: Great entertainmentreview/text: Awesome entertainment to distract your baby. It has kept my baby boy jumping for at least 2in per session, which is good. But he can do it maybe three times a day. The only downside is the hanging birds from the plastic branches. Not sturdy enough and my baby has pulled them hard enough to bend them and opted for removing them completely before they got broken.
