review/summary: Love It!review/text: I love everything about this...The fact that before they are standing up you can pull that front off and put on the floor for them to play and then put it back on for when they are starting to stand/walk....Big downfall if they aren't ready to walk yet and are a little tipsy don't let them use it does wobble with your kids.
