review/summary: Great quality and pricereview/text: I purchased the Graco Pack N Play to keep at my house for my two infant grandchildren. My daughter had the same one so I knew it was very well made. My husband and I had a little trouble setting it up, which I remember we had when I helped my daughter set it up. The poles that are inserted in the sides to give it shape were a little confusing. But once we got them in it was fine. I keep it assembled and ready, but I know my daughter and her husband have traveled with it and set it up in their hotel room. They find it pretty quick and easy to set up and take down to pack into their car. They also keep it set up on the first floor of their home and use it to change the baby's diaper. My daughter registered for hers at Babies R Us and it was more expensive there than on-line through Amazon.
