review/summary: Would buy it againreview/text: Loved it so much we bought another - one for both floors of our home. My son played with all the noise making potties and chose this one on his free will. I like the rubber grip for the bottom and that it doesn't have all the frills because in all seriousness its a training potty who needs frills or noises
