review/summary: It fitsreview/text: It works, that's all I have to say. the extra loops near the leg area that is supposed to help the close to newborn stay more secured didn't exactly have a use for it. I don't think babies near newborn of age should not be in this even though the box says that it is possible if this wanted to be used on them.My son like this carrier I feel like the tongue size on the bottom that you adjust by should not be what you use to judge so you can re size it should be by the baby. I sized mine correctly and it didn't fit my son.
