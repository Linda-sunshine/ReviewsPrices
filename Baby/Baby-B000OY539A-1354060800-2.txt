review/summary: Useful and comfortablereview/text: I bought this wrap because I had problems with wrists, so I can get some weight off my hands. It served well.The wrap is comfortable to wear and has many options how to wrap it (you can even use your own ideas). My baby really calms down in it and falls asleep deeply.The only disadvantage is that the fabric is a bit heavy, so you need to dress lighter not to overheat yourself or the baby. It's also a little too long and difficult to put on, so you either pull the end on the floor or end up being wrapped so tightly that it's impossible to put the baby down without wakening him up again.
