review/summary: Oops I got the wrong sizereview/text: While my weight was within the guidelines, I should have gotten a size smaller. Or maybe I would have preferred the type that has a strap both above and below the belly. It just seemed like this was a bit too big. And I didn't like that it could move if I sat down with it on. For taking a walk though, it worked OK.
