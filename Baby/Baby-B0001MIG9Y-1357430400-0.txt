review/summary: Small compared to cruisersreview/text: I am cruisers loyalist...but decided to give baby dry a chance. My baby is comfortable in size 3 cruisers and some margin to grow. I ordered the same size in baby dry (considering both products are from the same company) only to find they are smaller compared to the cruisers causing my little one lot of discomfort. Am stuck with a huge pk now.
