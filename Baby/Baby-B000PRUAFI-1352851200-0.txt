review/summary: Great great gatereview/text: We have a 75 lb. dog that kept taking down baby gates to get into the kitchen and counter surf. When I ordered this gate, I thought I would probably have the same problem because manufacturers usually exaggerate the capabilities of their products. In my opinion this gate is way better than advertised. With a baby gate if your doorway isn't exactly vertical the weakest point is at the top of the gate when tightening thus one point is always weaker that the others. Enter the dog that has figured that out and down it comes. This gate can be adjusted at all four touch points and even comes with a wrench that allows for the tightest possible fit. It also has cup devices that you can attach to your door frame that the fasteners fit into so it absolutely won't move. I am going to buy another one for downstairs. One last thing; It comes with two extensions so if you have a larger area than just a common doorway they offer more flexibility. This is a great product.
