review/summary: Fantastic nightlight ... but ...review/text: ... it could be improved with a feature to allow the light to remain on continuously and/or have the button you use to turn the night light on be backlit to make it easier to find in the dark. I would be happy to replace (or recharge) batteries, and it would be nice to have the option to keep the light on instead of being beholden to the 45-minute preset timer. While I can find the button easily in the dark it can be a challenge for my 3-year-old, thus it would be nice if the button were backlit. These are simply improvements I would like to see, and, overall, the light is great and I would definitely recommend it.This is such a cute night light, love the projected stars (it's fun seeking out the constellations), and the amount of light it gives off is perfect.
