review/summary: Easy & Attractive - Just Like You Like Itreview/text: Easy to install, with or without the extension(s). I love that it swings both ways, but I am left-leaning. I also like that it can stay open if needed - sometimes when I go in the gated room I am just going to grab something quick and won't have a free hand to operate the gate but can bring it shut with my foot or elbow on my way out.It is a bit more expensive than other gates but I think it is more attractive and versatile than the cheaper alternatives. I would buy this again and recommend it to my friends.
