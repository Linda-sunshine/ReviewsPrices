review/summary: Love it!review/text: We bought this when I got too pregnant to step over our cheap regular baby gate. I love it. I installed it in about 15-20 minutes and its been great. It's been a few months now and I need to adjust the screws on the top because it seems to have pulled apart a little bit. As some have said, this will look bent when you pull it out of the box but as you adjust the mounting screws it will begin to come together correctly. I like this gate a lot and hope it lasts as long as we need it!
