review/summary: happy niecereview/text: I bought this Pack N Play for my niece, who just made me a grand-aunt in December. It is the ONLY camoflauge playpen I could find and the price was great so I bought it. It is adorable! The camoflauge is military-style camo, rather than the outdoorsy type. If you have to have the outdoorsy (think RealTree) camo, then this isn't for you. BUt if you're creative like we are, you can make it work. She is thrilled with it and will get a lot of mileage out of it, once the little critter is mobile.
