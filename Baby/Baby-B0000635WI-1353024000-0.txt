review/summary: It works! (with a warning)review/text: Pros:- Provides good support- Feels comfortable- Does not restrict blood flowCons:- You have to adjust to find the most comfortable position, sometimes it just doesn't feel right- The cover that came with it is so coarse. We have to wrap the whole thing with a blanket (or you can cough up and buy the additional cover)- Not necessarily a con, but this thing is big. Make sure your bed is big enough (for you and your other half)Warning: If you are allergic to polyester, you will feel it! I air fluffed the whole pillow in the dryer, then wrapped it with a blanket and some pillow covers. It worked fine for two weeks then the allergic stuff came out again. Well, air fluff again and re-wrap with washed blanket, etc. Working again.All in all, this is a must have for pregnant women. I subtracted one star mainly for the polyester allergen.
