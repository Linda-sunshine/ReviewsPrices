review/summary: Good Pack N Play, Good Bedreview/text: We really like this Pack N' Play, and use this as our baby's primary bed, rather than purchasing a separate crib. We did add a separate mattress from IKEA. Easy to pack up and set up, my only complaint is that the included base does dip a lot after extended use. It's not a problem with a very firm mattress, but now that we use a slightly softer one, I flip the base every time I change the sheets to keep the middle from sagging.
