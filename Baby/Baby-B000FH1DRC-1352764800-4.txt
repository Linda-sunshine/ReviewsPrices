review/summary: The best on the marketreview/text: As new parents we didn't know what diapers to use. We received many diaper brands including Pampers with our baby shower. However, the Swaddlers were the best out of all of them. When we were trying to use the other brands, our daughter's skin got irritated causing the top layer to peel off. That ended up in a trip to the doctor. We then switched back to the Swaddlers and haven't had an issue. The yellow strip has been useful to us as well. Initially our daughter would cry everytime she had a wet diaper, however, when she was smaller, we would not have been able to tell that she had a wet diaper had it not been for the "code blue" strip. Yes we went through a ton of diapers, but it saved us lots of headaches because she would always stop crying after her diaper had been changed. Now she is older, and you can tell without the "code blue strip", but in the beginning it was a life saver. I recommend Pampers Swaddlers from my experience, and these will be the only diapers I ever give at baby showers.
