review/summary: Wonderful play yardreview/text: I purchased this play yard for my home day care. It is very sturdy and works wonderfully to keep a crawling 9 month old safe. I also purchased the gray one with the extensions for use outside!I also open it up to block off a portion of my living room so he has more room for crawling - as long as you keep the panels at the recommended angles it stays upright even when he stands at it.Definitely worth purchasing!
