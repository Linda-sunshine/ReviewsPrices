review/summary: LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!review/text: This booster chair fits perfectly in our bar stool seat. It's not bulky at all. I had several issues with past ones I had purchased which were to big. I eventually returned them. This booster secures around the back of the chair/barstool and up under neath. I feel very safe putting my son in this. The only negatives to this is it comes with a tray you can place over the base tray for easy clean up. This is a great idea however, my son just turned 13 months and has figured out how to pull it off. I don't recommend using it if you have a toddler. :) Food will go flying everywhere. The base tray does come off so it is still an easy clean up. I love how it is dishwasher safe. This is great for conserving space instead of buying a high chair.
