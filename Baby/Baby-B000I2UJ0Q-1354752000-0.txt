review/summary: Best Toy So Far!review/text: So, I've never written a review before and just had to say that this Jumperoo is absolutely incredible! Our four month old, right when she was put in, figured out that she could jump and off she went. She makes it perform a rocking motion and this morning, I kid you not, she rocked herself to sleep in it! All of a sudden, the jumperoo fell silent and I looked over at our little sleeping angel. Needless to say, it must feel very comfortable to her and I like how you can turn off the music for less stimulation.
