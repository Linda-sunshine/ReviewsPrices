review/summary: Couldn't be better! Plus Size Reviewreview/text: I'm a size 24 and I was afraid that this would not fit me and I wouldn't be able to use it but I was pleasantly surprised! My only complaint is that it didnt come with instructions but a quick trip to you tube solved that problem as well. Just search for Moby Wrap instructions and you'll get a whole host of videos that will show you how to put it on and put baby in. I absolutely love the comfort and closeness of being able to carry our foster son close to me. Also it's SO nice to be hands free! Love love love this product and definitely recommend it.
