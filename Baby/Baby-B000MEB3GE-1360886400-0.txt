review/summary: Could be betterreview/text: It's four separate timers that count up and can have an alarm go off at a set mark.. i.e. You can set an alarm to go off every 3 hours and have it count up to it and have four timers dong this. In reality, you need one timer for feeding reminders. The diaper change timer...why?. It would be great if the diaper part could add how many diapers of wet and BM through the day which is what the Dr asks for! Maybe n the future i'll time naps but for a newborn, I only need to keep track of feedings and how many diapers of wet and BM right now.I bought this for the timer function (to schedule feedings) so I can ditch my smart phone timer.
