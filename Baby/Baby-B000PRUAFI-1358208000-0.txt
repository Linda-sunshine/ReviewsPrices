review/summary: Read this review first!review/text: I always try to do my homework when buying online and listen to others reviews/opinions but never take the time to give my own. It's hard for me to ever make a decision on buying anything because the reviews I read can be such polar opposites, and if your buying these gates for kids like I did you want to make sure your getting a good product. We have four of these gates around our house to corral our twin 15 month old girls and they are great!! If you've read some of the other reviews some people complain that the install is difficult, the tension feature to hold them in place isn't strong enough, you cant open them with one hand, the opening isn't big enough and so on. I'm a stay at home dad who hates stuff that doesn't work and I will vouch for these gates. If your not capable of opening these gates with one hand while carrying a kid or grocery bag in the other, you probably shouldn't have had kids in the first place. This gate is super easy, at a great price, and I have not an ounce of worry even when I see both my daughters hanging from it while I get their afternoon snack ready! If you're a typical parent, living in a typical house, with typical (wonderful) children... this is a great gate... period. And I think it shipped for free.. what could be better?
