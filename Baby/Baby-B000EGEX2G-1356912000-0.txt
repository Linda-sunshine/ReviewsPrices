review/summary: Excellent Buyreview/text: I'm very, very pleased with this product. It was extremely easy to assemble and included the tools necessary to put it together. I assembled it on my own in appx 15 minutes. The ottoman came fully assembled. The chair is surprisingly comfortable - my wife sometimes complains that she falls asleep faster than our son does when she's trying to put him to sleep in this glider. I would definitely recommend it to others.
