review/summary: Love this turtle!review/text: My 21 month old son LOVES this turtle and so do I! The body is soft and the buttons are easy for him to use. It has a 45 minute timer so it will automatically turn off after 45 minutes which is nice.It will glow in 3 different choices of colors: blue, green or a soft amber. The blue and green are bright so its fun to look at, but for sleep, I put it on the amber.It covers the whole ceiling and comes down a little on the top of the walls.It is worth the money. As he gets older, we can use the little book it came with to look at the real constellations.I looked into the Dream Lite version and they are much smaller and feel cheaper and they don't do REAL constellations.
