review/summary: Awesome toyreview/text: I bought this for my 11 month old son because he was pushing everything in the house and I knew he was ready. Well I couldn't have picked a more perfect fit! I barely put it together and on the ground before it was zipping across the floor! He wouldn't let it go. This morning he normally eats right when he wakes up but not this morning. This morning he practically jumped out of my arms, crawled to the walker and was off to the races! I would have paid 5 even 10 times the price knowing how much he loves it! I just wish I'd bought it sooner.
