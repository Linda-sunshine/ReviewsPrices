review/summary: Great purchase!review/text: After buying and returning the Evenflo version of this product, I feel the need to write this review. Love it! Easy to install, open and close, but keeps toddler out. It really stays open if you open it all the way, and it swings close if you don't. Looks nice compared to other gates, also.
