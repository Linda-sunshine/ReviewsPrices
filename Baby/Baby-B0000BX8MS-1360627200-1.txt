review/summary: Wonderful blanketreview/text: Wonderful blanket that keeps baby warm and safe all night. I worried baby would have a had time moving and get tangled, but we haven't had a problem yet. Baby has been using the HALO sacks since birth and we couldn't be happier. There are different materials to accommodate different temperatures and the zipper really does make a difference when changing a sleeping baby's diaper. Constantly recommending these to my friends.
