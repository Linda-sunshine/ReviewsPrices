review/summary: Great toy great pricereview/text: I bought this for my 10 month old and she loves it!! I did have to exchange it since the first one kept getting stuck on the same note of a tune and amazon exchanged quickly. The second one was perfect and has since become a favorite. My baby plays for a long time with this toy and it gives her the confidence to walk holding onto this. She especially loves the peekaboo with the duckies.
