review/summary: Not very educational, just loudreview/text: I'm not a fan of toys that have a "loud" and "louder" switch (Seriously? On and off is sufficient.) and this toy is no exception. My 10 month old daughter likes to push it around and shake the phone and that is about it. Why did no one think to attach the phone to the unit? She just carries it around and it keeps getting lost. There are 2 modes you can put it in, one has a book and one has a music note. Neither one really teaches anything. I still have not quite figured out what buttons trigger what noise or song, so I doubt she is getting much from it other than noise and flashing lights. Another annoying thing is that if she doesn't play with it, it continues to make noise as if beckoning her to come back. Just shut off and be done!
