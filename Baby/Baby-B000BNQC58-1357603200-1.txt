review/summary: 18 mos son loves it!review/text: I bought this for my almost 18 month old son, to help with sleep training. I didn't realize it turned off after 45 minutes. Since he is in a crib, I can't put it anywhere near him (don't want to put it in the crib) for him to turn back on. However, for him, it doesn't seem to be an issue. I can also turn it on if I have to go in his room to check on him and it doesn't wake him up. The fact that the starts don't move is great--it's not distracting--it's rather soothing.When it's not bed time, he loves to play with the turtle. He has gotten attached to it, even though the shell is hard and not soft! This was a great addition to our bedtime routine.
