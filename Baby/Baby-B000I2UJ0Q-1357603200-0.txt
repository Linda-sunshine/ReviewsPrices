review/summary: 3 mo. old son loves it!review/text: Santa brought this for our 3 mo. old son and he absolutely loves it! He is a little too short, so we place a very small pillow under his feet, but he will grow into it soon. It was really easy to assemble and is light weight, so easy to move. My son loves to look at the lights and listen to the music. The seat also provides him support. As he grows, I am sure it will be even more fun.
