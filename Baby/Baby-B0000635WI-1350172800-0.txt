review/summary: Good body pillowreview/text: During my second pregnancy I was having a lot of trouble sleeping. I bought this hoping for support for my head & neck. Since I got this pillow I have been sleeping a lot better. I like the support that it provides for my head/neck/growing belly.I read some reviews that mentioned the pillow case was scratchy. I have not found this to be the case, although it is not as comfortable as my normal pillow cases. In addition, I have not found the pillow case as hard to take on/off as others have said. You just have to gather the pillow case & do it a little at a time.CONS: This pillow is big and bulky. My husband & I have a queen sized bed and this pillow takes up a lot of room. Turning over with this pillow is a bit of a chore as well.Other than that this has been well worth the money.
