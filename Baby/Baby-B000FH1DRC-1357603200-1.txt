review/summary: Pamper is the best diaperreview/text: Especially when it comes to size 2 and plus there's never a problem of leakage if you do it right. I used huggies at the beginning it was much worse. I hate to change bed sheet over night after all so love super large sized diapers like this.I wouldn't change to any other brand so far. We've continued using size 3 for over half a year now it still fits very well.Great product.
