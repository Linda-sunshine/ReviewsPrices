review/summary: 13 months and going strong!review/text: I bought the Cloud B ladybug nightlight just before my daughter was born. I have used this product literally EVERY DAY since we brought her home from the hospital. When she was a newborn and sleeping in a bassinet next to the bed, I turned it on for late night feedings. I use the blue light, which is the brightest of the 3 choices (red, green, blue). The blue light is bright enough to see what you are looking for but not bright enough to disturb someone sleeping in the same room. You can turn on the nightlight setting (which turns off after 45 minutes) buy pushing the moon-shaped button. When it's 3AM (or some other ungodly hour) it's easy to feel for the moon-shaped button in the dark. Now, my daughter is 13 months old and I still use it as a nightlight, turning it on as I leave her room for the night. I also use it as an indispensable distraction tool when I'm changing her diaper! She enjoys pushing the buttons herself and changing the color of the lights. It has been dropped several times from the dresser/changing table to the carpeted floor and the buttons are somewhat less responsive now. If I push up on the battery cover, it starts working just fine again. I would recommend this product again and again!
