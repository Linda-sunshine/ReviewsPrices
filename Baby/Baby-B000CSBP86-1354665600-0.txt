review/summary: Not for newbonrsreview/text: I wore this contraption for my newborn. Not a good idea. The baby fell out once this AM while I was leaning forward. Baby hit the ground sleeping and thank God nothing happened to the baby (she remained asleep). This is NOT for newborns who are still tiny (mine is 7lbs 3 oz at discharge from the hospital). I strongly suggest you don't use this product while running around the house even for a sec. Good for sitting in a sofa doing computer work, as I have done so. But the moment you start walking, a tiny baby will fall through the cracks and hit the floor. It happened almost the second time again today. Thank God I was able to catch her with my left elbow.I also have to complain that this is not for anyone weighing 200 lbs to strap this on. It is very tight and no room to adjust, were you to try to use this on a young infant with a size 44 chest adult male physique. Not going to work well. Better find another product safer and more comfortable for you and the baby. It is best for a woman and bigger baby.And yes, i know, this is for 8lbs+ baby per instruction. But it is almost close enough for people to get fooled like me. Better put it away for small babies. Must read the instructions!!
