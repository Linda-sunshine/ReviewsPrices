review/summary: Luvs is better!review/text: My daughter bought these diapers for her son, my grandson, thinking that they would be better than other diapers because of the Pampers name brand. We BOTH regret this purchase! These diapers definitely do not last all night. I give them no more than 3 hours! Needless to say, we will be sticking to Luvs diapers. Not only are they more affordable, but they are RELIABLE!
