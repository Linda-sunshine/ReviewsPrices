review/summary: Best diapers, best pricereview/text: I have tried almost every brand of diaper, just to see which was best. I think that Pampers were definitely the best for my daughter, and the price on Amazon (when you're a member of Amazon Mom and do Subscribe and Save) is the BEST. These diapers are very absorbent, and expand without leaking for night-time. We did have to buy a pack of these that are one size bigger than what she normally wears for her to wear at night, but I think this is because she sucks down an 8 oz bottle right before bed.They are definitely the most expensive brand of diaper, but I will gladly pay the price for the fact that my daughter has had zero diaper rash, and practically zero leak situations (even when she punishes the diaper...you know what I mean).Also, even though she's not a newborn I still love the blue line on them that tells you if the diaper is wet!
