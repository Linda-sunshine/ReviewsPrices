review/summary: Lots of Diapers!!!review/text: Good price, delivery time not bad (need to order ahead of time, before you run out), and I didn't have to drive to the store where I would have spent more money on things I probably don't need. Very convenient and have always been a huggies only user for all 5 kids... almost 18 years now. Thanks Huggies!
