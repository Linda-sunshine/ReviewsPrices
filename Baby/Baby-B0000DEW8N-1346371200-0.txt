review/summary: MUST HAVE!review/text: Yes! I might look a bit weird with two of these at a restaurant for my almost 3 and 1.5 year old, BUT I know that they will sit and eat safely... without asking me to take them down. I have them at our breakfast table (where we actually eat all our meals) and the kids are just so used to them. They know the chairs are for eating! And so when we go out to eat the chairs come with us! I absolutely adore them. They are practical, easy to clean, and SAFE.
