review/summary: Smart potty betterreview/text: I like it but like the Smart potty by BabyBjorn better. Its smaller and more easily stored away. Other than that this one is easy to use as well, inside comes out and outside easy to clean as well. it's just so big and my son seems to prefer the smart potty as well.
