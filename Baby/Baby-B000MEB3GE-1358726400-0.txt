review/summary: my favorite baby itemreview/text: At first, I didn't really get why a timer would be helpful, I mean us Mommas can do it all and keep track of it right??? It's prefect for nursing, times between feeds, how long the baby's been sleeping, and with a cardiac baby- it was so helpful with medication times. The light at top is just the right amount of light to check on a sleeping baby, to light the way so you don't trip down the stairs, diaper changes, etc. I love that you can turn the sound off and if you just want a timer with no alarm you can do that too.This is my go to baby gift. Couldn't recommend this enough.
