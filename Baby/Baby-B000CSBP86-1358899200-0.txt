review/summary: Nice to havereview/text: My little one is 6 weeks old and I have been struggling with simple house chores as she wants to be held all the time. I finally researched and purchased this carrier. It is so easy to put on and it feels very secure and sits well. I am very tiny myself and I was concerned about how it would sit. The cons are that it generates a lot of heat between the baby, the carrier and myself, so I would not recommend using it for long periods. The other thing is that since the baby sits in front, it is not easy to do things like eat unless you turn sideways. All in all, however, it is a great carrier that my husband and I can use for a while.
