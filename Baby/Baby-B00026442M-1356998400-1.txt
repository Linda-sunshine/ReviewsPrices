review/summary: They are good but I should use better diapersreview/text: I have been using these diapers for almost two years and had been happy with them until recently. For the last two boxes I ordered, one is defective-I can't unfold them without tearing them apart. The other smells horribly-too much chemical fragrance. Now I am doing research for other diapers and I realize that I should use better diapers becuase my daughter has sensative skin and recently she often scratches her belly and complains of being not comfortable, her felly feels dry and bumpy. She also scraches her bottock heavily and sometimes leaves scratching marks. It definitely irritates her skin.On the other hand, I have preferred pampers over huggies because pampers are thinner, softer, feel like more breathable.
