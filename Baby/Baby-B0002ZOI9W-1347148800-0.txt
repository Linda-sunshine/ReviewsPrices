review/summary: So much better than I expectedreview/text: I got this as a gift before my son was born. I honestly thought it was the ugliest, most unnecessary thing ever. It was my first child, though. As I found out quickly, this chair is a lifesaver. I used it to feed my son on occasion, gave him a place to sit while I did a few chores, taught him to reach for his toys, etc. He's 18 months, and just decided a few weeks ago that he doesn't like it anymore.Pros:It can sit or lay backToys are close enough for babies to reachHas a vibrating option, which is good for a babyCover is removable for washing, and easy to wipe down with wipesThe toy bar comes off to help put the baby in and out.Cons:It's not the most attractive thing I've seenAdjusting the straps is difficultThe child can't rock themselves until they're older, at which point they're probably bored of itIt's almost impossible to get the child in with the toy bar on
