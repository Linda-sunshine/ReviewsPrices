review/summary: third trimester life saver but do get soonerreview/text: this pillow rocks, it does take up some space, but if you get more sleep who cares i do recommend using an old pillow case and cut hole in it so you dont have to remove cover to wash its a pain to get back on and i ripped mine, but still its like a dream and was hard to give up lol
