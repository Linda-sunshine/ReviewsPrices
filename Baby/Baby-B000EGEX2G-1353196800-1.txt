review/summary: Decent glider for the moneyreview/text: Like many others I didn't want to spend over $200 on a glider. This one was easy to assemble, not too many parts to put together. The cushion though is super cheapy. Just regular square foam seat, but back portion is fine. Stains a tad easy - especially the beige color. It does squeak just a little but not super annoying. Glides easily. If you want something functional and inexpensive - this glider will do.
