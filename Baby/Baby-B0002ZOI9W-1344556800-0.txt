review/summary: Yes, your child can end up with their face to the groundreview/text: When in the rocking position our 6 month-old daughter was able to lean herself far enough forward that the rocker wouldn't tip, but because the fabric wasn't attached to anything but the side rails she would be suspended by the straps with her face almost touching the ground. Very dangerous! I still gave it two stars because it worked great in the reclined position. But because that is all its good for I would just buy a bouncer instead.
