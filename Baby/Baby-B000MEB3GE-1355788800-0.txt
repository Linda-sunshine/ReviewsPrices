review/summary: Great, if you don't have a smart phonereview/text: I loved this when I first bought it ( one for each of my twins in different colors), and it is great for those few weeks when you're SO sleep deprived. BUT, I found an app on Android market that does all the same things PLUS it lets you track and chart feedings, weights, diapers, etc over time so you can see any sudden changes (really important for me with my low birth weight girls). And the app was free... So I could have saved some money, but I did end up using these still when my mother in law would baby sit, so I'd know what I missed without leaving my phone behind.
