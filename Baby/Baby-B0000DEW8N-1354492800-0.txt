review/summary: Perfect for an extra high chair seatreview/text: My 14 month grandson came for a visit and this was perfect. I read other reviews and knew this would work. I loved the look of the blue/green booster seat. I wish I didn't have to pay more for this color! We put the booster seat on a chair with a towel underneath. The towel protected the chair from food but my grandson didn't spill. My grandson was secure for all meals. The cup holder held his sippy cup. We put the trays in the dishwasher. I can't find any thing bad to say about the booster seat.
