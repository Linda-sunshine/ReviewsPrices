review/summary: Sizing is TOTALLY OFF!review/text: I ordered the petite size 90-135 Pounds. I weigh 120 pounds and am at 28 weeks. I figured by the time I reach the end of my pregnancy I would be at or under 135 pounds (my end weight goal is 130-135 pounds according to my Dr.). I just received the prenatal cradle, and I can only hook it to the last notch. Even at the last notch, its super tight! So looks like the sizing is totally off!!!I'll obviously have to return it as there is no way I am going to be able to wear this for the next three months!!! Very unhappy, as I was really looking forward to wearing this belt and having some relief from the constant back pain.
