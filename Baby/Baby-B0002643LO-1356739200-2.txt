review/summary: Working for my sonreview/text: Not sure what else to write about this other than it works for my son. No leaks whatsoever. Holds pee in pounds - I am exaggerating but I've been lazy getting up in the middle of the night and left him with his diaper (I obviously don't do this often). Come morning the darn thing is so full and no leak! So, hey, got to give them credit for it. Also, the waist band is really soft so in case someone puts the waist too tight it wouldn't put red marks. We did switch from Huggies when he was about 4 months. We noticed a thick layer of material around the back area of the waist. Not sure what that was for but it put a mark on his waist back side. It is a thin layer but you could feel it with your hand.
