review/summary: Baby loves it, but the panel comes off too easily and wheels don't lockreview/text: She loves. Has had a great time pushing buttons and pushing it around. She's fully walking on her own now, but still likes pushing it around every once and a while.Two cons: the panel on the front is detachable...which is nice, but it comes off too easily. Sometimes she's able to pull it off on her own. The phone receiver comes off too easily. She tried to pull up by grabbing the phone and fell back down. It startled her. I took the phone off and never put it back on. Niether of these is a big deal, but wish they were a little more stable.Lastly, would have been nice if they gave me the ability to lock the wheels. When baby is sitting to play with it, it rolls away since the wheels don't lock. To remedy this, you have to have baby play with it up against something like the wall to keep it from rolling away from her.
