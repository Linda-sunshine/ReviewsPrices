review/summary: Good but not a favoritereview/text: My son got this for a gift when he was born. He began to hold it around 2-3 months. We always had it around for him to play with, but it was never his favorite. It is easy to hold and soft to chew on, and other parents who saw it went out and bought one immediately, so I definitely recommend it, but it just wasn't one of my son's favorites.
