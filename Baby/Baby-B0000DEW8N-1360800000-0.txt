review/summary: Great for eating out in restaurantsreview/text: Great because you don't have to worry if the highchairs are clean (or worry about cleaning it or bringing a cover for it), baby has her own &#34;table top&#34; with a cover to keep clean while it's in the trunk of the car, and to cover up after eating when it's covered with food! Don't have room for a highchair in our house, we use one on a dining room table chair. Also have another in our trunk! WOULD BUY AGAIN AND AGAIN. Highly recommend.
