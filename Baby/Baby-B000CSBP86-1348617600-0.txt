review/summary: Easier, quicker, and safer to put onreview/text: I have 5 months old baby, and I have two carriers,BabyBjorn and Ergo. So far I like BabyBjorn better than Ergo. BabyBjorn is easier, quicker, and safer to put my baby on.Ergo was still too big for my baby, so I had to buy Ergo's infant insert, but I don't feel confortable. I just feel it doesn't fit right. I have to reposition my baby frequently. Also Ergo with infant insert gets very hot especially in hot weather.When my friend let me use her BabyBjorn, I immediately decided to buy because it is easier and safer to put my baby on. It is also stylish. You don't need to buy infant insert. One thing I like the most is that you can carry baby facing ourward. She smiles and enjoys the view.So far I've never had back pain. I use a stroller when I had to carry my baby more than 2 hours. Again my baby is 5 month old, and I recommend BabyBjorn.
