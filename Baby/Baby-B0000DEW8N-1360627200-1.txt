review/summary: Easy Cleanreview/text: This straps very easily to our high pub style dining chairs. My 18Mo was eating in his safety first highchair but it took up a good chunk of space in our tight dining area even in the folded up position.Now he uses this booster, with the tray removed it slides right in under the table when he is not using it.It's very easy to clean and takes up no additional space!
