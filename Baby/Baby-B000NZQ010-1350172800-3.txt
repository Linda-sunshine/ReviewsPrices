review/summary: Fun for awhile, but it doesn't stay together.review/text: This toy is so-so. Our daughter used it as a walked while learning to walk, but other than that, hasn't been much interested in it as a toy to play with. The panel on the front is constantly falling off and the telephone isn't attached to it at all, which means that I"m always finding it in random locations. I don't think that it's been with the toy for months now. Overall, a so-so product. Kinda obnoxious songs and not very educational.
