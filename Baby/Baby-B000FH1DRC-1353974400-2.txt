review/summary: Used both Pampers and huggiesreview/text: We've experimented with quite a few brands of Diapers and also products within those brands and i Must say that out daughter has enjoyed Pampers Swaddlers more than any others. Each baby is different and in my case, i believe the form factor the way the diaper is made perfectly covers her bottom so shes able to crawl, move her legs at an excellent motion without having discomfort. Huggies in my opinion, the material feels a bit more plastic and Pampers has more of a cotton feel to it.
