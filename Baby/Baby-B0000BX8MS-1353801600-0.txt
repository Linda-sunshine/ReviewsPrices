review/summary: Nice Itemreview/text: I am very happy with how functional this sleep sack is. Being winter, the house is always drafty and cooler than the thermostat reads, so I put this on my son every night over top of his sleeper. It works great and keeps him much warmer safely. It's very functional for changing with the zipper starting at the top and zipping down, so you can open the bottom partially without taking the top off.
