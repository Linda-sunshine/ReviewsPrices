review/summary: Thought it would be betterreview/text: It's a great idea that seems like it would solve the issue of sleeping while pregnant, but it was actually harder to use. For example, if you lay with the long piece behind your back, you cannot roll over very easily.The pillow is firm-ish which some may like, and the material it is made of is soft to the touch. The pillow is quite large and takes up a substantial portion of the bed. I ended up returning this item (very easily thanks to Amazon) and bought a small wedge pillow for my belly and use a separate small pillow for between the legs.Material: 4/5Quality: 4/5Usability: 1/5Overall: 2/5
