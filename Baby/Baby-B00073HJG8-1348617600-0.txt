review/summary: Good Space Saverreview/text: I ordered this for my baby's room, so that the stuffed animals wouldn't take up much of the floor space needed for the baby's furniture. I'm am very happy with it, and it holds A LOT of teddy bears, and it also compliments the room.A little stretchy though.
