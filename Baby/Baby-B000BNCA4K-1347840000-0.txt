review/summary: Best Infant Toy Yet!review/text: I got this toy at Buy Buy Baby for $15! I had seen this on Amazon, but when I went to the store, I put it in the hands of my 3 month old who immediately started to play with it. It was magical. Because of the many loops he was able to grab it right away and use his feet which I could see made him feel good. Not to mention the noise it makes when you shake it is a nice reward. Since then I noticed that he has become a lot more confident with other toys as a result of this toy. Before he was pretty frustrated with most of the other toys I gave him such as the "keys". I would say that this toy made him a lot more coordinated as he has learned to play with it. My son is now 4 months old. Highly recommend! I'll be getting this for future baby gifts!
