review/summary: Baby is not dry in Baby Dry, Prefer Swaddlersreview/text: I have been using Pampers Swaddlers for my son (now 13 months old) and highly recommend THIS brand of Pampers. My goal was to order the same brand from Amazon but the only brand available on Amazon was Pampers Baby Dry diapers so I decided to give it a try, because after all, it is still made by Pampers, a name I trust. I do NOT recommend Baby Dry diapers. My son would stay dry in the Swaddlers but ironically he was soaking wet in the Baby Dry diapers. The diaper does not hold the wetness which would become saggy once wet and leak up the front, so he would be wet all over, in his diaper, his pjs, and his bedding, overnight in this diaper. He also developed more diaper rashes from wearing this diaper compared to the other one. I love the delivery service Amazon provides, but I will not get Baby Dry again.
