review/summary: Great seat, could be improved with sliders instead of buttonsreview/text: This is a very portable, nice-looking, and sturdy product. The buttons on the sides are not as convenient as some of the models that slide. I don't think we've ever used the top tray cover (the green part) because 1) are you really going to put food on this tray, cover it up, and transport it? and 2) you're probably going to clean off the random chunky food bits before you take the thing home. My husband thinks it's great and preferred it to other snap-on models, however I feed our kid more and have to deal with its &#34;quirks&#34; on a more regular basis (i.e. he's been able to easily pull off the white middle tray by himself since he was able to sit up straight in it!), so my standards are a little higher. Bottom line: this is a good seat with a neat tray system and good height adjustment features, but the side buttons and tray stability leave much to be desired.
