review/summary: Does its job.review/text: I bought this for my church, since we're renting a room in a school and don't have a nursery we needed somewhere for parents with small children to take their kids if they get upset during the service. Anyways, this thing works well, is fairly easy to use, and we liked it enough to buy a second one. We bought the colorful one since it was the cheapest (since I have Prime I didn't have to pay shipping on it). The parents and children seem to like it, and it's nice that we can add or remove panels as needed. I'm pleased with it.
