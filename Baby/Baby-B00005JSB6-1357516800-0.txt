review/summary: Not the same Diapers sold in retail stores. Poor quality, no absorbencyreview/text: We loved Huggies when we were buying them at Wal*Mart. They may say Huggies on the box and have the same Disney prints as the diapers from Wal*Mart but they are thinner and have less than 1/2 the absorbency.I don't know if these are knock offs that are made for a different market or what, but these are almost unusable. These could barely handle pee let alone a full on poo diaper. Blowouts are EVERY poo now where they were 1 in 10 before.Switching to different brand when buying from Amazon.
