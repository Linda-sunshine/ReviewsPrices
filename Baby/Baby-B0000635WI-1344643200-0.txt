review/summary: HUGE but overall I'd recommend to those in the 3rd trimesterreview/text: I would recommend this pillow for those in the 3rd trimester. Any earlier and this is overkill. Any bigger and it is total overkill (there is one other version I was considering that is larger & thank goodness I didn't purchase that monster!). I would just recommend a simple boppy for 1st & 2nd trimesters like I used.Pro's:AffordableComfortable but it will take some time to figure out which position is most comfortable.Con's:It is HUGE especially to store when you aren't using.It is a pain to get around and then again back into position each time you have to get up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night.
