review/summary: Everything I expected. Mom and son are both very pleased!review/text: Love this potty seat! My son showed zero interest in being potty trained but as soon as he saw this he dragged it out of the bathroom by himself and said pee-pee mama?! He's been using it every day since for the next 3 weeks. Good stability, easy to clean, has traction on bottom for hardwood & tile floors, good price point and comfortable for my 2 yr old to sit on. He'll sit there for an hour or longer if he could and doesn't want to get up I actually have to fight him to get off it and he NEVER sits still. Great seat. I deff. recommend it.
