review/summary: Well....review/text: Well I initally really liked these diapers. They fit well, they were snug, but not too tight in all the right places until a poop that went up the back of the diaper and onto her clothes. I tried readjusting the diaper to try and make it tighter in the back, but it didn't work. So I had to bump up to the next size and even then there have been a couple accidents where its gone out the sides.....its seems like there should be a size 1 that is longer in the back, b/c size 2 is too big.
