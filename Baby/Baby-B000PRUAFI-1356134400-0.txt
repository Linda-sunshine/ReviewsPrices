review/summary: Very handy gate!review/text: I use this gate at the base of our stairs to keep my toddler from going up the steps. The gate was fairly simple to assembly and I admit, it comes with adhesive and/screws to attach it to the wall and I skipped this step. I have had to take time to readjust it a time or two because of that, but that is my choice and it would probably work better with that step being completed. If I had this at the top of a staircase instead of the bottom, I would definately attach it more permanently. I LOVE the fact that it swings shut behind me. It's extremely easy to open, and has the option to lock or not. To get it to stay open you simply open it wide enough to catch and it stays open so we can use the stairs more freely after he goes to sleep. Assembly gets 4 stars, easy of use would get 5 stars.
