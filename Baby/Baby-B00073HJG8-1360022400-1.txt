review/summary: Awesomereview/text: This is awesome! I would have gladly paid 2 or 3 times the asking price! It's very big and sturdy and was easy to install. We have probably 40-50 stuffed animals in this thing. It's SO awesome having a place to neatly store the dolls while not in use. High recommend.
