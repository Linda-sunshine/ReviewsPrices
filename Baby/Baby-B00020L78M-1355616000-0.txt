review/summary: Not what I expected at ALL!!!!review/text: I bought this for my 7 month old son who was crawling everywhere. I was hoping it would keep him in one place. Within a week of the purchase, he started pulling himself up and "cruising" at which point I realized this would NOT work for us. Its extremely wobbly and does not stay in place. When he leans on the panel, it leans forward...forcing him to loose his balance. My son is way to strong and active for this. If your child is stationary and doesn't move around much, this might work....otherwise DO NOT buy this.
