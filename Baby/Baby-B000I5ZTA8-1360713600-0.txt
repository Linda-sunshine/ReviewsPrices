review/summary: Order according to their size chartreview/text: I originally ordered the medium (pre-preggo I was a size 4) after reading everyone's reviews to size up. When I was smaller, the medium seemed to help, but as I got bigger, I found even on the smallest links that I was totally unsupported. I 32 weeks and I am having some round ligament and pelvic pain, but didn't want to order one of those massive belts. I decided to try ordering the small and it's been a dramatic difference. It probably depends on how you are carrying - I don't have much of a graduated transition from my pelvis to my bump so even though my belly is quite big (my friends describe me as &#34;all bump&#34;), I need to wear the small on the smallest hook set. I would recommend this, but I would recommend going by the size chart specified by the manufacturer and not these other reviews.
