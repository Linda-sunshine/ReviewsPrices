review/summary: Nice product but not the best for mereview/text: I can see how this pillow would be helpful for some women, but it didnt work for me. My biggest problem was that I couldn't use my own pillow, your head will naturally rest on the top part of this pillow. Also, I tend to flip sides a lot throughout the night especially when wakeful. The uncomfortableness of pregnancy meant that I would want to change positions frequently during the night. You pretty much need to get out of bed, flip the pillow over, then crawl back in and adjust if you want to change sides. Not cool for me. Once arranged, I did enjoy the back and hip support. This pillow just didnt match up with my sleep style. For me, putting a smaller pillow between my legs worked best. If you tend to like to switch sides during the night or you are attached to your head pillow, I would pass on this.
