review/summary: Cause redness / chemical burns?review/text: The hospital provided these to us, and the brand we bought didn't hold water (nurtured by nature brand) so we bought some to go home, too. But we found his diaper area getting quite red. We thought it was wipes so switched wipes and also switched over to Huggies Pure & Natural and the redness went away. However, those ran a bit small so had some poo leaks with some watery stool blow-outs so went back to the Pampers Swaddlers not realizing they had caused the redness rather than the wipes. Took less than 24 hours to reach the conclusion that they did for sure cause the redness. We're back in the Huggies now but we're going to buy the next size up when they run out. FWIW, if your baby tolerates these they seem to hold liquid, even liquid poos quite well, no leaks. So, I give them 2 stars rather than 1 star. The Huggies are softer inside and out, though, and seem like a nicer product, really. Just hoping moving up a size helps us. Cheers,
