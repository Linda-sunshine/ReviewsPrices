review/summary: Great until it stops working... which it willreview/text: We purchased this nite-light for our daughter's nursery and she loves to look at the stars as we rock her to sleep. Very calming and soothing. The problem is that the LED lights die quickly, and are non-replaceable. We've gone through three units in under 1 year and have decided enough is enough. The first lasted about 4-5 months, the second lasted 2-3 months and the third (which was comp'd by AMAZON) has already begun to die after 2 months. It's really unfortunate as it's great while it works... and is useless when it doesn't. There are other similar products on the market, and we'll be trying those next for sure.
