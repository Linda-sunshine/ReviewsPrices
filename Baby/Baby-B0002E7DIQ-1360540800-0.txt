review/summary: Helpful for backache and tummy sleepersreview/text: I bought this over a month ago and wanted to make sure I've used it for enough time before I wrote a review. This body pillow is great, despite all the negative reviews. I am a tummy sleeper and this has really helped me to avoid sleeping on my stomach. Also, it gives just the right amount of support to avoid backache and other pregnancy-related aches and pains. I have to say I sleep much better with it than I did before I had a body pillow. My husband has tried it out as well and loves it too. The only downside is it takes up a lot of space on a queen size bed, but the hubby's should understand it's only for a matter of a few, sleep-necessary months :)
