review/summary: Cute and fun toy!review/text: My little man received this for Christmas last year at 10 months old. He is now 18 months and still plays with it. He doesn't push it along as much but he loves to play with the front of it. My only qualm is that the phone should be attached somehow because I constantly go looking for it :).
