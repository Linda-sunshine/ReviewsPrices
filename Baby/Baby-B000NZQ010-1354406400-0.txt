review/summary: Love this toy, its great!review/text: My son LOVED this toy! He played with it before he walked and never stoped playing with it! It is built great. Very entertaning! Very cute! I have nothing bad to say about this toy. My son played with this toy well past one year old. And I had to give it to my nephew because he was struggling to walk. He instantly fell in love with this toy and also became one of his favorite toys. I now have it back and my daughter is starting to play with it. I know it well be one of her favorite toys also! This toy has been through three babies/toddlers and still works great!!!
