review/summary: Great Activityreview/text: This is definatly a learning walker. you can adjust the speed on this. for beginner walkers this is the toy. my son was not afraid to stand up, because the toy was sturdy. it held it's place until he pushed it then it would move. doesn't take long he started walking on his own so i had to adjust the speed to the fastest for him. Very bright & attracting for kids.
