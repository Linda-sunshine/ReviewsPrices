review/summary: Very funreview/text: Before my son could crawl, he would lay down and look at this and play with the buttons on it. When he was working on walking he would try to stand up and hold this, but it moves too fast for him. He didn't use it until he started walking. So as a fun, musical toy, it's great, but as an aid to learn to walk, which it's marketed for, it's not helpful.
