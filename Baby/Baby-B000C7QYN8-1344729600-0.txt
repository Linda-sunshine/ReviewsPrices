review/summary: Pros and Cons....still a good wipereview/text: I've been using these wipes since 2008 and am completely satisfied. However, here are some pros and cons that might help...Cons-The smell did get some getting used to....but it's natural, you can't have it all!-They are pretty thin, if you are squeamish about poo (like my husband) I would suggest you fold the wipe for extra protection.-Once you get towards the end of the batch the wipes start sticking together, you pull out one and can get 4 more that you have to unstick yourself....this can be extra frustrating when you're trying to clean a messy poo and your child's legs are flopping about AND you need to unstick wipes.Pros-Good natural wipes. I first began using these wipes for my firstborn, whenever we had to use different wipes (pampers or huggies) he would break out into rash. He had pretty sensitive skin but it makes you wonder what they are putting in those other wipes that would cause such a reaction.-It actually wipes! Other brands I have used(Pampers sensitive, target brand, huggies sensitive)are so moist they don't grip on to the stuff it supposed to be cleaning. I have found myself rubbing my poor baby's behind raw just trying to get a crusty piece of poop off!! I've never had that problem with these wipes.-Cheaper through Prime + Amazon mom + subscription. Like all wipes you can get a good deal with these wipes that is significantly cheaper than anywhere else I have found.-In the time I have been using these wipes I have never noticed a change in amount or quality. They have been a good solid product and I don't ever plan on changing.
