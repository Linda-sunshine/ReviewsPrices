review/summary: Not for extended use, mattress warpsreview/text: We received this as a gift and have been using it as a bed for our baby for several months now. At first we liked it and he seemed comfortable, but now the bottom of the mattress has warped horribly and is completely unusable. I didn't realize immediately how bad it had really become, but there are serious hills and valleys, I feel awful for our poor baby. If we had only wanted to use this as a bed every now and then for brief trips or occasional visitors it might have been alright, but this was clearly not designed for everyday use.
