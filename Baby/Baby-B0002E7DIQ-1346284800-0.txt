review/summary: Thank Goodness for the Leachco Pillow!!review/text: When I started having to sleep on my side because of pregnancy - I was suffering from neck and rib pain and my back was achey too. I couldn't sleep for more than a few hours at a time because of being so uncomfortable.The pillow arrived and on my first night using it I sleep for more than 6 hours straight (a miracle for me!) and my pain reduced over a few days. I would not have been able to sleep during my pregnancy without this pillow. I am very grateful!!
