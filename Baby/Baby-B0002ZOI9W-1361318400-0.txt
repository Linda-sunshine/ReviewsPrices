review/summary: We've enjoyed it so farreview/text: The best thing is that this rocker is made to serve children from newborn to toddler who can sit and rock by himself. So far I have tested it on my newborn. The chair offers two options for him - a rocking chair with entertaining toys (including one musical) dangling over his head and a sort of portable bed where he can comfortably take a nap (this is converted from a rocking chair by a lever). My child as of now can only stare at the dangling toys, but I expect him to be able to play with them in a few weeks. The chair has been very helpful in getting him to sit up when he is awake so that I can face and play with him, and the sleepy position - for keeping him asleep but away from his crib.If there are any suggestion I would make, they are: it would have been nice to have a head holder (like car seats have) and that the rod holding the toys was a bit sturdier. Otherwise, not a bad investment.
