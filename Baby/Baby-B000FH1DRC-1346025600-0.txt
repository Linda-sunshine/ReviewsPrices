review/summary: These work very well for our son...review/text: These diapers were used by our hospital when our son was born and we immediately appreciated the blue/yellow line indicator line on them. It saved us some guesswork when he started getting fussy and we also didn't have to do the old check w/ the finger or hold him up to our nose tricks that our parents used to do. This alone just about makes these well worth it.They seem to be real flexible on the sizing as well, my son was just under 9 lbs. when born and is now between 13-14 lbs. @ 6 weeks and still is in the newborn size. The size 1's we have are way too big and loose on him and the newborn size doesn't seem to be cutting into him at all so we're going to stay with it for a bit longer. I noticed other reviews mention their "flexibility" in sizing and this seems to hold true, at least in our case.As far as absorbency and containing messes go we can't complain about these at all. These diapers seem to be able to hold a real good amount of liquid/waste and we've only had one minor leak issue but according to my wife she didn't think any diaper would have stood up to that test. For reference many of our friends have had kids recently and so far we don't seem to be having the same diaper issues that some described to us (just an observation).We'll be using the swaddlers as long as he can fit in them and while we did receive other diapers at the baby shower, those will be gifted to a couple of our friends that are expecting soon.
