review/summary: wonderful!review/text: We just received our Moby Wrap today in the mail. It got here in 2 days and we couldn't be happier! My seven week old baby girl is sound asleep in it right now as I type. I wish I had gotten one of these when my son was smaller. It is a huge help while caring for a 21 month old and a 5 year old on top of a newborn. It's truly hands free but if your out and about or doing things around the house and you feel like giving your baby a squeeze they are right there on your chest to hold and cuddle. I am a busy stay at home mom and really needed a way to wear my baby comfortably because I always felt that I had to set her down and I wasn't getting enough cuddle time (they are only this little once right?) Well I found my solution, so worth the forty five dollars it cost me. I had no problem getting it on and baby in. Before I purchased I went on youtube and watched tons of moby wrap tutorials which really helped when I got it. It probably took 5 tries the first time to get it perfect for us. It is Extremely comfortable and soft. The weight is distributed evenly and doesnt hurt my back at all which is a huge plus for me as I have a bad lower back and often get shoulder pain when carrying baby. I gave the Moby Wrap 5 starts because it is exactly what we needed and although we have only been using it for one day I already cant imagine everyday life without it!
