review/summary: 9 month old LOVES it!review/text: My 9 month old is mastering sitting and crawling and this toy is on the top of his list. He likes to sit in front of it and explore all the buttons, gadgets and phone. When he's tired of sitting we can take it off of it holster and put it flat on the ground for him. Easy to assemble and batteries were included. Can wait to see if he'll use it to walk with.
