review/summary: Love the blue strip!review/text: We started using the Pampers Swaddlers since baby was in the hospital. She was a preemie, and at that, the preemie diapers looked huge on her! We graduated to newborn size, and the strip makes diaper checking so much easier! The only thing is sometimes we do get blow-outs, but I think it has to do more with the force of the gas being expelled!
