review/summary: Does the job!review/text: I love this gate. I used it at the bottom of the stairs (would love to use one at the top of the stairs too, but too nervous about potential stumbles over the bottom bar) and I installed it myself, currently very pregnant, while my child napped in the next room, because my handy husband was at work and I just couldn't wait to get this hooked up. Installation was straightforward enough and the gate has withstood much rattling from our toddler.
