review/summary: Didn't leave home without itreview/text: I was encouraged to buy this, but wasn't sure if I'd really use it or not. I don't think its for everyone, but it became a lifeline for me. I wouldn't leave home without it. I had a C-section and used it when I got home to remind me to take my medicine. I used it mainly for knowing how long itzbeen between feedings and which side I had last nursed on. I nursed my son for a year and used the timer the entire time. I know some people complained about batteries, but we must have had a good one and only replaced it a couple times the whole year. I used it also for a nightlight or medicine if he was sick. I think the first week for new parents can be super tough with the lack of sleep. My husband would wake me up and say our son was crying and probably was hungry. I'd often, in my sleep deprived state, say, "I just fed him, it can't be that." And he was able to check the itzbeen and point out that I just fed him 3 hours ago. :) I thought I had just fallen back to sleep, but 3 hours had already passed. In that sense, it was fabulous. We're now expecting baby 2 and plan on using it again.
