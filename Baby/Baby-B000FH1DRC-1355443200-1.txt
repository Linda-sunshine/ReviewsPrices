review/summary: Diapers in bulk = geniusreview/text: This is the ebulk package that has the tealish colored packages as shown in the cardboard box. I like how the diapers are in multiple, smaller packages, so that we can take one to daycare and keep the others at home. These have been the best diapers for our baby. The Huggies leaked when she was tiny because she is very long and lean. The Pampers just seem to fit her little bum better. The weight sizing on the diapers seems to be pretty accurate because we have followed the weight guidelines from day one and haven't had any problems. At just under 18 pounds we are finally moving on to size 3 - not because we have had problems with the size 2, but because I want to move up before we do start leaking halfway through the next bulk package. Amazon is a great way to buy diapers with the Subscribe and Save setup. Definitely recommend.
