review/summary: Pretty Greatreview/text: I really like the play yard and bought it with soft foam mats to create a 'baby jail'. However, it is a little more flexible than I expected and my little one pulls up on everything these days. Also, there was a piece of the fence that had broken at the joint and wasn't in the box, so it must have broken before boxing. That was rather disappointing. Otherwise, it's a good play yard and serves its purpose.
