review/summary: Like the larger count boxreview/text: My wife and I have been using these diapers for a while now. We converted from Pampers when the Baby Dry diapers seemed to not be as high of quality as they were in the past. The absorbency is excellent and have found it to be one of the better diapers out there. However, my review is more specifically tied to the larger box. The previous box size that you could purchase on Amazon, we'd always run out before the end of the month. Now, we tend to have more than enough to last us through the month.
