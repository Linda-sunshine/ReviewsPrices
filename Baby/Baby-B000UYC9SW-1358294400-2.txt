review/summary: Have had one for awhilereview/text: Found one of these at a resale shop in medium and it was a little snug but its perfect for dad. Just ordered another in Large for me. They're fairly easy to use compared to most slings but it does take a little bit of figuring out and finding a position your baby likes.
