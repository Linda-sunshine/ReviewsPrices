review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: Just received it today. My son loves it when he saw it but after just a few seconds the light turned off. Not even a minute. We changed the battery but it's not working. Sooo disappointed. My 3 year old son said to throw it to trash. I've been a very satisfied amazon customer before until this thing happened. So sad.
