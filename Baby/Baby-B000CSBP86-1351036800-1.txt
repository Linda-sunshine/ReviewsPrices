review/summary: Excellent!review/text: The baby bjorn is so comfortable to use on a daily basis. Comes particularly handy on vacations when a lot of walking is involved. I need to walk our dog daily and it's cumbersome to take the stroller along for my little one. I carry her in the baby bjorn and it makes life easier. Also leaves one hand free in case I need to make a phone call during the walks.
