review/summary: Really cute!review/text: I've had this night light for my daughter little over 6 months now and it works really good, it's really cute. It's had 3 different lights, but in all honesty it's kind of a waste seeing as how the setting "blue" looks better than the other colors. All in all it's a very good product I recommend it to all mommies
