review/summary: Great walkerreview/text: I bought this for my granddaughter's first birthday. She is cruising around furniture, etc., and she loves walking with this learning walker. It seems to have a wide base of support and still be lightweight enough for her to maneuver. She loves playing with all the activities on the front. I do agree with the one comment regarding the phone receiver. It would be nice if it were attached. I am always finding under a table or something.
