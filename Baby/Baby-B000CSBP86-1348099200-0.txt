review/summary: Babybjorn baby carrierreview/text: I bought the air version of the carrier for my 7 months old. I had two other carriers but they were not as easily use as this one because this one opens in the front and you don't have to tie up from the back. The carrier is light in weight and my baby enjoys it while taking a walk in the neighborhood. The original price of approx. $120 would be a little pricey, but I used the 20%off Amazon coupon code while it was on sale for $60 and ended up paying around $50 for the carrier. Good buy!
