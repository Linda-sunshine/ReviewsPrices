review/summary: Great for About One Monthreview/text: We tried to use these with our twins when they were between 6 & 10 pounds. That was a non-starter. They were just too little to handle the positioning. Now they're about 15 pounds each. We got one decent day at the zoo, but even at just 15 pounds my chiropractor will be getting some business. These just aren't worth it. I recommend baby Moby when they're really little. Then move on to a baby ergo around 15 to 18 lbs.
