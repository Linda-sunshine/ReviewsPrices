review/summary: Gift for baby nephewreview/text: I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 9 month old nephew. To my surprise it was also a big hit with my 3 year old and 5 year old nephews as well. While it served its function as a night light, they also enjoyed flipping it upside down so that the lights were on the floor. Big hit!
