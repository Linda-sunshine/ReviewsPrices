review/summary: Sweet sleepreview/text: My mother bought this for me as a gift when I was 11 weeks pregnant. I had already started to have aching in my hips periodically. This pillow is wonderful, I sleep so soundly and wake up refreshed. Ignore the complaints about fabric, just don't expect silk or Egyptian cotton. I feel like it is adequately stuffed. I am 5'10 and have no problem curling right into this pillow. This pillow is a pregnant woman's best friend when the sleep problems start to set it. Totally worth it!
