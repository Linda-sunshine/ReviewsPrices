review/summary: Great alternative to high chairreview/text: I was sick of cleaning my adorably vintage, but annoyingly spindly, high chair, I decided to purchase one that was easier to clean and move around. I spent a lot of time researching options of traditional high chairs, and then came upon this little seat. I was immediately drawn to the fact that it wouldn't add another large piece of furniture to my house, and that it was smooth, easy-to-wipe plastic. Add in the fact that it is travel-friendly, and it was perfect.I love the fact that the height is adjustable, that it fastens easily and tightly to my dining chair, and that the tray is dishwasher-safe. I do not love that after one use, the safety straps were stained with food. The entire thing is very easy to wash, aside from the straps, which are now green-brown-disgusting. I did purchase Oxyclean per another user's suggestion and plan to use it to get them back into shape.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. My 9-month-old daughter fits in it comfortably, but with lots of room to spare. I envision using this for many years until she is big enough to sit in a regular dining seat, and I would highly recommend this booster to anyone who is looking for an alternative to bulky high chairs.
