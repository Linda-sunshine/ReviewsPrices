review/summary: Stick to swaddlersreview/text: I'm a new mom and was first I introduced to pampers swaddlers at the hospital...nice fit, wetness indicator stripe, no leaks, good absorption. Well I ordered a case of babydry by mistake thinking they were all the same. I was wrong. The baby dry are ill fitting, poorly constructed diapers that don't even need a wetness indicator because you'll see it all around your baby's sheets!!! You have to always make sure to fasten them up high and tight if not they'll leak. Also if your baby has runny stools good luck. Sometimes they'll catch it other times they won't. I also don't like how they have a plastic bag feel to them. Maybe it's just me, but my rating stays a one star.
