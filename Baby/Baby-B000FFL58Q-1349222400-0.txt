review/summary: Great Fun!review/text: My twin 2.5 month old granddaughters LOVE this toy! One of them can lay for 30+ minutes cooing and kicking and just having a terrific time. The other one lasts almost as long, too! And even when one of them is done, they still like sitting on my lap and watching the other one. I thought it was the music and/or lights but even before they come on, the girls start cooing and smiling.
