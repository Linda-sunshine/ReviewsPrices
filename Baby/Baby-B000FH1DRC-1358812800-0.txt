review/summary: Can't live without thesereview/text: I get these on subscription - and this amount is just about the perfect number for a month's worth of diapers. They are by far the best diapers out there. I had tried other brands that were more environmentally conscious but it's hard to beat the quality of Pampers Swaddlers. Plus the wetness indicator is key - and the lining stays remarkable dry, even when the little guy makes a disaster in there. So far I've been using the size 2 for several months now - they are the perfect size, not too big, not too small.
