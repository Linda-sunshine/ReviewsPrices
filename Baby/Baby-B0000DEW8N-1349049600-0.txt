review/summary: So far--it's great!review/text: We have a 6 month old and use this as our high chair. It has been great so far--very easy to use and clean. I haven't tried to travel with it yet, and our daughter is still using the tray so I haven't tried to push it under the table yet. I think it's a great value for the price.
