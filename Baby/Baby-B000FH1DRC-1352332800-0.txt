review/summary: Worth the extra dollarsreview/text: While a little more expensive than some of the other brands, I prefer these diapers for my 4-month old. They are much softer and feel less synthetic than some of the other ones available. They seem to fit better, too, and rarely leak (I don't think any diaper is totally leak-proof). My only complaint is that sometimes the mesh can stick to his skin a little after a BM.
