review/summary: Okayreview/text: I bought this toy for my 7-month-old daughter, after reading the wonderful reviews it got here. It looks like a neat toy, but my daughter has never cared for it. She never plays with it, and when I hand it to her, she simply throws it down. I'm sure it would be a great toy for the right kid, but she simply isn't that kid.
