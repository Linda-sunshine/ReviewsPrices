review/summary: Freaking Awesome...review/text: Way more impressed with this baby carrier that originally thought. Our 10 lbs kiddo is still pretty small, but it has been great for neighborhood walks and around the house when he'd like to be held but I still need to be working at my desk. We've also got a great Bob stroller, but honestly I'd rather use the BABYBJORN carrier because of its size and lack of hassle.
