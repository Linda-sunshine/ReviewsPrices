review/summary: Excellent valuereview/text: We bought two of these for our home. Our daughter slept in them downstairs for naps and upstairs in our bedroom. We currently use the downstairs one for diaper changes and the upstairs one to keep her safe and contained while we shower or whatever (the bassinet has been removed). They are super easy to set up and great quality. She is 7 months old now and I still love these pack-n-plays!
