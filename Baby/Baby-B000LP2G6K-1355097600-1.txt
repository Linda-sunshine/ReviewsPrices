review/summary: This thing is greatreview/text: Breaks down pretty small for travel and is easy to move around when it is up. The bassinet portion is nice too. We have out 6 mo old in the bassinet portion when we are in the living room so he has a good place to lay down without going all the way back to the nursery.
