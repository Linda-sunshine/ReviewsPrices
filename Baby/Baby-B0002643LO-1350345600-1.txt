review/summary: OMG, did these Pampers meet my expectations?review/text: So like I get this email from Amazon. "'Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Giant Pack Size 2 172 Count' meet your expectations? Review it on Amazon.com". Yes. You put it on and it keeps the stuff in. What more could there to be said about Pampers? They do a better job than Luvs and Huggies. They're also more expensive. The especially good thing about this Giant Pack is that it comes with more diapers than the non-Giant Pack. That means you run out of diapers less often, and that's a good thing. Nothing like having a dirty baby with nothing to change into. I say go for the giant pack! How many people read a review about diapers? Will my review be "liked" on Facebook? That would be really good for my self esteem.
