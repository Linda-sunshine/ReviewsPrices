review/summary: Wonderful Product!review/text: Exactly what my friends baby needed to start walking on his own, only after using for 20 minutes he took his first three steps all by himself! Only nine months old and walking! My friend and her baby love it, it was the perfect Christmas present! I would recommend to anyone with a crawling trying to walk baby, just be sure to put the wheels on level one, level two is a bit fast for beginners. ENJOY!
