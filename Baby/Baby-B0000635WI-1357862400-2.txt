review/summary: very comfyreview/text: this product is very comfy and i think will work well for me as i get bigger. I bought it hoping it'd help w/ my lower back/neck issues, but it didn't help too much. I stopped using it for awhile, but will plan to use it again soon.My only complaint is that the part where your legs go seems to go flat quickly throughout the night which causes my legs to ache.
