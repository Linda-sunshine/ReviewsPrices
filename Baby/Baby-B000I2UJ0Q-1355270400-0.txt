review/summary: We ALL love it!review/text: I bought it when our baby girl was 4 months old. She was not able to jump yet but had fun playing with the toys on it. It was a good place to put her while I did chores or just needed a break from holding her. At 7months, we raised it to level 2, she was LOVING it! It was so funny watching her laugh and jump so fast. She was turning 360 on her sit, following our dog walking around... we loved seeing her love it. She's now 10months old and still loves to jump on it. However she can now only do 10-15mins (vs. an 1hr when she was younger) she wants out because she's now crawling and prefers to be on the floor. I'm definitely keeping for our 2nd child. I'm glad I got it and I'm glad I got it early!!
