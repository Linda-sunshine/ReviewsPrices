review/summary: Very good wipes for the lack of chemicals in this productreview/text: I've tried a lot of wipes, with both toxins such as Propylene Glycol and toxic free. These are the best I have found that are toxic and chlorine free and DONT contain Propylene Glycol, a very toxic chemical found in most wipes and a lot of beauty products. I wish they were a bit damper and bigger, but would prefer these over most wipes that have toxins.
