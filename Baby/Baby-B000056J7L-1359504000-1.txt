review/summary: Superior to other potties!review/text: We have two other potties (hand me downs, etc) and this one is far superior. My son prefers this throne to the others and that says it all. Easy to clean, no silly lid that falls down, breaks etc. and very comfortable. Get one for your little pooper.
