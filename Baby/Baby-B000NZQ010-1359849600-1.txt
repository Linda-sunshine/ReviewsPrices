review/summary: Son's favoritereview/text: I bought this for my son when he was 9 months old because he was pulling himself up into a standing position. He immediately took to it and started using it as a walker. Even though he is 15 months old now and walking like a pro, he still uses it. I loved it so much I bought one for me niece.
