review/summary: Great Toy! Large Age Range!review/text: One of my biggest requirements for a "good toy" is that my son will play with it over and over for many months. This toy is perfect! We got it for Christmas (6 months old) and we took the noise-maker part off of the wheels and he just played with the noise-maker for a long time. I was a little disappointed that it didn't seem to help him much when he was learning to walk (12 months) and I thought that we were pretty much done with that toy once he was walking well, but he really got a renewed interest in it and it is often the first toy that he seeks out when he walks in the room (15 months). I keep it "parked" under our piano bench and he makes a bee-line for it and pulls it out and pushes it all over the house. He is a very good walker and doesn't need it the least bit for balance but he seems to enjoy pushing it just the same. I call it his lawn mower b/c his stride looks the same as if he were mowing the lawn. :) He loves the barn door and the shapes that are hooked on with bungee cords. My only complaints are that the noise-maker part falls off if it is jarred with much force (such as running full speed into the wall) and the phone is not attached with any sort of bungee so it is rarely used with this toy but rather stored in the toy box. Overall I think it is a great toy and we have gotten a full year's worth of use out of it which is impressive by my standards. When he outgrows this toy I will be happy if I never hear "Home On The Range" every again but I'm still glad that we got it!
