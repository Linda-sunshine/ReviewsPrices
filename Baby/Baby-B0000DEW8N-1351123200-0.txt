review/summary: A GUIDE to make a decisionreview/text: We got this for our then 6 month old baby. And we absolutely love it. She is now 13 months. I'll point out some Pros and Cons so you can make a better decision.NEUTRAL:- Operation: you place baby in seat, fasten seat belts, and then place base tray (and top tray if you want).PROS:- 3 Adjustable heights.- Straps are detachable and washable: yes, they are. Another reviewer says they're not, BUT THEY ARE. I have detached them. You just have to slide your hand under the seat and help the straps come out. Very easy to do.- EASY TO CLEAN: no fabric, no problem. My baby is perfectly comfortable without cushioning and hot fabrics. And I can assure sure that cleaning this is a breeze as it doesn't have crevices and seams.- SPACE SAVER: using one of your dining chairs (or any other chair) would save space when you slide it under the table. I'll also blend in better with your decoration.- 2 trays: both detachable. The top one (with lid) is perfect for serving then food right there though I never used the lid. It is also dishwasher safe. Once they learn to take off this top tray by themselves the base tray stays securely in place and is easy to clean as well (no way for baby to detach this :)CONS:- If you have a cushioned chair (cushioning that can't be taken off) this seat will leave a mark, probably permanent once you take the seat off (a couple of years later?). Also, babies drop food that sometimes doesn't go to the floor but to your chair seat.- If you don't have a cushioned chair: you might want to cut a plastic or cleanable place mat and put it on the chair before installing the baby seat. This is for easy cleaning. I didn't do it and sometimes if I don't wipe fresh food immediately it gets to attached to the wood.Hope this helps you make a decision :)
