review/summary: Good booster but..review/text: This booster is solid, built nicely and does what its suppose to be but it is not travel friendly. Its a bit on the heavy and bulky side. Especially when you are taking your baby out, parents, from experience have lots to pack when going out and i dont think people want to carry something that adds bulk and weight while on the go. Other than that i recommend this chair for home use.
