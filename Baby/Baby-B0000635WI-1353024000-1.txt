review/summary: Still figuring it out....review/text: I definitely am happy I received the Snoogle as a bday gift from my sister, but I am still figuring out a few things out - like am I positioning myself correctly? where do i put my head and stomach exactly? how can my husband and i share the space in our queen bed? etc. I am at about 25 weeks, and trying to figure out if I am positioning myself correctly on the pillow, or if i just need my stomach to grow more. sometimes i think all i need is a wedge to shove under my stomach and an extra pillow between my legs. with that said, I do feel more &#34;cozy&#34; at night and it does help prevent me from rolling on my back. I am just not sure if it is the &#34;perfect&#34; design for me at this current stage in pregnancy.
