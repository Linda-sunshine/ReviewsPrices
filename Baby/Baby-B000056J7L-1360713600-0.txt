review/summary: Quality toilet for toddlerreview/text: Thanks to Amazon's 90 day return policy, we bought 4 different potties for our boy to try. No, he didn't "use" them, just sat on them to test durability, comfort, and function.Durability - solid plastic. I'm not going to sit on it, but it handles a 32lb kid no problemComfort - No problem sitting on this potty. the raised back is very nice additionFunction - The most important aspect. The raised lip on the front is a MUST for boys. Other potties we tried the lip was not high enough (or not there), which could be a disaster. Raised back is also helpful for holding and guiding your kid down.Highly recommend this for potty training at home. We have the other brand/styles that have wipe holders, etc but don't use it. Avoid the "talking" potties and create your own reward system (M&M;'s work great or there are a ton of potty training apps for phones and tablets). You can also get one of the more basic, smaller potties to keep in your car for trips.
