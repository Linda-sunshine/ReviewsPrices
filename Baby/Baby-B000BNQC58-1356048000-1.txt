review/summary: Nice light display, would be awesome if there were some movementreview/text: I bought this for my son's 5th birthday. He really loves it. I think it's good, but I was hoping there would be some movement to rotate or change the star pattern.I didn't realize when I bought it that it was battery-powered, but since it came with batteries, I'm ok with that. Plus, no cord means any of my kids can pick it up and carry it around, and my son can move it around in his room without any problem.
