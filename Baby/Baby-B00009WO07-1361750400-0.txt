review/summary: I like them, I prefer them, but they can be improvedreview/text: I like that they are very absorbent, my children have never been allergic to their material. It's OK price, compared to the cheaper brands with poor quality. The only brand that in my opinion tops Pampers is the Seven Generation, because their design is better (pleaded in the back preventing stuff coming out of the diaper, absorbent material all the way front and back, and wider sticky bands on the side), only draw back is that Seven Generation is more expensive than Pampers. That is why, for me Pampers is the middle choice for my kids.
