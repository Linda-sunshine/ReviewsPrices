review/summary: Great product. Love it!review/text: I bought this Cloud b turtle when my youngest was born. She is now 6 1/2 years old, and it still works beautifully! It gets used most every night, and she loves it. I like the automatic shut off function to save a bit on battery life, but she can easily find the buttons in the dark and turn it on if she wakes up in the middle of the night. It has even survived a dip in the bathroom sink when she thought he needed a bath a couple of years ago. I have recommended these to all the new mommies and mommies to be that I know. If this one ever stops working and she wants another, I wouldn't hesitate.
