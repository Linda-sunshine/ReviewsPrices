review/summary: Love it except one thingreview/text: this turtle is adorable and my daughter (2 years old) was amazed when i turned it on. all 3 colors show up on her ceiling just fine. the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i wish it had the option to stay on all night. and would be even better to have the option to plug it in instead of using batteries. I need to have an additional night light in her room because she gets scared if she wakes up in the middle of the night and there is no night light. when she gets older, i'll let her keep it by her bed so she can turn it on by herself if she wakes up. she's not old enough for that yet so it stays on the dresser.
