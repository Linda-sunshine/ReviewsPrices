review/summary: For the price, it's very goodreview/text: Being a new parent my wife was looking for a glider. Went to babies r us and their chairs were gong for 300-500. I decided to check on amazon and found this chair with fairly good reviews. For the price I would recommend this. One knock on this chair would be that I did find the cushion to be uncomfortable after sitting on it for more than 20 minutes. But like I said, for the price I can deal with it.
