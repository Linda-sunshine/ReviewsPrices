review/summary: Love it!review/text: I love this play pen! My daughter has so much room and I am able to remove one of them to leave it like a door. I unattached one of the sides so she can go in and out as she pleases, and when I need to keep her contained I will just put it back together and I love hanging her toys on the play pen! Works perfectly! Soon I will have to buy a few more to expand it! :)
