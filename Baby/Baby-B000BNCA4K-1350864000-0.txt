review/summary: Great for baby amusement and hand/eye coordination development; BPA & PVC free, phthalates compliantreview/text: This is our 4 months old baby's second favorite toy.Pros:+ Full of slender surfaces for easy grasping one or two-handed at any angle (great for two-handed play).+ Flexible and soft, so baby doesn't get hurt or cry when bonking her own head.+ Lots of colors (seems purple is our baby's favorite!) and funky shape that baby likes to stare at.+ Safe for sucking and nibbling (no hard surfaces/edges or toxins). Per manhattantoy.com, "The Winkel is made of PU tubing (polyurethane) and as such does not contain BPA or PVC and meets the SPSIA and European requirements for phthalates."+ Built-in rattle, although I wish it were slightly louder.+ Can be refrigerated for teething relief per company website.+ Easily tethered to bib or stroller using pacifier straps likeUlubulu Universal Pacifier Clip, OMG Cupcakes.+ Great for eye tracking exercises (softly jiggle and move it around in baby's line of sight, watch her follow with her eyes and head!).Cons:- Slightly bulky (nitpicking) compared toSassy Ring O' Links Rattle Developmental Toy(our baby's favorite). We definitely like having both toys, but keep this one at home instead of in the already-bursting diaper bag, whereas Sassy Ring never leaves our side (easily fits in bag and pants pockets).An actual rattle likeBright Starts Rattle and Shake Barbell Rattleis louder, and I had thought would be more amusing for our baby, but fails to hold her attention for more than a second. It's also very limited in graspable area, so only stays in her tiny hand for a few seconds at most. It may be good for an older baby, but for now, just sits at home unused.
