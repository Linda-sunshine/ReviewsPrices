review/summary: Great Potential, But Not Stablereview/text: We bought this for our daughter when she was starting to pull up on furniture. Unfortunately, this is a very lightweight and "tippy" toy, so it was terrible for her to learn to pull up on (it would just fall on top of her). She loved the little barn door though, so we backed it between some furniture so she could still play with it. Fast forward a few months and once our daughter starting cruising/walking, we thought this would be fun for her to push around. Unfortunately, this product failed again! We have rugs and hardwood floors. The wheels were too fast on the hardwood floors and she would often trip and fall forward as it would rush out from beneath her. However, the worst part of this product is that it is "tippy" as I previously noted. Numerous times she bumped into the corner of a piece of furniture or walked from the rug onto the hardwood floor and the whole walker violently flipped forward with her on top of it. She even badly pinched her fingers one time. For this reason, I would never recommend this toy, nor would I ever resell it to another parent. I am so surprised at all the positive reviews and am surprised that the stability of this toy hasn't been an issue for anyone else.
