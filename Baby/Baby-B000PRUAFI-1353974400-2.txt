review/summary: Perfect fit!review/text: We got this gate to keep our one year old away from the dogs' dishes and the stairs. It works perfectly for what we need! It was a quick and easy installation. Love how the gate can swing either way and remains open if needed. When it's closed, it remains latched, even without locking, when our little one decides to shake the gate. Definite recommend!
