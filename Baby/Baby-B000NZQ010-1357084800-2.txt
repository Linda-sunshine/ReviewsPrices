review/summary: Really Functionalreview/text: Our son loves sitting at the toy and hitting all of the buttons. He is able to hold on to the handle and pull himself up easily. The toy is sturdy enough to allow him to pull up without it falling over although we do monitor his play.The only annoying side to the toy is that it will continue to play music randomly as a &#34;reminder&#34; to come interact with it. It would be nice if that was a feature we could turn off.
