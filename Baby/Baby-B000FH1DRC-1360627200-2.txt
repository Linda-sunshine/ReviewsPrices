review/summary: Better than Huggiesreview/text: OK OK I know everyone has their favorites but seriously this is our second child and we only buy Pampers now. They are bigger more absorbant and smell better.I don't know if they are cheaper or more expensive than Huggies but I don't care - we're Pampers converts.
