review/summary: Good and safe, but can damage chair it sits onreview/text: We have the blue/green/white version of this chair. It is easy to use, clean and travel with and our kids like it. The one draw back is that depending on the chair you use it on, it can leave damaging marks on the chair. In our case, we use it on a painted white wooden chair. Over just 6 months of use it has scared the chair in places where it gets rubbed each time the chair climbed into or the user of the chair wiggles or rocks back and forth. We considered placing a towel between the high chair and the "real" chair, but I felt it would compromise the safety of the high chair. Thus, I've resigned myself to sacrificing the chair underneath. That said, if you're considering buying this chair for long-term use, consider using it on an old chair that you don't care about keeping in good shape.
