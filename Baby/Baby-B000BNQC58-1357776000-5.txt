review/summary: More stars on ceiling than Brite Litesreview/text: Got this as a gift for a 5year old boy and absolutely loved it. My daughter has Brite Lites and in comparison I liked that this one had more brighter lights on the ceiling than the Brite Lites and that it's less fabric to spot clean. (less fabric to get dirty).
