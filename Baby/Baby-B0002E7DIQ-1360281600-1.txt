review/summary: Can't Sleep Without It!review/text: A friend suggested to my husband that he buy this for me. This has made my husband the best husband in the world because he did and now I can sleep! My hips ached terribly until I started using this pillow. I would frequently wake up in the middle of the night on my back and then be scared that I had done something to the baby. I can count on one hand the number of times I've woken up on my back using this pillow. It is so much better than a regular body pillow or one of those pillows that you can only use on one side. There's no fighting with the pillow in the middle of the night if you want to switch sides. You just turn over and use the other side. I also found with the cheap body pillow I was able to find at Target, all of the stuffing would shift and then all I'd have between my legs was just some fabric. It really didn't do any good.The only negative is that it is somewhat large. We have a king size bed so it's not an issue for us. Any smaller and I think my husband might have felt pushed out of bed a bit. But who cares about him anyways?I really think I might continue to use this pillow after I have the kid. It is so comfy!!!
