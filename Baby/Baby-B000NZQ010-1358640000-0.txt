review/summary: Great for 6moths all the way to 5year old siblingsreview/text: I have a 2year old boy and a 10month baby girl, they play with this toy together. The older boy steals it from her more than not but when they play together they love this toy. I Love that my kids can play with it even in low light because of the lights on this toy. My older boy has started to even mimic the -do, ra- sounds this toy makes. They both dance to the songs and there like 10 different toons so I don't get annoyed. I only don't like that an unstable walker can pull this thing down on themselves quickly and easy. My not quite yet walking 10month old baby girl stood with this toy and went backward with it and gave herself an actual black eye with the hand rail where she was hold it. I felt so bad for her because she had a hard slam backwards on the hardwood floor and also a hit to the right orbital socket that left her black, purple and blue for a week. She is a tough cookie so she was fine after some hugs and mommy time (like two days). I recommend this toy to all my friends with young kids.-RRK
