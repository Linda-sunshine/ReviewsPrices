review/summary: Great Buy!review/text: My mother bought this toy for my son when he was around 9 months old. He is now 18 months and still loves this toy! It is very durable, it stands up to him picking it up and throwing it on tile floors and him standing on it. He loves all the colors and music and has learned to identify the shapes provided by this toy. I have recommended it to numerous people!
