review/summary: Use your cell phonereview/text: I bought this and used it for two days. I found I was always forgetting to hit the button when I changed my daughter or fed her, or i would forget the timer in another room. They I found a free app for my cell phone and never looked back. There is so much more flexibility with the app I found and it was free. I always have my cell phone with me, it's a no-brainer. Too bad I didn't think things through before I purchased the timer. Oh well...
