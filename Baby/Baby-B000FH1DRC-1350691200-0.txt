review/summary: Great diapers, size does matterreview/text: I love these diapers! They have never leaked on me and the yellow strip is great for telling when my son needs a diaper change (for the times when it's not obvious). However, beware that once they are even a little too small the baby's "#2" comes out the back. I would therefore recommend going with a larger size if you are unsure.
