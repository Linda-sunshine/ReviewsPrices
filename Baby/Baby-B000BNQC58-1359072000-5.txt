review/summary: Good customer servicereview/text: As everyone else, we love the Twilight turtle. We switched to different LED light every night. Unfortunately, one of the LED light went out after 2 months. I contact the customer service and they provided some trouble shooting and then repair/replacement in a timely manner. Hope the next one can last for 3000 hours.
