review/summary: Lovely Glider that's NOT ESPRESSO!!!review/text: The only reason I didn't give this glider 5 stars is because of the misleading colour description. It isn't espresso at all more like a very dark cherry. I was kinda disappointed since all of the other furniture in my nursery is espresso ;-(After I got over (some what) my disappointment with the colour I was able to set it up out of the box (8+ months pregnant) as I was too excited to wait for my bf to get home. The set up was VERY simple and clear. It looks great, I really love this glider.
