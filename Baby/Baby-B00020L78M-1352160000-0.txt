review/summary: Very safe place for my baby!review/text: We bought this because we were looking for a safe place to put our baby. It is roomy and we have placed many of his toys inside so it is a nice play pen. There is no "door" in and out so sometimes bending over to grab him bothers my back but the purpose it serves is so needed so it is worth it. Great quality and portable for vacations.
