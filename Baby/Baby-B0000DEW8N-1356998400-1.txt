review/summary: Great buy (first time mom)!!review/text: This is a great product..simpleMy 18mo loves it and so do I. The best part of all is that the clean up is such a breeze. Even though its adjustable (which is great) I wasn't able to use it with my dining room chairs which sit quite low so my daughter can't pull up to the table like a big girl yet. I highly recommend this product!
