review/summary: My Wife Loves Itreview/text: My wife and I are having our first children (twins) and I was looking for something to make her more comfortable when she slept. After a week of using this pillow, my wife has slept much better. She doesn't wake up or turn as much in her sleep and she doesn't get back pain anymore. This pillow is big but it doesnt take up too much room in a queen size bed, there is still plenty of room for me to sleep. I would recommend this pillow to any mother-to-be or at least to their husband to get them one.
