review/summary: lots of funreview/text: When our son started to walk along the coffee table our friends suggested we purchase a walker to help him learn to walk. Toys R Us had a dismal selection, so I found this on Amazon. Our son immediately loved the telephone. It's just too bad the phone is not connected like some of the other pieces. The phone is now somewhere in the play room. He also immediately loved the flap that can be swung open or closed and the triangle/circle/square pieces he could detach. A few weeks later he was comfortable walking with it. Now he tries to push all the toys, even boxes and chairs. He LOVES this walker and it's been 2.5 months since we got it. It's light enough so when he pushes it into a corner, he can re-direct it in another direction.
