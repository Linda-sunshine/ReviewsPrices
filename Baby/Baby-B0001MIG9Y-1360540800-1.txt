review/summary: Love these diapers!review/text: Buying a huge box of Pampers diapers is totally worth it! Pampers Baby Dry are really absorbent for one thing and it beats always having to buy diapers at the grocery store frequently! When you use up the diapers, the sturdy box it came in proves to be very useful, too :-)
