review/summary: Great Diapersreview/text: I have a 7 week old son and these are the only diapers that will hold :everything&#34; in. We have tried using the Luv's brand, and the pampers. The pampers are completely unable to hold urine, my son peed out of everyone we put him in, and the Luv's brand will not hold on to his bottom very well, every time he pooped it leaked out of the diaper. These are the only brand my wide and I will use, the hold great and the wetness indicator is a life savor, especially if you have a child who hates to be wet.
