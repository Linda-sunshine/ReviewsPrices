review/summary: great diaperreview/text: no complaints about this diaper. we have used pampers and huggies, and huggies are terrible compared to these. They leak and are more flimsy so harder to get on a kicking baby! but the pampers fit well, are light and stiff enough that they are not a pain to get on.
