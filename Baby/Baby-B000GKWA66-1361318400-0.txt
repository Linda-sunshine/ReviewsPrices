review/summary: cute, too quite and a choking hazard!review/text: My toddler threw it accross the room and it landed on the hardwoods and the nob broke off. Thank goodness I was right there when it happened because my 6 month old could have gotten a hold of it and choked on it! It's the perfect choking size! I couldn't believe how easy it broke off. I wrote the company to let them know so hopefully they can change the design, I have not heard back from them.Other than it being a choking hazard, it's a cute stuffed animal...the sound machine is very quite, so probably not the best for white noise
