review/summary: Decent, useful, appropriately pricedreview/text: I did a ton of research on play yards and this one came out on top when it came to value and utility. Plus? COLORS!It's quick and easy to fold up, set up, rearrange and move around. We have used it outdoors for 2 weeks of camping, then rinsed it off and brought it in to contain the little one in the living room.Each panel is light-weight, so at a year old we're finding our kid can drag it and escape if she puts her mind to it. (We don't have it configured as a closed play yard at the moment - just using 4 panels straight across the door.)NOTE: With the way the panels are designed, you can only make enclosed spaces with an even number of panels - 4, 6, 8. Of course, there are work-arounds when you find yourself wanting to close in the kiddo with 5 panels...It has pinched me several times, so watch your hands.This play yard is worth the price, but I wouldn't pay more.
