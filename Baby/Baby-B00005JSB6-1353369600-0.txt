review/summary: Faulty batch of diapersreview/text: We have been ordering diapers for over a year. The current boxes we are using have has over a dozen diapers with missing tabs. The latest package had 4 diapers in a row missing a tab. I realize this is a better price than we can purchase the diapers in the store, but I have come to expect a high level of quality from Amazon that is missing from this purchase. We will be closely monitoring our next shipment and it is this poor again, we will be canceling our order. With 2 kids in diapers this is a HUGE deal!
