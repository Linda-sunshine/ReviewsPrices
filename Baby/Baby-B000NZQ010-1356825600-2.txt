review/summary: Exactly what we were looking forreview/text: Purchased for my 7 month old who constantly is pulling herself up. She likes sitting on the ground and playing with it, loves to climb up the front and play with it just as much. She doesn't push it around yet but as soon as she wants to walk I imagine she will love it even more. It also entertains my 2 year old:) even though he likes more complex toys as well, he is still entertained by playing the keys at the bottom and loves to play with the phone. All around this toy is exactly what I was hoping for and I am so happy both my kids are enjoying it!
