review/summary: AWFUL!!!review/text: THESE DIAPERS ARE HORRIBLE. I ALWAYS BUY THE PAMPERS CRUISERS BUT SINCE THE STORE WAS OUT OF STOCK I THOUGHT PAMPERS MAKES THESE AS WELL SO THEY MUST BE GOOD AS WELL. WELL I WAS WRONG MY DAUGHTER WEARS THEM FOR HALF AN HOUR AND HER PEE PASSES THROUGH THE DIAPER. THEY SHOULD MAKE IT TO AN HOUR AT LEAST. ONE PEE AND I HAVE TO CHANGE HER DIAPER. HORRIBLE I CAN'T BELIEVE PAMPERS MAKES THESE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE DIAPERS!!!
