review/summary: Good alternative to a large highchairreview/text: For the price, this is a great alternative to a traditional high chair. We don't have a lot of space and didn't want a large highchair taking over the kitchen. The chair is easy to attach securely and simple to use (and clean). My 6 month old isn't a great sitter yet, and he needs a rolled up towel to keep him from sliding down, so I don't recommend the chair for babies that aren't sitting well on their own. Overall though it's a great chair and I'm glad I didn't spend the money on a traditional highchair.
