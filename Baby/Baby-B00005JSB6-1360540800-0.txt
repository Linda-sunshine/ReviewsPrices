review/summary: Leak, leak, leak!review/text: I don't know what has happened, but ever since I switched my 2 year old son to size 6; he leaks through almost every night! I have been a Huggies fan for all my children, but now I'm thinking I should try something new. I thought that perhaps he was just urinating too much, but when I took it off there wasn't really that much there...not enough to leak like it did. He still sleeps with us and I'm tired of constantly waking up next to a pee spot! Maybe it's a bad batch...who knows.
