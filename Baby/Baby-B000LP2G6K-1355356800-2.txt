review/summary: Awesome for a boy!review/text: This pack-n-play is AWESOME for our son! NOT only did we use it when he was first born, but we also use it now that he is moving around a lot and crawling as a place for us to put him while we get ready in the morning if one of us is not on the bed with him! He loves it and so do we ! Thanks!
