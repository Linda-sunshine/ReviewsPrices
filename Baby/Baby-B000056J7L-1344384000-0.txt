review/summary: Uncomfortable!review/text: I used this with my son, and it served it's purpose. The only problem is that its really uncomfortable. He complained about it, and my daughter absolutely refuses to sit on it for more than a second and complains that it hurts as well. So while this may be a good product, it just doesn't work for my children. If you want something comfortable on the heiny, this is not the one. Back to the drawing board...
