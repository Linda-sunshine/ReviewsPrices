review/summary: Not for tall peoplereview/text: I am 5'8 and this pillow was not long enough to go under my head, between my knees, and under my belly. I was also very disappointed with the softness. This is a hard and scratchy pillow. It is also pretty thick, my head was up too high to be comfortable. I normally sleep on a goose feather pillow, so I prefer softness. I was in so much pain when I finally got out of bed after using the snoogle total body pillow. I returned it. I was very hopeful that this pillow would give me a good night sleep, since I haven't been sleeping well since week 16 of my pregnancy. Very disappointed.
