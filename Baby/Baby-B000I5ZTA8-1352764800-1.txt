review/summary: Just what I needed! Convenient, but can get a little itchy.review/text: Starting at around my 6-month mark, my belly was getting a bit heavy. I've been trying to still do some exercise once a week, and was startled to find quite a bit of bouncing!I needed some extra support, and found that the Mini Cradle did the trick! It's convenient because it's relatively small, and it's easy to carry in my purse if I feel like taking it off/putting it on. I also like that it uses a hook-and-eye closure rather than velcro...makes it a tad less embarrassing when I want to just discreetly take it off at my cube at work, plus it won't snag on clothes! :)The construction of the belt is such that it's an extra-wide piece of elastic with hook and eye closures. This means that it stretches out a little bit over time, and can get a little bit itchy by end of day because of the lightly ribbed texture. I know some folks wear the band to sleep, but I only wear it during the day because it gets a bit itchy. I try to wash it regularly to keep it from accumulating sweat, etc.Overall, a great product. I didn't want to buy anything that looked like a harness, as convenience was key. I got a small and it worked just fine for me. I'm 5'6&#34;, size 4 pre-pregnancy, size 6-8 in third trimester of pregnancy.
