review/summary: Great for play tooreview/text: Love this chair. Before our daughter started solids, we actually began using it as a seat to sit up and play in on the floor, to have her near when we ate, or for her to get a new perspective when playing under the hanging toys of her activity mat and when wanted to sit up more (instead of getting the Bumbo chair). Now we use it for its intended purpose and it's nice and compact to take to restaurants. Also, love that is not a huge eyesore that takes up too much space.
