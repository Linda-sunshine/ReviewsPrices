review/summary: Every baby should have one of these!review/text: This is by far the best toy I found for our son. The many loops help develop hand coordination and using both hands to bring the toy to midline. It is easy for them to grab and light enough where they can play with in on their backs or tummy. It can also be placed in the fridge and then be used as a teether. While we don't do that, our some is always chewing on it and it is the best teether toy we found for him. I was put off a bit by the price but it is well worth it. Every baby should have one!
