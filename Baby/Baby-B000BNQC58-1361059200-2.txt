review/summary: Very helpfulreview/text: I bought this for my 5 year old son. He was always afraid of the dark, and would always need the hall light on in order to go to sleep. As soon as he got this, he allowed me to turn the hall light off and slept with this on every night for about 2 months, and now he will go to bed with no lights at all. I also like that this goes off after a certain amount of time as to not waste the batteries.
