review/summary: Perfect booster chairreview/text: This booster is perfect. It cleans easily, 6 month (now 9 month) baby loves it. This chair travels well but it also used everyday at grandma's house. I spent hours trying to be sure I bought something that baby would be comfortable in, but was also easy to clean and use. This chair is perfect! There is no cloth to need to wash, it wipes down easily. The best part, you can't beat the price!
