review/summary: Bought one of these for each of my 8 nephews and nieces (just change the batteries with in the first month)review/text: The kids love these no matter what age from a few months old to 10 years old. The only thing I would advise is to change the batteries before giving the gift. After about a month of every night use some of the lights stopped working. We thought that the light burnt out since the other 2 lights still were working. I decided to change the batteries just to see and discovered that was the issue. Great night light!
