review/summary: Love it...review/text: This was a great buy and I am so happy we purchased it. We keep it in the living room for our grandson so we do not have to go upstairs every time he needs changed or I need to do something. It folds up easily and I love the wheels so I can push it instead of carry it when it needs moved. The only recommendation would be that the topper be able to adjust as my grandson was able to pull himself up on the sides way too soon, so we removed it and just use it as a playpen.
