review/summary: Great toy for infant getting close to walking.review/text: My 9 month old loves this toy. She is standing on her own when holding on to things so this toy is perfect for her. She loves all of the sounds and lights on the toy and she gets a kick out of being able to hold on to the handle and stand up. This has quickly become her favorite toy.
