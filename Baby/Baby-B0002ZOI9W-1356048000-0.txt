review/summary: Happy baby, happy parentsreview/text: Assembly went smoothly (15-20 mins), but you need a screwdriver in order to do the job.The rocker is so nicely balanced that even the slightest movement of the baby (currently 2 1/2 months old) will cause the chair to rock, so it acts like a self-soothing mechanism: baby gets agitated, chair starts rocking, baby calms down.The vibration unit is very power efficient. 1 D size battery lasted for a month of daily use, before we had to change it.The static position of the chair is convenient for feeding or longer naps.The whole thing is very lightweight, so you can easily move it around the house.Toy bar looks nice, but our baby is not into toys yet.
