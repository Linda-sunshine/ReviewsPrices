review/summary: Great for stairs.review/text: I bought one of these for the top of my stairwell and one for the bottom. They have been great. We have the tension adjusted really snugly and chose to not add the additional screws. No screws in our walls or bannister!-It should be noted that the manufacturer recommends securing with screws even after fitting to the wall. I thought the bar across the bottom would really annoy me, but we adjusted to that quickly. Plus if you want a tension gate the bar is unavoidable. My toddler son pulls on these all the time and they never budge. The actual opening is a bit small if you are walking through with a laundry basket (or carrying a child). Also, we have trim on the bottom on the wall side so the top had to be a bit wider than the bottom and these allowed us to adjust for that. These have been in use for almost a year and we are very happy with them.
