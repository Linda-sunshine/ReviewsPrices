review/summary: Tried every other brand possible!review/text: We tried generic, brand name and in between... We even cloth diapered. The problem we ran into was our children's sensitive skin, and also the leakage factor. Huggies are gentle on their skin. They are also amazing at holding in leaks. We change our babies diapers frequently, but some diapers just SUCK. They pee once and BAM a leak. With Huggies, when they pee once, you can't really tell they peed. They are super absorbent. And as far as price, if you buy the 192 pack online with the coupon and subscribe and save, they are amazingly cheap! So yeah, we love them.
