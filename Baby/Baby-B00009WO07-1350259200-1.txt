review/summary: Horrible - how does anyone use these???review/text: I assumed since these are a well-known brand, that they would work well. They are the worst diapers I have ever used - pee leaks stright through them, ie if you don't change the baby pretty often, their clothes will be soaked more than once a day. How am I going to use up these 200+ diapers? Ugh.
