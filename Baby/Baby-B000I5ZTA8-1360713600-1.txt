review/summary: Poor design, poor supportreview/text: The sizing for this belt is pretty ridiculous, there are only three options to adjust it, so you just have to hope that one of those options will fit, but being pregnant your belly is constantly growing so this is very limiting. Also, the support is very light, I am on my feet a lot at work and needed much more support than this belt offers and I am only 23 weeks.
