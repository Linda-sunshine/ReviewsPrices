review/summary: at first liked it, but shrank a lotreview/text: I used the Moby wrap a lot. My daughter hated it first but after trying it out at home a few times and getting used to how to wrap it, she liked it and it was quite handy. A lot of times I would wrap it at home and just leave it on. It also took some time to get used to putting the baby in and out. I only used the cross wrap where she faced me or faced away from me. But after a few washes (according to instructions) it shrank to the point I could not wrap that thing around me and tie it. I am 5'6 and 140lb. Also, my daughter was growing incredibly fast and my back always hurt.I don't think the back problem was due to the wrap though. At 22lb I had to stop using it. It was just getting to heavy. I don't know if a different carrier would have been better. expecting number two I think I will try a different one.
