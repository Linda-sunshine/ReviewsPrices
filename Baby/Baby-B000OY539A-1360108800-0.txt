review/summary: tricky at first, a breeze at second...review/text: yes, it's more fabric than you can imagine (but manageable!), and it takes practice but my baby is so content in this wrap that I wear it around the house regularly.**TIP: When going out, wear the wrap before you get into the car. That way when you get to your destination, all you have to do is tuck Baby into place. Trust me, it sure beats struggling to tie a wrap in a parking lot or if you're caught in yucky weather.
