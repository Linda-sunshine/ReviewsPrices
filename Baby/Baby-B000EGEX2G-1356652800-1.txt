review/summary: Comfy and cutereview/text: I love the glider and the ottoman. Took vey little effort to assemble, except that two of the snaps on the left arm cover were warped. My husband drilled and attached them with screws so I could use it right away. Funny instructions on the arms, as the right arm was labeled as left, and left arm was labeled as right. Obvious with the assembly though. Getting lots of compliments on it, and most people want to sit in it as opposed to the sofa or loveseat!
