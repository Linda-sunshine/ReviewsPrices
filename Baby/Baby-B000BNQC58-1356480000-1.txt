review/summary: The Perfect Gift for a toddler!!review/text: I bought the turtle for my 3 year old grandson for Christmas Eve. He just LOVES it!! He carried it around all evening and was fascinated by the stars and moon projection and being able to change the colors. My son, his dad, told me that he actually went to sleep looking at the stars and listening to the soft music.
