review/summary: Most Used Baby Itemreview/text: I read a ton of reviews on baby carriers while I was setting up my registry. I wasn't quite sure how much I would use it, but decided I would rather have it in case I needed it. My hubby and I struggled with our little one for a few days after bringing her home from the hospital, she wouldn't calm down, she wouldn't sleep etc. One night, I thought to try the K'tan and within 5 minutes she was quiet, calm, and on her way to sleeping.If you've read "Happiest Baby on the Block" I think that the Baby K'tan is the ESSENTIAL element to getting baby to calm down, relax, and even sleep (as a part of the 5 S Approach). My baby is now 6 weeks old, and we have literally used it multiple times a day since we brought her home. It is an ESSENTIAL item for us, and we have turned the car around to get it when we've left home without it.It's easy to put baby in, easy to clean, and it grows as baby grows with all the different positions. I would highly recommend this as a purchase for you or someone you know. It allowed my baby to relax, and it gave me my arms back! It's great to be close to baby, but still be able to get things done.Can't say it enough, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product. We're getting a second one for my hubby to use as well. BUY IT!!!
