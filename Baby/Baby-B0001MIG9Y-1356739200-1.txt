review/summary: They do the jobreview/text: These are adequately absorbent, no offensive scents from the diaper material (before being used). Easy to use restickable tape. I have used these diapers in varying sizes since day one without any problems (except that they cannot handle all the urine of a 2 year old overnight). I never had rash problems that I can attribute to these diapers.
