review/summary: Great Support!review/text: Had the one from Boppy but had to return it. This gives BETTER support and I like the small band. I am 7 months pregnant and 167lbs. I use it on the middle setting, however I've used it on the last setting before. I could go a bit smaller for more support so I will have my friend remove the first (loosest) setting which I've NEVER used and re-sew it on so I can use it tighter. Not sure if I will need to go tighter but I can imagine as I get bigger, I will need more support. All in all, it's a great price, great value and great product! Would recommend to all pregnant women!! The support feels great.
