review/summary: Good name started producing bad qualityreview/text: I had been a fan of Pamers brand since my baby was a just a day older. I loved pamper's Cruiser but Baby Dry no longer keeps the baby dry. It gets saturated very quickly and sometimes leaks. With Pamper's Baby Dry diapers, you will have to change diapers very frequently (on an average every 3 to 4 hours) as it will hold just one pee then start to sag. It is cheaper for more diapers and I thought it was a good deal but you get what you paid for. I don't understand why so good quality name Pamper brand started producing so poor quality product. I am no longer ordering this product.
