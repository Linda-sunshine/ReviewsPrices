review/summary: Girlfriend loves itreview/text: My girlfriend loves having glowing stars on the ceiling while we're going to sleep, and I'll admit that I find it pretty cute myself. One feature we really like is the automatic shutdown (I think it's after 45 minutes) because we don't want to forget to turn it off and drain the battery. The light source looks to be a high power LED, meaning the batteries ought to last a long time, which we like. I threw in some rechargables, and between that and the energy efficient LED, all the headache of battery replacement is pretty much removed from my life. I'm quite pleased with this purchase; price was very reasonable for the quality of the item. The turtle is cute too.
