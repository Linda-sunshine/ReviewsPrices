review/summary: Awkward contraptionreview/text: I read a few dozen reviews before purchasing this item and thought it would work for me, but I was wrong. There's nothing really wrong with this carrier, it's just a matter of preference. I like having a carrier that I can adjust to fit me just right; this type of carrier does take some getting use to, but it's something that you have to fit into, not the other way around. My boyfriend is tall and thin, whereas I am average height and curvy so the carrier will either work for him and not for me or visa versa. It seemed very well made, and could be a great carrier for someone who started off with a wrap like carrier.
