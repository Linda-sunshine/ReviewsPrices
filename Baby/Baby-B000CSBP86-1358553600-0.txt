review/summary: Triplet mom says YES to this product!review/text: I have triplets who are now 6 months old. I have used the Baby Bjorn since bringing them home. I actually own 3 of them! It is safer and easier than pushing my super heavy seven foot stroller around. It also allows me some one on one time with each baby. Thanks for a great product!
