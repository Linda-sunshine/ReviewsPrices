review/summary: cute and functionalreview/text: Sound machine AND adorable stuffed animal in one? Win-win. I love that the sound machine is removable for travel, because the sheep is pretty big. I don't use it all the time, and didn't even get it until my daughter was 3 and 1/2 months old, but it helps when she's worked up and fussy around bedtime ("overstimulated" would probably be the technical term). I imagine it would have helped her fall back asleep after eating in the middle of the night back when she was still doing that. I like giving baby gifts that are cute and practical, and this definitely fits the bill.
