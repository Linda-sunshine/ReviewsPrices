review/summary: Great Pregnancy Pillow so far!review/text: I love this pillow for sleeping comfortable while pregnant! It relieves pressure off of your back and stomach when placing one arm and leg under and one on top while holding it. It is pretty large though; I sleep in a queen sized bed with my husband and am thankful we are both fairly thin, or else I do not think we would fit with this huge pillow. The only negative is that the cover is not the easiest to get on and off to wash. I am not showing a whole lot yet, so when I get bigger I hope the pillow will be just as comfortable!
