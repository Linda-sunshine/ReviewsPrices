review/summary: A little on the small sidereview/text: I purchased this for my grandson to use when he visits. It's okay when using it for a small child, but as he has grown, we find that it is a little snug and he is small for his age at 2 1/2. The concept is great and stores compactly. I think it would be great when travelling or when going out to eat. It's certainly more sanitary to place your child in this seat and use the attachable tray, rather than placing him in a restaurant supplied highchair or booster seat and using the common table. Even with the chair being a little on the small side, I would definitely advise purchasing this chair for the occasional use.
