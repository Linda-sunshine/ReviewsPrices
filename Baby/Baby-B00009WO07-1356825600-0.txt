review/summary: Smells like peereview/text: If you like smelling pee all day long, buy these diapers. Don't get me wrong, I love pampers. I love Pampers swaddlers. We have been huge fans since day one in the NICU with the micro preemie pampers that were smaller than a credit card and still too big.Yes, these hold in the pee but good lord you smell it. With technology in diapers, spend a few more dollars and go with the swaddlers. If you buy them on amazon with the prime membership you'll get a better deal.
