review/summary: Cutereview/text: Works exactly as expected. No zipper problems, have been using for a few months now. I got a large which was a little big for my 9 month old. I find the sizes to be true to the weight recommendations, I order up based on reviews but a medium would have been better. He also has club feet and his special shoes fit perfectly inside no problems.
