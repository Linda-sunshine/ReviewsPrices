review/summary: Great &#34;bug&#34;review/text: I got this for my son because his friend stayed the night (toddlers) and she had one but it was the red ladybug, he absoultly loved it and it was hard for him to &#34;share&#34; with her even though it was her bug... so we put it up high so they could see the stars and moon... I like the lady bug bc he can say bug, and this color came out and so we got it for xmas, never had any problems, great twilight bug, best one out there
