review/summary: Third time's the charm?review/text: We sent the first chair back because of a crack in the wood we were worried might affect the structural integrity. We sent the replacement back because it looked like the package had been dropped and the ottoman was cracked nearly in half. You can imagine we inspected the third chair pretty thoroughly - there are a couple of minor cracks but it doesn't look like the structural integrity will be compromised so we kept it.Now about the chair!Aside from all the complications to finally get one here that seems structurally sound, I do not regret this purchase. I am 6 months pregnant (glad I ordered before baby arrived!) and we put the chair together in about 15 minutes. The instructions aren't perfectly clear about everything but they are very simple. I had read many reviews but I didn't have a lot of the problems others have mentioned:Some people have complained that the back cushion is low or doesn't support their head. I am 5' 7&#34; and my husband is 6' tall and we both found the back of the chair very comfortable. Perhaps this is because we fastened the back cushion to the top of the chair instead of only the back poles, so it can't slip down. Perhaps it's because we have only sat in the chair for a short while. But we like it.Some people have complained that the arm rests do not snap on. We did have trouble getting them to snap but we got all the snaps secured.Some people have complained that the seat cushion is not thick enough. I have only had my chair for a few hours but I find the seat cushion is very nice. I am 157 lbs (at 6 months pregnant) but if it does get uncomfortable over time or as my weight increases I will probably put another cushion on top or something. Right now, it feels great.The rocking motion is smooth and all feels great so far. If I remember to go back and edit my review in 6 months or so, I'll try to let you know if I ever had squeaking issues (as many people have).
