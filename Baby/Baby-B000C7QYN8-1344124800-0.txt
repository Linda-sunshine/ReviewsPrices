review/summary: Sponsored by Lorax = higher price - Used to be better & less moneyreview/text: When we first started getting these were a great deal and were fine for our son. The changes in packaging & size didn't get us upset (except when they removed the indicator as to which side you should pull the tab from). Recently they started putting a "approved by the Lorax" on the packaging. Apparently this is justification for a 50% increase in price! Subscribe & save went from $22-$31 for the same size pack. Time to try some alternatives - 1st stop Pampers Sensitive!
