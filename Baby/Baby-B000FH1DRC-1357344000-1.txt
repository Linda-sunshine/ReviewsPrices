review/summary: Best value out therereview/text: Buying this item with Amazon Prime/Mom with Subscribe & Save is the best deal out there. Saves a lot of money and I always have plenty of diapers available.The diapers are also very high quality, and the strip that shows wetness is a huge plus. From what I've seen from friends babies and how much trouble they've had with generic or lower-quality diapers, its worth it to get the good stuff, and Amazon helps make it easy to afford.
