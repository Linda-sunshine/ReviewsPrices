review/summary: Fundamental FLAWreview/text: FLAWED.As a number of other reviewers have noted, there exists a fundamental flaw in this product's execution: the sound _SUDDENLY_ cuts out after the timed period. This can abrogate any beneficial effects the soothing put-down sounds have had, raising your child from the state of sleep they managed to reach.All it needs is a min or two long volume fade down in order for this to be a great product, rather than the sadly missed mark that it is.I emailed them in the hopes they might forward on the device's plans such that we could do a quick DIY hack on it to introduce our own fader, but they didn't address the question, instead choosing to advertised future products. Disappointing.I like(d) it, but then have to be grumpy about it. Oh well. Perhaps it teaches our child to deal with the sudden removal of nice things, a bit like life, like expectations (ahem, case in point).
