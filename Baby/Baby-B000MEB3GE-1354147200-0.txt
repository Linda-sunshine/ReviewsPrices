review/summary: great for moms and dadsreview/text: I had seen another friend with one of this with her first and decided to try it myself. I didn't get it out until about week 2 or 3 though and I wish I would have sooner. It allowed me to track how long my baby was feeding for and how long inbetween. I like the other timer features as well, but the feeding one is so heplful. My husband is always shocked when I've said how long it's been between, he just doesn't realize how much times passes. It's nice to not have to write it down, but to have everything tracking by the push of a button.
