review/summary: Pampers - gentle and easyreview/text: These diapers were recommended by all our friends with babies. They were also used by the hospital where my baby was born. They are very gentle on the skin and easy for parents to use. The extra frills around the thighs give added protection. The stickers are strong and keep the diaper in place. Also they work well after removing the stickers and placing them multiple times. Love them.
