review/summary: Almost perfectreview/text: The pillow is great to help me stay on my side, especially when I flip over in my sleep. It is big, so if you don't have at least a queen size bed, your significant other will need to sleep on the couch :). The seam at the inside of the curve is pulled too tight and can be harsh on the neck, but I find that if I just slide down a little, it doesn't bother me too much. I would definitely recommend this pillow for any pregnant woman.
