review/summary: Huggies not my favoritereview/text: I worry about cost of baby products just like every other parent so when I received a coupon that would make the Huggies diapers the same prices as Luvs, I thought I would give it a shot. I will not be purchasing them again. They did their job, no pee pee leaks or poop explosions but the diaper was thick it was hard to feel if it was wet or dirty. LUVS does a great job, a little cheaper and you can feel if there is a little prize inside.
