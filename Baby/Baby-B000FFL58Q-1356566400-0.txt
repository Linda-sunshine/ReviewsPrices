review/summary: OMG!!!review/text: I bought this because of the postive reviews. I would give it a 10 star. When our granddaughter was placed on the quilt under the arbor she immediately responded with smiles , movement, and sounds. Our daughter and son-in-law were thrilled to see her enjoyment and interactivity. Plus the little one is entertained while Mom or Dad is cooking, but not too far away that they can't watch her and respond if needed. Definitely encourages movement and interaction.l
