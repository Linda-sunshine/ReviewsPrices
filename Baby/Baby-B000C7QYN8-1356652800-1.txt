review/summary: Great wipes!review/text: These are the only wipes that do not irritate my baby's skin or leave a sticky residue. The reason I did not give these all 5 stars, is that the size of the wipe is small. It sometimes takes me several wipes to do the job. This is a small annoyance, and does not keep me from making these the only baby wipes I use.
