review/summary: Awesome!review/text: We have purchased two of these after one was given to a friend (we didn't think we'd have more kids!) and both times our babies have been completely mesmerized. They love the songs, all f the activities and it is very durable. I also really like that the front plate is detachable so you can take it on a car ride. Assembly (and dis-assembly) are very easy so if you want to take it apart and pack it in your luggage to go on a trip, you can-- we've done it! The only down side is that the phone isn't really attached and it is super easy to lose. I wish it was on a cord like the shapes at the top.
