review/summary: Twilight Ladybugreview/text: I bought mine for my grandaughter and she loves it, she didn't like to sleep by herself at nite and since she has a Ladybug she loves to sleep by herself.its not as big as i would have thought (about 12 &#34;) but perfect in every way for her. comes with batteries we tried it out right away when we got it in the mail
