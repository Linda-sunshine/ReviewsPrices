review/summary: Great Night Lightreview/text: My daughter has a couple of these and loves them. She loves pushing the button to turn them on, and then pushing the other buttons to choose the color of light each night at bedtime. I know some others have said that the lights burned out not long after purchase, however I have not found this to be the case with ours. We have had both of ours for over a year, and they get used every night. We have only changed the batteries twice. Maybe the others got defective items. I would recommend these cute little critters to anyone.
