review/summary: A huge improvementreview/text: I've been using this thing for almost a week and LOVE it! It's made such a difference. Before I used to sleep between two rows of two pillows (five pillows total, counting the one under my head). It was pretty ridiculous...too many moving parts. This is a way better system. I like that it keeps you upright and makes it harder to roll over onto your back in your sleep. I usually tuck a firm tempurpedic-type pillow between my back and the inner back of the pillow to keep me even more upright as well. I see what people were saying about the shoulder seem. They should definitely fix that, but I have been able to overcome that without too much trouble.
