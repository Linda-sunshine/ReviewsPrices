review/summary: really helped with my pregnancy precipitated inguinal herniareview/text: I wore the prenatal mini cradle low on my hips to keep a pregnancy precipitated inguinal hernia from causing pain. It worked really well. As long as I took it off to sit down I didn't have any problems with comfort. When I first got the mini cradle, I was a bit horrified that I could only wear it on the largest of the adjustable eyelet setting (I was 120 Lb at the time and I think I was 34 weeks pregnant). I later realised that it needs to be tight to be effective so it was OK and I'm glad I bought the petite size - it took me though to the end of my pregnancy. The design could be improved by having more eyelets for adjustable sizing.
