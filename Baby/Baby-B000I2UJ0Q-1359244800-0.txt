review/summary: Very good Jumperoo for the price.review/text: Our child loved this from a very young age. Some days he would bounce himself to sleep from excitement. The adjustable straps work well for changing as your baby grows taller. Having the removable and machine washable seat is nice and the rest of it wipes up very well with cleaning wipes. It doesn't travel very well, but does collapse a bit for moving it.
