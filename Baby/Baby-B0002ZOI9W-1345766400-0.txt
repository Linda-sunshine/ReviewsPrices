review/summary: Great for my infant and my 2.5 y.o.review/text: We purchased this chair to use on vacation with family so we didn't have to ship our bouncy chair out and back. Now I wish we had this one at home. It's great! Not only was it comfortable for our infant (3 months), but my 2.5 year old took a nap in it too! There's definitely value in something both my kids can use.
