review/summary: The wetness indicator is worth itreview/text: These are the best diapers we have tried for baby daughter (8 months now...they grow so fast ! :D).The wetness indicator is real help and the Amazon discounts make them the same price or cheaper than some of the other big brands and/or even the budget brands.
