review/summary: good deal, good productreview/text: I love the seventh generation wipes- good density in the wipe and plenty of cleaning fluid to work. Never irritated my son's skin and I feel secure that the wipes are safe for him and the environment. I also was able to get this box of 350 count for around 11 dollars which is a snapping deal. I particularly like that they come in packs of 70 wipes so that the packs can be used without drying out straight from their resealable top.
