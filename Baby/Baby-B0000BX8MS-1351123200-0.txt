review/summary: Snugglyreview/text: We ordered this and another microfleece sleep sack because our "little" guy had outgrown the size "small" one he had pretty quickly. I ordered XL, thinking it'd give him plenty of time to grow into it. But the XL was actually very large, too large for our 5 month old -- even though his weight did fall within the described range (he was about 21 pounds at the time I bought this). I returned the XL for a smaller size, which fits perfectly (although it seems in another month he could need the next size up if his growth doesn't slow down!) The product itself was perfect, just too long for him.
