review/summary: Large & Well Madereview/text: So the only reason they are not getting a perfect 5 is for the clips only, I used a command hook instead then decided to just use a wire tie my 4yr old has a lot of stuffed animals BIG & Small it holds them all it will probably stretch this thing out over time as she adds to her collection but we are glad re ignored some of the reviews and purchased anyway, We are glad we bought this and it looks neat hanging up.
