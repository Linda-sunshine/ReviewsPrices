review/summary: Useful itemreview/text: This is great. Comes with a book that shows different holds for different ages. Also contains reminders for safety on each section so that you can always double check baby is held in the best possible way. Comfortable although I haven't used for extended periods yet, so not too sure how mu back would feel after that. That said it is great to hold the little one in when I have things to do and she doesn't want to be on her own. It means less crying, more contented baby and more accomplished. Such a great thing to have. Easy to carry as well, can be put in the included pouch and carried in the diaper bag until needed. Only thing let to add is that I am quite large breasted and she protrudes further from my chest when I use it compared with when her father uses it, but that's personal and to be expected I guess. Looking forward to using this product as my little one grows.
