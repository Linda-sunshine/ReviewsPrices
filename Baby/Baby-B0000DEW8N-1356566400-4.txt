review/summary: Good quality and pricereview/text: Needed a temporary solution for toddler without a high chair. This booster fit the bill. It is sturdy and the straps keep the booster very secure on the chair. The main tray snaps in securely but there is a removable second tray. The idea is to be able to take off easily to wash but it is also easily removed by toddler when food is on it. If the 2nd tray was more secure, I would give 5 stars but still a good purchase and would recommend.
