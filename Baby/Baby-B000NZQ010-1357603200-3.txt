review/summary: Wonderfulreview/text: Bought for my 9 month old son for Christmas. He loved it the first time he saw it. It makes a lot of noise but there is a volume for low and high. The back wheels also adjust so that when toddlers are standing behind it, it will not just roll away fast. He is just learning to walk and loves to stand and walk around it in circles because he can balance on it well. At times it can be a little overwhelming with the music and sounds, but it was a wonderful gift for my son's first Christmas
