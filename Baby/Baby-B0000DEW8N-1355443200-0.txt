review/summary: We love this booster seat!review/text: We loved this booster seat so much we bought a second one for our second child. It is easy to snap on to any seat available, and super easy to clean. We have put our 5 month old in it a few times, and she is easily supported by the back and tray to sit up in the seat for a few minutes at a time. We love that we don't have to lug around a big, bulky high chair, as we don't have much floor space in our dining area, so a booster seat was a great option for us! Definitely recommend this seat to anyone wanting to save some floor space!
