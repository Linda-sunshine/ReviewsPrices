review/summary: Great quality at a great pricereview/text: We use Subscribe and Save to purchase our baby's diapers. What a great service! The price is very competitive, and usually beats the local store prices (even with coupons). We use the Pampers brand because they absorb well -our baby is a heavy wetter. We also collect the Pampers Gifts to Grow points and redeem them when we have enough.
