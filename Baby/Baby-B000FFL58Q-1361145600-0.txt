review/summary: Not sturdyreview/text: I am disappointed with this product. I put it together and I have to say, it's not a sturdy gym. I worry that one good tug will send the entire thing crashing down. The pieces do &#34;click&#34; together and slide into the fabric slots but it has come apart when pressure was applied (by me) to test it. The fabric is nice but I wouldn't recommend it.
