review/summary: Takes to long to put on properly.review/text: I am college educated but when it came to this wrap I felt pretty dumb. It would take me forever to put on just right. It was either to tight or to loose. With a crying baby and needing to get something done, this just was not the wrap for me. I used it maybe twice. I heard great things about this wrap, but sadly it just wasn't the one for me.
