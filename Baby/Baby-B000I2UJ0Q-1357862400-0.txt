review/summary: I wish I bought this sooner!review/text: Got this for my 6 month old twins. May have to buy a second one. This is their favorite toy bar none! They will spent several hours a day in this. It was super easy to assemble, took me about 20 minutes by myself, I am not the most technical person around so it may take others less time. I also like the fact that it can fold up for storage, however this jumper gets so much play time, I have yet to bother to put it away.
