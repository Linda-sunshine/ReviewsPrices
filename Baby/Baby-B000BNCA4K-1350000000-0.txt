review/summary: awesome toy for babies learning hand coordination!review/text: I bought this toy for my little guy, as he was needing more simulation. Most toys were too heavy for his little hands, or he would involuntarily hit himself in the face and would cry. BUT this toy is awesome, its the first toy that he loved! Several places for him to easily grab, super light weight, he loves to chew on it, and it is soft, so it doesn't hurt when he hits himself in the head or face. Great toy for babies learning to grab and hold on to things.
