review/summary: Soft, soothing....sleepreview/text: We received the Sleep Sheep at our baby's shower and once our little guy arrived we quickly learned why this product is so highly rated -- it works! The Sleep Sheep is so soft to the touch and plays four different sounds (heartbeat, rain, ocean, whales) on a timer with a wide range of volume control. It has a strong (and long) velcro strap that allows it to be hung from a crib, portable crib, automobile headrest. We were able to attach it to our handmade cradle. We preferred the rain and ocean waves sounds -- both are very soothing and gentle -- and would sometimes play the whales sound, which kinda mimics human voices in the rise and fall of sound. I thought the heartbeat was a little creepy so we never played that. The Sleep Sheep became our go-to noise machine and our little one often fell asleep to its gentle sounds.My one complaint is that I wish the timer went longer than 45 minutes. I'm not sure if it's his natural sleep cycle or if it was influenced by the Sleep Sheep, but our little guy's cycle is 45 minutes and it seems like he would often wake up when the Sleep Sheep turned off.
