review/summary: Perfect for my son!!!!review/text: My 19 month old won't go to sleep without his &#34;sleep sack&#34;. As most kids his age - he won't keep a blanket on at night, and we keep our house fairly cool when we sleep. He loves it - the x-large fits him perfectly (with a little room at the feet) and he's over the 100% percentile for height. Happy sleeping - great buy!!!!!
