review/summary: Pretty, practical and pink...review/text: We purchased a Pack 'n Play for our granddaughter and she sleeps so well in it when she comes to visit us. It keeps her safe and comfy.I got the Camo Jane version for her to have at home and it was the perfect addition to their home, as well. Great size and so easy to put up and take down. Throw in the car, if you are going away for the weekend. Plus everything she owns seems to be pink and brown, just fits right in.
