review/summary: Great potty!review/text: My daughter loves this potty. She is 17 months and we are just starting to introduce her to the potty. It is sturdy and bright. She can sit in it for a while, even if sometimes she doesn't do anything in it :-) I just wish it had a lid, it would make it a little easier to keep her from throwing toys into it.
