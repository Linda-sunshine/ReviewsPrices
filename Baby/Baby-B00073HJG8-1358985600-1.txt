review/summary: Finally the &#34;stuffies&#34; are off the FLOORreview/text: My 9 year old is not ready to get rid of her stuffed animals. We hung this above her bed and she feels like she hasn't abandoned them. She picks one out now and again to sleep with. Her room is much tidier as well. Perfect solution to freeing up space in an organized cute way.
