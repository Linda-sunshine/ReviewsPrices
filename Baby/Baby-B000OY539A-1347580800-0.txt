review/summary: too much fabric!review/text: I spent a lot of time trying to decide on what carrier I wanted to use for when my son was born. I decided on this one mainly because it was cheaper than another style I was looking at yet it was still considered "safe" for baby (meaning: no problems with baby's hips when used correctly). I used this all of maybe 6 times. There is a lot fabric, it can be cumbersome. It's also hot and my son who weighed 8 lb 12 oz at birth never could fit comfortably in it. It was probably a user error but I never could get him adjusted correctly. It was either too loose and he would slide down or too tight. He did not enjoy this wrap and if he would let me carry him in it, he could take it for about an hour and no more than that. The idea of this is great, just not for us. I have since given it away to someone who loves Moby wraps. I have decided I am going to try a sling now to see how we fare.
