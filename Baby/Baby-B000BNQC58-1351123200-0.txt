review/summary: What's the purpose of this?review/text: I am not sure what the use of this is. ** It automatically turns off after 45 min. *** I am not sure about your child but a night light should be on all night. My son woke up in the middle of the night in a pitch black room frightened. I removed his regular night light thinking this would stay on all night. This isn't soft for him to cuddle and the night light turns off. I returned it.
