review/summary: Meets expectationsreview/text: We purchased this for our 16 month old. We had the three-in-one swing to toddler chair for our older children, but they stopped making it, so this was the next best thing. This chair has a very cute pattern and is a nice comfortable chair. Our child seems to really like sitting in it.
