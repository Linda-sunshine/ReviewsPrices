review/summary: Great Travel or Grandma's Housereview/text: We purchased this as an alternative to the two other high chairs we have to use when we travel to Grandparents/Family's house for parties, etc. It serves this purpose fantastically. The removable tray liner makes clean up super easy and the cover keeps it clean during travel and stoage.While it doesn't have any decorative covers or pretty patterns, that also leads to it's ability to be easily wiped clean and there are no nooks or crannies for crumbs or food to become stuck. That to me is a positive aspect of this. The other two high chairs we have both have the fabric covers and get dirty and gross pretty easy with a baby that loves to move while eating.It securely attaches to any chair we have found including folding chairs, and folds up into a very compact package so it doesn't take up much space while traveling.Overall we feel it was one of the better purchases we have made and if we didn't already have two other high chairs, it would be our primary choice!
