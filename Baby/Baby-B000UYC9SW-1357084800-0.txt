review/summary: Sizing is way off.review/text: According to Amazon and the K'tan website, a medium should have fit me well, and perhaps have been a bit on the small size. Instead, the medium was HUGE and unusable. I returned mine and am too leery of the weird sizing to purchase this in a small. I had really high hopes for this.
