review/summary: Great toy for experienced cruisersreview/text: My 8-month-old has been pulling up and cruising for about 2 months but she had mostly lost interest in trying to walk since she started crawling properly. Well, this walker seems to have changed that! She's only had it for a few days but she loves being able to get herself around on two feet and I've already seen a noticeable improvement in her balance and coordination. Now I'm scared she's going to be walking way before I'm ready!I do want to say that I don't think this is an appropriate toy for babies who are just learning to pull up, despite what the "sit-to-stand" name might suggest. It's sturdy but if a baby pulled straight up on it with all of their weight (as they tend to do in the beginning), it would definitely fall over. There's also no way to lock the wheels and it goes really fast even on the higher-tension setting if a baby is leaning forward on it too heavily.As far as the activity panel goes, the voices, music and sounds are all quite annoying but that's just par for the course with this type of toys. I wish that there were multiple sound effects for each of the buttons so it wasn't quite as obnoxious and repetitive.
