review/summary: Kills your back if you're too tallreview/text: This carrier puts all the baby's weight on your shoulders and upper back. I can stand it until the baby's about 10 pounds, but after that, it's just plain painful.The pain starts in my shoulders, where the straps start to dig in. Then it moves to my lower back, which is straining to stay straight with 10+ pounds of baby pulling my upper back forward. Then my stomach muscles start to ache too.The only time i ever use this carrier is at the grocery story, where the fact that it is pretty easy to get set up solo is a major benefit. For walks at home when i can take the time to get the it set up, or any time i can borrow another pair of hands, i use theERGOcarrier, which keeps the weight on my hips instead of contorting my spine.
