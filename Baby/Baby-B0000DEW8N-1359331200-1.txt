review/summary: Great!review/text: I was looking for something for my mother-in-law to use when watching my little one. I didn't want the expense of a high chair, and this was the perfect compromise. It is easy to clean, and I love the simple design and colors. The tray table is adjustable, which is nice, because my little girl's belly seems to be growing fast! Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase!
