review/summary: Just what our 6 month old wanted for Christmasreview/text: This Jumperoo is great. Feels very sturdy & safe. I appreciated the adjustable heights to accommodate a quickly growing baby. The toys are entertaining.Moving the Jumperoo from room to room is a bit tricky - it's an awkward size and is hard to fit through standard inside doors. But my baby doesn't care about those things - he's happy that he can be upright, entertained, and active.And as a bonus, it matches all of our other Fisher-Price Rainforest items.
