review/summary: Convenientreview/text: I really like this pillow. But make sure you have a big bed because it takes some room :)It helps a lot to sleep on the side. It holds my back well, so I can sleep half on the side half on my back. Depending on which side you sleep it also helps to hold the belly. You can stick the other extremity of the pillow between your knees so it keeps your hips elevated. Too bad it does not come with a cover which costs 20 extra bucks.
