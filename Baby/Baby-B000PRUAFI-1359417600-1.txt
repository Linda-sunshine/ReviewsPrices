review/summary: Love this gate!review/text: We ordered this gate to be able to lock our dog in the laundry room while we're away at work. It shipped quickly, was very easy to assemble and install but the best part is that it is made sturdy and operates easy. The gate opens and closes easily but locks securely in place when it closes. We love the bronze color too as it blends in with our decor and doesn't show dirt or wear because of use.I would highly recommend this gate to anyone is looking for something for their pet or small children.
