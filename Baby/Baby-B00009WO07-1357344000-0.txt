review/summary: Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Plus Pack Size 5review/text: I recently had to babysitting for a couple of days my 15 month old twin grandsons, and had to change lots of diapers.I liked the Pampers Baby Dry Diapers because they were easy to put on. The tabs made it easy to adjust the fit which is important as the twins are not the same weight. It was helpful to be able to tell when to change them by the feel of the diaper in the front when they peed. Most of the time the diapers were leak proof. I did find that the diapers are a little too full in size in the butt, this might be with boys. I have noticed this with each size they have worn. However, having said that these diapers are still the best fitting of the brands. Sometimes additional diapers are needed before the new month's shipment arrives, so they have tried other brands. My son and daughter in law have used Pampers from their birth. The diapers are shipped monthly to their door through Amazon's program and the Amazon Moms Club. In their monthly order they can manage their diaper subscription with options such as size, brand, quantity, and accessories. Each month they have chosen to continue with Pampers.
