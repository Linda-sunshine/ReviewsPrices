review/summary: Good wipe - a bit smallreview/text: We bought this wipe because it did not have the chemicals and perfumes of other wipes. We have used these since our son was a newborn, he is now 2 years. They clean well and have never irritated his skin. They are a bit on the small side compared to other wipes.
