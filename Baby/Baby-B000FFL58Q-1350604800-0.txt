review/summary: Stopped working after a monthreview/text: My daughter loves this gym, however the lights and music stopped working after about a month. At first we just thought the batteries were dying because we would turn it on and nothing would happen but then it would randomly start playing when no one was around it as though it were possessed. Well, we've tried replacing it with batteries from two seperate packs and neither fixed the problem. I'm disappointed in the quality of the products coming out now.
