review/summary: Amazon is not good product is finereview/text: Amazon has changed their policy so much during the past two years. First I had to pay $80 for amazon prime. I thought that was wrong but I paid it. Next, what really made me cancel is on my subscribe and save products if I was "running low" they would send me another order of diapers but NOT at the discounted price!! So the diapers went from $36 to $50. So my amazon mom (prime) and subscribe and save did not apply. I have been a very loyal customer for 2 years with many baby products: diapers, baby food, baby formula and 10 years with books. I even reccomended amazon to all my friends for the convenience and discount. Now, I'll be sure to do the opposite. Amazon disappointed me and that is not the way to treat a good customer. I would rather deal with Target and their discounted price even if I have to drive there. The Target card give you an automatic 5% off.
