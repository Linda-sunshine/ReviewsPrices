review/summary: Cloud b night lightreview/text: Four stars because this product is pretty expensive for what it is. It would be worth the price if there was a sound option included. My son loves it though.Pros:-light weight-choice of colors-perfect amount of light in a dark room-cuteCons:-expensive-auto shut off...I think there needs to be an option to leave it on all night-no soundI'd recommend it, but there is room for improvement.
