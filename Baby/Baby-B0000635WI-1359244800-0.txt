review/summary: Lifesaverreview/text: I started using the pillow at 17 weeks and am now at 22 weeks. I can finally sleep through the night! It's flexible to mold to your body and you can decide if you want it to cradle your back or if you want to wrap your arms around it. It's great for pillow support under your head and between your legs. It doesn't take up that much more room in the bed. When I have traveled for work or vacation, I always look forward to coming back to it for a good night's sleep. I only wish it would help me with my achy hips!
