review/summary: A must have for parents with a new babyreview/text: As almost every new parent will attest, your memory leaves something to be desired in the first few months after birth. These little devices are a life-saver, and incredibly handy to have around.Easy to use, though the first-time set-up leaves a little to be desired, we found this so useful, that we buy these for all of our friends who are first-time parents to be! Forget using apps on your iphone or android, nothing beats the ease of use and long battery life of the itzbeen! not to mention the durability when it gets dropped or knocked onto the floor in the middle of the night!
