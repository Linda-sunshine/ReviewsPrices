review/summary: Safety hazard when your child can unzip sleepsackreview/text: Both my kids wore Halo Sleepsacks and they worked fine until my 22 month old figured out how to unzip it. I think there is a design flaw that the sleepsacks should have a covered zipper and/or a clasp to prevent a curious toddler from unzipping it.I reported to HALO and SaferProducts.gov a safety incident while my 22 month old was wearing the HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket Size Extra Large. I woke up at 4am because for some reason I felt the need to check on my sleeping toddler. I found him asleep in his crib and tangled in his sleepsack. He had managed to unzip his sleepsack and was lying face down with his head tightly stuck inside the bottom of the sack that is normally over his feet and the rest of his body tangled in the sack opening. I was alarmed that he could have suffocated and was thankful that he was sleeping fine.Due to this incident, I will no longer dress my son in sleepsacks which is unfortunate since both my kids wore HALO SleepSacks while they slept in cribs. I shared this feedback on Facebook and with my mom friends so that the scary incident I experienced can be prevented.
