review/summary: Nice transitional toyreview/text: If you see this more as a toy than a crib/playpen, I think you will be satisfied. It is designed for occasional periods through the day, not as a place to leave your baby. I can rock it easily from my chair (using my foot) and it is built with enough stability to keep me from worrying about a rollover. It can also be set in a fixed position, but I use it mainly for the rocking motion. The overall engineering is good, but I would recommend an upgrade to the "toy" bar. The items there are not baby-fascinating, but they could be. I'd like to see the sticker-covered plastic bits replaced with soft, dangly, *detachable*, *washable* toys.Consider this rocker for a newborn, and you'll get your money's worth as it transitions to toddler-size.
