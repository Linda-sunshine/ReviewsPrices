review/summary: Swaddlers are great up to size 2review/text: These are hands down the best diapers for newborns up to size 2. We didn't like the sensitive version but these are just the right thickness, they have a wetness indicator (though I wouldn't bother using it, chances are good the baby is wet!). We had some issues with leaks and blow outs here and there but that's to be expected in any type of diaper every now and then. They are pricey but worth it for baby's comfort!
