review/summary: Not the best builtreview/text: Not bad for the money however the quality is not great. The wood is not very strong and feels a little cheap. If I was to buy again I would probably spend the extra $$$ and get a solid wooden chair.It is comfortable and looks great, so if you are not wanting to spend a lot it's great!!
