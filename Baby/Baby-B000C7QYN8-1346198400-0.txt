review/summary: Great Wipe Free of Common Irritantsreview/text: Pros: Chemical FreeCons: The scent isn't as pleasant as other wipes.We love this product! We began using Seventh Generation wipes four years ago when our first child was born. Our pediatrician had a sign in his lobby titled "Horrifying Household Products." One of the items listed was baby wipes, because most baby wipes contain some form of alcohol that is irritating to baby's skin. When I found these wipes had natural ingredients and did not contain the propylene glycol that most wipes contain, we immediately decided to use these. Even though our second child will often grab a wipe to suck on, I don't become overly concerned at her exposure to chemicals when I catch her. While the natural scent of these wipes isn't unpleasant, it doesn't compare with wipes that have added fragrance - but, then again, that's why I buy these wipes.
