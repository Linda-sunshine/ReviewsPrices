review/summary: good buyreview/text: my wife was finding it harder to get comfy as her tummy grew so i got this for her and she says it helped a lot. The only thing bout it is that it head rest part is a little bulky so it takes some breaking into it and the size of it takes up a lot of space in the bed so she enjoys it more while im at work. other than that she's happy with it :)
