review/summary: HALO SleepSacks never disappointreview/text: HALO SleepSacks never disappoint. We bought this one because my chunk-a-dunk 10 month old had outgrown his size Medium SleepSacks, and needed new ones for winter. This particular SleepSack is so adorable, with the giraffe on the right side. It's also very soft and cozy, and keeps my baby warm all night long without a separate blanket.
