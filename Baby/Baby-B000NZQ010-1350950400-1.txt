review/summary: Wheels are too fast.review/text: Overall the toy walker is very educational, but the wheels roll too fast for first time walkers. Even when I put the wheels on the 1 gauge, for them to move slower, the wheels move too fast for my son to walk. He really loves to play with the buttons and he stand with it sometimes, but I have to help him walk with it. Overall it get 4 stars.
