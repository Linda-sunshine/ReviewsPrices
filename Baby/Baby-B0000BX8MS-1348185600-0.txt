review/summary: soft, cozy and warm - Baby and Mom love it!!review/text: I bought this wearable blanket from amazon for my 16 months old girl. She is 50th percentile in weight and 75th percentile in height. The X-Large runs a little big on her, but I wanted a bigger size so she has some room to stretch her legs in the zipped blanket. The blanket is very soft and keeps her warm. The zipper is actually very good quality. I can close the zipper in a dark room while woken up from half sleep in a middle of a night. :) I am so happy with the product. Now, I can sleep peacefully in the night without getting worried that my little munchkin getting cold. It's a must buy!
