review/summary: Santa brought it, and it's the favoritereview/text: Our two and a half year old loves this turtle. I'm impressed with how well the stars project onto the ceiling and walls. We like the three different colors you can choose from, and that it has a timer and turns itself off after our daughter has fallen asleep. This was her favorite gift this Christmas.
