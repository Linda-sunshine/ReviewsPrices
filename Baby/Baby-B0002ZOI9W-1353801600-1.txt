review/summary: My baby sleeps in this rocker every dayreview/text: I cannot tell you how valuable this infant rocker to toddler rocker has been. It has a vibration function that helps soothe baby and allows me to rock baby to sleep. My now 8 month old still takes a nap in it every day. I even take this seat with me when I need to take a shower and keep baby entertained. He loves the toy bar when he is awake and I just take it off when he needs to nap. Love it! It's important to pull out the stabilizing bar if you leave the baby unattended even for a moment (baby can lean forward and topple over without it).
