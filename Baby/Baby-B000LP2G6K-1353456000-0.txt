review/summary: Shipping was fast!review/text: I ordered this on a Monday thinking it would get here the following week and it showed up Wednesday morning. i was very impressed with how quickly it came and would definitely order from this seller again in the future. as for the pack n play itself it was really easy to set up once i realized that the instructions were tucked under the mattress pad :p i thought i lost it but i didn't pay attention. the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because in the middle of the night the toy bar snapped itself off and flew across the room and i'm worried it might do that again with my son inside the bassinet so i don't like the toy bar but otherwise i love everything else about it. it's also super light- i can lift the entire thing at 9 months pregnant with no strain. this will help me easily move baby from room to room without waking him if i have to. definitely recommend!
