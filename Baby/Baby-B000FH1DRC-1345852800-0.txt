review/summary: Great Valuereview/text: We ordered these diapers in size 2 for our baby boy just as he was outgrowing size 1 diapers. We are now about halfway through the last bag, and it seems to be time to move on to size 3. It is nice not to have to make a special trip for diapers every few days. We will order the size 3 diapers to save time and money.
