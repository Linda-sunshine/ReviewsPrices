review/summary: Great product!review/text: Because I've been having some lower groin pain I went to a maternity store and tried on a few of their options but didn't want to spend $40+ on it so I bought this one on amazon instead. I was a size 6/8 pre pregnancy and I'm now a size 10 and I purchased the size Small which fits me perfectly on the tightest setting so I'll have room to grow as well. I wore it on a longer walk and I didn't have as much pain as I would have without it.
