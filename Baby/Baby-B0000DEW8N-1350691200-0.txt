review/summary: Great conceptreview/text: This really takes the place of a high chair that takes up more room for those of us that may not have that kind of room in the kitchen/dining room areas. It is great for sitting your child in it to feed him and it is safe and is to clean. Just put it in the dishwasher if necessary or wipe it up with ease. I LOVE IT.
