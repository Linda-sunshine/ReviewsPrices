review/summary: Great for bar-height table.review/text: We have a bar-height kitchen table, so the high chair wasn't tall enough. We ended up buying this booster seat and strapping it into one of the chairs. We actually don't use the tray - we just push the chair up to the table so he can eat like we do. I like that it has straps so I don't have to worry about my toddler jumping from the tall chair when he's done eating. Easy to clean.
