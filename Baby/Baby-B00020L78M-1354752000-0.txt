review/summary: Grandson loves it :-)review/text: I was surprised at how light weight this is. That will come in handy in the summer months when I will need to carry it outside. It reminds me of milk crates. Same material and design. It is sturdier that I thought it would be. We are happy with it. My granson loves that he has more room and I love that I can vacuum and clean the floor under it easier than trying to clean the play pen we had. I also like that you can get more pieces to add to it. I plan to do that for the summer when we have get togethers with more than one grandbaby here. HAPPY!
