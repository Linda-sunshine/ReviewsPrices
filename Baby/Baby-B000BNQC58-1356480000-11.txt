review/summary: Third one I've boughtreview/text: In a family with over thirty first cousins, you end up having lots of kids running around needing presents. For some reason, this Constellation Night Light turtle was a HUGE hit with the kids.I have purchased four of these turtles so far in the last two years, and the children always love them. While I'm unsure about the soft plushiness combined with the plastic shell and a light source inside, the kids don't seem to mind and actually enjoy the turtle lying around their room at night, shining lights up onto the ceiling.If you've got small kids who are fussy at night, give this a shot. You might find that you'll be buying yourself one - or at least sneaking it into your room once in a while.
