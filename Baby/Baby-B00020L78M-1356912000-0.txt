review/summary: Just what we neededreview/text: It was easy to order, came directly to the house and within about 5 minutes was up in our TV room. Luckily our great room has space for the pen on one side and enough room for the couch on the other. It's been great to have a safe place for our nine month old son to play with his toys. It's kept the toys contained in one area and the dogs out of his playing space, so less dog hair in his mouth!
