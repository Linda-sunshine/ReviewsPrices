review/summary: love it!review/text: We love this booster seat. We have 2 of them (purchased the 1st one somewhere else). We got the 1st one when our now 10 month old son was just starting solids at 6 months, hoping to buy time to research high chairs. We like the booster seat so much we decided we didn&#8217;t need a high chair. We got a 2nd one as a &#8220;traveling&#8221; booster seat. For the price, this booster seat rocks! The colors are nice and the seat doesn&#8217;t take over the dining room like a high chair would. Plus, it&#8217;s easier to clean -- there aren&#8217;t any nooks and crannies that hide crumbs or other messes.The only complaints I have are not really complaints about the booster seat as much as maybe arguments for a high chair:-When my son tilts his head back when sitting in this seat (e.g., out of excitement or when drinking from his sippy cup if it&#8217;s not full), he doesn&#8217;t have very far to go before hitting his head on the back of the real chair. I generally put a blanket or burp cloth on the back of the real chair so that his head hits something soft and not the bare wood. I could also solve this problem by raising the booster seat about a foot, but then I wouldn&#8217;t be able to pull him up to the dining room table.-The booster seat has a hard seat and isn&#8217;t as cushy as some of the padded high chairs. It doesn&#8217;t seem to bother my son now, but once he starts speaking, we&#8217;ll see what he has to say.
