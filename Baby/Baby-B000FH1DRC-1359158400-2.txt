review/summary: Not my favorite choice- Huggies Snugglers work much better!review/text: We have tried both the Huggies snugglers and the Pampers Swaddlers. For us, I think the Huggies hold in what would be blow outs much better. Also, everytime I take a Pampers swaddler off of my daughter, the lining is sticking to her. That can't feel good to have something stuck to her all of the time when wet- plus it is more likely to give her diaper rash. The Huggies are so much softer on the inside and the lining has never ever stuck to her. Everyone is different but for us the Pampers Swaddlers just didn't work for us.
