review/summary: Worth the $review/text: Very happy with my purchase of the K'Tan. My 2 month old will fuss for a tiny bit at first, and then fall fast asleep, just as she did at 1 month old. The online videos are extremely helpful. Material is sturdy and washes well. Their sizing chart was accurate for me. I'm fluctuating between 125-130lbs, and I'm 5'4&#34;, and the xs is just right. A little tight at first but stretches nicely and supports my daughter well. Very happy I bit the bullet and purchased this.
