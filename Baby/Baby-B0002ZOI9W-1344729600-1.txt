review/summary: Life saverreview/text: I have the older version of this swing for my 1st boyy, who is now 5 years old. I used it for my 2nd and now for my 3rd child! I must say it is very durable, i brought the swing along with me to overseas, and several cities in my luggage ( taking apart and utting them back together, by myself with a small screw, which takes only a few mnutes!!!). I bought 3 others as gifts. My 2.5 years old still wants to sleep in this, then i transfer him to his bed. such a life saver.
