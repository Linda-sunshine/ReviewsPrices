review/summary: Worst diaper we ever triedreview/text: This is the worst diaper we ever tried. After my 20 months old daughter go to bad (changing diaper at 9pm) we have to change it at around 4am, otherwise she (her outfit, bad and comforter) will be totally wet by the morning. We had no other diaper with such an experience. During daytime it is even worse, sometimes it start letting thru everything after few hours. We use 5-7 diapers a day whereas we needed only 3-4 from cruisers. This simply have not enough absorbent to stay dry for 12 hours (as advertised)
