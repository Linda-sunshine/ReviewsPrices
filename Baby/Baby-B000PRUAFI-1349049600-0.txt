review/summary: Great quality!review/text: GREAT PRODUCT! This gate is sturdy, stylish and has no problem keeping our energetic Pitbull isolated from the 'delicate' things we have in our living room while we're away. Quick installation and it's quite adaptable based on the width of your opening. I only used one extension piece and never even used the permanent screw-in installation because tensioning the gate with the jack screws was more than secure enough!It takes a little getting used to for operating the latch mechanism but that would probably work to your advantage if you're trying to keep kids from opening it.
