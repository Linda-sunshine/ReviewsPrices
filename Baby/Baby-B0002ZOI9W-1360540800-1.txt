review/summary: Infant chairreview/text: We love this rocker! For my first child I borrowed this rocker from a good friend and fell in love with it! This is the perfect rocker to grow with your child. It has several different positions so that your child is comfortable at any age. It is also perfect for infants that suffer from reflux. Our problem now is trying to keep our pre-schoolers out of the chair and letting it be for our infant! Would highly recommend!
