review/summary: Excellent!review/text: Very colorful, cute animals! My son has used this from 8 weeks old and still LOVES it now at almost 7 months old! Cute music or nature sounds, two different volume settings, also a setting for movement (only makes music when baby moves). At 7 months old my son loves the movement setting, the crinkly sounding leaf, the white tiger tail that sticks out and is now trying to figure out how to get the toy out of the giraffes mouth. This has been such a great buy! He has used it everyday for the past 5 months and I'm sure will continue for many more to come. I highly recommend, it's definitely a worthy buy!
