review/summary: Bought for pregnant wife, use for my back painreview/text: I recently bought this for my pregnant wife, she loves it, but on a recent out of town trip, she could not take it. I decided to try it out, with my bad back i wanted to see if it would help at night.That night was the best night sleep i had in a long time! It provides very good support for my lower back that I have not woken up from back pain over the past few nights!Looks like I need to buy another pillow for my wife!
