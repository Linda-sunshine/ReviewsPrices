review/summary: Leaked almost all the time, and every time at night!review/text: Not a fan of these diapers. I have a son, and these diapers leaked all the time. I usually use Huggies and they rarely leak! Thought I would try these because I love the Swaddlers for newborns. Looks like I will be switching back to Huggies.
