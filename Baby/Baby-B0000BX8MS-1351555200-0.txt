review/summary: Toasty warmreview/text: Those little legs can get chilly in a onesie, so he likes to wear his sleep sack for lounging around. He can play on his play mat and do tummy time with this on, still kicks his legs with no problem. When I unzip it to change his diaper his legs are always nice and toasty warm. Obviously great for sleeping too.
