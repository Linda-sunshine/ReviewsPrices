review/summary: The Key to Getting Things Donereview/text: We received one of these as a gift and I began using it as soon as my husband returned to work and I needed a safe place to put my infant son while I showered, made lunch, or did just about anything that required two hands. I can easily carry it from room to room, my son enjoys looking at the toys that hang before him, and he'll occasionally nap in it with the "calming vibrations" on. His arms aren't long enough to reach the toys yet, but I attached a few links to the center toy's handle and he can now pull them to make the song play. All in all, this has been so useful that I've since purchased a second one for my mother's house.
