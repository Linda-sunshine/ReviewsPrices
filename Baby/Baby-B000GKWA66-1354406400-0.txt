review/summary: Creepy sound that did not soothe my sonreview/text: Some babies love white noise, but we didn't find this product to be very soothing for our baby. The heartbeat setting is so slow that it sounds very unnatural. The whale setting sounds more like haunted house noises. The rain and ocean noises are the only ones that don't sound creepy. For us, this was a waste of money. We had better luck with the Tiny Love Soothe and Groove Mobile, which plays music for 40 minutes, and has several different settings/types of music/white noise from which to choose.
