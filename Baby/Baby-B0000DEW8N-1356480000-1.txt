review/summary: This should put the highchair people out of business!review/text: I bought this for my 13 month old granddaughter to use during a holiday visit. This unit is very secure, attaches to dining chair easily, and is very portable (to take to restaurants, friends' houses). It takes up very little space, especially compared to the regular big high chair. It converts as the child ages into a booster seat. My daughter, who has a regular high chair at home, plans to purchase one of her own to use for eating away from home, as this product is much safer than what restaurants provide. This would be a great gift for new grandparents or parents and could take the place of the traditional high chair at half the price! I would definitely buy again.
