review/summary: Perfect gift for a 4 year old!review/text: My 4 year old niece absolutely loves her turtle night light...and the best part, even after a year it still sits right on her bed! She uses it every night and loves counting the stars on the ceiling to sleep. Great battery life, super easy to use and has 3 different color settings.
