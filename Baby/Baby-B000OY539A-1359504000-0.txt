review/summary: Not as complicated as people make it!review/text: I am a new mother and my baby girl hates being left alone in another room if I am trying to get dishes, laundry, etc done around the house. I went looking for some type of wrap/carrier and found this at my local babies r us. I hadn't read about how complicated it was until after I bought it and it sat on my shelf for about 2 weeks because I was so hesitant to even try. Well I finally tried it when my baby was 5 weeks old and it works wonders!! As long as you are not a complete idiot if you follow the instructions in the book you should be able to successfully use this wrap. I got all my dishes and laundry done and my girl fell asleep in it instantly! Don't be scared of the complexity of it, it's not that hard!! Very easy and convenient.The first time I used it my daughter was a little loose at the top but it just takes practice once or twice. Took me less than 3 minutes to put on.
