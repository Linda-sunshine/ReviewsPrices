review/summary: Great toy, doesn't lastreview/text: I love this walker. My neighbor had it and my daughter was obsessed, so I had to order it. Within a month, it got stuck on one note and did not shut off. I sent it back and got another one. This one lasted two months before it did the same thing. Too bad, it is really entertaining for the little ones.
