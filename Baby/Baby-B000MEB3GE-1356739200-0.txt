review/summary: Very helpful with newbornsreview/text: This product was a lifesaver when we first brought our son home from the hospital. It helped us keep track of how long it had been since he'd eaten and since he'd pee'd or pooped (diaper icon for pee and bottom star for poo). It was really good in helping us discern his cries in the beginning. We would just look at the timer and see when was the last time his diaper was changed or since he ate or napped. In the beginning, when your brain is mush with sleep depravation, we never worried about having to keep track of anything. This little gadget did it for us. It is especially helpful at night. There is a little button that lights up the screen so it's easy to check on times in the middle of the night without having to turn any lights on. Since my wife breastfed, she also found it was extremely helpful in timing how long he ate for. The reason why we gave this four stars is that it's extremely helpful but only for about a month, month and a half. We accidentally misplaced it one day (about 6 weeks in) and never really missed it. So while it's a great product, it is short-lived in it's helpfulness. Amazon's price was by far the cheapest and even though you won't use this product for a long time, it is really helpful during the first few weeks. If your child happens to take medicine, this would have a much longer shelf-life. You can set the timer to go off after a certain time has passed, so this would be really useful in helping to remember to give medicine.
