review/summary: Excellent safe toy! Great for autistic kids too!review/text: Great item! Arrived safely in package. I have seen this constellation night light before and the other models from the same company. They are all awesome. This is my 2nd one and I can say that even with ALOT of use, it was over a month that I needed to replace the batteries and that is impressive! The stars hit the walls and ceiling and fill the room with color. Even the cats love to see this on. This will be a definate hit.I mention this is also a great item for autistic kids because of their attraction to lights. This makes my nephew so happy and giggly and I point out the moon to him. He loves it and having the timer is a great feature.
