review/summary: Cheaply made. Lasted only 2 monthsreview/text: We purchased this for our daughter who loves to sleep with a light on. she loved this night light and Slept with it every night. The problem is after two months the bulbs burned out and there is no way to replace them. We also purchased a turtle night light for our son and the same thing happened after two months. While the idea is great and the kids love them, these night lots are too expensive to only last 2 months.
