review/summary: Great for babysitting, wish it was easier to move room to roomreview/text: I watch an 8 month old baby about 24 hours a week, and this playard has been a God-send. Without it, I was forever worrying about whether or not the baby was safe while I was doing necessary daily routines.It's a sturdy playard, and looks good in the living room. It is too wide to fit through the doors of the other rooms, and requires too much effort to disassemble it each time I take care of him.I assembled this alone, which was a challenge, as I had never set one up before.
