review/summary: Love this booster!review/text: We were using a full-sized highchair for our 6 month old, but it was huge and took way too much space up in our kitchen. Also, the tray was too high for her. So, we purchased this booster and we all love it. She is able to reach her tray easily and can pick food up from it. I debated between getting this one and one of the space saver highchairs and I'm very glad we got this one. So easy!
