review/summary: Four years and countingreview/text: We've had this turtle for four years and it's still working, which is more than I can say about a whole bunch of similar products we've tried. I love everything about it: the design, the true-to-sky constellations, the three light choices, the auto off feature. Perfect for a nursery or an older child who's afraid of the dark!
