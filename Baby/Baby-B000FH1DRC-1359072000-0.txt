review/summary: Great leak protection, soft, but terrible perfumereview/text: We tried anything we could to keep our baby's blowout diapers at bay. We tried every brand (Kirkland, Huggies, Pampers Baby Dry), and her soft newborn poops would regularly leak or blowout from the top back or the sides. Not the case with Swaddlers. We have had only one small liquid leak from the leg. We've saved A LOT on laundry as a result. The diapers also feel softer and less papery than other brands like Huggies.My one complaint is that the Swaddlers from the Ebulk Pack on Amazon REEK. The ones that you get in the store smell like baby powder. The ones in the Ebulk pack have a much stronger odor. My child hasn't had a reaction yet, but it's a pretty obnoxious odor.
