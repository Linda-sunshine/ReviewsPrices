review/summary: amazing!review/text: I got this twilight turtle for my 3 year old son, and he loves it. Every night when he goes to bed he wants to take it with him to see the stars. I really love the quality this toys has, and the stars shine all over the room. Some of my family that has seen this love this toy. I don't think you can go wrong by getting this. I also found that amazon has the best price for this turtle.Also I know this toy has been updated, but the reviews said to stick to the old one so that's why I got the old one, and not the updated Twilight Turtle
