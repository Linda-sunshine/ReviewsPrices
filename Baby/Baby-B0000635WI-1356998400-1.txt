review/summary: Great product as long as you haev realistic expectationsreview/text: My wife has been suffering from terrible morning sickness, heart burn, and indigestion during her first few months of pregnancy. We had one of thse during her first pregnancy with my son, but got rid of it after his birth. I bought a second one this time around because it was the only product that allowed her to get in comfortable positions while sleeping. Keep in mind that if you have terrible morning sickness and other related issues like my wife has, no item will be a magic bullet to fully take all of the discomforts away. nevertheless though, she's able to sleep significantly more comfortably with this. additionally, there has been a sharp reduction in the heartburn and indigestion since using this. To even test this out, she slept one night without it and had really bad heartburn throughout the night.I'm definitely a believer in this product, but only as long as the expectations for what relief it would provide are realistic.
