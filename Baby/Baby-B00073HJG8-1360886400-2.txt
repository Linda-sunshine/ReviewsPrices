review/summary: Good hammockreview/text: I really like the hammock, it reminded me of one I had as a child. I wish the instructions would have had a image or a little bit more detail on the best way to hang it. (that is the only reason I gave it a 4) It is best to hang the side hooks at almost the same height as the center hook, unwise everything will just fall out. I learned this by trial and error so my sons wall has a few extra holes in it, but oh well. It is large and will fit a lot of stuffed animals.
