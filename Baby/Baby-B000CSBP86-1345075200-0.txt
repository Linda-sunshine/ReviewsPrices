review/summary: I liked it... Baby didn't.review/text: I have had other baby carriers with my two older children and this one is definitely my favorite. It was easy to use and felt very sturdy. Unfortunately, my son didn't like being in it, but he's not much of a snuggler so I'm guessing it is his personality and not the carrier that is the issue. :) I'd recommend this item to other parents.
