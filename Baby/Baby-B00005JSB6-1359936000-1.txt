review/summary: Good... but possibly a sizing issuereview/text: These diapers worked well while our baby was on the lower end of the weight range. Once he got over 20 pounds, he's been having issues with poos going up his back. He is kind of chunky, so he might simply be too wide and sized out of these earlier than expected.We're moving up to size 4.
