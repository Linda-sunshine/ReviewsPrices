review/summary: A must havereview/text: Got this chair for my son when he out grew his bouncer. Love that it can seat babies up to 40lbs! It was a breeze to assemble. It's a great chair for the price and is handy for use around the house or to bring along when visiting family for nap time or feeding baby. I found the music on the toy bar annoying compared to other musical toys, but other than that it's great.
