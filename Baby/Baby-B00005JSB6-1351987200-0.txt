review/summary: its pretty wellreview/text: We'd been using these wipes because we liked the thickness of the wipes. These wipes could tackle a mess pretty well. However, the last several times we have purchased the wipes they have had a scratchy texture to them. It is like there is plastic within the wipes that makes them feel gritty.
