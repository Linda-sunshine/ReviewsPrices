review/summary: Beware counterfeit itemsreview/text: I received my package today with my "Cloud B" turtle. I bought the blue one, because my son loves the color blue. When I opened the box I was a bit concerned, because the packaging didn't say cloud B anywhere on it. It just said "Turtle" and had the picture of the mocha turtle on it. Okay... I opened it.The turtle had one button depressed permanently so when I put the batteries in it flashed colors but wouldn't actually work correctly. The box was missing its batteries, and star chart. The plastic shell was scratched and damaged and the face and legs of the turtle look completely different than the image shown on Amazon (and cloud B's website.) It's on the way back, and I ordered the one that is directly from Amazon (rather than another company fulfilled by Amazon.) Hopefully that will be a good thing, but there are definitely problems out there regarding this turtle.
