review/summary: Safe for my babyreview/text: I've been a loyal buyer of Seventh Generation. I like this cause it feels smoother on the skin. It has a retaining moisture so I don't have to worry about it drying up even before I haven't used it yet. No diaper rash on my baby's skin whatsoever. Perfectly safe for my baby!
