review/summary: A decent choice for the pricereview/text: I picked this up for our daughter, and while at the time she was too young to use the walker part of it, she has definitely spent a lot of time with the music/shapes/sounds portion. I am a bit disappointed with the way the music and sounds are programmed, however. Hitting a piano key will give you a color, but if you hit it again, it will play a sequence of notes up to that key. I don't know how effective this toy can be at reinforcing concepts/words if they change each time you press the key. The other annoying things is that if you leave it on but don't touch it for a couple of minutes, the intro song starts to play by itself, as if the toy were trying to get your baby's attention. The walker portion is something our little one has just discovered, and she seems to like it. There are two speed for the wheels, which is nice, though I would have loved to see rubberized wheels. All in all, it's a fun toy, and we've more than gotten our money's worth.
