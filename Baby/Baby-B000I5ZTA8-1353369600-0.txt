review/summary: Helps a littlereview/text: Definitely follow the lbs chart and not the sizing. I bought a large because that is the size pants I wear, but this cradle is slightly large on me. It is not uncomfortable, but I definitely wouldn't call it comfortable either. It seems to alleviate some back pain since I am on my feet walking all day at work. I don't wear it everyday, but I do wear it on days that my back pain feels really bad and I need some extra support. I am now 31 weeks pregnant and may find that I will need it even more later. Good price though for the item.
