review/summary: Why didn't I get these years ago?review/text: I had the accordian gates for years & hated them. Do yourself a favor & spend the extra $25 for these. Their sturdy & the gate closes behind you unless you want to leave it open. In that case, you just swing the gate all the way open. Opening it is a breeze for humans, but not for dogs. They haven't budged since I put them in & I didn't even screw in the holders as the intructions suggest.
