review/summary: An amazing night lightreview/text: I bought the ladybug for one of my Grandsons a year ago. He had trouble sleeping in a dark room. This did the trick. Actually, it went over so well that I purchased this turtle for my other grandson. These are fantastic night lights. They are very well made and sturdy. The batteries last a long time as well. Great product.....kid approved !
