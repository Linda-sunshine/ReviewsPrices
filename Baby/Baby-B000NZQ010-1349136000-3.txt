review/summary: Item should be RECALLED!review/text: We bought this for our son about 2 months ago and I am very disappointed with he product, the removable toy comes off to easily badly engineered, when the toy comes off then the product is to light and often flips over often, my son was just using in now in front of me and again that stupid toy came off on the front lodged itself under the front and the toy flipped over and my son just did a face plant on to the floor. I'm ditching the toy and throwing it into the closet, the educational part that always comes off he can keep but i'm going to write a formal letter to the company asking that they recall this product until further safety issue are resolved. It needs to be designed better that it doesn't just fall off all the time. AVOID!
