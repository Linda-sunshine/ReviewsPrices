review/summary: All GOOD Except For High Frog, Twisted Elephant, Bad Music!review/text: Every toy in the market has pros and cons. There's never a toy that fits all. Long story short, we got this jumperoo after reading the 1000+ 5 star reviews. We put our LO in it when she was 3mths old - she was too short for it then, and so we put a pillow underneath for support. But soon, she grew to be tall enough. At 6mths now, she's too tall for setting #1. We're moving her up to setting #2. So the height of this jumperoo was never an issue for our LO. See below list of pros and cons:Pros:Very cute Rainforest themed design - our baby loves to look behind at the eyeballs on the back cushion!Back cushion support/paddingStrong spring for fun jumping actionReasonable size - if it's too small, it will not hold up or provide enough safety supportColorful, entertaining toysCons:Out of reach toy - The blue rainforest frog is super cute, but unfortunately, it is positioned too high up making it impossible for baby to reach it. Our LO loves it so much, so we remove the entire leaf and give it to her. The frog is her fav teether. Same problem with the toucan, but good thing, she didn't ask for it as much.Twisted elephant - The elephant is adorable, but sadly, it's twisted the wrong way showing only his back to our baby. What in the world could the designer be thinking? It's wound up too tight for baby to turn it around easily. Doesn't encourage baby to play.Bad, annoying music - we usually turn it off because the animal sound plus the repetitive music in the background is just too much for all our ears. LO hates it too.All in all, I'd still buy it again. Word of caution: Putting baby in and lifting baby up could be tricky due to the tight space and leg opening. When putting baby in, be sure to check and make sure their legs are fully inserted into the leg openings before sitting them.
