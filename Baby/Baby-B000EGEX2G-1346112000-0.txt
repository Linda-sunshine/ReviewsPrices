review/summary: It serves it's purposereview/text: I bought this a week before my 3 month old was born (tried it out at Target first, then found it here for cheaper and qualified for free shipping!) Easy to put together, although stretching the arm cushions took 2 of us.The first month my baby hated it, we used the yoga ball more.Now we use it all the time (think 6-8 times a day for 5-10 minutes each time).2 Complaints:As others have stated, the back cushion does not completely cover the top back of the chair as pictured. However, a rolled up hand towel fixed that (and when you are an exhausted first time parent, does it really matter? Just nice to sit down for once!)It started making a clicking sound about a month ago (2 months after purchasing) when rocking. I have not had my husband try to fix it, but just an FYI it is there. Not super loud to wake the baby, but it's there.Otherwise, great investment, can't wait to sit in it and read books to baby when he is older!
