review/summary: Rainforest jumperooreview/text: I love the rainforest jumperoo!! I got it just a few days after ordering. Very easy to set up. My daughter has been using this for a month now. She is now four months. It has a great head support. Very bright, colorful and just super cute! My daughter has loved it since day one!!
