review/summary: Baby loves itreview/text: This product seems to be pretty well made and easy to assemble. Most importantly, my baby loves it. She plays with and chews on all the attached toys. She jumps and jumps and many times rocks herself to sleep. This is great while we are getting ready for work in the mornings.
