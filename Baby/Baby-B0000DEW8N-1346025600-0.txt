review/summary: Great Booster seat at a great pricereview/text: Decided to buy a portable booster seat online instead of one of our local stores as the price was irresistible. For about 1/2 price, this seat definitely delivers at 100%. The height is good (usually set on the highest feet setting of #3), and the seat overall makes for an easy quick clean-up.The one thing that's annoying is that the top white tray comes off way too easily. Once our 15 month old figured out that it pops right off, she kept taking it off at meal time. VERY ANNOYING when there's food on it and it goes flying on the floor below.Other than that, I would still highly recommend this booster seat. Looks great too! Who needs an LV bag hanging off your shoulder when you can have this stylish booster seat hanging there instead?!
