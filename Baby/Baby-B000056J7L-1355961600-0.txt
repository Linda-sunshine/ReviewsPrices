review/summary: lightweight, but does the trickreview/text: Bought this for my grandson when he comes over. It's lightweight and easy to move. He seems to like it. The plastic shroud in the front is great. My only concern is that it could be bigger. If you have a boy and get this system, you'll learn what I mean.
