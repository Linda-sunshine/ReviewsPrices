review/summary: Sizing (should have got a small instead of a medium)review/text: I read all the reviews that said this ran small so order the next size up so I did....well I should have stuck with the sizing chart and got a small instead of a medium! I don't feel like it was tight enough to hold up my tummy. I did notice a difference and I'm still glad I bought it.......wish I got a small instead!
