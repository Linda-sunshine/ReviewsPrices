review/summary: Great productreview/text: We got this rocker for a shower gift and found in indispensable after our son was born. We had a very hard time in the beginning getting him to sleep. He would not sleep on his back at all and when we tried having him sleep in his swing, he won't fall asleep in that either. This was the only thing we could get him to fall asleep in. We would kick out the bottom part so that it was fully reclined and won't rock. We would also take off the bar with the toys on it. He also had to be swaddled in order to sleep, so we think that he really liked it because it conformed to his body (like a hammock). If we were having a really hard time getting him to sleep, we would turn of the vibrator and that usually did the trick. We would set the rocker up in his crib and it fit perfectly inside. It was also easy to pack up in the car and take it to my in-laws, so that he would have someplace to nap. Now that my son is older (4 & 1/2 months) and he finally sleeps on his back, we still use this rocker. We have put the toy bar back on and he will entertain himself for a while by swatting at the toys.
