review/summary: Not bad bouncer, but found betterreview/text: We bought two bouncers. This one and the Evenflo Exersaucer. My son is now 9 months and a little tall for his age. He is too big for this one, but still comfortably fits in the Exersauser. He also has always liked the toys around the exersauser more, so for a little more money, I think it's worth the investment to get the other one.
