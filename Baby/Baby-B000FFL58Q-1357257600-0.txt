review/summary: Been used for my two boys and still going..review/text: I have two boys, five years apart, and both of them love this gym! My youngest, 5 months old, loves to lay there and grab at everything. The soft music and lights keep him interested. I also like that you can hang other items from this and you can move the items around so the child doesn't get bored and the items aren't always in the same place. This is a really great product!
