review/summary: Perfect little booster seatreview/text: I was looking for something to replace my son's highchair, which was just too bulky and taking up too much space. This booster seat is just the right size, fits perfectly on my chairs (which have rounded seats and backs) and adjusts to different heights. My only complaint would be that the tray is quite low on my son's lap. It's not a big deal because since he is almost 2, he just sits at the table, but I imagine it would be good for a smaller child.
