review/summary: Can't ask for morereview/text: A breeze to put together, baby loves it. Can be adjusted as she grows, she loves to bounce and play at the different stations. Easy to use and clean. Looks nice, doesn't take up too much room, and seems very durable. Every site I checked recommended this model even over newer ones, and although I haven't used any others, I can easily recommend.
