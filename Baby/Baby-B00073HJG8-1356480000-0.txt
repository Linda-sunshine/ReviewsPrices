review/summary: It's not pink!review/text: I had been looking everywhere for a toy hammock for my sons' room, but every one I found was pink! Not only is this one basic white, but it's exactly what we were looking for. It comes with hooks that we screwed into the wall, and it's been a huge help in corralling the toy clutter.
