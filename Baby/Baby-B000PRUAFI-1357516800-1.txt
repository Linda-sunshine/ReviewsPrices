review/summary: LOVE this gate!review/text: This is by far my favorite baby gate we have (we have 4 different kinds). I LOVE that it has and "open" option for when our daughter is asleep and my husband, dogs, and I just want to move freely throughout the house. Other gates we have that swing just drive me nuts because I have to let my dogs in and out of certain rooms during times when there's no need for them to be constrained. I also can keep the door propped open during times when I'm moving through the house a lot and letting my daughter follow me. I won't purchase another kind of gate now that I've been spoiled by this.
