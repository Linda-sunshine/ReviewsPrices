review/summary: I'm sitting in it right now...review/text: Cheapest one I could find anywhere on the internet... However, it works pretty well and is pretty sturdy, as long as you aren't too hard on it. Cushins (sp?) could be more comfortable and it sometimes clicks when it rocks but I can't complain for the price. Pretty quick/easy to assemble too with all items included (including needed tool). Thanks.
