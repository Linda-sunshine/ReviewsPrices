review/summary: Nothing else comes closereview/text: After baby outgrew size 1 I started wondering if I should try something different and a few moms onTighter budgets were claiming that Store and competitor brands were cheaper and the same . So like a suckerI went and bought several brands and it was all a waste of time & money. I found that pampers was a more luxurious diaper , better made, fit better etc etc and if your lucky like us and your baby sleeps for 6+ hoursIt's good to know it can hold a lot . I never had leak outs until I tried the other brands , so if your on the fence I would say how does that save money if your constantly changing a diaper and washing dirty clothes? If your worried about price I found amazon mom subscribe and save to be very competitive with no hassle and it arrives at my door ! Couldn't be happier
