review/summary: Good Enough for the Moneyreview/text: For the price, this chair is what you would expect to get! I looked at more expensive chairs at Babies R Us and other furniture stores and none of them were fantastic - so for the price of this chair, it is nice. The bottom cushion is pretty thin, however I'm sure we will add more foam/padding down the road. I haven't had any problems with the chair squeaking or creaking, but I haven't sat in it that much yet as my little one wont arrive for another few weeks. For now, I like the chair!
