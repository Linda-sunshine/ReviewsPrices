review/summary: Choose a size upreview/text: So glad I listened to the reviews on this site. The sizing chart said I would have easily fit into the extra-small range, but I ordered a small instead based on what other women have said.I'm 5"4 currently 126 pounds at 31 weeks and the small size fits perfectly at the second setting. I'm glad I have one more line of hooks to get me through the next few weeks. Don't listen to their sizing, it's completely off.That being said, when you do find the right size it's quite comfortable and offers some decent support for the expanding belly.
