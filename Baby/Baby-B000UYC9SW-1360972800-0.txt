review/summary: Not for mereview/text: I am not a &#34;carrier&#34; person. I like strollers much better; however sometimes it is not possible to bring stroller everywhere. I was looking for something simple and easy to carry my 11 month average size son in. I thought this was going to be easy to put on, but after trying it I gave up. I am 5.6 and 110 pounds and I ordered the small size. When I had a sweater on, it was very tight. I do not understand why, since I sometimes wear XS shirts. I tried to adjust it but it just didn't work. My son didn't like it and wanted out of it. The only positive was that the material and the color were nice. I returned this carrier, because I knew I wasn't going to use it. I ordered ring sling instead, and it works much better for me, because it is easy and fast to put on and off.
