review/summary: Skip the high chair...this was one of our best purchases!review/text: So we were looking to get one of those big fancy padded high chairs, but figured we would buy one of these to begin with, because we would need it for traveling anyway. We've been using this for over a year now and have yet to buy a high chair, and we're not planning to. This thing is so easy to clean and our daughter is yet to complain about not having a fancy padded high chair.The tray is great, we simply wash it in the sink when she's done eating, right along with her dishes. We have yet to really use the tray insert and cover. I believe we used it one time and if I remember right it did come in handy because we didn't have to wash the tray, we just put the cover on it.Pros:1) Inexpensive2) Easy to Clean3) Light4) Very PortableCons:1) None
