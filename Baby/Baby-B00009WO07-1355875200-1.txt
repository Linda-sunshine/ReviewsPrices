review/summary: Diaper quality issues, Damaged carton packagereview/text: The product quality has detiorated over the past one year. We have been using Pampers ever since my baby girl started using diapers. Of late, there has been several instances where the diaper does not hold up enough liquid as it used to, it wets the pants very often. I am unhappy with the shipments coming from Amazon too, the carton packages are most damaged when it arrives. Does not make me feel safe although the diapers are protected with the plastic foil inside. The price point is good, which is the only positive aspect to mention.
