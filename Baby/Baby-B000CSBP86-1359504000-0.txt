review/summary: Great - don't know what all the complaints are aboutreview/text: I stayed away from bjorn based on complaints of back pain. I tried an Ergo, but it's too small (me and DH are fluffy - lol). I've been using a Moby wrap, but didn't have time to deal with all that material during a trip. Bjorn is SUPER EASY to use and was very comfy for my fat little 21 lb 9 month old. She loved it and fell asleep in it. I even got DH to start baby wearing with this thing - something he said he'd never do.Highly recommend.
