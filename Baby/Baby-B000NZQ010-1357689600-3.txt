review/summary: Dancing baby/ great wheel feature!review/text: My 10 month old daughter loves this!! She has been cruising along couches for over a month, so I figured we'd try this out to help her practice walking. Pulled it out of the box, easily assembled it, and *POOF* I have a much more mobile baby! She loves all the buttons and lights, and dances to the music. This is her favorite now. Favorite feature: you can tighten the wheels so it doesn't fly faster than the baby can push it, without this feature, she'd probably had fallen face first. Great thinking VTech;)
