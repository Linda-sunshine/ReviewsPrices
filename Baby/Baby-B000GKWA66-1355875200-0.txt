review/summary: puts baby to sleepreview/text: I had this on my baby registry but I really liked it at the store and so I ended up purchasing it myself. And it is great. My baby loves it. She listens to the "play" setting everynight and she falls asleep to it. She is 7 months now and still listens to it everynight and now she actually cuddles it when she falls asleep. I love it.
