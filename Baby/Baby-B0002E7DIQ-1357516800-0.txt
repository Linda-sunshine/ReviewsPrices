review/summary: Wife approved!review/text: My wife has threatened to keep this in the bed AFTER giving birth to our son in a few weeks (she likes it that much). Sure, it takes up 80% of the width of a queen bed (with her in it) but she swears by it. What am I going to do, argue with a pregnant woman? HA! I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid.
