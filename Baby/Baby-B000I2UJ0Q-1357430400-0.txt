review/summary: 5 month old loves itreview/text: Baby loves to bounce in this thing and it keeps him entertained for a while. It's pretty well built and appears to be durable. It was fairly easy to assemble...probably took less than 30 minutes. We put a pillow underneath his legs so he can bounce a little better, otherwise he's on his tippy toes. I didn't give it 5 stars because one of the springs appears to have been preassembled backwards which makes the seat a little bit unbalanced on one side. It's not a big deal and I'm not concerned that they bouncer will topple over. I wish all the supporting bars had a toy hanging off of it instead of just the two because the baby likes to look up and reach for them.
