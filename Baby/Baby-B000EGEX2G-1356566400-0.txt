review/summary: No more than adequatereview/text: We purchased this glider in advance of our first baby. We purchased it primarily for the price, and I hoped it would be sufficient given some of the negative reviews. It is sufficient, but no more, and in hindsight with the hundreds of hours I have spent rocking & nursing her, I wish we had gone for a pricier, nicer glider.The bottom cushion is not the best quality and quickly became pretty warped/permanently indented. The arm rests are a ltitle short (they hit my arms in an uncomfortable place), and the chair doesn't give a lot of back support. I also wish the back was higher to give better head/neck support. I'm 5' 8&#34; and have to tilt my neck considerably to rest it on the back. It is hard to be comfortable after spending more than a couple minutes in this chair.19 months after purchasing this chair, we are expecting again and I have reluctantly purchased a nicer glider for baby #2. I hate having to buy another chair, when this one is still in decent shape (pro: the chair itself is in fine shape still!), but the thought of spending another 2 years or so rocking babies in this glider gives me a back-ache!
