review/summary: Perfect product for keeping baby happy and parents peace of mindreview/text: Ever have a crying baby and you are thinking to yourself, is it a hunger cry? Too tired? Wet diaper?This product puts peace of mind your hands with a fantastic wetness indicator from front to back that is yellow when dry and blue when wet. Taking one of the 3 main reasons that the baby is crying out of the equation just makes our lives as parents that much easier.Our daughter has had a couple of 'blowouts' but never anything that this diaper could not handle so far in her first 2 months. She has used these diapers from birth in the hospital until today and they have worked great. I highly recommend this diaper for all parents, couple this with a reasonable Amazon price and the 'Amazon Mom' program (even for the dads like me out there); you end up with a great all around buy. Sign up for regular delivery of these at a frequency that meets your family's needs and you'll thank yourself later.
