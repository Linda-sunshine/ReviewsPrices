review/summary: Fits all chairs and table heightsreview/text: Our son LOVES it! It's great to have him at the table with us. At first I was sad because I thought I was going to have to stack books so he could reach table height but I noticed there are adjustable heights on the bottom and once raised he fits perfectly! I wish we would have gotten this from the beginning rather than a high chair
