review/summary: The perfect match for my PoopMaster!review/text: Throughout my pregnancy, I was constantly told that breast is best and that breastfeeding is the best thing I could do for my newborn. Everyone, however, left out the part about the liquefied poop that seemed almost impossible to contain. At my son's birth, we were using Huggies Little Snugglers and had to do outfit changes at every bowel movement and on particularly bad days, even after urination. On a whim, I decided to try Swaddlers and haven't looked back. They leave less room around the baby's legs so they're much less susceptible to leakage. They've proven to be excellent at containing my little one's mushy poop if i fold down the top of the diaper in the back. I definitely don't mind this small modification as it has saved me and my furniture from being pooped on and has saved me money on my laundry bill.
