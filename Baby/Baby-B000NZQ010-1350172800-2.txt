review/summary: It was a hit!review/text: I bought this for my Granddaughter's first birthday. Unfortunately, I had to have it delivered to her because I am not in the same state, but my son (and the pictures) say she loves it! I can't really speak to the durability because she just got it, but I was not given any complaints. From the pictures it looks as if it is sturdy and very colorful and interactive, as shown here.
