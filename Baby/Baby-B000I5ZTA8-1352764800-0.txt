review/summary: Too Bigreview/text: After reading the reviews, I purchased a size up as many reviewers said this product ran small. I'm 33 weeks and weigh 170 pounds and decided to order the medium. It is definitely too big. It does not fall off, it stays on, but even on the tightest hook setting, it doesn't actually give me any support. I don't use it at all at this point. I should have just ordered the Small based on the product's weight chart.
