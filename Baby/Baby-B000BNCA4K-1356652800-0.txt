review/summary: Easy to handlereview/text: My little guy got this toy for christmas and took to it immediately, he is 4 months old and has been chewing on it and moving it from one hand to the other.The toy is very light weight and the "rings" make it very easy to handle and the softness make it perfect for chewing. I would have never expect my son to like it as much as he did and to tell the truth its not a toy that I would purchase but after seeing how much he enjoys it I would strongly recommend it for babies around the 4 month mark.
