review/summary: Misleading online specificationsreview/text: The specifications on Amazon state: can be used for a preterm infant. Once I opened the package, I see it states clearly: for babies between 8 and 35 pounds. And further inside" Never use for a preterm infant without seeking the advice of a healthcare professional." Obviously misleading. Our baby is not preterm, but on the small side at 5 lb. Why does the manufacturer exagerate the possible use of the product?
