review/summary: Amazing asset during the first few months!review/text: I bought this on a lark, not really expecting much and not being able to find anyone of my friends who had used such an item. I now recommend it to anyone I know who's going to breast feed, (although its uses extend past that, see below). I used this starting on day one and daily throughout the first 4 months. Around 2 months I started trying out an iPone app that logged nursing, pumping, bottles, diapers, food and more. I found that the Itzbeen was a much better solution early on and the iPone app was better after a few months. The Itzbeen was most useful for the first 2 or three months when logging everything in an iPhone app would become its own job. There are just too many feedings and diapers, especially in the middle of the night. The Itzbeen makes it easy you just hit a button and forget about it. And it's just as simple to read when you are wondering how long it's-been.In the early days I used it for:Time between feedingsLength of sleepTime on each side while feeding and pumpingKeeping track of left or right side(you can use it for diapers, I never did)With a toddler I use it for:MedicationTime-out-- It was an amazing asset during the first few months. I would recommend to any breast feeding moms-to-be.
