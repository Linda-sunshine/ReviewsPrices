review/summary: Exactly like LUVSreview/text: I ordered these after my daughter came home from daycare wearing a pampers diaper, and I loved it. Unfortunaltey, this was not the diaper she came home in. These are plastic and are not worth the money. With the exception of the cute prints, they are exactly like luvs, but a lot more expensive. I like LUVS, but thats not what I wanted/paid for. Also, the diaper I loved so much was actually a pampers cruiser. Which I did end up ordering the next time around. they are like swaddlers...soft, more cloth like.
