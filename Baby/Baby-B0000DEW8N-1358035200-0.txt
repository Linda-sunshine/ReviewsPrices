review/summary: Great for infants who start eating solid foods.review/text: I bought this to replace Fisher Price Space Saver High Chair. That chair was great because it reclined, allowing our young baby to sit at the table with us. However, that chair's seat has more of a rounded seat back, which caused my child to slouch/lean backwards when it was at its most upright position. When he was ready to start solids foods, I didn't want him slouching backwards, as it is a choking hazard. This Deluxe Booster chair has a 90-degree seat angle, which keeps my son upright and in a safe position for eating. Another benefit is that it doesn't have a fabric cover. So, no need to strip the seat for cleaning. The tan model has a height adjustment and the tray is a reasonable size that fits easily into most sinks.
