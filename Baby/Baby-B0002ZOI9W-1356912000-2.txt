review/summary: Best Infant Chair for the Money and for Refluxreview/text: I've tried out a number of chairs with both of my children, borrowed and purchased. My older daughter had a severe case of reflux and was never comfortable. Our original Ocean Wonders bouncy chair was our only respite from crying and spitting up. When my son was born 8 years later, I initially considered purchasing the updated version of the Ocean Wonders chair. We decided to borrow a Graco chair from a friend, first. My son was unenthralled with the Graco seat. On a whim, we decided to purchase a second seat and this was one was well-rated, inexpensive and I was intrigued by the angle and the rocking. Right off the bat, this was by far a superior seat to any we had previously used. My son preferred sleeping in this chair during the day, since the angle helped his reflux. Around 3 months, he would sit quietly for 30 minutes at a time batting at the toys while I prepared dinner (godsend after a long day at work). At 6 months, he loves to frantically kick his feet and rock himself wildly - still sitting happily for up to 30 minutes in this seat. Genius!Pros:-Inexpensive!-Good angle for reflux and sleeping. Not too angled for really small infants.-Toy bar is a bit boring but you can easily clip more exciting toys to the bar.-Singing lady bug that an older baby can activate.-Kickstand is great for napping infants.-Rocking is a lot of fun for a more active baby.Cons:-Assembly was miserable and solicited a lot of cursing from both of us.Tip: the bottom bars look the same, but they are not.-Older, stronger babies can flip themselves out. USE THE BELT.-Babies who can sit up are at danger of tipping it over-Singing bug's music is too short and tinny. Hard for small hands to pull.I would highly recommend this over more expensive chairs. The lifespan on a bouncy seat is so short. Why spend a lot of money? At least this one converts into something useful later on!
