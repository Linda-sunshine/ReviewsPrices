review/summary: Pregnancy + back 'N Belly = Better Sleepreview/text: This is my first pregnancy and I was glad i decided to invest in this. Sure I still don't sleep the whole night through because of nightly potty breaks but that's pretty much what I wake up for not because a pillow slips out of bed or aching hips. Occasionally I'll wake up to turn over, but it so much easier to get comfortable again without adjusting a zillion pillows. I had some trouble with the seam at the top of the pillow at first, but after breaking the pillow in a little it doesn't bother me. I remedied the problem at first by sleeping with the pillow upside down. I thought the purchase was way worth it.
