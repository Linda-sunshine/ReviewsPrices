review/summary: Fun toy, and a favorite in our house!review/text: I purchased this jumperoo when my daughter was 4 months old, she's now 8 months and still uses it daily. This toy is easy to put together and is easy to clean. My daughter loves to jump in this, and loves all of the toys-it keeps her occupied for about 30 minutes at a time. I would definitely recommend this product, and it was a great purchase for us!
