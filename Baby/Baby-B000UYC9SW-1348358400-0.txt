review/summary: Easy to use, awesome baby carrier!review/text: I can finally get things done around the house! Our baby needs to be held close to fall asleep and stay asleep. Within minutes of getting him in the K'tan, he is calmed down. It is much easier to use than other wraps I've seen and holds the baby securely. The K'tan now goes everywhere with me, even to work, where I can get lots done with him there. The only down side of the K'tan is that you have to buy a size, meaning it doesn't fit everyone. My husband is bigger than I am, so he cant use it and I don't want to buy two. Despite that,I absolutely love it and so does our little man!
