review/summary: Excellentreview/text: This is a great potty chair. It is simple but cute, doesn't take up too much space in the bathroom, and is very easy to clean because of the removable inner potty. The splash guard works really well for a girl, and we've had no leaks. Be careful, though, since the inner potty can get stuck to the child's bottom and create a mess if he/she gets up too fast. We learned this the first week, but since my daughter learned not to jump off her potty chair excitedly when she is done, we've had no accidents.
