review/summary: Portable...review/text: Bought this for my baby.We did not want to buy those expensive high chairs and after a few you kind of dispose it. This one you just secure it in a sturdy seat, and the baby is set to go.Portable... we bring it anywhere when we go out because it's durable, light weight and not bulky.Now my baby is done and old enough not to use it is perfectly stored, not occupying space in the garage until the next baby to use it.I may give it to a friend.
