review/summary: Works well and great simple sleek gate! Best value online for sure!review/text: Very happy with gate. Easy to install, looks great. Price and value is by far the best available online. I researched for at least an hour trying to find just the right gate. This is perfect! I also had a very standard size 30" opening. With a different size I could see possible issues if the extensions did not line it up quite right but the adjusters have a good 3" of travel on either side. I would just not trust it quite as much if they were fully extended. Pretty cool it comes with 2 extensions. I saw many other gates you have to buy the extensions separate. Also as a side note my 5 year old can open it just fine first try. We wanted that and my 2 year old can not. Perfect! Also keeps dog out. 3 for 1 :-)
