review/summary: Can be used carrying your child facing out!!review/text: I love the Moby wrap. Neither of my kids were willing to ride in a carrier facing inward after a time. Initially I thought (foolishly!) that I was therefore stuck using a Bjorn, which doesn't seem nearly as comfortable for my kids (though admittedly, neither ever complained). It also hurts my back more. Eventually I was googling and learned that there is a way to wrap the moby that allows you to face your child out. My daughter, who is about to turn one, LOVES it now. This is great because she's getting a little big for the Bjorn -- her weight seems to make her uncomfortable dangling from an unyielding piece of material between her legs. And neither kid liked the Ergo, they want to not only face out (not possible in an Ergo), but ride up closer to my face than the Ergo allowed. So the Moby allows a "kangaroo wrap" that works like a Bjorn. But the Moby is stretchy and my daughter doesn't seem to be uncomfortable dangling off my chest in it. She recently rode in it without complaint for almost two hours while I did my shopping. As you know if you have a baby just starting to walk, getting two hours of anything done without the baby screaming to be put down to practice walking is a big deal. So thank you, Moby. I just wish I'd figured this out in time to use with my son! I expect to get several more months of use out of this before my back tells me we're done.
