review/summary: Love our Jumperooreview/text: Purchased the Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo for my 3 month old daughter. At first she was too short to actually bounce but she loved to sit in the jumperoo and listen to music and watch the lights. As she has gotten bigger she can now jump up and down and spin herself around in the rotating seat. She loves the lights and colors and sounds. She likes to grab onto the different pieces at each station. It can be a little tricky to get a squirmy baby into the seat but once she is in there she has so much fun playing in it. Amazon had a great price and Free shipping so I couldn't pass it up and am glad we bought this. Would definitely recommend.
