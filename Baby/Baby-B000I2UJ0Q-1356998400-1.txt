review/summary: Best purchase so farreview/text: Watch your kids transform in this thing. Our 4 month old is like a different kid in his bouncer. He seems to really enjoy his independence and ability to be upright. He started bouncing immediately and laughs so much when showing us what he can do. Love the theme, the colors, the snack tray, the mobility, the price... Highly recommend.
