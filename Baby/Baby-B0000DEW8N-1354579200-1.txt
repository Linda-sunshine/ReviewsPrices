review/summary: Perfect for my needreview/text: My new granddaughter came to visit family for the first time at 8 months old and this was a perfect booster chair for her. We could take it with us and always had a secure seat for her. Probably not what you'd want as your one and only little chair but certainly works great at &#34;Grandma's House&#34; ... easy to clean and attached securely to almost any chair. Highly recommend!
