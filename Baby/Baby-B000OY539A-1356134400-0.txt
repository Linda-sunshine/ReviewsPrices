review/summary: Not a fanreview/text: I can totally see the benefit of using this and the material is great and very soft, however, I did not enjoy this so much. Lots of fabric to wrap around and I'm not the most patient which is probably why this didn't work for me. I also had a very small baby so she slipped right through, I was worried about suffocation risks so I took her out. Another thing to consider is when you've got a screaming newborn, do you really want to be fussing over all this fabric? I ended up buying the baby hawk and it worked great for us.
