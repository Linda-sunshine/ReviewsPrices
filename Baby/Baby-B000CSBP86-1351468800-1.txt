review/summary: Great carrier for a newborn!review/text: Before our son was born we had planned to use a Moby Wrap or a Baby K'tan as the main carrier until he reached 3+ months when we planned to switch to an Ergo Baby carrier. I experienced extreme frustration with the wraps and did not feel comfortable carrying my 3 week old son in them. I constantly worried that his chin was touching his neck or that he was in an uncomfortable position.We decided to purchase the Baby Bjorn Classic carrier to use for at least the first 3 months and possibly longer. My husband loves this carrier and so far he has not experienced any back issues. I've also carried my little guy in the carrier a couple of times and haven't had any issues with it at all. It is extremely easy to put the baby in and out of the carrier.
