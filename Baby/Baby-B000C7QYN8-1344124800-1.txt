review/summary: Love these wipes...but a $10 price increase?!?!?!review/text: I have loved these wipes since I began using them right after our first baby was born. But now just 6 months later they suddenly jumped in price over $10!!! Why the stiff price increase? I'm so disappointed especially since it seems as though it is a common practice for this brand to use deceptive sales practices including decreasing the size of their product and changing the ingredients. I really want to use the healthiest products for my baby and the planet but I can't go broke doing so.
