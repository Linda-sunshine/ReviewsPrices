review/summary: Love this toy!review/text: My grandson used this a lot when he was a crawler. Then when he started walking, he loved pushing ti around. So many activities and I love how the unit detaches from the wheel base. VTech makes a nice toy that captures the interest of a baby and toddler with a variety of sights, sounds, and tactile stimulation.
