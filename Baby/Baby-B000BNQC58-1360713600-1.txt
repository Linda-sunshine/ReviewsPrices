review/summary: Super cute and practicalreview/text: This is much better than the &#34;name brand&#34; version. It's durable, less expensive, comes with a back story, you can switch it to &#34;off&#34; to avoid wasting the battery and has a timer to turn itself off. 3 different color lights. I put it in a different spot each night and we make a game out of finding the moon.
