review/summary: Excellent gate!review/text: For a few different reasons, my family had need to keep our German Shepherd out of the children's bedrooms in my house. With my kids being pre-school aged, a cheaper gate-less gate was out of the question. After doing a little bit of research, I decided to pay a little bit extra (but still at the lower end of the spectrum) for the North States Supergate, and couldn't be happier. With both extensions attached, it sits VERY snugly in the hallway. The difference in width due to the floor molding doesn't matter in the least, and even with my kids occasionally hanging their body weight against the gate, or my dog plopping herself down in front of it - her body weight pushing against it - the pressure screws haven't budged an inch in the month that we've had it.The gate itself is very easy to use. It "locks" with a twist, although it does not appear that even locking it is necessary, it just makes the top of the gate a bit more sturdy. Both of my children can open it with no problem at all, though I will say that it may be a struggle for a toddler up to about 3 years of age. The gate is not huge, but it should do in any doorway and most hallways that are not completely over sized. Just make sure that you check the dimensions listed and actually measure the width of where ever you want to put this gate, and if it works, you will not be disappointed!
