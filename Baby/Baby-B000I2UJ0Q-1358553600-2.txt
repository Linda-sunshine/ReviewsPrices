review/summary: The best!review/text: My 6 month old daughter LOVES this bouncer! It's her favorite thing to do. There is so much to look at and spin and touch that keeps her attention and when she starts bouncing her smile couldn't get any bigger. It's a bit pricey, but for me it was worth every penny!
