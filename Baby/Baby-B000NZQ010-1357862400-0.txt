review/summary: L-O-V-E it. One of the best toys for our babyreview/text: I bought this for my baby when she was 5 months old. She could sit up with some help but not crawl, and this toy was perfect for her to sit at and play with. When she got better at moving around we could take the face off and set it on the floor, and she could crawl to it and hover over it to play. She is almost 9 months now and still loves this toy. She pulls up on it, pushes it across the floor & plays with all the components on the front. She loves it, so we love it. One of the best toys I've bought.
