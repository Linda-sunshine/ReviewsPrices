review/summary: loved it except when......review/text: I loved this pillow except when it came time to turn in bed. I agree it's like a wrestling match.think I may have wacked my husband a few times with it to. Lol Other then that I totally loved it. I found i got more support when i folded it in half and hugged it with the other side reminding me not to sleep on my back. Also great for people with back problems. I have had conic pain in my back and watching tv with my hubby was nearly impossible without paying for it. Once again with the Snoogle folded in half kinda like a horseshoe, it gave me much comfort to enjoy movie night again! Unfortunately our new dog took over my original one and we are expecting baby two so here I am to buy another. Happy Snoogling!
