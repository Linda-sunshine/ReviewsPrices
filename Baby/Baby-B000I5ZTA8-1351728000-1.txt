review/summary: Good fit, easy to usereview/text: I've had it for about a week. I actually ordered a size medium based on other reviews, even though I fit squarely in the size small weight range. Well, they sent a small! But it's very fortuitous because the small fits well. I'm 5'11", was about 130 before the pregnancy, and I'm about 155 now, at 6 months pregnant. I'm wearing it on the smallest setting and it fits great, so I think it will work well for the rest of the pregnancy. I think some of the confusion about sizing depends on how your weight is distributed. I would say, if you are a tall, lean sort of person, follow the manufacturer's guidelines, because your weight is more spread out and you're likely to be less big around, thus allowing you to fit into the smaller size. Just my thoughts, anyway.My problem is that my baby is sooo low and pressing down on everything, so I'm wearing the band to help hold everything up and relieve pressure on my groin and hips. I've been wearing it for a week, and it's decreased my pain dramatically. I can go almost the whole day without any significant hip or groin pain, as long as I don't overexert myself, whereas without the band I was experiencing pain soon after waking up. I'm going to wear this thing until I deliver! Thankful for it!
