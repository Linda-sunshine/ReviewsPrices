review/summary: Only use for small, small stuffed animals!review/text: I was able to fit 8 very small stuffed animals and 3 medium sized ones in the hammock. Not impressed at all. I would have to buy 6 to hold my daughters collection (which is not very large at all) Expected it to hold a lot more, pointless purchase as I still have an overflowing toy box.
