review/summary: Great Choice!review/text: I love this pillow. It has made it much more comfortable to sleep at night. I have had this pillow for almost 2 months now. It hasn't smashed down like most pillows do. It still has the same shape as the day I got it. I am 7 1/2 months pregnant. This pillow has helped me to be more comfortable so that I am able to sleep almost the whole night. I highly recommend this pillow to pregnant women.
