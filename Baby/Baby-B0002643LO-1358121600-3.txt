review/summary: Perfect Condition; great savings off in store pricereview/text: These diapers say &#34;used&#34; in the description, but that just refers to the outer box/packaging being slightly crushed or torn. The diapers themselves and the inner sealed plastic they are in are absolutely fine. This is a significant savings off of in store prices for the same amount of diapers. The quality of the diaper is also good. The diaper is cut a little wider than some other brands, which is nice for taller, larger children. We had some problems with leaking when our child was in a lower size, but realized the weights for children overlap in Pampers sizes; switching to the next size up solved the issue.
