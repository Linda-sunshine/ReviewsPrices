review/summary: Awful and bad for your babyreview/text: This carrier dangles your baby from his/her crotch. Get an ergonomic carrier, like a Beco or Ergo where the baby actually sits. Don't let your baby dangle in a way you would never want to. If you don't believe me, sit on the arm of your couch on your crotch. That is what baby feels. We hated it. Also, kills the back. No support whatsoever and baby will outgrow it super fast. Also, facing out is wrong. Baby has nowhere to hide his face from the world or seek comfort from mom or dad. And they inevitably fall asleep with the head dangling. I don't know who designed this or why it is so popular but don't let the price and all the celebrities draw you to it. It really is an awful carrier once you've tried what a real baby carrier should be.
