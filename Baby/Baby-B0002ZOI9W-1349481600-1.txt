review/summary: He loves it!review/text: My son absolutely loves this chair. he is 12 weeks old and I have had it since about 6 weeks. I wanted to to give ample time before reviewing. He loves to sit in it and watch me make dinner. While others complain about the rocker mode, my son seems to love it. While I never leave him in it unattended I find that when I pump in the morning, I cant put him in it and set it at me feet and gently rock it. By no means will I leave him in the rocker mode unatteneded. But it is a nice change sometime for the baby so they don't get sick of it. all in all we love it!
