review/summary: Good ideareview/text: I've always been one to write down times if I need to keep track of something throughout the day (like med doses or newborn feedings) so this came in handy for me w/ a newborn. Now that baby is older I don't use as much unless giving medicine, it helps me keep track of how long ago the last dose was given; which may not seem like its easier than just writing it down but it works for me. It's also convenient if you have a newborn and you're breast feeding and trying to keep a routine of pumping.
