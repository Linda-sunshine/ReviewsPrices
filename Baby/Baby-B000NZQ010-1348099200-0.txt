review/summary: My son loves it!review/text: I bought this for my 10 month old son after he started using cardboard boxes as walkers. I figured that this would be a better solution than a wobbly box. He loves this thing and now at 11 months has started talking steps on his own here and there but still loves to whizz around the whole house with this. The activity board on the front keeps him entertained as well., he lovers pressing all the buttons and hearing the sounds and music. The only negative thing is that the activity board clips onto the front and is not very stable and tends to fall off pretty much well every time my son uses the walker. It's not really a big deal, just annoying. All in all, I would still recommend this product.
