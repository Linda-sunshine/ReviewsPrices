review/summary: Great Product, works well, very multifunctional, stores wellreview/text: I bought one of these to cordon off areas from my 1 yr old and 3 yr old. it worked great. It is very multifunctional and can be configured for many uses. We even used it as a temporary crib around a mattress. I bought another set and love how easy they are to store when not in use. Of note, it is cheaper to buy a new set than to buy the individual pieces. Don't worry, having more of these is worth it.
