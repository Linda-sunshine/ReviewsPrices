review/summary: didn't work out for mereview/text: I gave birth in July and I live in the South, so it is unbearable hot to wear this, add the wrapping technique and you get a very very very frustrated and sweaty me (I don't sweat almost at all). My daughter hated being in the Moby wrap. Thanks to a friend of mine who gave me Over the Shoulder Baby Holder I get to carry my baby around other wise I wouldn't have. I hope I can sell it to at least make something out of it, I have worn it maybe 5 times in 3mo :( I know it works for some people but not me...
