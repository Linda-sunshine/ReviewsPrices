review/summary: Best Baby Toy Ever!!!review/text: This Toy is great and well worth the price!when i first saw the toy i liked it but i thought it was a little expensive for what it was but i ended up finding it at a garage sale and got it for cheap and my son ended up loving this toy from about 3 weeks and up he is now almost 6 months and still, this is his favorite toy!I encourage anyone to buy this toy if something happened to my sons i would pay just about anything to replace it he loves it!the thin plastic colorful "piping" makes it super easy for tiny hands to grab and its a great teeter too!everyone seems to think toys that make noise ad light up will be best and keep baby's attention longer but i have found that when the music stops that my son really doesn't care for those toys much at all...but this simple toy he LOVES, it keeps him entertained for hours!
