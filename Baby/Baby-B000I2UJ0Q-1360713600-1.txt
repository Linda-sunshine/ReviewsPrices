review/summary: Not my daughter's favorite.review/text: I think this is one of those toys that depend on the baby. My daughter likes it okay but gets fussy quickly. She only goes in it once or twice a day for a couple of minutes.That said, it is awesome to have a place to put her when I have to use the restroom or vacuum or something. It's sturdy and well made.My daughter is only 6 months so I'm not giving up yet!
