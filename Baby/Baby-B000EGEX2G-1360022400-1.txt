review/summary: I am satisfiedreview/text: I was a bit skeptical, based upon other users ripping on this glider. However, I can tell you that I have no squeaking issues, whatsoever, and it has been used multiple times per day for the last 4+ months. I checked the hardware, when it initially arrived and high quality definitely does not come immediately to mind. The wood and fabric is fine, but the glider hardware has been cheaped-out on (duh, what else would you expect in this price range?!). What I did was disassemble the glider and ottoman and repack the bearings and it has been smooth sailing the whole time.
