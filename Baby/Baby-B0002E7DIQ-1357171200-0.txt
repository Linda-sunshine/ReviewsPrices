review/summary: Great Pillow!review/text: This pillow offers great support and replaces the six I use at night. My only qualm is that the pillow was about 15 dollars cheaper the day after I purchased it. :(I immediately began using the pillow out of the box. It's great for support not only in the bed, but for sitting on the couch as well. Seems like it definitely can be used for breastfeeding support!Though it was a bit pricey...I love it!
