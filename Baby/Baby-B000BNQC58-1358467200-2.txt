review/summary: So cute!review/text: Got one for a niece and thought it was so cute bought one for ourselves. I had and still have glow in the dark stars in the room I grew up in. This is a great portable alternative to putting those glow in the dark stars all over. Different look than glow in the dark stars hung from fishing line, but color change ability is great. Hasn't burnt out yet. Amber shows up plenty fine when lights are out. Green and blue are very vibrant. Auto off timer is nice too. Use it nightly!
