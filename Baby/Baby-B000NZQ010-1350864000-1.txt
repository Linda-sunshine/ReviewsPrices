review/summary: Great Learning Toyreview/text: This walker is the perfect height for new walkers. The wheels can adjust to two speeds and the detachable face feature is excellent. Just make to sure to turn toy "off" in the night as it is easily activated. My daughter and her visiting toddler cousins love it! So glad I bought it. Very eductaional and interactive, most of all very well proced!
