review/summary: Hours of entertainment, good purchasereview/text: Initialy, we were gonna go with the baby Einstein bouncer, until I read all the reviews that said the electronics didn't work properly or broke easily. So we went with the rainforest jumperoo, and have been very pleased. It was easy to assemble, easy to adjust the height, and has a variety of activities to keep baby boy busy. He's Spent many hours I using this toy. My only criticism would be that it does not fold, store, or transport easily.
