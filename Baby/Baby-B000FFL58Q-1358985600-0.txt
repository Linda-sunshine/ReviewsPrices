review/summary: 3 month old baby fell in love with it!review/text: This is by far the most needed baby product for moms that need a good 15 mins to either eat, do some chores, or even take a shower (never leave the baby unsupervised though....yes that means place it in a safe spot you can see while in the bathroom). The mat is super cute and colorful and the toys are very entertaining for the little one. I watch him as he lays on the mat and tries to kick and grab different hanging toys. The music/light feature is great too. My baby just figured out that he controls the music (it makes noises every time he successfully grabs any of the hanging toys) and he is smitten! This gym is definitely a lifesaver for both the baby to enjoy and learn as well as stay entertained during tummy time and for the parents that need a break from the baby. This product is a must!
