review/summary: Great Buy!review/text: This product is well made, easy to assemble and looks just like the photo. The back of the seat can either be positioned slightly back or slightly forward, and the bottom of the rocker can either be set to rock or be stabilized in a more reclining position. I have a three-year-old granddaughter who is light enough to still sit in it, and six-month-old twin grandsons (I have two of these rockers) who can sit and play or recline and sleep. The cloth covering is easy to remove and wash. None of the kids like the vibrating option on the chair. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to have a chair for an infant to play or nap in. It would not be worth the purchase to buy it for an older toddler.
