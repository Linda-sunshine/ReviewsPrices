review/summary: Not Pleasedreview/text: I ran out of wipes and ran to the store. Fearing there would only be chemical-laden huggies wipes, I was happy when I saw the 7th Gen. unscented wipes. I grabbed two. I'd never used them before, but their diapers are awesome and I figured it wasn't a risk.So wrong! Besides the fact that they visibly remove gunk from the trunk, I noticed on the very first use that a super-strong UNPLEASANT odor remained on my baby's tush, and that was only in trying to remove urine. I used another wipe thinking that would do it, and no-go. The odor remaining seems to be worse than if I hadn't wiped my baby at all. Super super musty, urine-y. As for wiping a poopy baby, the same goes, now making the poop/must smell even worse. I don't get it. On their own, the wipes don't have a smell. I grabbed another brand 'natural' wipe that I had on-hand to try to get rid of the smell, and poop smell gone with one wipe.I will never get the 7th gen. unscented again. Ever. I might try the fragrance wipes, since otherwise it seemed okay if a little thin.My recent favorite is the Jackson Reece Herbal Baby Wipes. Wow! But they are out of stock everywhere right now. I'm fed up with wasting money on trying wipes that don't work for me, so I finally had to order the JR brand from Canada.
