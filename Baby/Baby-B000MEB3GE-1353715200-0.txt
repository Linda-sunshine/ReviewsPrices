review/summary: Brain saver!review/text: I decided to purchase this while I was still in the hospital after having my second child. I knew that once I returned home and was home all day with the baby and my three year old, that life would be a blur and I wouldn't remember how long it had been since the baby had been changed and things like that. My husband set this up for me the minute it arrived and now, three months later, we still use it every day! It's so nice to hand off to a babysitter and easy for the sitter too as they don't have to try to remember anything either. We didn't use the sleep button at first. I figured there wasn't much point. The baby's going to sleep however long he wants. But, now that he's starting to sleep longer at night, we have been using it to track how long he's sleeping at night because I can't always remember what time it was when he fell asleep. While I was exclusively nursing him, the Dr. said we needed to give our baby Vitamin D supplements everyday. The bonus button helped us remember to do that, too. We even put an alarm on that button so when it got to be 24hrs without being reset, it would remind us that we need to give the baby his vitamins. The only thing that kept me from giving this item 5 starts is the fact that I had it clipped onto my pocket and caught it on the arm of the rocking chair and the hinge broke off so it doesn't clip anymore. At first I was really bummed about it and tried to find a case to put in it so I could keep it on me at all times, but we've adjusted and have found a convenient location to let this sit and I still remember to reset the buttons after taking care of my little guy. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and have already recommended it to several of my friends who are expecting. I can see this becoming my "go to gift" whenever I'm invited to a baby shower.
