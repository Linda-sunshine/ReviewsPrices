review/summary: Simple, easy potty-trainingreview/text: This is a great potty for potty training. I use this for my 2 year old, and it's a good size for him to sit on. It also has a pee-pee guard (I'm sure there's a technical name for it), so he doesn't spray all over when sitting down. It's very easy to pull the white part out and clean it with each use. It's also very, very light, so I can carry it up and down the stairs to different bathrooms. Good buy.
