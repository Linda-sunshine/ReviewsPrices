review/summary: my son loves it and i love it - absolutelyreview/text: This thing rocks, no wait, it jumps :) My son is besotted with it. easy to set up and with a variety of play things to keep the little one busy. he especially likes the rollable sun and frog. we started using it once he turned 5 months and though he took a couple of days to adjust, he soon became pro at turning the seat and using the toys. of course he still cant reach the hanging birds but i do see him trying to catch them. just a matter of time. and i love it since it allows me spare time to do my stuff. the baby is safe and happy and so is mommy. the only flip side is my son drools constantly on the seat cover and i dunno how to take it out to wash it. so now i always put a bib around him when he is there so that he can drool onto the bib... buy it, you cant go wrong !
