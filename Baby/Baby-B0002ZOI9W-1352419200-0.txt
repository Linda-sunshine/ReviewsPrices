review/summary: Not so great when baby can sit on her ownreview/text: This seat was a shower gift and I have used it since birth with my little girl. At first it worked great, the vibrate feature was wonderful and I could put her down in this for a nap in the living room or wherever. The "kickstand" keeps it from rocking when they are infants and puts it at a better angle for sleeping so their head doesn't drop forward. It is a little bulky and cumbersome to move this seat around though..especially trying to hold a newborn! The dangling toys did catch her attention and we would often put the seat next to the table and she would bat at her toys while we ate dinner. The music is kind of irritating...not something you want to hear over and over again. Now that she is bigger it is not working out so great for us anymore,the kickstand puts the seat at an awkward angle for her to sit up on her own and the toy bar has to be taken off because now they hit her in the face. However, with the kickstand down, she can now rock the seat, but isn't big enough to control herself and tips it over...forward. I discovered this while she was in the seat and I was in the shower. The seat belt kept her from hitting her face on the floor, but since she now wants to lean forward to get toys that fall...we can no longer use this seat until she's old enough to use it simply as a rocking chair.
