review/summary: This Carrier ROCKS!review/text: I love this carrier/sling. Just got it a couple days ago and tested it right away by putting my 2 month old preemie in it. He loved it and fell asleep immeditely. He loves being close to the chest so this is wonderful. Not too complicated to use, but I will surely save the instructions for all the different ways to wear the carrier. very happy with this purchase...and it may just be the new gift I give to all new Moms!
