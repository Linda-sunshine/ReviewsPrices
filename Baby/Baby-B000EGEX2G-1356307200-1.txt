review/summary: Easy to assemble & comfortable to use...I like itreview/text: This set is easy to assemble and comfortable to use. I like it because it does not make a noise when it glides and the cushion on the chair on ottoman is comfortable. The covers on the handle are good and the back rest is comfortable as well. The wood on this set is also high-quality and cleanly cut. The chair is not heavy to lift or move. I would recommend this set to anyone & everyone.
