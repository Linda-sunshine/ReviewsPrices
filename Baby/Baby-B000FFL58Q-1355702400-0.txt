review/summary: Made my baby coo at 4 and 1/2 weeks!review/text: I wasn't sure when I got this play gym if my baby would be able to use it because he was still so little. Also, as a first time mom everything is so new, I had no idea what was appropriate for him at this age and what wasn't. However, based on all the reviews here left by people who purchased it for their infants, I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did! My baby loves it. The first time I put him on it he just looked and looked. You could tell he was taking it all in and was trying to figure it all out. Then he started making cooing sounds! Before this I had heard maybe one or two coos where you think it was a coo but you aren't one hundred percent sure. Well, this time there was no doubt. He made about 6 or so distinct cooing sounds. It was so cute. The first time you hear it is really special and sweet. I captured it on video and sent it to family members. Every time we put him on the mat he makes cooing noises. I highly recommend this mat for people with newborns. Give it a try!
