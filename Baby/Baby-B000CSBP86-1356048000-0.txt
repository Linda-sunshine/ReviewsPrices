review/summary: Happy Babyreview/text: My wife and I received this Baby Bjorn as an early Christmas present. It has, undoubtedly been the most convenient way to carry our son around. He is happy and always has some sort of stimulus to keep him distracted from teething. The carrier is easy enough to get the child into single-handedly. Also very comfortable. Spent an entire day going through airports and shops without a bit of discomfort.
