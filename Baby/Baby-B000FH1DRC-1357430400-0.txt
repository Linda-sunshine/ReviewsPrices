review/summary: Good quality diapers and great fit for my babyreview/text: We have used swaddlers since day 1 and are very satisfied. They've always been a great fit and hold almost everything in. My daughter (luckily for us) sleeps 11-12 hours at a time, so the diaper is often full in the morning. But no mess!Important to note: while we are very happy with Pampers, we've also had stages where they didn't always fit perfect - translation: multiple &#34;blowouts&#34;. Other brands might fit better on your baby. No brands seemed to fit for a two week stretch in her 8th month.We've since moved onto baby dry and cruisers and are also happy.
