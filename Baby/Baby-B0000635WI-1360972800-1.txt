review/summary: Worth every pennyreview/text: so comfy and supportive. I can finally get a full nights sleep!! Started using it the start of second trimester and am now almost in my third and it's been the best. I even looped it up when I had a horrible cold and it kept me elevated enough where I didnt cough so much or get as stuffy as I would laying flat.
