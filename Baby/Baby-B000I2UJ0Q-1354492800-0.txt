review/summary: Best jumpy!review/text: I can't figure out why jumpy's these days don't actually jump. They are these silly little saucers and the kids don't get to bounce. This was a hand-me down for us and was so great. My son loved bouncing in it for months. Started at about 4.5 months and used it multiple times a day for months. Same advice for a bouncy chair- make sure it bounces! They love to bounce and it's good for them to be able to move.
