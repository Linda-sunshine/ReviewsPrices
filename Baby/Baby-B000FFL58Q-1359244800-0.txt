review/summary: Seems like funreview/text: We receive this as a baby shower gift. It seems like fun with the cute characters and prints. It was able to keep my baby entertained for about 20 - 30 minutes each time. Those butterflies are useless. The description says "butterflies spin at baby's touch"; but, it's way too high for young babies to reach. It would be better if the manufacture had put a motor in it.
