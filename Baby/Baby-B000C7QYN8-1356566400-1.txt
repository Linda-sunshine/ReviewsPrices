review/summary: Great brand, the newer version is betterreview/text: Pros: Alcohol free, doesn't have a lot of the chemicals that the others have (honestly, who wants to rub chemicals into their genitals), next to not using baby wipes at all, I don't think you'll find a safer product to use on your kids sensitive areas.Neutral: They are not that moist so if you've forgotten to change a poopy diaper for awhile and poop is dried on, its either going to take some persistent rubbing action (no fun for your kid) or better yet, just get the first one moist in the sink (if possible) and it works just fine.Cons: They use a sticker instead of a clicking latch to secure the opening for the wipes which after awhile, loses its adhesive properties = even more dry wipes. Also, you'll sometimes intend to pull out one and 3 will come out. Lastly, sometimes they don't come out that easily (or 3 come out as mentioned prior) which when you're trying to do 5 things with only 2 hands, is frustrating.Update: We recently purchased one at a local store (Target or something like that) and for some reason, they were way more moist, as if they upgraded their product. It was the greatest thing since sliced bread. But when our subscription of wipes came in from Amazon about a week later, they were still the old product. Maybe Amazon just had older stock and the next one will be the newer, more moist ones. We're crossing our fingers. If so, this rating will be a 5.
