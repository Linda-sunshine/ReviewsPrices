review/summary: Fun, Durable & Educational!review/text: Pros:DurableBatteries are long lastingHUGE age range for play!My son started playing with it at 4 month old and still plays with it at 15 months!Taught him how to walkStill walks around with itKids can dance to the musicHas interesting features to keep children's attention (peek-a-boo doors, upbeat music, etc)Cons:My only complaint would be the phone. It falls right off and gets lost. Everything else is on a string of some sort, so if the phone was as well it would provide more use other than getting lost amongst the other toys. Not a huge complaint, but its all we had.Overall:I would buy this again and again! It was definitely worth it and my son still plays with it at 15 months old!
