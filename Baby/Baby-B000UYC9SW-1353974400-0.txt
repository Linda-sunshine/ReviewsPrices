review/summary: Best carrier aroundreview/text: I love how simple it is to get this carrier in place and baby in it. I am able to sit, stand and bend over with this carrier on which is great for getting stuff done around the house. My baby loves it. She likes to snuggle her head right on my chest and falls sleep within minutes of being put in it. The cost of this is fractions of what the more expensive, more complicated carriers are. The best carrier I've had.
