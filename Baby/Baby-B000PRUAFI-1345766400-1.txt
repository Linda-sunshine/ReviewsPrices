review/summary: North States Gatereview/text: I bought this to keep my dogs out of the kitchen and I love it! It's sturdy enough for my husky yet so simple to use. I didn't want to attach anything to my door jams so I didn't use the mounting cups that came with it, you don't need them. It took me 10 minutes, start to finish to install and I didn't need any tools. I like the fact that the gate swings both ways, closes behind me if I need it to and it can be set so that the gate stays open when I want to give the dogs free range. I wish that I would have bought one sooner.
