review/summary: My 3year old best friend at nightreview/text: My little daughter received this as a present on from her grandparents on her birthday. I couldn' t explain her face when she saw all those stars in her room...it was lovely. Since we have a new baby in the house we were having troubles again to get her to sleep all night but with this night light she's doing fine and we're happy too.
