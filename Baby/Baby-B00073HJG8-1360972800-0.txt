review/summary: Easy to install, but is this really "jumbo" sized?review/text: I bought this for my son's room and it was easy to install and a decent size compared to the toy hammocks you can buy at Walmart. However jumbo sized is not what I would call it. This net holds about 15 14&#34; stuffed animals.
