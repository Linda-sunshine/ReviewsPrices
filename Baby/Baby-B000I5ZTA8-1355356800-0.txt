review/summary: Such a Relief!review/text: I recommend these to anyone who is expecting and still working. Or to anyone who has had life-long hip problems that were only enhanced due to pregnancy! It does relieve pain and offer support and was a great price to boot! I wear it off and on at work, because if I don't take it off and get a breather it becomes uncomfortable and tight. But I put it on in the morning and by afternoon am ready to take it off and the pain doesn't increase. It's been very beneficial.
