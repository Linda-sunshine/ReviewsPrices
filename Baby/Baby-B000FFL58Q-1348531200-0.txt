review/summary: Grand baby loves it, what else matters?review/text: We bought this for our first Grand child; it has lots of different activities, colors and things to do. She is now six months old and she is totally enthralled with it. She gets excited to play with it and it holds her attention, it also helps her exercise and work on her coordination. If I had any compliant it is that it uses three C batteries which is kind of odd. Hardly anything uses C batteries and they only come in 2, 4 or some larger even number. So if you buy a four pack you are stuck with one useless battery.
