review/summary: Love This!review/text: My daughter is 13 months old and we&#8217;ve used this just about every night since she was born! She loves the stars it projects on the ceiling and it provides the perfect amount of ambient lighting (not too much light as to keep her awake, but enough that she has something to look at on the ceiling as she falls asleep). I do wish the stars would move around a little, the stars that are projected are stagnant and do not move at all. But my daughter doesn&#8217;t seem to mind and enjoys them just the same. It&#8217;s nice that there are three different light colors to choose from - blue, green and amber. We usually just stick with the green (which is the default color when you turn it on). But it&#8217;s nice to have the option to change.We bought one of these turtles for my 2 year old niece and she LOVES this! She is obsessed with lights lately, and she carries her turtle around, turning off the lights in the house and projecting the stars from the turtle on the walls. She is fascinated by it and now she refuses to go to sleep at night without her &#8220;turtle stars.&#8221; This item seems to be a favorite amongst all the little ones, and I highly recommend it. It makes for a fabulous gift for a young toddler&#8217;s birthday or a baby shower.
