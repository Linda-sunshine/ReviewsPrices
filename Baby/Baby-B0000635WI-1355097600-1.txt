review/summary: Worked well for pregnancyreview/text: This worked well for my pregnancy and I didn't mind it breaking down over time. Now that I am no longer pregnant I actually DO mind that it broke down. So it is okay, and worth it while you are pregnant, but it isn't really for a daily use multi-year or multi-pregnancy pillow.
