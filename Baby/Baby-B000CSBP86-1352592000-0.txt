review/summary: Not a "Must-Have" - a "Must-NOT"review/text: This carrier is one of the worst on the market, but has somehow gotten hyped as the "Must-Have" baby item. I even had one for a while - until I learned better. No infant should have his weight supported by his crotch - proper carriers place the legs in a frog-like position, hugging you tummy-to-tummy. Infants require adequate head/neck support as well as the ability to tune out overstimulation - the Bjorn leaves baby hanging both literally and figuratively when in the (again overhyped) forward-facing position. As if that weren't enough, the distribution and shape of the Bjorn straps are a recipe for killer shoulder and back pain. A good carrier will let you carry on normal daily activities while babywearing - without back pain. I was so dissatisfied with my Bjorn after just a few weeks that I tossed it rather than inflict it on an unsuspecting garage saler.If you want a buckling, soft-structured carrier, go with a safe, comfortable choice like the Kindercarry, Beco, or Ergo. These carriers will allow you to carry your baby with ease through toddlerhood. I'm no athlete, but I can easily hike 30 minutes with my 32lb toddler on my back in a Kindercarry.For newborns, I highly recommend the Sleepywrap/Boba Wrap or Moby Wrap. While it takes a little practice initially, the comfort for both of you is amazing in a stretchy wrap. I wasn't as big a fan of the Moby - the Boba is more stretchy and comfy to me - but I think many folks could go either way between them. The stretch wraps are generally most comfortable to around 20lbs.The Boba website has some excellent information on babywearing and positioning here: [...]
