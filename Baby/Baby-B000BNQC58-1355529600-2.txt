review/summary: Make your child feel safe at night.review/text: This is the second night light I have purchased and it is so much nicer then the cheaper ones you will see in the stores this year.Bought the first one last year (turtle) for may sweet grand-girl (4 years old), and she loves it. She fall asleep with it each night. She now has a &#34;foster&#34; sister (2 years old) and she wanted one for &#34;her room&#34;! Got her the Lady Bug to this Christmas.
