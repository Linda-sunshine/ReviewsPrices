review/summary: Great for my persian catreview/text: My cat's eyes have to be cleaned twice everyday to avoid infection. I used vet recommended wipe before which he didn't like at all. Then I changed to 7th generation, the price is good which is only 1/3 of the vet wipe and my cat seems to prefer this wipe. As cats are more sensitive to the smell, I suppose the wipe is more natural. Great price with good quality.
