review/summary: Surprised and Impressedreview/text: I'm 30 weeks pregnant and have had horrible hip pain while sleeping since about week 20, when I started making an effort to get used to sleeping on my side. I'm usually a back-sleeper, so this was a tough transition! If I slept on my left, I'd wake up with intense hip pain on that side, so I'd switch to the right and sleep on that til right-side hip pain woke me. I was using a regular body pillow, but it just didn't cut it. Finally, after reading a bunch of reviews, I ordered the Snoogle. I thought it was kind of expensive, but I was desperate. I didn't expect much, but the Snoogle surprised me! I'm sleeping SO much better and have much, much less hip pain!!! The Snoogle allows me to sleep with my back supported so that I'm still on my side, but a little more on my back than before, while still providing support for my growing baby belly. I highly recommend this product--worth every penny!
