review/summary: Sent it backreview/text: This is a cheaply made, overpriced space hog. It's huge, which would be fine if baby actually liked it. My five month old hated being in it even though he loves hopping in general. The cheap plastic toy on one side pinched his finger. And to top it all off, it's treated with fire retardants!
