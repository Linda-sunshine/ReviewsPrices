review/summary: Gave in & so glad I didreview/text: I was very resistant to the idea of buying a pillow specific for pregnant women. However, I'm so glad that I gave in. After trying multiple pillows across weeks and sometimes within just one night, the Leacho Snoogle pillow is all I need. Getting a decent night's sleep while pregnant is challenging enough with leg cramps and the baby's acrobatics; the Leacho Snoogle pillow really has helped my back feel more comfortable and keep me from having to chase pillows with my legs throughout the night. When I think about how much a good night's sleep is worth, the seemingly high sticker price is well worth the money. I am only 4'10" so I wasn't sure if the product would be OK for someone so short v. the average. But it works great for me!
