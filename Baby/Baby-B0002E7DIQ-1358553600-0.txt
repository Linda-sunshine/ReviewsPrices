review/summary: LOVE ITreview/text: Ok, I have back issues and have to sleep on my side at a slightly inclined position....the pillow mountain was getting to my hubby so I thought I would give this a try....lets just say I love it and my daughter is now hitting me up for one!! I have used it with the opening up and down (currently opening up) and it is providing the hip support I need and side support to keep me from tossing and turning. I did get the additional pillow cover (the pillow comes with one pillow case but the extra is nice on laundry day...but a bit pricey). Overall its bulky but its my bedroom not a display room and it fits just fine in our blanket chest at the end of the bed if I want a showroom quality look. I've also hid it under the other pillows and that works just fine for the &#34;showroom quality look.&#34; Love the support, comfort and overall a great find....my only complaint is that swapping out the pillow cases on this thing is like giving birth....uuuggghhh....not simple but I'm getting better.&#34; Hope this review helps you choose this over the others on the market....my only issue I have with the product is keeping my daughter from stealing it....oh and last week my son made a play for it....I have a feeling I will be buying more...ha!!
