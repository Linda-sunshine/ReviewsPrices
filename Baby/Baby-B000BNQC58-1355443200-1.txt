review/summary: My great grandchildren loved this!review/text: I had an early Christmas for my great grandsons, ages 5 and 8. Of all the things they got, they loved their turtles the most. I even enjoyed it myself as we three snuggled in bed and told bedtime stories. The green and blue stars were the best. The amber color didn't show up very well.
