review/summary: A must need for any pregnant woman!review/text: I was hesistant to purchase the Snoogle because it was so darn expensive. Did I really want to spend almost 50 dollars on a pillow? But when I kept tossing and turning and couldn't find a comfortable position to sleep in, I gave in and purchased the Snoogle. This thing has become a life saver! I've been using it everynight since being pregnant and I even take it with me when I need to go on overnight trips.The snoogle already has a cover on it that you can remove to wash so there is really no need to buy a slip cover. Also you can shape it to any form so it can be used to prop yourself up when reading a book or watching tv. I'm thinking it might even come in handy once the baby is here.
