review/summary: love Pampers, but.....review/text: Love everything about Pampers and this diaper. Love the bulk pack, and the subscribe & save. However, I've found once my daughter started sleeping through the night, she peed through these, and we had to buy a box of Huggies for overnight. These are great during the day and sensitive enough for her bottom, but you may want to look for the extra dry pack or do what I did, and get something else for overnight...
