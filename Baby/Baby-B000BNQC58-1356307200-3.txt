review/summary: Twilght Ladybugreview/text: I bought the Cloud B Twilight Ladybug in green (and red!) and also the Sea Turtle as Christmas gifts for my nieces, ages 3-4-5. They were beautiful and I knew the girls would love them. I did NOT, however, plan for how excited my 16 and 20 year old girls would get upon helping me wrap them!! They played with them for an hour in my darkened bedroom and had a blast!! A great gift; sturdy, beautiful, great display on walls or ceiling. Much better designed and constructed than the ones I saw advertised on TV for more money!Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Lady Bug
