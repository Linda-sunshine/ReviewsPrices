review/summary: Amazing Product!review/text: Am so happy with this product, my baby is 8 months, and is nearly walking because of the encouragement this product has given him. I was going to buy a walker that rolls around before I bought this product, but when I heard that they were unsafe, I opted for this product instead. The lights and sounds are good, and not too repetitive, however, the little door function broke after two days of use. An amazing, affordable buy.
