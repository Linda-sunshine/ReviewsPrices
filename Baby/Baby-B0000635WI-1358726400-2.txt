review/summary: A must have!review/text: Well worth the money! This is a high quality necessity! I was initially shocked at the amount my husband spent on it, but its worth every penny and I've already gotten so much use out of it!I firmly believe that EVERY pregnant woman should have one of these! It has been such a lifesaver! My husband got it for me for Christmas and I don't think I'll give it up even after I have the baby! It is nice and soft, yet firm enough to hold its shape, mold to your body and provide support wherever needed.The main picture shows a woman holding it in front of her like a body pillow but I've found that my favorite position is with it behind me. It is long enough to act as a pillow for my head and to wrap my arms around, supports my entire back, and then wraps forward between my knees. It also coils up to support me when I'm sitting in the living area watching tv, and does a great wrap-around thing that will replace the need for a boppy!I would definately suggest also buying the separate cover for it. You'll be spending LOTS of time with this item since it does so many different things and having a cover that you can take off and wash will be much appreciated.
