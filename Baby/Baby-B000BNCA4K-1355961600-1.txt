review/summary: If you are looking for toys with quieter sounds, this is it!review/text: Easy for little hands to grasp. A little heavier than it looks. Fairly quiet rattle sound. Bright colors. It hasn't become a favorite of my child yet, but I still have hope. This is a really cute toy. I like to hang it from his activity gym and he does grasp it. It is just a little quieter than the toys he likes at this point.
