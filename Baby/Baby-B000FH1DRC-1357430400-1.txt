review/summary: Love the swaddlers!review/text: They fit great, keep him dry and rash free. Baby has only had 2 diaper rashes since he was born (teething and antibiotics) and he has pretty sensitive skin. I am very pleased and they are worth the price. We tried a few other brands and had many leak issues, however the swaddlers fit his build the best (long and thin).
