review/summary: Luv it but wish the clip didn't breakreview/text: I first saw this advertised in a baby magazine and thought it was just silly. Then my baby was born and I realized that when u throw in sleep deprivation it can be very difficult to remember how long its been since the baby _______ . The timer is great as is the night light and L/R switch at the bottom is helpful for breastfeeding. My only complaint is that the handy clip on the back broke almost immediately but it's still worth buying.
