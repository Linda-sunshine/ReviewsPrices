review/summary: Excellent!review/text: Excellent quality and value for the money! Our 9 month old daughter is walking by moving from furniture to furniture. She does not yet push it by herself, but if I help her, she will walk along behind it. It has plenty of current options to keep her occupied and I can tell it will take her through a lot of stages. We have other Vtech products and love them as well.
