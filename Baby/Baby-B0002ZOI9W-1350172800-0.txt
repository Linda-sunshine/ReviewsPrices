review/summary: One of my daughters favoritesreview/text: My daughter is 5 months old and has loved this chair for the last few months. We bought it when she first started grasping objects an she loves the ladybug that plays music when pulled. I can put her in this chair when I need to do something around the house and it keeps her occupied for a bit. The only critique I have is that the other two toys don't do anything when pulled, so other than batting them she loses interest fast.
