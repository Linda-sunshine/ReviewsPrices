review/summary: Gentle Giraffe is good for sleeping.review/text: I had originally bought this giraffe for my son, so he can stay asleep, but he didn't seem to like it much, so now I use it, and it helps a lot. It drowns out other sounds, with gentle white noise (and other sounds you can choose from). It also comes with a couple of timer settings, 23 to 46 minutes.
