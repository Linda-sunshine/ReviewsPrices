review/summary: Don't order a size biggerreview/text: I almost ordered a medium after reading all the reviews about the inaccurate sizing information, but after I read a review which suggested to stick to the manufacturer's sizing chart, I decided to go with a small. I'm SO glad I did. The medium would have done nothing for me. I'm 26 weeks, 5'3", 144 lbs, and I'm wearing it on the smallest setting.That being said, I DO wear it UNDER my belly, which I believe it's meant for. Some people say they wear it higher than that, and if that's the case, you might want to order the next size OR if you're on the higher end of the weight range. Either way, orders are very easily returned to Amazon.The belt gives good support and I feel a little more secure when taking my morning walks - less vulnerable to lower back strain. It doesn't provide a huge amount of support, which you don't want anyway. It would not only be uncomfortable to have something too tight, it wouldn't be good for baby, either.I only gave 4 stars because the material is not comfortable enough to wear on bare skin. You need to wear it over clothing, otherwise the fabric digs into your skin. Even so, I still recommend this product to anyone who feels like they need a little support.
