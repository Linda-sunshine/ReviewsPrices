review/summary: Sounds great at first, but in reality, not that usefulreview/text: My wife and I recently had twins, figuring that we were going to have a very difficult time remembering feedings and diaper changes we purchased this product.The problem is that while this product sounds very useful, due to it being very limited in functionality and configuration, it is almost useless.We ended up writing everything in a small journal, as we could not perform ANY of the following with the Itzbeen-1) Report a feeding that occured in the past- I fed the baby 30 min ago.2) Set when you would like the alarm to go off- after 3, 3.5, or 4 hours are the various intervals we needed as the girls gained weight.3) View the history of past feeding, she only the last feeding.4) Record how much the baby actually ate- especially important when feeding from a bottle.5) Record when the baby peed/pooped.While we did not spend a fortune on this device, I would have liked to use it for something else other than a paperweight, which is the best use I found for it so far.I would not recommend buying this product, unless you do not know how to right and believe you will immidiately run to press on the appropriate button, every time you perform one of the relevant baby activities it is designed to record.
