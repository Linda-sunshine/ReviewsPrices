review/summary: Choking hazardreview/text: I used this gym for my first child without incident, and he loved it. However, when my second son was 4 months old he gagged on one of the pieces. I laid him on his back to play and moments later heard him gagging. The blue spinning part of the parrot hanging toy was completely inside his mouth and he couldn't turn his head. Luckily nothing serious happened, but I wanted other parents to be aware of this potential problem. Fisher-Price is a very nice company to deal with. I sent the toy back and received a voucher.
