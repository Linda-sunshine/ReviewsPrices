review/summary: Lifesaver while it lastedreview/text: Greatest invention ever! It helps me and my husband especially to stay on track with feeding and diaper changes! Great buy!!!!Unfortunately after not even 4 weeks the device started to have issues. First one button stopped working and then one after another to the point where the device was no longer functional and programmable . We changed the batteries twice, but nothing helped! So it was great while it lasted! I now just use the timer on my phone. TIP: If you have an iPhone just download a free app which works just as well and seems to be more convenient!
