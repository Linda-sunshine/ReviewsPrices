review/summary: The best diapersreview/text: Pamper Swaddlers is the best diaper. This is the brand that they used while the baby was in the NICU and I have been using it ever since. I have tried Pampers Baby Dry because it is less expensive and you get more diapers in each package; however, when I change my baby the diaper has a very strong urine smell. I don't encounter this issue with Pampers Swaddles. It is a little more expensive, but its worth every penny!
