review/summary: Great. Exactly What I Needed.review/text: The Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat is exactly what I was looking for!I needed something to feed my niece in. I didn't want to purchase an expensive highchair since I only babysit her once a week. The Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat was the perfect solution.Pros:- Extremely affordable.- Can be used as a stand alone on the floor OR attaches to any chair.- Can be used with the tray OR remove the tray and push up to a table.- Great for an assortment of ages (my niece was 5 months when I purchased it).- Great Quality- Strong materials- Easy to cleanCons:- After repeated removal of the white dishwasher safe tray, it doesn't snap into place well. This is somewhat of a design flaw because it never snapped in the front, only a bit in the back and on the sides. My niece grabs the front and pulls it up. I don't like this, but it isn't the end of the world. You don't need the tray for the seat to be functional.Other than the minor con, I have no complaints with this product. It was exactly what I was expecting, and worked better than I could have hoped!
