review/summary: Good idea, but has a few flawsreview/text: The sheep is very cute as a stuffed animal, but we ended up taking out the sound machine portion because it was too hard to turn it on when it was in the sheep and attached to the crib. And since it only stays on for a max of 45 min we had to restart it a lot. In the end this was also not loud enough. Save your money, time and sanity and purchase a sound machine that runs continuously.
