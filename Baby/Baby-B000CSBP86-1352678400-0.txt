review/summary: Very Comfy for Babyreview/text: I ordered a Bjorn after trying a neighbor of mine's. I had tried other carries similar to this one and they scratched up my little boys legs. The Bjorn is so soft on baby! I also like that it's so easy to get the baby in and out of. I got the plain black one so my hubby will actually wear/use it as well. My son is only 4 months old, so he's not too heavy yet, but it's good for now! I also alternate between using this and a wrap. I like the wrap better for my back but like the easiness of the Bjorn. I would recommend this item for sure.
