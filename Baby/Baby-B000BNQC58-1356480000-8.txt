review/summary: My daughter loves it!review/text: My 6 year old was afraid of the dark and wanted the pillow pet version of this nightlight. After reading various reviews I decided to get this one instead. Let's just say she was super excited to receive this. In fact, she was eager to sleep in her own room.The colors of the lights are great. Green shows up the best, followed by blue, then red. We haven't tried finding the constellations yet, but I think it's awesome they incorporated that into this.If you are on the fence between this and the pillow pet version, buy this. I'm 100% satisfied.
