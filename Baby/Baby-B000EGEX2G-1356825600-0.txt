review/summary: Comfortable, easy to assemble, and all at the right price!review/text: I'm waiting on the arrival of my little one but already absolutely love sitting in this glider. It is the perfect combination of softness but not too cushioned that you sink in and have trouble getting up and out of the chair. The little pockets on the arms of the glider look like they will be helpful for storing any items that need to be close by during feedings. I was expecting this to be one of the more difficult pieces of nursery furniture to assemble but it was actually the easiest! I started to take pieces out of the box while waiting for my husband to get his tools to put it together and by the time he returned I had the whole chair put together it took 15 minutes tops. Also, this is hands down one of the cheapest glider and ottoman sets available anywhere I've looked. This has been my favorite and easiest baby purchase!!
