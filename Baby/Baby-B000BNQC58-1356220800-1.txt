review/summary: Awesome nightlightreview/text: We got this turtle as a nightlight for our sons room when he was an infant. The amount of light is perfect for a mid night feeding and change. The timer goes off in about 45 minutes. Now that he is about 18 months, he loves the stars every night before bed.
