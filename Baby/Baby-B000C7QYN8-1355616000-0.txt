review/summary: Great concept, doesn't work thoreview/text: I bought the seveth generation wipes because I try to keep chemicals away from my children, however these wipes are so dry that they do not clean at all. I had to use a ton to get my daughters bum clean and she ended up being red from all the rubbing. I am going back to huggies.
