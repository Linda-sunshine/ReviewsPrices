review/summary: Not genuine huggies?review/text: These huggies I bought aren't the same as the ones I purchase at the store. The ink on the outside of the diapers is really bold, and I was afraid it would stain my kids clothes. In addition, as another poster has mentioned, the size 6 sold from amazon are bulkier than the ones sold in stores. They do not seem genuine huggies or they're made somewhere else, I have no idea.Due to the ink amount I decided not to use these diapers as I wasn't sure if they would cause a diaper rash for my son.
