review/summary: Great booster seat!review/text: When by 16-month-old started climbing up into his high-chair all by himself, we decided it was time for him to join us at the table. This is an excellent solution. We placed a towel over one of our chairs (to spare the chair), adjusted the seat height on the booster seat (brilliant feature), and strapped it to the chair. Now my big boy eats with us. We don't use the tray, but we love the portability of this thing. Also it does not have lots of nooks and crannies for food to hide in so it clean-up is s snap. I highly recommend this product.
