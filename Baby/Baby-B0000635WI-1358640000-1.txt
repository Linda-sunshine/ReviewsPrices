review/summary: Worth Every Pennyreview/text: Loved this pillow during pregnancy. The small crook goes nicely under your head while the length of the pillow supports your tummy. The sleepless nights I had before this pillow almost stopped immediately once it arrived. I just used two pillow cases to cover the pillow rather than spending extra money for a fitted one.
