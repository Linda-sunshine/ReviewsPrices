review/summary: Great product for an open box,review/text: I was if'y about purchasing an open box of diapers. But I am glad that I did. Well worth saving a few bucks since diapers are expensive. Would highly recommend purchasing an open box/good condition. When receiving the package it did not look like an open box. Packaging was intact as if it were a new box. Box was a bit worn but a box is a box as long as the product is new and intact. I would buy again. :)
