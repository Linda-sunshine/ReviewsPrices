review/summary: Helps my son sleep at night like a big boyreview/text: My little guy is 3 and is afraid of the dark. We tried some different night lights from Target, tried a small lamp and he still ended up screaming for us at night. Twilight Turtle is easy to use and easy to transport. Aside from being a comfort for our son at night, he loves to play &#34;fort&#34; with it in a dark room. Battery life is pretty good because of the 45 min timer. We&#699;re currently learning the constellations as well, using the attached booklet. Great buy, way better than the comparable Pillow Pets Dream Lites.
