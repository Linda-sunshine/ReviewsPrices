review/summary: Best diapers I have found for my kids.review/text: We've tried Huggies, Luvs, generic big-brand stores etc. Pampers beats them all. Very few if ever have any blowouts, or leaks with these diapers. Huggies came in as the worst, and Luvs are not too bad but we still found these Pampers to be the best.These hug him around the legs really well, and the absorbancy is huge. The diaper bloats out like a balloon sometimes overnight but keeps the sheets and him dry.Our older son is just about out of Diapers and also used Pampers all throughout his first 2 years. Never any issues. And if there are no issues, then isn't that what it's all about?
