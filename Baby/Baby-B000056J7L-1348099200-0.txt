review/summary: Great potty seat!review/text: Great purchase! My son loves this seat. The splash guard is high enough for little boys who are learning to stay seated the entire potty experience. ;) The bowl in the middle is easy to remove and clean. I would definitely recommend this potty to any of my friends.
