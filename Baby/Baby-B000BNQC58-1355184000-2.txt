review/summary: Light Up Your child's lifereview/text: For our review, we choose the Twilight Turtle Nightlight. This is a wonderful choice for babies and even older children. He is an adorable little plush turtle with a hard shell. Kids can play with him by day, and at night he turns into something truly amazing. A night light that not only keeps all the scary monsters away, but turns your child's bedroom into a whole new world. The back of the turtle's shell has a star and moon pattern and when the light are out, that pattern is reflected on the wall or ceiling. You can choose between white, green and blue stars. My toddler was amazed by it, and even my older kids loved it.***I received this item for free in exchange for an honest review on my blog, New Age Mama***
