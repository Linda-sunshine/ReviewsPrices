review/summary: Adjustablereview/text: I loved how adjustable this hammock is for all the kids' stuffies. Either stretch it wide for lots of toys, or narrower, but it will hang lower. But since we have a lot of stuffies, and I hung it wide, it held everything neatly and never had issues of the hooks falling out of place!
