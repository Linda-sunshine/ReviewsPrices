review/summary: This gate should be recalled!! VERY UNSAFE!review/text: I purchased this gate when my twins were 4 months old and was disappointed from the beginning by how flimsy and cheaply made it was. It was also extremey difficult to change the shape and with no gate, it was hard to step in and out of it. At 9 months just as my twins started to learn to pull up, one of them climbed to the top of the gate and fell head first onto our wood floor. This gate has a terrible deisgn and is very easy to climb which is extremely dangerous. It is in no way safe for babies once they learn to stand. The panels should have up and down bars similar to cribs. The hexagon openings are the perfect size for little feet to climb. This product needs to be recalled.
