review/summary: Best diapers I have usedreview/text: We have used several different types of diapers and these are definately the best. The line that turns blue when wet is great to make sure you are keeping your baby dry. You always know right away. Our baby is almost 5 months old and has never had any diaper rash thanks in part to these diapers. They also do a good job at preventing any accidents (although most of the top brands seem to do an equally good job in this area)
