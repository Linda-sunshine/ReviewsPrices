review/summary: Useful Buyreview/text: Great for child or pet. This was bought with the intent of being used as it is seen in the picture (connected circularly); however, I've found it to be most useful when I pull it apart and place different pieces in front of objects/rooms I wish to preserve from the curious hands of my baby. This was more useful than I originally thought it would be, and therefore an excellent buy for our living quarters.
