review/summary: Great playardreview/text: I bought this playard to travel to with. I liked it over other ones because it came with the raised insert for infants. I like the subtle colors and the quality. Other reviewers said that the insert &#34;caves in&#34; in the middle, but if you follow the setup instructions and properly insert the included bars, it stays perfectly flat. Note: the raised insert is at a set height (as pictured), it's not adjustable. You can choose not to use the insert and just use it as a standard playard.
