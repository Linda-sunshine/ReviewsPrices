review/summary: Almost perfect!review/text: I bought this for my 3-month-old grandson as an alternative to swings that take up so much space. The quality exceeded my expectations, and I assembled it myself within minutes. So far, it's been great. He sleeps so peacefully using the vibration feature! The only thing that I think would improve it would be to add an automatic rocking feature. However, the description was accurate, and I knew before buying it that that was not an option. I would definitely recommend it, and I plan on getting one for my daughter to keep at her house.
