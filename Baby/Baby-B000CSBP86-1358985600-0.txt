review/summary: easy to usereview/text: I got this carrier as a gift. I just became a mom and gotten frustrated watching the crying baby while using computer, cooking and eating myself. I did not know this product is for a baby from age 0 month until I took a close look at the box. It is easy to assemble, the clip-on are smooth. with the carrier, I am able to free my hands and use computer or do some house work. It helps!I just started using it. will update the review after more use.
