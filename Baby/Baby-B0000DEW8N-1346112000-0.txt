review/summary: I'd like instructions ON the booster seat!review/text: Likes:- takes up very little space compared to a proper highchair.- quite portable; I take it with me when I take my baby to my mother's, but still too bulky to take to the shopping malls or on the go.- easy to clean and use again! Just wipe or rinse. Even if I had to leave food to dry on it for a while, the gunk comes off with just water on a cloth, or a baby wipe!- A nice sized tray. At six months old, my baby can reach the cupholder easily at the end of the tray. He can't do this with the highchair at my mother-in-law's, which is a HUGE tray.- The lid for the tray is so useful! When I'm traveling with the seat, I put the splat mat, his bib and his cutlery all in the tray with the lid locking in.Dislikes:- Bulky for carrying. It bumps against the body and hurts!- You have to read the instruction booklet to figure out where the straps go and how to adjust the height. They don't put any instructions on the seat itself, so you can't ask other people to help out with fixing it up or packing it away while your baby is screaming. My hubby and all the various "assistants" keep getting the straps wrong and/or forgetting to adjust the height!- Tricky to take the main tray off. It gets a little stuck. This is a problem when you need to get your baby out FAST, but not a major issue, because it always comes off, just not immediately.I have no regrets buying this booster chair. I recommend it for anyone with a lot of dining chairs (flat styles! not cushioned or rounded bum, etc) and no more space around the dining table for a high chair. If you're looking for something to carry out to big malls etc, where you're going to have to walk a while with it, I don't recommend it!
