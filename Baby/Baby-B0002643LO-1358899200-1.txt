review/summary: The bigger the diaper, the less it holds...review/text: In the past year, I've come to appreciate and only purchase the Pampers brand for my growing daughter's needs. After reaching 15 months of age, however, the diaper wasn't able to keep hold up to overnight use and I started using a nighttime diaper from a different manufacturer. As grandmothers and others watch the baby, they don't know which diaper to use at which time, so I've completely switched from Pampers to another more sturdy brand that doesn't leak and doesn't cause wet mornings.
