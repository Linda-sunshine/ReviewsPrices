review/summary: Great for traveling - wish the tray weren't so easy for toddler to removereview/text: This seat is great. We've started using it as our primary seat when feeding our 16-month old son.However, we've stopped using the insert (white) tray because he's figured out that he can remove it, which can make quite a mess. I wish the white tray clipped on the front or both sides to make it harder for him to remove. Oh well. Otherwise a great product.
