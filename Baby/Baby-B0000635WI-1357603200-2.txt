review/summary: ITS OK.....review/text: Im a stomach sleeper, so getting comfortable while pregnant is almost impossible. I got this pillow to see if I could train myself to sleep on my sides. Unfortunately, after about a month, I have tossed it out of the bed and went back to using several pillows. It is great to prop up on and sit elevated if you have heart burn. It is a VERY big pillow, and like most pregnant women, I have to get up numerous times a night and the pillow was always in the way. I am expecting twins and think it will serve as a great feeding pillow. Dont completely hate the pillow but it didnt help me sleep any better either!!!
