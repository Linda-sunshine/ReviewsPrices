review/summary: Super easy to install and usereview/text: Very easy to install and use. First, read the instructions! You will need to make sure how to attach the extension(s) to the gate. The orientation is important. When you are assembling the gate, lay it out on a flat surface with plenty of working room. Then, move it to your designated location. It helps to have a 2nd person but not required. One person can hold the gate in place while the other adjusts the tension. As the instructions state, don't make the door closure too tight or too loose.
