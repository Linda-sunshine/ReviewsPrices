review/summary: Our daughter loves it!review/text: Bought it for my 5 months old girl and "WE" loves it. It was able to keep her entertained for about 20 minutes each time which is good for me to have time to do my stuff. We watch her as she lays on the mat and tries to kick and grab different hanging toys. The music is nice, also play mat,toy, animal character are bright and colorful. Her dad said.. He wish he would have bought this sooner and I totally agree with him.
