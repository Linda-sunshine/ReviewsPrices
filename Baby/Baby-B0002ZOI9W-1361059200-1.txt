review/summary: This is okreview/text: It worked good as the infant seat and my son liked the things that hang down but now he is 16 mths old and he loves it as a chair. My only thing is that is still reclines a lot so it is not a very good chair...it makes me feel like its a bit of a gimmick. If there is another one you like but it doesn't convert into a chair...I would get it because this is just not too functional as a chair for a toddler but a great infant rocker
