review/summary: perfectreview/text: I have tried ergo baby and the moby and the baby bjorn and i like the the bjorn the best.the moby wrap is to hot with all that fabric wrapped around you 3 times.its also over priced since its just a ling peice of fabric. you can get the same thing if you cut a bed sheet in half. the baby will eventually sag and slope in it as the fabric stretches so you have to keep fussing and adjusting it. it is also a pain to take on and off or take baby in and out of. hate itthe ergo baby carrier puts the baby to tight against you so its to hot especially with the infant insert. its nearly impossible to breast feed in so every time you want to nurse; you need to take the baby out. otherwise you could loosen the carrier and feed with the babys body contorted. it does have great back support so i will keep it and use it when my baby gets bigger.The babybjorn is so perfect. it keeps you and baby cool on hot days. its cozy. its its simple to put on and get baby in and out of. its east to breast feed in. you just need to add a little blanket or cover when you do. its life saving to be able to breast feed or carry baby comfortably with your hands free to do what you need. the only con is the babybjorn lacks the back support the ergo baby has.
