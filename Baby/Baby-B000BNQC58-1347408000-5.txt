review/summary: OK for big kids tooreview/text: My son is 10 years old and loves this nightlight. It is not that he is afraid of the dark; he is a social person that doesn't like to be alone. This helps him relax and go to sleep. He likes that he can select the color for his mood and that it turns off when it is done. His previous "nightlight" only put stars on the ceiling. He loves that the stars are on the walls now too.
