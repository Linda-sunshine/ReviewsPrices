review/summary: The best shower gift ever!!!review/text: My mother-in-law once told me how my husband loved the jumper that hangs by the door (40 years ago) and I already thought of putting one on my registry...except when I looked around the house, there was nowhere to put one... I searched in Amazon and found this product and got it. My son loved to stand and was able to hold his head up at 8 weeks old so I put the jumperoo together and put him in it. Well, his feet cannot thouch the ground so I placed a pillow there so he can stand up and because he was still tiny, I had to put a blanket at the back so he can reach the toys. He loved this the moment he tried it. The best memory was when he fell asleep on it. This gift made me purchase the whole rainforest collection and I was not disappointed.
