review/summary: zipper issuesreview/text: I have several different HALO sleepsacks using various sizes and weights on all my children and I really love them. They are great to have an extra layer on your little one and know that they are going to stay warm through the night!With this particular sleepsack I have had some issues with the zipper not staying together. I have been able to work it back off him every time, but it has been a little annoying. I think I might have just gotten a lemon this time as all the rest have been great.
