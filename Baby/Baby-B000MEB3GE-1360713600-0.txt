review/summary: I may not be able to chart everything, but I can press a button.review/text: My baby is a preemie, so charting how often she eats, how much she sleeps, the last time I changed her diapers (if she doesn't have enough wet diapers, she's probably not eating enough), and so forth is a big deal.This seemed like a luxury item for me. I mean, surely I could remember to write down how long something took, right? Uh, not so much. But I could simply press a button and start a timer that counts how much time has passed for an activity or event. This little device is a God send. (Note that you can set an alarm if you need to ensure that something happens within a set period of time. I set an audible alarm to ensure that my baby eats at least every 4 hr, for example.)Very glad I got this. It's very easy to use.Note that the blue color is more of a silver.
