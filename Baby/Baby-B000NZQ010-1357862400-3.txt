review/summary: Great for toddlers learning to stand/walk!review/text: This was a great option for our daughter to get mobile. She loved pushing it around before she could walk on her own, and it has wheel brakes that help provide drag on the rear wheels, so it doesn't shoot out from under your toddlers. I think it really helped our daughter make the transition from crawling/standing to walking. There are rubber stripes down the centerline of each wheel, so it will grip on hardwood and reasonably well on carpet as well. We never had a problem with either surface. Kids love it. The activity center on the front is entertaining as well. We bought two more for friends/family with toddlers.
