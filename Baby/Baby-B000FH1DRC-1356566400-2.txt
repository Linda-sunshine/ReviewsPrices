review/summary: For my newbornsreview/text: My newborn babies get Pampers swaddlers. When they get older, we move to a less expensive diaper, but for the first three months, at least, I won't go with anything else. These diapers are soft, very absorbent, hold in poo-splosions (as we call them at our house), and the wetness indicator is nothing short of awesome. Love these diapers. We've never had any issue with sore bums or much of a diaper rash, I believe, due to the nicer diapers during that extra sensitive newborn stage.
