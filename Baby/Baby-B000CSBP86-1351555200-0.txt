review/summary: The BJORN is our favorite one!review/text: My son is 4 months old. We have use the carrier for my son about 3 weeks. It is quick and easy to use and gave my hands back. I can use my hands to do other things when the baby with me in carrier. We also have taken him to shop or walk. My son also likes the carrier, he feels comfortable and very happy in it. He can turn his head easily and face in or out. It's very useful for us.
