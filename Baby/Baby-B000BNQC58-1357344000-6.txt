review/summary: Very cute, works greatreview/text: I bought one of these and one of the &#34;dream lites&#34; you see on TV for my daughter's for Christmas. My 1yr old and 5 yr old love this, the lights are very bright and do a great job illuminating the ceiling and wall. About the only thing that I could say is a &#34;con&#34; would be that it's hard and not very ideal for snuggling. My daughter puts this one on her bedstand and turns it on to &#34;keep the monsters away&#34; and she snuggles with the dreamlite which are soft. I gave this 5 stars and being $10 cheaper than the dreamlites is a plus too.
