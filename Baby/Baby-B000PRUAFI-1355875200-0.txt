review/summary: Excellent Gate!review/text: I ordered two of these gates for the bedrooms so that we can keep the doors open and not have to worry about the baby going into the rooms. It is so much sturdier and a more heavy weight gate than the Regalo extra wide gate I purchased for the stairs. I like the wide width of the swing gate and it is so much more easier to open and lock. I recommend this gate to anyone who is looking for a gate to keep children and pets out of rooms/areas of the house you do not want them in.
