review/summary: problem with the swinging toyreview/text: my kids had issued with the swinging parrot with the wheel. My daughter would get her hands/feet stuck in them. we took it off them for my son we tried it again and he would hit it hard and it bruised his head. It's great otherwise. you can always add other toys like rings and dolls .
