review/summary: Don't know what I'd do without it!review/text: I wasn't sure how often I'd use this gift. I've used it almost every day, several times a day for 6 months! And it has the original batteries. I don't know what I'd do without this. I generally only use the heartbeat sound, but he does enjoy the other jungle/nature sounds too. If he wakes up in the middle of the night, I turn this on and he's back to sleep. I highly recommend!
