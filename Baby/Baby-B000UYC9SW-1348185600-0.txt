review/summary: So awesome!review/text: I really didn't want a sling. Really, I didn't want a baby carrier at all. I had one with my first child and it always seemed to take more effort to put on than it was worth. HOWEVER, I read about the Baby K'Tan in a consumer review guide and decided to check out the company website for more information. The Baby K'Tan website alone made me purchase the product! The site has step-by-step pictures of each position, as well as videos! The site was super user-friendly! When I tried the Baby K'Tan on for the first time, I was amazed to see that it actually was as easy as the videos and pictures made it out to be, and the back support was awesome! What's even better is that the sash doubles as a carrying case! When wearing the sash, the carrying case serves as a front pocket! I LOVE my Baby K'Tan!!! I'd recommend it to anyone!
