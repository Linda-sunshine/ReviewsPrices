review/summary: Keeps the kid entertained.review/text: Bought this more my 7th month old about 2 months ago and she still plays with it for about half an hour at a time. It has two settings, one that plays lots of music, and another that talks more. She loves the music setting. There are two volume settings, which comes in handy because the louder setting is quite loud, so when we want it to be a bit quieter we can turn the volume down. My daughter loves detaching the phone and the shapes at the top...and the peek-a-boo door on the left is also a favorite of hers. I also loved that the front panel detaches so that baby can play with this on the floor especially when she couldn't sit up very well. Now that she's sitting she can play with it attached to the walker. The only reason I give it 4 starts instead of five is because it's a bit dangerous in that there's no breaks on the wheels. When baby is playing with it sitting down, it very easily starts rolling and she sometimes leans on it causing it to roll away from her and she sometimes face-plants the front panel. We learned to put the back wheels against the sofa so that it would stay stationary. Wish you could enable some sort of break on it when it's not being used as a walker. Otherwise this toy is great and I'd recommend it to everyone. Keeps the kids entertained when there's so much to do!
