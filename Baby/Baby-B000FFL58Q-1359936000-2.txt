review/summary: Baby loved it!review/text: My babies favorite toy on this was the smiling monkey and she enjoyed the lights above. The changes I would make are that the mirror is pretty much useless, the parrot toy seemed a little dangerous in that it is a pretty heavy toy for babies typically put on this mat and seemed an easy way to get their fingers caught in the spinning wheel. And as other comments have mentioned you have to rotate the butterflies yourself. I'm ok with this as it gets parents down there to play with their kids, but really if you're putting your baby down on this you are probably needing them to be occupied for a few minutes without your playing with them so it would be nice if these would spin on their own.
