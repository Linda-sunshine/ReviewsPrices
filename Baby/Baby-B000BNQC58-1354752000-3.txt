review/summary: Very cool but a bit expensivereview/text: The overall idea is great, but it is really disappointing if you're looking for anything more than a fancy expensive nightlight. I was really hoping that it would project the images on the wall and there would be some kind of light show or movement of the stars but the stars/moon are just projected on to the wall and it seems to bore my son. Typically, when he is falling asleep, he'll find something to focus on and "zone out", such as the ceiling fan, so I thought this would be a great idea. He would watch the stars and fall asleep BUT he doesn't even seem to care about it. I really do love the product but I just wish it did more.I paid around $22 for it on sale, and that is the only reason I'm not really complaining. Had I paid the full price of [$], I'd have returned it:)I love Cloub B products I just wish it did more...It is very light and easy to move from room to room which is another bonus. I feel bad because I do like the product and feel I could potentially turn off buyers but wanted to inform you of the lack of interest my own child had in it.Might be great for your baby!
