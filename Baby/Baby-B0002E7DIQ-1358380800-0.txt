review/summary: NOT THAT GREATreview/text: Doesn't live up to the hype all these women are raving about. I've used this since I was 10 weeks preg (when I started having trouble sleeping) and I am 24 weeks now. I'm not going to stop using it because I paid +$70 for it (ugh!). I'm a back sleeper and since preggos aren't supposed to sleep on their backs, I bought this to help me get comfy trying to sleep on my sides. Nope. Not comfy.
