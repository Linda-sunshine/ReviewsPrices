review/summary: LIFE SAVERreview/text: I wish I had bought this as soon as I got pregnant. Well worth the money since it means I get a MUCH better night's sleep. I've recommended it to 2 other pregnant friends and they both love it too. Some people talked about the seem by the "neck" being too tight. It is a little tight but I just readjust the pillow a little and haven't had an issue. Love that you can toss and turn and not have to rearrange 20 pillows! Only downside is that the cover is not that soft. I've been using it for 3 months or so and its gotten a little pilly in places. Also, the cover IS removable and washable but its a pain in the tush to get on and off.Not just for pregnant women, my husband got into it when it arrived and immediately asked if we could order another one for him! Oh, we have a queen sized bed and it takes up slightly more than half the bed. Fortunately my husband just snuggles up to the outside of it and uses it as a body pillow too so that's not a problem for us.
