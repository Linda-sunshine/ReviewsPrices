review/summary: great travel chairreview/text: This is a great travel highchair. Folds up easily, is light weight and has a protector over the tray so it stays clean riding around in the car. However I did try to use it briefly as a highchair at home and found that with daily use there were an aweful lot of cracks and crevices to clean crud out of.
