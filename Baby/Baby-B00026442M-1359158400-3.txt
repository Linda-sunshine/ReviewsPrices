review/summary: Satisfiedreview/text: I've been using this brand since we took our 1st LO (who is now 16 mo.) out from the hospital since she was born... I'm using the same brand for our 2nd LO a NB. Have always been satisfied... I've tried huggies but I think I just got comfortable with pampers already so decided to stick with it. Plus to start off its the brand used by the hospitals.... I guess coz its more affordable than huggies.
