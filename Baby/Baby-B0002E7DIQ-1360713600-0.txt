review/summary: the best thing I bought during pregnancyreview/text: As I entered my third trimester I found it more difficult to sleep. While this pillow is very large and takes up a lot of room, it is a great purchase. it supported me when I slept on my side. I felt it supporting my back and my belly and overall I slept much better. Even if we had to go away for the weekend I would take it with me. I would reccommend that you have a big bed to use this in, especially if you are sharing the bed with another person.
