review/summary: Good, but too smallreview/text: I was looking for a net to hold all of my Squishable plushies. I have over 20 right now and as they are large they take up a lot of room. I also have other various plushies that people have given me over time.I was looking for baby shower gifts when I stumbled across this Jumbo net, and being only a couple of dollars, I decided to buy it and try it out. I knew 6 feet would only hold a few of my plushies, but I didn't think it would only hold 3 plus 2 smaller stuffed animals without things falling out.For my uses, not so great. It saved me some room, but not a lot. If you have normal sized plushies, you should do fine, probably can fit maybe 15 or more. It only sinks a bit with my set up, and I can walk under it without it hitting me (I'm 5'4). I'll continue to look for a better net, but for now this will do.
