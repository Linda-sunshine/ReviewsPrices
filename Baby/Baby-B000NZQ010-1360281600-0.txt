review/summary: Good overall walker with bonus play boardreview/text: We purchased this for my son when he was 6 months old. He liked to play with the toys on the front and constatly takes off the phone and likes the barn door. The play board comes off easily fits in a suitcase and we take it with us when we travel. A month later he started to stand and likes to use it to pull himself up. The downside is that when he does pull himself up, it will tilt back and he will fall backwards so you have to hold it down for him. He loves it though and will stand up with it for long stretches of time. Also you have to hold it so it won't roll. When he is ready to start walking this will be perfect. I highly recommend the walker.
