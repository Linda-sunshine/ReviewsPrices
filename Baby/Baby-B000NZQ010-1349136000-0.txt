review/summary: Vtech - Sit to Stand Learning Walkerreview/text: Vtech has always provided neat, colorful toys that allow infants, toddler, and children to explore their senses in a fun and unique way. I love the colors and options this walker has. It's loud and playful and keeps my little one interested. The package arrive neatly and timely. It has held up very well. I have not had to replace batteries yet, my only issue be it minor is that the purple telephone receive is not attached so I am constantly picking it up otherwise complaintes. I do recommend this item.
