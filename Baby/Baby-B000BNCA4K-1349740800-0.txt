review/summary: Great Toy that has lasted 5 years and through 3 kids already!review/text: I purchased this toy from Circle Of Knowledge a toy store in Saint Louis, Missouri. I must say that my kids have ALL used it as babies and as a mom I love:*The flexibility babies can cling on to it starting at just a couple of months of age*Great teether with no moving parts to worry about breaking or baby choking on*Colorful design is interesting to curious babies*Machine washable, I throw it in my dish washer on the top shelf and it's never had a problem being washed, I then hand wash it with water to be sure all the soap is off and it's kept clean.*BABIES LOVE THIS TOY! They can hold it, teeth on it, throw it around and it's just a classic in our house! We have loved it through my first daughter being a baby, my son and now my 7 month old still loves it...I believe it's the kind of toy I'll save forever for when my kids all grow up and have kids, it will last that long!*Classic design and easily found in a bin of toys makes it a lot more functional too.*All three of my kids have liked it and I like it too--plus people always are curious about it when they see it out with your kids, they will often ask what it is and where it's from so it really does have a unique look!!---WORTH the price, you'll get a lot of use out of this toy and years of fun!*Bravo to the designers for making this interesting, unique and durable baby toy that kids love so much!!!!!
