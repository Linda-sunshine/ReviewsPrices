review/summary: Loved it but shipping is expensivereview/text: We love this chair for baby and she seems to like it as well. It is awesome that it is portable and can be moved from room to room, unlike the swing. I was disappointed it cost so much to ship, especially when I found it at the local Walmart for the same price.
