review/summary: Perfect for kids who want a night lightreview/text: This and the Cloud b Twilight Constellation Lady Bug night light are cute and perfect for little ones who want a night light. They get to choose their color of stars, and they have the timer so it will turn off automatically so you don't have to worry about wasting batteries. My kids sleep with their night lights. The soft body makes them kinda cuddly.
