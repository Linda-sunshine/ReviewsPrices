review/summary: Best Wipes Out Therereview/text: We use these for ourselves. I have sensitive skin and when toilet paper is not enough or is bothering me, I use 7th generation wipes. In a pinch, I've used many other brands and nothing has come close to these. Most other brands have a stinky perfume that is noxious to me. Most other brands, even natural brands, are dripping wet and leave one's bottom sopping wet. Seventh generation are nearly odorless and are moist but not wet so skin wiped with them dries quickly. They can also be used as a quick wipe away for sweat when showering is not an option.
