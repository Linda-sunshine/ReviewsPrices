review/summary: Waste of moneyreview/text: Had bought a package of Swaddlers to test them out. Will NEVER do it again. My son is a very healthy and hydrated boy. I am LUCKY if he can go 15 minutes in them without needing to be changed because they are that soaked. Changing a diaper that often is not very fessable nor economical.
