review/summary: pretty much does what it says on the packagereview/text: We tried a few brands, we liked pampers the best. I did this through Amazon Mom (yes, I'm that secure in my masculinity) and it worked well having it on a 4-week delivery cycle. I could forget about having to buy diapers and they would just show up at the door...generally just in time.
