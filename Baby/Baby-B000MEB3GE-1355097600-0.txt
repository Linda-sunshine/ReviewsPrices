review/summary: 1st Time Parentsreview/text: I would recommend this product to any first time parents. The Itzbeen has been with my wife and I, wherever we go. It's the device that requires us to look for it before we leave the house, and usually it's in the diaper bag or on teh nightstand. Being first time parents, with busy lives, this allows to ensure our little one is getting all the attention she needs. I would even consider a product that experienced parents would like, let's face it, life doesn't and hasn't slown down in today's world, and we need all the gadgetry we can get to help us at times.I rated this a 4 star product, as I personally feel it could use an upgrade on the buttons a bit. Being a techno geek, I feel the slide switch for L/R should be a button instead of a switch, however I'll be honest, that's just the man's opinion, as I'm not the one using that switch, I stick with the Zzz, Feed, and Potty. (Sounds like me)Final Tip: Buy It!
