review/summary: Very cutereview/text: My children ages 4 and 6 love the turtle and it is used every night. The only thing I wish is that it had some soothing music with it. I would highly recommend this light, it is bright enough to see the stars on the ceiling but not too bright as to distract the kids from rest.
