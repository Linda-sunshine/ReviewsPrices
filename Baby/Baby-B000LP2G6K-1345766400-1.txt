review/summary: Great product! Love it.review/text: The go green play yard is awesome. I dont have a little one yet, but am "nesting" in preparation. I just set it up last night. I struggled to set it up at first because I skimmed the directions thinking it was simple. Well it was simple, but you have to read the directions fully. I've never set up these new play yards before, they are probably all set up similarly. I just didn't realize the bottom has to be halfway up before the sides would lock. Once I figured that out setup and take down was super easy. The colors are awesome and match my color theme (willow organic and zurich). The quality seems very nice (duh it's a graco). I can't find anything I dont like. It is a little heavy but if you want it to be sturdy it's gonna have some heft! Very happy with this purchase (paid under $61!) and would recommend to anyone. I may add a mobile or something with sounds, but this beats what I was going to spend on one of those loaded models with all the gadgets. Very happy! Love graco and amazon.
