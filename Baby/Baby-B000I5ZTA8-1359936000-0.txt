review/summary: Fits fine, just doesn't DO anything.review/text: I bought the medium as I was solidly in the weight range listed and it fits just fine- I alternate between using the middle tightness and the highest tightness setting with no problems.Unfortunately it doesn't offer any pain relief for me. My hips and pelvis hurt just as much with it on as with it off. I keep trying it and hoping, and while it does make me feel a little more secure when I'm walking around, it really doesn't lessen the pain any.
