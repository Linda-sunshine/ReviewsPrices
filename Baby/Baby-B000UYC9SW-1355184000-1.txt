review/summary: A must have once your baby is around 11 pounds!review/text: Fantastic product! I originally purchased the Moby Wrap, but returned it once I heard about the Baby K'Tan Baby Carrier. While the Moby Wrap is a great idea...there is just so much fabric and I looked huge in it! Not flattering at all the way it wrapped around you. The Baby K'Tan is a different story - it's two loops of fabric that are already &#34;wrapped&#34; and much more flattering to the wearer (especially with post-baby fat!). I'm a 38D post-baby and purchased the medium as directed. The K'Tan does stretch - I purchased a medium according the the sizing chart and while it fits, it does tend to stretch out over the course of a few wearings. I ended up washing it in warm water and drying on medium and it has fit very nicely ever since. Also, a quick tip: to make it tighter roll the individual loops (like you're wringing water out of it). Then unloop as needed to fit baby in snugly. My baby girl loves it....we even go to Mommy & Me yoga with the carrier. I do find I still need to support her head as she likes to peek out...but she is only five weeks old so I think I would be supporting her head anyway!All in all, a fantastic product until you move up to the ERGO or similar infant carrier once they are older. I like that this carrier has more structure than a simple wrap.
