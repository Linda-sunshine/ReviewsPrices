review/summary: Wish I had bought this soonerreview/text: Wish I had bought this much sooner! A great way to transition a young toddler from the high hair. Takes up MUCH less space than a high chair & is easy to clean. Love having my little guy at the table with me! Love that its easy to remove for travel. Easily removable tray for cleaning. Excellent purchase
