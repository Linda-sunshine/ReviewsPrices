review/summary: Peace of Mindreview/text: I first saw the Halo SleepSacks reviewed in a blog about quadruplets when I was pregnant with my first child. The mother swore by them and encouraged people to use them without any incentive from Halo. After doing some research, we registered for a few and thought they were "so cute" when they arrived.The hospital where our daughter was born gives every new set of parents a Halo SleepSack as a gift and our daughter started using it when she was minutes old. We really loved how warm it kept her and how easy it was for us to change her diaper while she was wearing it. She also started to roll in her sleep at just a few weeks old and the SleepSack brought us peace in the midst of our hyper-awareness in being new parents. She stopped using them around 1 year of age, but we held on to them and have started using them with the newest members of our family.We adopted 2 babies from Africa this past Spring and sleep was a huge issue in the beginning. We finally discovered that the babies needed to be swaddled-even though they were well beyond the typical age for US (where we live) children to be swaddled. We obliged for a bit, but when we decided we needed to ween them from that the SleepSacks were essential to our process. I honestly thing they would still be swaddled had we not been able to provide the sense of security and warmth the SleepSack brings them. And as a bonus, as the weather gets colder and our children acclimate to that for the first time they have been requesting the SleepSacks. :) They will often wear them to play in the house. They can crawl and walk fine in the Medium size and we are planning on purchasing a few large size to get us through the winter.
