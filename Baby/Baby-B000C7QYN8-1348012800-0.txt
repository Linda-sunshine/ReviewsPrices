review/summary: Okay but not the best wipereview/text: I like this wipe okay but it is not the best non-clorine wipe out there. If you buy the refill packs - they do not seem to 'dry out' unlike the tubs I have purchased in the past. The wipes are smaller and overall not as 'moist' as Earth's Best.
