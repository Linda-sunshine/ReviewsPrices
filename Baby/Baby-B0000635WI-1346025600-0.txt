review/summary: Would not recommendreview/text: I purchased this pillow early on in my pregnancy, and it worked well for the first few months. However, I found that the pillow really flattened out with use, and I eventually just switched to using multiple regular pillows in order to get enough support. I am not a large person either (115 pounds before pregnancy), so it didn't take much. Once I made that switch to regular pillows, I found the multiple pillows were much easier to maneuver around. Now that I am in the final weeks and turning is really difficult, I would not go back to the snoogle at all.
