review/summary: Looks Nice, Easy to Set Upreview/text: I bought two of these gates to section off parts of the house that I don't want my dogs getting into. I have had them set up for about a year now, without any problems. The gate is very sturdy. One time I fell down the stairs and ran into the gate, and it still didn't fall down. It was also very easy to set up. I am not handy at all, and I was able to set this up in about 15-20 minutes with no extra tools required. I like that the gate automatically closes behind me. I also like that it does not lean or topple when my dogs jump on or lean against the gate. The color is nice. It is a dark bronze that looks blackish if you are not paying close attention. I think it would go well with the decor of most homes. Overall, this is one classy gate.
