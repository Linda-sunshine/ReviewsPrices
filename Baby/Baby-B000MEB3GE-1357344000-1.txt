review/summary: This is a lifesaverreview/text: This truly was a lifesaver for both of my children. For the simple fact alone that I could NEVER remember what side I had fed them on last!I was also really obsessive about how long they slept. So it was great for keeping track of that. This thing kept me sane in those early newborn days.
