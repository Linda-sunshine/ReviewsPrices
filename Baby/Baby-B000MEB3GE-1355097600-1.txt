review/summary: A must for first time parentsreview/text: This ingenious little device is great for newbie parents who are exhausted and have no idea what time it is when their baby wakes up for the 4th time in the middle of the night. It keeps perfect track so that at a glance you can tell when was the last time you fed, changed etc. I would definitely put this on a must-have list.
