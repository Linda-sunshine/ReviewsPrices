review/summary: Pampers dry maxreview/text: My 18 months old daughter is prone to diaper rashes. Anything that's a little hard rubs against her sensitive skin and she gets rashes which look like pimples and red, in a few seconds. I tried all the brands- huggies baby dry, luvs, rite-aid brand, Walgreens brand but only pampers dry max worked for her. It absorbs a lot n she is always dry, unless left overnight( more than 8 hrs). Huggies little movers are also good, but none can beat pampers and as for the price with amazon subscribe and save, pampers is cheaper and delivery is fast. I highly recommend this product for babies with sensitive skin.
