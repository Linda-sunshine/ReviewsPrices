review/summary: FOLLOW THE SIZE CHART!!review/text: I read all the reviews and ordered a size up - Dumb mistake. The whole point of these bands is that they sit BELOW your bump and are very snug (not constricting, but enough to actually do something - otherwise why are you buying it?). I am 5'7" and 155 lbs (135 lbs before pregnancy) and I ordered the medium based on other reviews here, even though I am in the range for a small. It is no where close to fitting. On the tightest setting it is looser than the elastic in my maternity jeans. I was really looking forward to this being in my 8th month, but it is ridiculously loose. The elastic is SUPER-stretchy, so even though it "fits" (as in, it doesn't fall off my body) it is not at all capable of doing it's job. It just sits there. It seems like a good quality belt. For those who are interested it is 3 inches wide.Trust the size guide people!!!!
