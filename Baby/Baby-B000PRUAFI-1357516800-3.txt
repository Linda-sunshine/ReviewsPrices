review/summary: It IS super easy to close...review/text: but it's also kind of loud, in a &#34;clanging&#34; manner, when it does so, not a good choice for a household in need of quiet.The side extensions leave a wider space between bars than the main section, so our Pomeranian can slip through, & we had to use cord wrapped 4-5 times top to bottom to fill in the gap to stop her.Otherwise it's great, fits our strairway and holds up against our marauding Shiba Inu & Pomeranian hooligans.
