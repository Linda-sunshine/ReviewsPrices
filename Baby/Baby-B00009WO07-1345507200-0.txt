review/summary: I really want to like itreview/text: I really want to like it. It is certainly better than the Huggies I bought before but the quality is no where close to the pamper's cruiser we have been using. It is good if you knew you will change diaper frequently as it will hold just one pee then start to sag. I haven't run into any leaking issue yet as I now use it only when I knew my baby will not stay with it for long. We use it as temporary diaper that is why I still give it a two star rating. It is cheaper for more diapers, you get what you paid for.
