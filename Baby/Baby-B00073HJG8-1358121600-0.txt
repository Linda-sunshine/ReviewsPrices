review/summary: Not bad. Not good.review/text: Had problems putting the toys in after we got it hung up. They wanted to roll out the front. Is it too stretchy? Solved the problem by sticking various ears, paws and tails through the back side to hold the animals and arrange them so they looked cute. The 3-year old loves having her &#34;friends&#34; watch her while she sleeps.
