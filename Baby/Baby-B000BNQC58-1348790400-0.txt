review/summary: Good Quality, Poor Featuresreview/text: I bought this to replace a similar turtle that I ordered from one of those discount sites. On the turtle, after a week or so of use one of the buttons popped in so it couldn't be used anymore.The turtle had four colors of lights, and you could choose to have them all on, one on constantly, or automatically fade between the colors. The constantly changing colors kept my children amused, and was really pretty to look at. The turtle also played some pretty celtic music.This ladybug has four buttons: one on/off switch, and three colors. That's IT. You can only pick one of the colors to be on (blue, green, or red which hardly even shows up) but unless you want to sit there pushing the buttons it won't change between them. No music, no other features. For the price, that really surprised me.This ladybug is built well, it doesn't seem like I'll have to worry about the buttons poking in like the turtle, but I am very disappointed by the lack of features, and so are my kids (twins, age 14 months). I recommend trying to find a similar product that does more, as children get bored with this one quickly.
