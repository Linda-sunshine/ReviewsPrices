review/summary: BEST stand alone walker!review/text: This is the second time we have purchased a toy like this and this is by far the best! My son's had a bad habit of tipping over every time he pulled up on it so while I knew my daughter would love one and it would help her walk on her own I was hesitant about purchasing one. This one is wonderful! It hasn't tipped over once! And the toy part on the front has quite a bit for her to do so when she gets tired she often makes phone calls. :) She loves to use this to walk all over the house! I love it and would recommend to any crawler who is starting into the walking phase!
