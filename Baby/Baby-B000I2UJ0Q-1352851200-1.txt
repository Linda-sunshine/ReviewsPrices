review/summary: It's been a month and my son still loves it!review/text: I purchased this when my son was a little over 4 months old. At first he was a little scared but by the second or third time he got use to it and he loves it. He's jumping up and down like crazy. It's been a month and he still enjoys being in the jumparoo, definitely one of our favorite purchases.We especially like that it can rotate 360 degrees because if he's looking for me, he can turn himself around and find me. The jumparoo is also nice that you can adjust the height of it, so if baby grows you can definitely adjust it to accommodate. It's been a month and our son sits in it at least once a day everyday.
