review/summary: Extremely Comfortablereview/text: Because I am a very particular sleeper, I was skeptical regarding how much this pillow would help me sleep on my side. A friend recommended the Back 'N Belly, so I decided to start using it at 18 weeks to get used to sleeping off of my back. The Back 'N Belly is so comfortable. It is my little nest now. I find it so comforting, and it helps contain my body. I didn't notice an issue with the seam (as others have mentioned here). I can't recommend this pillow enough!
