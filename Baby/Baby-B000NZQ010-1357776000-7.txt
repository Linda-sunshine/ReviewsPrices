review/summary: fun toyreview/text: There is a lot to do on this walker. We usually keep it up against the wall so that it doesn't tip over- our 9 month old is pulling up, but this toy isn't sturdy enough for a baby learning. It also gets going pretty fast for a young new 'walker'. But overall, it's fun, busy, and our baby likes it!
