review/summary: Not good for babies over 15 lbs and/or 26 inchesreview/text: We were only to use it when our son is 5 weeks old till he was 3 months old (16 lbs), it's good for newborn who's able to support his own head and he felt alseep in it while where him. Once the baby is over 15lbs, you'll feel most of the weights are on your back and shoulder. Like child birth isn't enough of a strain on mom's back already, this is NOT designed for wearing a long period of time (15 mins and longer). We just purchased the Cybex 2.GO baby carrier from a local store to replace Bjorn original. We were able to try on the Cybex at the store, weights are much well distributed on your hips and shoulder. If you plan on wearing your baby for more than 3 months, I wouldn't recommend Baby Bjorn Original. Try Ergo, Beco or Cybex instead.
