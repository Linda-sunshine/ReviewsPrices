review/summary: Great Walker!review/text: We got this walker for my daughter last year at Christmas when she was just 6 months old. She has played with this toy throughout the entire year. When we first got it, she couldn't stand but the front part of the walker comes off so she could play with everything on the floor. When she started pulling herself up to stand, she would balance on this walker and pretty soon she was pushing it around the house, stopping to play with the colorful toys on the front. Now that she is 16 months old and running everywhere, she still likes pushing this around and it still entertains her. Excellent buy for the money. It is very durable and sturdy. Would buy again!
