review/summary: Fits true to size, not enough supportreview/text: Contrary to other reviews, I found that this belt fits true to size. I am size 4-6 pre-pregnancy, at 32 weeks gained 20 lbs. Medium was too large, Small was just right. However, I ended up returning the belt because I didn't feel like it provided enough support. I ended up getting the Medela one, which provides more coverage and support. Velcro is also better for customized fit, the three options of the eye and hook didn't give me the right fit.
