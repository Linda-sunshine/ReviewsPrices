review/summary: AMAZING disposable diapers.review/text: VERY soft. VERY absorbent. These diapers have never given my son a rash, even when he sleeps through the night. I LOVE SWADDLERS! I tried baby dry because they gave us a pack at my baby shower, but they don't feel as soft nor hold as much as the swaddlers. From what I've seen, the only way these diapers will leak is if you've put them on too loose. That's not because of the diaper though. Or parents who expect a diaper to hold for a whole day! be realistic!! ... either way. GREAT DIAPERS!! never changing!! I'm glad they're making swaddlers for bigger sizes now
