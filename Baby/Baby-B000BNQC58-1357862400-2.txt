review/summary: 17 month old loves itreview/text: I did a lot of research between Dream Lights vs. Cloud b Twilights and am so pleased that we decided to go with Cloud b Twilight for several reasons. The plastic is very strong and durable, the stars are clear and bright on our ceiling and walls and it automatically turns off after 45 min (which is perfect to make sure it doesn't turn off BEFORE the kids fall asleep). The stuffed animal part is very soft and I love how it is educational on teaching our kids about constellations. Most of all, our 17 month old son loves it and its became part of his nightly routine of turning it on and choosing his color. Highly recommend this for any age.
