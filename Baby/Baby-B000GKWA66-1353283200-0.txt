review/summary: My 6 Mont-Old loves his Sheepie!review/text: I bought Sleep sheep before my son was even born, hoping it would sooth him during those long first nights. . . Boy was I wrong (At First!). As a newborn he hated the thing... it made him cry even louder! Now that he's 6 months old, he adores it! It puts him to sleep for every nap and at bedtime. He almost tries to cuddle with it when he goes to sleep it soothes him so much.Pros:*Has 4 different white noise sounds (my son like the whale)*You can adjust the volume up and down as needed*you can set it to play for 25 minutes or 45 minutes before it automatically shuts off*There's a velcro strap on the back to attach it to the crib in order to prevent suffocation in newborns and infants*Well designed and VERY softCons:*I wish there was a setting that played longer before shutting off... it sometimes takes my son an hour to fall asleep*Not for every baby... I would suggest observing your babies sleep habits before investing in this product*Gets dirty easily because of the color and the material
