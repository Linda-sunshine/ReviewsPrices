review/summary: It has it's moments...review/text: I've had this pillow for about three months now. I do like it and can't sleep without it, especially as my pregnancy progresses. I tried to sleep without it the other night and tossed and turned. BUT, the seam is an issue. Often times I wake up because the seam has been digging into my shoulder and my entire arm/shoulder is asleep and tingly. Last night I actually got out scissors and cut that part out (I know!). But it is so much better. I will go to a fabric store and try to find something stretchy to stitch over the huge holes so the stuffing doesn't fall out. I don't understand why the manufacturer hasn't fixed that design flaw. It seems like a lot of people have issues with it. But overall, the pillow is worth it.
