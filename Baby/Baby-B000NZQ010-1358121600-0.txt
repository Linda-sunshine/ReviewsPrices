review/summary: Entertaining & Interactivereview/text: This toy captured my 10 month olds attention as soon as we got it out of the box. Her favorite is the phone, but she loves all of it. It has lots of pretty lights& plays music (2 volume levels). The activity board, as I refer to it, with all the music and buttons attaches to the walking cart, so its ideal for a younger baby to play with separately on the floor. As a learning walker, its great, but beware, those wheels move pretty freely. We use it on carpeted floor, and its best on our shag area rug which offers a bit more resistance for a baby who is standing up and testing out "walking". On a hard floor, this will get away from the baby quickly causing them to fall. If we do use it on a hard floor, I walk with baby and the toy which works ok too. Once you have a true walker, this will also be a fun toy. Overall, we think it's great- just be careful with a new walker so they don't get scared when this takes off causing them to fall.
