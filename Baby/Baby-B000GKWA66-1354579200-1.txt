review/summary: thank goodness for this!review/text: There is something about this thing that soothes kids instantly. I have not figured out what exactly is so soothing about the sounds, but it works without fail. I've put this thing in my friends' strollers when their babies are acting up, and each time marvel at how quickly the babies stop fussing and crying! Would highly recommend, for crib, car, stroller, anywhere!
