review/summary: Perfect as baby corral, and to protect TVreview/text: We have a few of these. One we had setup as a corral, a big circle basically. That works great. We also have one set broken up into 2-3 piece segments. We use those to block the baby from getting to the TV stuff, the window, behind the couch, etc. Works great!I will scream to any parent that these are not a substitute for your attentiveness and attention. Never leave a baby or kid alone, even if you have baby gates, babyproofing, and baby play yards like this.
