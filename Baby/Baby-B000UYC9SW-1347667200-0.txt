review/summary: Baby K'Tanreview/text: After reading other people's reviews on the Baby K'Tan, I had my heart set on having it and I really looked forward to its arrival. I needed a comfortable carrier that my baby could relax in, one that does more than my Baby Bjorn and has multiple wear positions.The Baby K'Tan is very soft and cozy looking, and I like that it is way compact and easy to tuck into a diaper bag. The only thing I'm not so keen on is the sizing. Since I'm petite (5'2", 110 lbs after losing baby weight), I ordered the XS size. It is indeed extra small, so tight in fact, that on the first wear, the fabric was cutting off the circulation to my baby's legs and they were turning dark red, then purple. Off went the Baby K'Tan! I've tried stretching it out but it's still too snug for my liking and I just worry too much about my baby while wearing it. She doesn't seem to mind it that much once she's in it, but she will start whimpering to get out after about 5 minutes.Its tight fit also makes it somewhat difficult to get the baby in by myself. It's easier if you have someone else there to hold up the baby while you arrange the fabric. I'm not sure if my experience is typical, or if I just have an overly large baby (3 months old, 15 pounds, full head control). I want to like the Baby K'Tan...but I think it is better suited for newborns or small babies who want to curl up in the fabric and sleep.The Baby K'Tan is extremely comfortable for me, but not my baby. Once it's on, it feels like your baby is a part of your body--no back or shoulder pain. I wish she fit in it better!I will keep the Baby K'Tan for my next kid, but for now, I'll stick to the Bjorn because my baby's legs fit in it better.
