review/summary: Easy to assemble and great fun for 4.5 month old!review/text: I examined nearly hundreds of these jumpers before settling on this one and I am glad I went with this particular model. It is so easy to assemble and everything snaps into place and it even coils up to fit nicely into a corner to save space. There are some nice toys to play with and the bounce is pretty good. The lights and music are not annoying and it seems sturdy and safe. The only complain I have is, my son is 4.5 months old and he still does not touch the ground yet at the lowest setting. Also, there does not seem to be as many toys as I thought on this. Don't get me wrong it is adequate, but other models seem to have more. Other than that it is a great purchase.
