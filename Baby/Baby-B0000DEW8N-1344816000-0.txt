review/summary: My 2 year old likes itreview/text: I bought this for my 2 year old daughter because her tummy was getting a little bit too close in her high chair and it made her uncomfortable. This booster seat is small, lightweight, easy to clean, and safe. The straps stay put and I don't worry about if she is going to fall out of it and my daughter seems to be very comfortable in it. I think she likes that she is sitting a regular sized chair instead of a high chair. I definitely do my research before purchasing online and I recommend this.
