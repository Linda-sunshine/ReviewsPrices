review/summary: The only seat you needreview/text: We toyed with the idea of getting one of those fancy booster seats but eventually settled on this one due to the amazing reviews. We are VERY glad we did! Well made + lightweight + easy to clean + adjustable = seriously great product! The only complaint I have is that the straps stain relatively easily. The rest of it held up for two years and was still in amazing shape when we sold it to a consignment store. WORTH EVERY PENNY!
