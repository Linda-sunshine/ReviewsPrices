review/summary: My 11month old nephew loved it!review/text: Great product that my nephew really is enjoying and helping him building the confidence to walk. The first item that I received didn't work but as always Amazon's great customer service got a new one sent out in no time. I am giving it 4/5 because there are some improvements that can be made, such as the phone easily coming out of it's holding place. Maybe that is just because it is my nephew's favorite part.
