review/summary: Great Gate!review/text: I bought one... then a second... then a third... Have them at the top of both stairs and the bottom of our main floor stair. I've had them installed for about 4 months and they still work perfectly. I think the locking mechanism is very solid too and will not be figured out by a baby or most toddlers. And they auto-close! That's a great feature. With two older kids and the baby I'm just wondering how long they will last.... but that would go for any gate. These are great and a great deal.
