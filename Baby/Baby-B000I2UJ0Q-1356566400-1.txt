review/summary: This thing is AWESOME!review/text: My daughter LOVES this thing! It keeps her entertained as she jumps around, plays and interacts with all of the many toys and features it contains. With her so engaged, it gives momma time to do things around the house (within reason and with her in my view, of course).We put it on our registry simply because of all of the positive reviews and I'm so grateful that someone got it for us!I highly recommend the Rainforest Jumperoo. So much fun!
