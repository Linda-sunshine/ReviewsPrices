review/summary: Great high chair alternativereview/text: After getting tired of cleaning our fabric covered full size high chair, I opted to order one of these. I had reservations, afraid my 1 year old would topple over and not be secure enough but it's great. It attaches securely to our dining room chairs and is SUPER easy to clean..you can throw the whole thing in the sink and wipe it/spray it. I love that it's portable and we can takeit on vacation, to restaurants, and weddings/showers/birthdays, etc. where there may not be enough high chairs. I'm super pleased with the purchase and wish I would have made the switch sooner.
