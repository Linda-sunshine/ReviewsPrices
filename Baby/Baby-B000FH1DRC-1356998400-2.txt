review/summary: Pampersreview/text: Love the Pampers brand, one because of how much fluid they retain. Two because of the blue strip that shows when they are wet. Our little one hates being wet and will cry with just a little bit of blue stripe. We have had other diapers and without the blue stipe we couldn't tell if she was a little wet, hungry or just wanted to be held. Thanks Pampers.
