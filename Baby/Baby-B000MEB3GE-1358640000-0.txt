review/summary: Limited use, but could be handyreview/text: We used this a LOT in the first week, but ever since then it's been gathering dust. We kept forgetting to set the timer, and couldn't agree when to push the sleep one (do we time from the beginning of when the naps start to the end of the nap, or from nap to nap, or use it to tell how long he'd been awake?). The first couple weeks with a new baby are such a blur anyways, while this helped us be aware of what we needed to be doing, I don't think I'd spend the money again.
