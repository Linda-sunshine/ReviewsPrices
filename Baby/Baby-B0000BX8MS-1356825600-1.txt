review/summary: Warm and durablereview/text: I have several Halo products. I have never been disappointed by the durable zipper and fabrics. The fleece bags are cozy for the winter and great for children transitioning from swaddle to blankets. They can't kick them off and so won't wake up cold. The inverted zipper makes late night diaper changes a breeze.
