review/summary: Been using these since she was onereview/text: We switched from pampers to these because of cost and I believe fit for our daughter. She started crawling at 6 mo, walking at 9 and running at 12. I like the convenience of the big packs and subscribe and save. Ends up being cheaper than Costco and their Kirkland brand.
