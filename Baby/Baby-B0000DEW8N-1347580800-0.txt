review/summary: Great Booster chair!review/text: This booster chair is fantastic - easy to set up, easy to clean - my son is a very enthusiastic eater, i.e. food everywhere and all I need is to wipe this chair down with a sponge and its ready to go - and the price is awesome - loved it so much I bought one for my brother's little girl too!
