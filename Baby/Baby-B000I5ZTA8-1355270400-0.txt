review/summary: mehreview/text: Maybe for a smaller woman it would be helpful. I am a pregnant size 14/16, xl in maternity and I noticed almost no support for my belly while wearing this. Also, it is a huge pain to move when going to the bathroom and readjusting. I would not recommend this product at all. I find the much wider belly bands with no hooks to be more supportive, and less hassle to wear.
