review/summary: Unbelievablereview/text: I bought these diapers for my 6 month old daughter after using Swaddlers since she was born. The coupon was only for the Baby Dry and with a name like that, would you think anything else than a dry baby??? Guess again. These diapers are terrible. Of course I got the largest quantity too, 246 diapers, for $38.99. Boy I thought I was making out like a bandit! I changed my daughter tonight at 6:15 and it's 8:15 and she's soaked through to her clothes. And every single morning after sleeping a full 10 hours, she's got wet sheets and blankets. I cannot believe how disappointing this item is. I am shocked that Pampers even makes a diaper like this, when they have Swaddlers on the market. Please, if you are reading this before you switch over, DO NOT BUY THE BABY DRY. I am devastated that I am stuck with 200 more of these awful diapers.
