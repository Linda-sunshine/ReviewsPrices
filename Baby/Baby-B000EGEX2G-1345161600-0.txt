review/summary: Don't trust the 5 stars, they haven't had it long enough yetreview/text: Don't be surprised if after about a year it starts falling apart, at least that is what ours did. It first started squeaking a little and it went quickly downhill from there. The bearings don't hold up well and soon deteriorate into nothing, but a rod. We have started to cannibalize the ottoman now to fix the glider, but I think that we will just get rid of it and find something better.
