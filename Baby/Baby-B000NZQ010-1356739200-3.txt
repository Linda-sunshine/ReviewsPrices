review/summary: Absolute delight for an infant/toddler!review/text: I purchased the Sit to Stand Walker as a Christmas present for my 6 month old daughter. I knew it would be a while before she was able to push the toy, however, I was intrigued by the ability to sit and play with it at such a young age. I honestly assumed it would be a little while before she was really "into" the toy. I was so wrong! She LOVED it from the first moment she began playing with it. There is a great variety to hold her interest - she loves spinning the gears, as well as the shape sorters and light up buttons on the top. This toy easily holds her interest for 15-20 minutes, which for a 6 month old, is a HUGE deal!There are only two things I could see where VTech could improve on the Sit to Stand: the phone and the wheels. The phone is not attached to the toy by a cord like the shape sorters. It would be so nice if the phone were connected. Also, the wheels don't have a brake, which means that she can't just sit down in front of it and start playing - it rolls away. We work around this be either sitting the toy at the edge of the sofa or a table leg, but it would have been convenient to be able to lock the wheels.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this toy. You won't regret the purchase!
