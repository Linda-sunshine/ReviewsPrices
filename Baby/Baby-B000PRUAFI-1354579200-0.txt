review/summary: Great for my dog!review/text: I got this baby gate for my house to prevent my dog from going upstairs. He gets real clingy so sometimes when we'd go up to the second floor, he'd have to follow us. If we really needed to be upstairs and he couldn't be trusted on the first floor alone, we'd end up having to tie him up for a little bit, which I didn't like doing, but was necessary. With this gate, I was able to leave my dog on the first floor, and know that he won't be able to sneak upstairs. He's a big dog, but a dumb dog, so I don't have a problem with him getting over the gate.Now for logistics. When it came, it looked a little bent, but don't worry, that's only because of the intense strain the top of the gate is under in order for it to be mounted by tension (as opposed to drilling holes and screwing it into the walls). It works just like a tension rod for your closet would work, or those floor to ceiling shower caddies. Once you get it in the position you want it, you just turn the knobs until it's as tightly secured as you'd like it. As far as assembly, there was only really minimal work to be done, and for me personally, it was only because I had to put the extender piece in to made it wider. The instructions were really clear.One thing I was slightly confused about were the little white cap sort of pieces that fit onto the pegs that press against the wall. I didn't use them because they cover the grippy material that helps the arms hold onto the wall surfaces. I think the caps are for if you want to drill into the wall and really secure the gate, like if it's at the top of the stairs and you don't want any chance it will slip if someone leans too hard against it.All in all. this is one of the best purchases I have ever made for the house. I don't know how I lived without it!
