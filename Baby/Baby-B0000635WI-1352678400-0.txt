review/summary: Helpful pillowreview/text: This pillow, although very expensive, was worth it for me. It definitely improved my sleep at night during my pregnancy. It helps me feel supported but you can use it so many different ways, it's easy to adjust to a new position if you need to. The cover is also pretty easy to get on and off for washing. Despite the high price, I would recommend this pillow highly.
