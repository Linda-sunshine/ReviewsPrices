review/summary: Easy to use!review/text: I love this gate. It's easy to open, it swings close by itself (even though it won't shut closed if it's not alligned properly) and it stays wide open when needed. It opens by lifting the actual gate up, so there aren't any latches that might break. My only issue is the lock... I can't figure out how my dog (a 65 lbs boxer) is able to open it even when locked. I might have to set up a camera to see how he does it. Other than that, I'm glad I bought it.
