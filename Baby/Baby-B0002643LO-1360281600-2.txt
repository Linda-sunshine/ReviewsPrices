review/summary: go with pampers swaddlersreview/text: I have two main complaints:1. These are not as absorbant as the pampers swaddlers, and since it's a diaper, that's pretty much its main task. I didn't experience any liquid leakage, but solids were problematic. Any more detailed description will probably prevent this review from being published...2. These diapers do not have the wetness indicator lines that are found on the swaddlers. I didn't realize that those lines were so useful until I subscribed to these (used to get them at Target).Anyway, these two reasons are sufficient for me to cancel my subscription after two shipments.This review is by no means related to Amazon's subscription and shipping service. I think Amazon does a fantastic job with that. All shipments arrived before the stated arrival dates with no problems at all!
