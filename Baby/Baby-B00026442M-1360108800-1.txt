review/summary: LEAKY - the worst!review/text: Summary: these leak terribly. Today, between my two twins I had 3 leaks and now I have a huge pile of laundry. It's not a fluke - it's been this way for the last week+ that we've been using these diapers. I ordered 2 boxes of these, and the second unopened box is going back to Amazon. No more.In more detail: I have twins and from sizes NB through 3 they have been wearing Pampers Swaddlers, which were fantastic. When it came time to switch to size 4, I looked around on Amazon and only found Sensitive Swaddlers in size 4, which were much more expensive compared to regular Swaddlers. So... I thought why not try these cheaper Baby Dry ones. I mean, they are Pampers, same brand, so how different can they be? A WORLD of difference. We went from not having any leaks ever to having a rash and leaking 3 times a day. In order for the babies to stay dry, I literally have to change them every 90 minutes now, which is ridiculous. So: cliche by so true - you do get what you pay for. And in this case, I am not saving any money because I am going through the diapers at a much higher rate. I'm going back to Swaddlers, even though they are more expensive, they are worth every penny.
