review/summary: Almost perfectreview/text: This is a great product, it's sturdy when it's all connected, it can fit in fairly small spaces and we love the colors. My only problem is the price. We definitely needed a fence to keep our son out of things he shouldn't get into, especially while we were moving but it's sooooo expensive. I know you can't put a price on your child's safety but maybe they could put a lower price on the product, it's almost not worth that much.
