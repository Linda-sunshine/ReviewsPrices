review/summary: Sketchy Qualityreview/text: I really liked the idea of this product, and don't have nearly as many issues with it as a lot of the negative reviews I read. All three of the colors (blue, green, and amber) show up just fine on my sons ceiling when it's dark. At first, I just wished it would plug in so it could project all night long. Then, all of a sudden, it started staying on all night. I have no idea what happened - maybe it fell and an internal piece broke, but whatever it was made me happy. It wasn't staying on every night, though, which is strange. When I walked into my sons room this morning, however, I was not pleased. The turtle was flashing. Upon some online research, this is apparently how it alerts you to a dying battery. Seriously? You have the light flash on and off like an alarm? If this starts as your child is drifting off to sleep, this could be extremely distracting. If your kid is as difficult as mine to put down, the last thing you want is a light flashing on and off, waking them up. I am going to investigate a little and see why ours is staying on, but I'm now considering looking for a different night light. Unfortunately, there aren't many alternatives that just project stars, so stick on glow-in-the-dark stars might be the best solution.
