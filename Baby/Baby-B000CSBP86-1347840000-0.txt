review/summary: Really Easy to Use Baby Carrierreview/text: BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original - Black, ClassicAfter seeing some other baby carriers, I found the BabyBjorn more suited toward my preference. It's really light and sturdy, ideal for my son. I was thinking about getting a newer model, but the classic model does the same function for far less cost. I found the instruction easy to follow and was wearing it right away. It is also good to have your spouse adjust the straps for you since I'm a big guy.
