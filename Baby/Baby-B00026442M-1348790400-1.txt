review/summary: Pampers Baby Dryreview/text: I am not a fan of the pampers baby dry. I have a 16 month old and when the diaper gets wet it starts to sag in the bottom to the point where it looks funny and I am sure is uncomfortable for her. The fact that she is such a mover I think makes this not a great diaper for her age. The pamper cruisers are great and that is what she is wearing now. Before I could not decide between the baby dry size 5 and the cruisers size 5 because I really didn't know what the difference was and now I do! The fit!
