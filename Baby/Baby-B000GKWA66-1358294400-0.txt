review/summary: Great Shower Giftreview/text: When I was invited to a baby shower I asked my sister (mother of a 1 year old) what I should get the mom to be. She said without a doubt, a Cloud b Sound Machine (she has the giraffe but I picked the sheep to go with the nursery theme). I thought about getting the travel sized version but my sister said the regular one has more sounds, goes louder, and it was only a few $ more. I also saved on the cost by buying it here rather than at a store, where they go for like $30.She was super stoked to open it! She didn't have it on her registry but said she intended on getting one. Perfect mix of adorable and useful for a shower gift!
