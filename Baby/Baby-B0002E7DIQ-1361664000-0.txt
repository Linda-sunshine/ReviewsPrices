review/summary: Only buy if you're SHORTreview/text: I have two major gripes about this product.1) It's made for someone around 5'4". Since it's "contours" are the appeal, you had better be the right body size or else it's no different than a normal body pillow (only much more expensive.) If you are any taller the benefit is lost.2) How expensive is stuffing? You would think very pricey by they way they skimp on this. Mine was missing about a cubic foot from one of the ends, but more importantly, missing another cubic foot right where the head goes. Huge empty spot. And you can't really "re-adjust" the stuffing.
