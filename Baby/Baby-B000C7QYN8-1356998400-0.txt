review/summary: Perfect balance of wetnessreview/text: I'll start by saying I really like that these wipes aren't too "wet". I found that pampers are really wet and leave the baby's butt wetter than it started! These are damp enough to do The job of cleaning but not too wet that I have to do a super dry after the wipe! If we didn't dry after the wipe, we would start getting a diaper rash. Not worth it!I gave it 4 stars because I'm not a fan of the smell. I actually started with these wipes, then went to pampers, and then for the reasons above went back to these. The smell isn't all that bad, just not as pretty smelling as some other wipes out there. Overall, very happy with these wipes!
