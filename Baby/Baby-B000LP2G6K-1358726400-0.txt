review/summary: More than Satisfied with this Graco Playardreview/text: I purchased this playard for my 3 mos. old grand daughter who was traveling to visit me for the weekend. The Graco Playard was erected in minutes by me (Grandma) and ready when she arrived. It is very sturdy, mobile friendly, and comfy. I put a padded cozy fitted sheet on it and my grand daughter rested well. Packing up the playard was also in minutes. It's very compact so it takes up very little room in the car. I am so happy with my selection.
