review/summary: too good for a pregnant woman and even after deliveryreview/text: I been using this almost 4months now.. I love it.. only one small problem is it doesn't recline.. but worth it for the price..... if you go anywhere else you will be paying more.. I got it for $129 + 10% off = $116 + free shipping....use it.... feel it.. I am sure you will like tooo.......
