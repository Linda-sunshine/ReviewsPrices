review/summary: Great for learning to walkreview/text: Our baby LOVES this toy! She has enjoyed playing with it since she was just sitting up and could only play with the front panel. It is a bit tipsy though, so we would have to hold on to the back so she wouldn't pull it down on top of herself. As she learned to walk she would push it all over the house. Now, at a year, she still loves this toy and will even push it from the front. Best toy ever. Warning to parents sensitive to obnoxious toy music: this thing plays on and on and on... just when you think it stops, it will start singing again. There is your fair warning. BUT the kid loves it, so we put up with it. Her favorite is the little door that opens and closes on the front, and the phone. It would be better if the phone was attached by a string of some kind, but somehow we haven't lost it yet.
