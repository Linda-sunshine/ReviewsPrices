review/summary: My sister and her fiance love itreview/text: At first i was hesitant in purchasing this item, because some of the reviews criticized and complained about the &#34;corners' being uncomfortable, and other minor issues but i did more research and found this to be the best out of the whole maternity pillows. To my relief i was right, my sister has fallen in love with this thing and claims that its the most comfortable thing ever and it helps get rid of her heartburn. she also says its great due to the fact that she can turn finding a comfortable spot while never having to re-adjust it. If you were in my position, not knowing a damn thing about maternity pillows, trust me, after hours of research i came to pick this one, and it was clearly the best pick, i still get thanked for it up to this day. I highly recommend this to whoever is pregnant, or wants a comfy mega body pillow
