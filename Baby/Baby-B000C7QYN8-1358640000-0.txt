review/summary: Great buy!review/text: I buy this product for a number of reasons, not the least of which is price. Can't beat it unless prices have changed that much in the last 6 months.I have no babies or children in the house, so I can't say how good these would be on babies' bottoms. In my unasked opinion, however, I don't think they're moist or large enough to clean a really messy booty.For myself, I use them everyday to loosen up my makeup before I take a shower and when I just need to freshen up. They're not too moist, so makeup doesn't get into my eyes; and they're small enough that I don't feel I'm wasting money on a large wipe for a small jobs.They're Really scentless which is Great, as I'm not a perfume person. I'm clean -- that's good enough. And if I do spritz with perfume, I know I won't be clubbing folks with clashing scents.This box of five packs w/70 wipes each is the best price out there and I've checked. Used to buy the store brand wipes from a chain drugstore, but these are better made, better priced and Really Unscented.
