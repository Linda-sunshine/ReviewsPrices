review/summary: best nightlight ever!review/text: We've owned the green turtle for 2 years. And just recently purchased the pink ladybug for my 3 year old. My preschoolers LOVE their nightlights. They sleep with them every night, and they travel with us when we go see grandparents. They're soft enough to keep in bed, but hard enough to withstand 2, 3 & 4 year olds. In the 2 years that we've owed the turtle, I think we've changed batteries 3 times. And it's used every night.I agree with others that the amber light on the green turtle does not show very well. It's a faint light, and appropriate for a night light when you don't want to look at stars (cause you can't make them out), but still need a night light.The pink ladybug, however, does NOT have an amber setting. It has red, blue & green and ALL are vibrant colors on my kids' bedroom ceiling.Unlike the newer "as seen on tv" models, these stars look much more realistic and there's no logos that shine - just stars & a quarter moon. My children adore their night lights and I'd recommend this product highly - we wouldn't consider another brand when looking for a light for our 2nd child. Cloud B is too awesome.
