review/summary: Stick with itreview/text: My pilates instructor recommended this pillow when I first got pregnant because one of her other clients had bought it and loved it. I am a person who liked to sleep on my stomach or with a very thin pillow on my side or back (prior to getting pregnant). I HATED this product for the first two nights. It felt like my neck was at a weird angle and I kept flipping the long side over each time I got up in the night, so sometimes I would have to climb over it to get out of bed. I decided I was giving it one last try or I was returning it. On the third night I put the long side between my husband and I and I just rolled over and either had the long side at my back or up against my stomach. I would pull the lower curve up between my legs to keep my hips even. I was sold on that third night. I was able to put my head on the smaller curve at the top and that helped keep my shoulders and chest open. My husband and I call it the "great wall" and while it cut down on our intimacy, it also made him feel more relaxed that he wouldn't roll into me/my stomach/the baby in the middle of the night. I had a number of nights that I would wake up with aching thighs (the muscles and the bones) and that was because my legs were on top of each other without the pillow in between. As long as I make sure the pillow stays between my legs and my hips are fairly even/straight, I rarely wake up with any aches or pains. I recommended sticking with this product for several nights to see if it can work for you - I am happy I did.
