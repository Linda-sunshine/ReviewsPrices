review/summary: Digs into neck, might cut the seam and hope I can use it...review/text: Previously, I had tried the snoogle and ironically my neck was so comfy I thought it was the BEST pillow - but i'd still end up on my back so I returned it and got this Back 'N 'Belly pillow thinking I'd have suppor ton both sides... Well, i didn't roll over but it forced my head up so high that on my side (i'm petite, 5'2" and weighed around 110-115 when I tried it) so I usually only need one low pillow and this was like a 2 pillows to me. Past the angle though, the most frustrating thing was the seam. i had read that in reviews but honestly NEVER could have imagined how horrible it would be. Imagine a rope pressing on your neck/shoulder ALL night. I worried I'd loose blood to my brain!!! Finally, my work around was to put a smaller pillow under my shoulder so that i was higher or it somehow got me to not have to use the head part as a real pillow. My 6'2" husband thought it was great. He is obviouly taller and he loves to stack pillows and crank his neck. So maybe his ear/head fell more in the center without getting the gouge that I experienced. However, I was the pregnant one and I'm the one who needed the fancy pillow... Another friend of mine who is built differently than I thinks this is the best pillow. Maybe it dependant upon your size, or maybe it is dependant upon luck about whether you get a horrible seam or not. I didn't even have fluff under my head. Just a seam! For my next pregnancy i will shop for a new pillow. The other problem was that sometimes the feet area split open so i was searching for a portion to toss my knee over but that stopped later in pregnancy because I moved less...
