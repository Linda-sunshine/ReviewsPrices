review/summary: Must-have for Sleeping Babyreview/text: I got this as a gift for my sister's baby. At first they didn't use it when giving their child a nap, but now it is a MUST for his two hour daytime naps. It cuts out the background noises (we live on a busy street) while providing soothing sounds. He points to it every time he gets tired and just needs to have it by his side.
