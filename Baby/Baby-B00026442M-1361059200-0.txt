review/summary: Horrible!review/text: I won't use these again! They kept falling apart and the gel crystals went everywhere! They got all over my toddlers bed!!! I change his diaper every couple of hours, there is no way these could be used for 12 hours to keep your baby dry. I'm never buying pampers again, horrible experience with these.
