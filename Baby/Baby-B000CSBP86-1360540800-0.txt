review/summary: Freedom to move around the house!review/text: We love our BabyBjorn! We were given a different hands-free carrier at a baby shower, but it was clunky and difficult to strap our baby into. We hardly ever used it. But once we researched other carriers and discovered all the positive reviews for the BabyBjorn, we had to try it ourselves. Now we use it all the time for our 4-month-old baby girl. She loves it! It is so simple to use, easy to pack on trips and makes chores around the house so much easier because the BabyBjorn TRULY leaves your hands free to do any kind of chore! We will never use another carrier!!
