review/summary: Lammy!review/text: This lamb is so perfect and can't put it into words! First of all, the material is so soft and the features of the lamb are so sweet. It has a crib strap and the music box is completely removable for washing and so simple to do. My New Grandbaby about loves and coo's to it. Her favorite sound is the heartbeat and fell so fast asleep! her other favorite sound is the whale songs. The music box has different sounds which can be volumed up or down, and has two different timers to set. It was so important to me to find a nursery product that has a womb heartbeat, this has it and more! Absolutely love this lamb!
