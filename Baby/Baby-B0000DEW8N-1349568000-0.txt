review/summary: Great seat after a highchairreview/text: My son really needed to be transitioned to a seat were he can sit properly at a table ( with out kneeling in the chair) This seat is great. I am sure I will use the tray when we travel but we are trying to get away from the tray thing all together. My son is 19 mo old and he did great in the fp space saver high chair till this point. I am not sure why people are commenting on this booster not tilting properly -- I didn't think it was designed for an infant to start feeding. We should have got it a few months ago when he started climbing on his own into the highchair. Straps securely to out wooden kitchen chairs. easy to wipe down or vacuum out. :)
