review/summary: Booster Chairreview/text: This works great at Mimi's house. I bought this to use when my granddaughter comes to visit. It works great! We attach it to a bar stool and don't have a storage problem like having a free standing high chair. It straps to the bar stool securely and works great. The top has two trays and a cover, all of which I put in the dishwasher for cleaning. I love this booster. This product is well made.
