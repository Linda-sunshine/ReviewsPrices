review/summary: For my son's new roomreview/text: I bought this for my son after moving him out of the nursery & into his big boy room. He was nervous so I bought this to comfort him . I had previously bought one for my daughter and it worked wonders for her when she transitioned to her big girl room. Definitely recommend this little guy.
