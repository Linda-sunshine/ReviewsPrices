review/summary: Best disposable diapers out therereview/text: These diapers are the best disposable diapers you could ever buy for your baby. My baby has sensitive sking so we mainly use cloth diapers but for daycare she needs disposables and these are the only ones that dont make her get a rash. Huggies are just useless for my baby. If you do a side by side comparison of this diaper versus your regular Huggies snug and dry you can see and feel and smell the difference. These are so much softer and gentler on the skin. We used this on our baby from the hospital and then we tried huggies when she was about 3 months because we received so many boxes of huggies, after just one day of using huggies, her poor little bottom was covered red bumps, so we returned all of them to the store and bought more of these pampers swaddlers.Like all other disposable diapers these diapers do leak sometimes especially if you dont double check around the thighs to make sure the ruffles have been properly pulled out. These are still the best disposable diapers.
