review/summary: Not loud enoughreview/text: I bought this because it had been recommended by my sister. I liked it when I first used it because it seemed to help my little one sleep longer, but I was annoyed that the sounds would stop after 43 minutes and I'd have to keep re-starting it. I also feel like it wasn't really loud enough -- babies are used to sounds as loud as the shower in the womb, but the sleep sheep isn't even half as loud. I ended up downloading an app on my iPad that plays white noise continuously and as loud as the iPad will go, and my 2 month old daughter is sleeping 6 hours each night.
