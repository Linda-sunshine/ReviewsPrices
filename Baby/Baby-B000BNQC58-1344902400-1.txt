review/summary: Wonderfulreview/text: I got this for my seven year old daughter. I thought well maybe she is too old for it, but she had her heart set on it. Truly, it is wonderful! The stars on the ceiling are fabolous. She can change the colors of the stars. It came with a birth certificate and really I just love this product. I would recommend this product to anyone including giving it as a baby shower gift.
