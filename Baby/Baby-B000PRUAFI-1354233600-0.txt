review/summary: This gate is great for dogsreview/text: My little chinese crested dog was able to jump high enough to clear the barricade I made so I needed something higher. I found this on amazon at a reasonable price. I was very happy when it arrived. It was fairly easy to install and works great. It has a feature that allows you to leave it open or have it swing closed behind you as you pass through it. It's strong enough for kids and larger dogs too. I'm very happy with this purchase.
