review/summary: Best investment since my son was bornreview/text: We have bought bassinets that were never slept in, clothes that never fit, toys that only I have played with.But this play yard is the best investment we have made yet. I recommend the rainbow colors, just set it up and act like you don't even want the kid inside of it. My 10-month old loves it and it gives me enough peace of mind and time to unwind to make up for some of the less-wise purchases.It folds up easily but with how easily you can move it and change shapes I think it is easier just to leave out.
