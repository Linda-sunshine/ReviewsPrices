review/summary: Great Idea, Great Buyreview/text: This was bought for my 4 month old to grow into. We put it together in about 20 minutes, and had it up and working. She loves it. She's been playing in it as well as rocking in it. The ability to go from recline to sitting up, rocking to relaxing is great. It's sturdy and well built with great attention to detail. The plastic screw covers, for example, are reinforced with metal threads.The only downside is that the seat isn't very cushioned - but we plan on fixing that by moving over a snuggler from her swing.tl;drI would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with a baby that is looking for a long term purchase.
