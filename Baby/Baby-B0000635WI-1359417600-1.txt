review/summary: great...review/text: only slept on it one night, but really enjoy it. i agree that it is expensive, but pillows all around are expensive... usually. this is comfortable and cradles my whole body... it does interfere with being close to anyone else in the bed... it forms a cocoon around me... but so far, i am enjoying that!
