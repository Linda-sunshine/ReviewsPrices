review/summary: A Must Havereview/text: My husband and I are first time parents and we have been using this since we brought home our baby from the hospital in May. I bought this based on the rave reviews from here and I'm glad I did. It has been an invaluable tool and is still essential for everyday care to our baby to this day.We primarily use the Feed and Change buttons so that we don't feed or change him too soon. You might be thinking, "I can just download a baby timer onto my phone... FOR FREE! Why would I want to pay for this?" Well, if you share your phone with your family and they have access to it all the time or if you're a single parent, thats fine. If you plan on using a partner and you keep your phone to yourself for the most part, it would make sense to have a neutral timer that anyone can have access to.I noticed that a lot of the complaints were about it not keeping track of how much baby ate and whatever measurements for different things. Keep in mind; this is an incredibly simple tool meant to track time. If you want something more complex then you may be better off getting that phone app or just writing stuff down. In any case, I hope you find what works for you!
