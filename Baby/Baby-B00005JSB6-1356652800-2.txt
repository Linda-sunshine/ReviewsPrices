review/summary: Huggiesreview/text: As parents of eleven children we have gone through many brands of diapers, comparing them and trying to figure out which ones worked best for us. We conclude that Huggies are our favorite. We don't have troubles with leakage or diaper rash as we did with the other off brands. We highly recommend Huggies Snug and Dry.
