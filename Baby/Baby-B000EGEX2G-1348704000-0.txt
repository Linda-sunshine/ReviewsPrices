review/summary: Uncomfortable and Squeaksreview/text: The look and design of this chair is great. However, after having the chair in use prior to our baby's arrival the wood started creaking and squeaking. This is the ultimate reason why we returned the chair. The chair is a tight squeeze for Dad at 6'1'' 220 lbs, but fits Mom nicely 5'2'' ~125 lbs. The seat cushion is very thin and firm and can cause numbness in the rear and legs.
