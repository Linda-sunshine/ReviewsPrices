review/summary: Very good and comfortable for infants..review/text: I have been using the Huggies diapers for my kids since last 5 years (2 kids) and have been very pleased with them.I have tried other diapers for my kids and have one or the other issues but never with Huggies.Though they are slightly higher in price but the quality is really worth couple of cents extra that you will be spending per diaper for Huggies...Not to mention that you will be using more diapers per day if you are using the cheaper brand. So the per diaper cost ma be less but total monthly cost will remain the same.....
