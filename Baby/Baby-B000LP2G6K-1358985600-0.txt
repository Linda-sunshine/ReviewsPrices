review/summary: Fantastic Portable Crib for Travelreview/text: I'm an Army wife, and when my son was 15-months-old my husband deployed for a year. My son and I lived on the road, from one family's house to another.We flew with this and just checked it as-is. Despite several flights, and flight changes, there was no problem with it. Since it counts as a "necessary" item, it also checked for free along with a stroller and a car seat. It didn't even get a rip in the bag/sack it comes in. Perfect.My boy grew up sleeping in this, and it remained sturdy, stable, and safe until he was nearly two-years-old.The "frills" these things come with (diaper bag, changing table, mobile) are all cute and fine, but realize your personal, actual needs in buying these things. My boy loved the mobile, but he quickly outgrew needing the "baby" features of this bed. In our life it's primary function was as a portable-crib: and it was excellent for that.
