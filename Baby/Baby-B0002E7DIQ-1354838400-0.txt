review/summary: Worth Considering!review/text: I was having trouble sleeping and normally toss and turn a lot. Purchased this in my 4th month of pregnancy and slept in total &#34;black out.&#34; Better sleep than when I wasn't pregnant. I love that I can switch directions as in face either way. It's a cocoon in the best sense and I strongly recommend giving it a try.Significant others may complain because there's a &#34;wall&#34; between the 2 of you in bed, but it's still worth it. The quality of sleep I was able to experience was so beneficial. We make &#34;Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!&#34; jokes about it now.
