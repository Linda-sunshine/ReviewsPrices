review/summary: love these diapersreview/text: I love these diapers. I used them in the beginning when they did not have baby flex. They were a bit binding and leaked easily. I then switched to luvs for the price but they did not have stretch tabs either my son was between size 3 and 4 so the extra room would cause leakage. Size 4 in pampers baby dry were just right and the flex tabs are comfortable for crawling and movement. I liked pampers cruisers but they were a little pricey. I love that the regular pampers have stretch for the same price. Now if only Luvs would do the same.
