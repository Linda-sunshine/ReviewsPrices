review/summary: Baby's Favoritereview/text: We bought this for our son when he was about 4 months, around the same age our other friends' kids started enjoying their jumpers, but he refused to like it until he turned 6 months. Then magically, one day, it was all he wanted to do.Baby likes it because:-it has exciting, upbeat music-lots of touchy feely toys-dangling toys for him to look up at-it swivels so he doesn't get bored looking at the same thing the entire timeWe like it because:-baby is entertained for 20-30 minutes so we can get things done around the house-the seat comes out easily for washing-the music is catchy and fun but it doesn't get stuck in your head like some toys :)-height adjusts easily and has three settings for growthThe only thing I don't care for is that it doesn't fit through most standard door frames when all assembled. You have to break it down to move it from room to room, which isn't so bad, but not entirely convenient.
