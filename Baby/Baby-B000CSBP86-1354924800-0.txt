review/summary: Wonderful productreview/text: I bought this for my 3 month old daughter and she loves it. She is 6 months now and i still use it. She loves to sleep in it when we are outdoor.My only concern is how long i can use this for her. The product does comes with various adjustments but not sure what is the exact limit. Overall it is a wonderful and useful product.
