review/summary: No Diaper Rash!review/text: With the coming of my twins, I had to save as much as I can. So I used cheaper diapers...but soon even with putting generous amount of diaper rash cream every change, diaper rash came in red, raw pimple-like bumps and even bleed. I decided to change and use pampers and was amazed at how quick the rash was gone. Pampers diaper is lightweight and breathable. Very good for the nite especially if the baby can sleep through. Won't leak.
