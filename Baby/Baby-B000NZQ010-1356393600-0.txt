review/summary: Perfect!!review/text: This was perfect for my nephew! He didn't even allow me to remove all of the parts from the packaging before he began pushing the wheels around the house. He actually took his first steps assisted by the walker within the first 5 minutes of playing with it once I assembled it! Needless to say, I am very satisfied!
