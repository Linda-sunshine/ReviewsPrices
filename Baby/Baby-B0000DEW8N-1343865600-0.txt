review/summary: Fantastic alternative to high chair!review/text: We could not be more pleased with this item. A great item at a fantastic price. We are very happy we chose to try one of these prior to purchasing a high chair.This seat is simple to clean, easy to install, and has some great features. It folds for travel, and we really like that the backrest folds down so easily. This allows us to fold it down and push the chair back under the table with all the other chairs. Clean up is very easy, everything wipes off without problems and our son likes sitting in it and eating. He now goes over to the seat and points to it when he's hungry.We haven't traveled with it and aren't sure we will, but it's nice to see how easy it is to fold up and take along.Would be 5 stars even at a slightly higher price point, well worth the money.
