review/summary: Good potty, but....review/text: My older son would ONLY use this potty, which we had borrowed from a friend whose son was older. We moved and gave it back to them, as they had another younger boy and needed it. It is SO GOOD for boys especially, b/c the splash guard is HIGH and pee doesn't wiz everywhere. Also, it is SO SIMPLE to clean (just two parts) from an adult perspective. So, I bought this for my younger son (now 2.5 yrs and potty training) BUT, my younger son isn't really that into it. He sort of likes the other (cheaper and actually more annoying & more messy) potty. So, long story short, it's a good potty, especially for boys, but every kid is different and (as my older son says, &#34;Mom, kids like what they like...&#34;) each has their own opinion (especially 2 yr olds!), so you never know if this will be &#34;the one&#34; they want to use and get trained on! GOOD LUCK with potty training!
