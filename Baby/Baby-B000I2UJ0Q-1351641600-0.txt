review/summary: 3-month old LOVES this thing!!!!review/text: My daughter first used this when she was only 2.5 months old (pretty advanced so neck was strong already). She seemed very serious when ever she was in there. She wanted to touch everything but didn't seem to understand it was play time.Now only 2 weeks after having it, she can play in it for 30-60 mins at a time!!!! She happily goes in it 3x a day. That gives us time to eat, talk, clean, etc. She smiles as soon as she goes in. She's really good at jumping around too. I think it has helped her leg muscles and even neck by quite a bit. She's very strong for a 3-month old (was able to turn from tummy to back at 2.5 months) so I wouldn't recommend this for every 3 month old but I'm sure it'll be super fun when they are strong enough. I know she'll love this thing until she starts walking! Super funny to see how much fun this tiny (12 lb) baby has in this thing. She knows how to play with some of the toys and also know how to turn herself so def easy for a baby to navigate. We just put a blanket under her seat (so she can reach toys), pillow under her feet (stands tippy toed) & pillow at her back (push her forward). I wish they would make the seat come lower because some younger babies are able to enjoy it already but just can't reach. I don't care. Still a 5-star.Worth every penny. Your child will love it so stop doing research and just buy it!
