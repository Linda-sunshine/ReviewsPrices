review/summary: Comfy but big.review/text: I bought this because I am a back sleeper and I wanted something to stop me from rolling onto my back. This pillow is very comfy but it is big I have a California King and it takes up half the bed, if you have a Queen your husband will end up on the couch haha. The seam at the top is kind of hard but I just put a light blanket on the top and it has never bothered me. I really love this pillow and it does help me sleep a lot better!
