review/summary: Best carrier ever!review/text: My son absolutely loves this carrier! He loves that he can see out and look around while being snug against mom or dad. It fits and adjusts well on both of us and holds the weight well dispersed on our backs. We tried several before finding the baby Bjorn and will never go back to another kind!
