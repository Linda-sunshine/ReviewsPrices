review/summary: do not rock easilyreview/text: This thing looked about 18 months old by the time it was one month old and we all know a tiny new one month old is not hard on things. It was on carpet and barely moved plus it did not rock easily at all and was falling apart by the time we returned it. They do NOT make baby things like they used to for my previous babies. Must be the economy...
