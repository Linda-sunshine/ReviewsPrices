review/summary: did not make it on timereview/text: i'm sure it would have been great for support on pregnant women based on it's texture at least! but my sister gave birth at 25 weeks before this arrived. we were planning she'd use this on her 3rd trimester but oh well things happens. i would just like to appear on your generous hearts to pray for my nephews recovery, baby mateo rafel!TIA we'll use this pillow when he comes home, i saw this can also be used while breastfeeding. :)
