review/summary: My 1-Yr-Old LOVES itreview/text: From the Moment I put it in front of my 1-year-old son, he was off and running! He has been standing and "cruising" for weeks now, not officially walking because of balance. This walker allows him to run anywhere. The front of it is so much fun to. I wish the phone portion was connected, because he loves to play with the phone and it gets lost in our house easily... but I guess it's nice he loves it so much.Very happy with the quality, value and fun of this walker.
