review/summary: It really holds LOTSreview/text: This held just about all my daughters stuffed animals she has a few more but are very large. I didn't actually count how many it held but it does stretch and hold a lot more then I thought it would. Love that I was able to get them all out of her toy chest so it can hold other toys besides stuffed ones. Great Product! Must have for a stuffed animal lover. (:
