review/summary: Adorable toy, less effective as a noise machinereview/text: I think this giraffe is so darn cute! I bought it before my son was born. I did use the sound machine function when he was a brand new, tiny baby, and he was only sleeping about 45 minutes at a time. But as he began sleeping in longer stretches, I opted for a white noise CD that could play all night long.I still have the toy attached to the crib railings (now that he's older and not at risk for SIDS). He doesn't have any blankets or other toys in his crib, just this. It gives him something to look at if he wakes up, and something to touch or chew on before he falls back to sleep. It also helps when we travel. I attach this toy to the travel crib so it feels more like home.
