review/summary: Great for about to walk babiesreview/text: Super easy to assemble. As soon as I put it down on the floor my son (who was just over 7 months at the time) crawled right up to it, pulled himself up and started pushing it down the hall. He loves it. He will sit and play with it also. Really enjoys the &#34;barn door&#34; and the cow. He laughs everytime it &#34;moo's&#34;Great toy and great product.
