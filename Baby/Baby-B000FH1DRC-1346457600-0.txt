review/summary: Preemie and Newborn are same size!!!review/text: ********* MOMS WITH BABIES 6 LBS OR LESS ***********------NEWBORN SAME SIZE AS PREEMIE, BUT CHEAPER-------We have used Pampers Swaddlers for the last 19 months with our daughter, and are now using them with our twin boys. We absolutely love the quality. They don't leak, unless you have an obvious blow out. Just make sure that the leg "ruffles" are out of the diaper and not tucked in. They are also super absorbent. I was able to leave my daugter in them all night when she got older, and not have any problems with leaking, or diaper rash.My boys were born at premature sizes, of 6 lbs, and 4 lbs, 13 oz. I got the more expensive Preemie size, but had Newborn size leftover from the hospital. I swear I cannot see a visible difference when holding them next to eachother, nor when using them on my boys. Both sizes require me to fold down the front a bit, and the leg gussets are quite low. That being said, they still work great. Just don't spend the extra money on the Preemie size. It isn't necessary.
