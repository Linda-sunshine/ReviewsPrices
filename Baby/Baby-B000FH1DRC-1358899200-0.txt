review/summary: Pampers Swaddlers is the Bestreview/text: I have been using Pampers Swaddlers since my daughter was born. I have tried to use less expensive kind of Pampers, but my daughter developed heat pumps easily using it. When I switched it back, no more issues. My guess is that Pampers Swaddlers has the best air flow. I also use this overnight. It's totally soaked with urine when my daughter wakes up in the morning, but has never leaked.Amazon's subscribe and save also saved me time to order and compare prices every time the diapers are about to run out.
