review/summary: great glider!review/text: i got this as a gift and couldnt be happier with it. it was very easy to assemble, i was 8 months pregnant and put it together without much trouble. it is comfortable as well. i didnt get too much use out of it which was a bummer, but it looks nice and was quite sturdy
