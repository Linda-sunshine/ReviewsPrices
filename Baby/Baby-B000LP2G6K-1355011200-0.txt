review/summary: Love these thingsreview/text: This was cheaper than I found elsewhere and shipped to me in perfect condition with all the parts. Very easy.If you are new to the pack and play concept, then you should definitely get one. I don't even have kids, just lots of nieces and nephews and I got tired of always setting up their pack and plays in my house. This thing folds together in about 1 minute and is pretty portable. When it's popped up it's a great place to put a little one down for a nap or even just to put them for a few minutes to stay out of trouble if you really can't keep your eye on them. Super easy and definitely comes in handy.
