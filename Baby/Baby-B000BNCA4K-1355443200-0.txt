review/summary: Love thisreview/text: Baby loves her winkel. It is easy to grab and hold onto, the bright colors are very fun. This is a softer rubbery toy so it doesn't hurt if baby hits herself in the head - or throws the toy and hits someone/something else. This was a favorite around 6-9 months old, and is still enjoyed at 1 year.
