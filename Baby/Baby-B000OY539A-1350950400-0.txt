review/summary: Good Baby carrierreview/text: I like the Moby wrap, but I know it can be confusing to put on. My son is 2.5 months and I still don't tie it correctly sometimes. He liked it a lot when he was 2 weeks old, but then hated it until about 8 weeks. I'm not sure if I was tying it too tightly, or what his problem was, but we finally are making it work most of the time. However, he's about 15 lbs now and is starting to get to heavy for it. I can support him just fine, but if I don't tie it tight enough in the beginning he starts to sag. But I have to be careful with how tightly I tie it, because otherwise he'll complain when I first put him in.It's great for walks - it puts him to sleep about 5-10 min into our walk. I feel like he's secure it in. I just wish I could use it for a longer time. I'm sure it'll work great for my next child, now that I know what I'm doing.
