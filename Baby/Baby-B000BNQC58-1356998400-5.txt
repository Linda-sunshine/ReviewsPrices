review/summary: Excellent giftreview/text: We gave this to our 4 year old granddaughter and she loved it! When she opened it she began jumping up and down and wanted to find a dark place so she could see the stars. She is a very early reader and loves to learn so the booklet that came with was also very interesting to her. Excellent gift choice and an excellent response from our granddaughter. Both gift and response were better than we expected!
