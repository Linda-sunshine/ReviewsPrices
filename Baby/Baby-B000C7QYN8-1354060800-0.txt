review/summary: Too Thin and Too Smallreview/text: The first time I used this product was when I bought the one pack from Target. Previously, I used the Kirkland brand, which I loved, but wanted to switch to something more natural. The one pack that I used could be compared with the Huggies brand- very thick. So I bought a subscription to the refill packs from Amazon, thinking I would get the same thing.The refills are quite different. They're very thin and a lot smaller in size. There's a thick sticker dispenser instead of the thicker plastic cover. I have to use about 10 or more wipes each time, and it's a bit too slippery for me.I cancelled my subscription right away. It's too bad. I really wanted to like it. I guess I have to search some more for the perfect, natural wipe.
