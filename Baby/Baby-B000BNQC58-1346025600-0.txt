review/summary: So cute and so functional!review/text: We LOVE this!I got my 3 year old the ladybug and my 13 year old stepdaughter the seaturtle. They both use them nightly! We moved to a new house, actually a really old creaky house so both the girls really appreciated the extra comfort. (even though little one still sleeps with me) I have seen the "dreamlights" in the local CVS and Walmart and believe me, these are SOOOOO MUCH BETTER!!!!!
