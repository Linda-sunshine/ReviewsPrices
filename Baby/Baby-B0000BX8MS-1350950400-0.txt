review/summary: Great for chilly nightsreview/text: We bought two of these for our 6 month old twins and they love them! One weighs almost 21 lbs, the other is closing on 19 lbs, and they have plenty of room to grow... but there isn't enough room for them to get out of these sleep sacks. (Bother babies are around 95% for weight and generally in 12 month clothes for her, 18 month clothes for him! They will be able to sleep warmly this winter. :)
