review/summary: How do people function without this??review/text: I am a new mom. I have never heard of this gadget until a friend told me about it. I was a bit skeptical that I would use it at first but when I started using it, I realized it is essential! At first I was breastfeeding and with the feedings every 2 hours, I didn't know which end was up! This little gem kept track for me so I didn't even have to think about it. Now that I am bottle feeding, my husband finds it essential also. He does half the night and then puts it in bed between us so when our baby wakes, I can just check to see when he ate or had his diaper changed. I agree with the other reviewer, these should be issued in the hospital. This is the one item that I couldn't live without!!!
