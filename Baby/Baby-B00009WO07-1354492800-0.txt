review/summary: Great Dealreview/text: From my understanding just from Target & other stores similar the jumbo box is no longer, only what boxes are left is what you can get. I normally used to pay anywhere from $35 & up for that jumbo box now I can only get the smaller box for the same price INSANE it has depending on size about 100 diapers So I'm no mathematician but $47 is a much better deal especially for size 5 to have 172ct Only downside if you live in a building keep a watch out because there is no box covering diapers so everyone can see what it is
