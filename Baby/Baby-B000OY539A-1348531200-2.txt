review/summary: Good for baby who likes to be heldreview/text: My husband and I bought this for our 3rd baby when she was 3 weeks old. She is very fussy during the day and doesn't like to be put down, but will sleep beautifully if she lays on my chest, so we figured this would be helpful to being able to get things done around the house without her screaming. When we got it home, my husband (who is an engineer and generally has no difficulty putting things together and following diagrams) attempted to help me put the Moby wrap on and then put our daughter in to it. She screamed and protested very loudly and wasn't in securely, as I tried leaning forward and she nearly fell out. After several more attempts, he recommended that we return it to the store. Later on, when she was calmer, I re-attempted this myself and did successfully get her positioned, but it was very awkward dealing with the ends, which basically hang on the floor until the very end while attempting the hold the baby in place while I wrapped myself. (I used the kangaroo hold for her.) I will say that she does sleep very well in it, but I do find myself holding her head while I move around with her, just because it doesn't seem very secure just tucked into a piece of cloth. On a positive note, I can keep up a little more easily with my older children having both hands free. Ultimately, I am hoping this gets easier with practice!
