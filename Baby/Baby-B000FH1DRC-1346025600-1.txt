review/summary: Best diaper we've usedreview/text: First off, the wetness indicator is amazing! (for some reason I cannot tell if my daughter's diaper is "squishy" or not, it's nice to just be able to see an indicator without having to take her diaper off). Secondly, my wife insists (and I agree) that my daughter wear these to sleep. This is because when she soils herself while sleeping, these seems to irritate her less than the re-usable diapers she wears during the day (probably because the disposables are more absorbent and less waste matter remains in contact with her skin).
