review/summary: Not a Fanreview/text: I purchased this as I thought it would be a good alternative to the Moby Wrap which looked very initmidating to me. I didn't like it one bit. My newborn baby hung very low in this thing and never seemed to be comfortable. What is bad about this (and also what makes it &#34;easier&#34; to put on), is that it is pre-sized, and not adjustable. I am 5'8&#34; and 140 pounds and the size small was too big. Maybe if I had gotten the xtra small it would have fit better, but it wasn't worth shelling out additional money to find out. I went and bought the Moby Wrap from my local retailer and, after watching a video on YouTube on how to put it on, it fit so much better! Whenever my newborn would scream and cry I would put him in the Moby and he was instantly soothed. My advice...buy the Moby and skip this. Once you get the hang of the Moby it is so much better because it is adjustable which is key!!!
