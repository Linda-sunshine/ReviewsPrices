review/summary: Not just for kids...review/text: I received this as a Christmas gift as I have been sleeping with the aid of a sound machine for almost 15 years (I'm 30 now), and am always trying to find what works best. I have a bedside Homedics machine, but keep having complications with the settings and sound volume. I have used phone apps (White Noise is really excellent), but have issues with the sound being muffled due to speaker placement, and having to turn the volume up enough that it disturbs my husband.This soft and cuddly giraffe is absolutely adorable, and the sound box is very easy to work with. I can sit the giraffe above my head on my pillow (kinda like a giraffe hat) and the sound is loud enough to lull me, while not disturbing my sleeping sweetie. Also works if I cuddle it as I'm drifting off.I couldn't be more pleased! (Yes-it is all right to sleep with stuffed animals when you're all grown up.)
