review/summary: Best Diapers!review/text: I have only had one leak in these diapers and my baby is now 12 months old. She has NEVER had a diaper rash and sleeps 12 hours in these diapers at night. I tried Huggies for a 5 days and she had diaper rash after 2 days. I donated the rest of the diapers and sent my husband out for more Pampers! They are so soft too. Can't go wrong with these diapers.
