review/summary: Great early use toyreview/text: This was the first toy that my son really showed an interest in, starting at around 3 months. The many loops made it easier for him to hold and eventually navigate to his mouth.He seems to respond to the colors, shape and the slight rattling sound the center box makes. It is still one of his favorites at 5 months old and gets daily use in our house.
