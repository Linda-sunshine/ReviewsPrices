review/summary: Great productreview/text: I saw this toy a lot when I was doing my registry but I always thought it looked really weird. Then our friends visited with their 4 month old daughter, who happened to have and love this toy. She loved it so much we decided to get it for our son when he was born. In the beginning he just liked looking at it but about 3 months of age he started being able to grab it. Since there are so many loops to grab, it is really easy for an infant to pick it up. No matter where they put their hands they'll be able to grab it. It was the first thing he was able to pick up and play with. We attach it to his stoller with a tether and it entertains him whenever we are out. It's also the go-to toy at home as well. Now that he's 4 months old, he loves putting it in his mouth and gumming it. We are really happy with this toy and highly recommend it.
