review/summary: Not high qualityreview/text: Bought this pillow locally midway into my pregnancy. Had been having extreme pain in hips, legs, arms, and back. I have so far used it for about 4/5 weeks.Pros: It does help me fall asleep faster; helps control reflux to a degree ; overall comfortableCons: lost shape after about 2 weeks. It's currently a long tube, instead of curved. Can be manipulated to tuck in where I need it; Tore at seams; I seem to get tangled in it and have a hard time getting up to use the restroom (which is at least 2-3 times a night). Actually fell off the bed in an attempt to get out!; huge space hog; no cover included and can't wash.Overall, I like it simply because I need the support. I paid less than what's listed, but still feel it's too much. In my opinion, it's quite overpriced given the quality and shouldn't be more than $25. I'm worried how well it's going to hold up and if I'll make it to my due date since it's already needed mended in several spots. I definitely don't think it would last more than a few months.
