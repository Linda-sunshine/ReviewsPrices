review/summary: A MUST for all parents!!review/text: This Jumperoo has been my saving grace. Our son can sit in it for extended of periods of time allowing me to get stuff done around the house. He loves all of the toys/lights/sounds and jumps & spins around in it giggling the entire time. He is 5 months old and 28&#34; long--the lowest setting is perfect for him.
