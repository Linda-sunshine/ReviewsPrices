review/summary: FANTASTICreview/text: This is so cute...We bought this for our 8 month old daughter for christmas. I tried her out with it on the walker but she was trying to climb up on it! So this toy allows you you to take it apart so that the child can sit and play with it. She loves the colors, lights with sounds. She plays with it even longer when her 4 year old sister helps her out with the different functions. I will probably try her out again in a few weeks to see how she handles trying to move around. This was so worth it and I definitely would recommend this product.
