review/summary: Great!review/text: We bought both this and the blue turtle for our little girl and boy, 4 years old. They opened them on Christmas Eve and have never slept better. They are in the same room right now in bunk beds and my son likes the light off, but his sister is scared of the dark, now she just leaves her pillow on and by the time he is tired of the light it has automatically shut off! He spends the time with his and then it's dark for him...they also love that they aren't the ones that all the stores have and instead one that not everyone else has.
