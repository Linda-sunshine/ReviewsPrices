review/summary: 6 Month Old's Favorite Toyreview/text: We purchased this for our five month old son in December based on the reviews on Amazon.com. He immediately loved being upright and figured out how to bounce quickly. At six months old, he's Becoming more engaged with the activities. As soon as we put him in the jumper, he squeals with delight and starts bouncing. When he's not in the jumper, he often kicks his legs as if he is.
