review/summary: Well designed and very helpful baby accessoryreview/text: I bought this for my four month old grandson who weighs 16 pounds and is not yet sitting up on his own. It has been in constant use since it arrived four weeks ago. We take it from room to room so that he can accompany us and not be constantly held. I read all the other customer reviews before I ordered it, and I agree with the comments/warnings that a squirming strong baby may be able to tip the rocker forward. It should always be used with an adult caregiver present. Nevertheless, this is a wonderfully useful baby chair. It is well designed, lightweight, easy to move around, and cute.
