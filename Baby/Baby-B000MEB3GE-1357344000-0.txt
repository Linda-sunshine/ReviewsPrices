review/summary: My External Memoryreview/text: Before having the baby I thought this was completely unnecessary. Once I entered the sleep-deprived world of the new parent, though, this became one of my favorite items. It helped me keep track of how often my son was nursing, when he was last changed, and on which breast he'd last fed. When just home from the hospital I used the * button to time my pain medication, and I still use the light when nursing in the middle of the night. The one downside is that the clip on mine broke one of the first times I attached it to my pocket, so I now have to carry the timer room to room. That's negligible effort for a very useful device, though.
