review/summary: Keeps my child contentreview/text: We used this carrier during a cross-country flight with one layover and it worked wonders. Much easier than using and checking a stroller. Our 18-pound 6 month old was very content to be carried by my husband- no fussing, whining or kicking. Carrying him for extended periods of time made our backs sore but I imagine that would happen with any type of weight strapped to the front of you like that. Getting our son in and out of the carrier wasn't that hard either. He is much more content to be carried in his baby Bjorn than to be in our arms.
