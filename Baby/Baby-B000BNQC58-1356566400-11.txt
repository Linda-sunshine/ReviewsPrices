review/summary: Died two days after I got itreview/text: Lady Bug worked beautifully...for one night. Changed the batteries, followed directions, no results. If I didn't have a sleep-hating baby, I'd probably have the wherewithal to return this thing. It's impossible to change the lightbulb (or even get to it, just to see if there's a loose/dirty connection). I like being able to fix things without disemboweling them!
