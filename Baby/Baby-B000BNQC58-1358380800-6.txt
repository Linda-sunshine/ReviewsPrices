review/summary: Perfect!review/text: The turtle is cute, you can cuddle this though not to sleep on but definitely to carry around as a toy. The constellations are beautiful and the 3 colors show up nicely - I live in a Victorian home with high ceilings so we reflect off the walls and under the covers. My 6 year-old son loves it! No more fear and quite the conversation starter with his older brothers on the star formations.Well-made, durable, educational, cute, cuddly - what more can a boy want to drive away the dark?
