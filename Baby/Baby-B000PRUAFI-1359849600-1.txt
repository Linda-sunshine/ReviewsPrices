review/summary: Good stuffreview/text: This product is easy to use, performs as advertised, and enhances the safety of our little one. Best feature is the one-handed operation of the gate, allowing us to pass through with little delay even encumbered with laundry, groceries, or anything else one routinely carries around the house.
