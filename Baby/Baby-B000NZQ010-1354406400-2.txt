review/summary: Didn't feel sturdy enough at first, but she loves itreview/text: My daughter has this walker as well as the Melissa and Doug Alligator push toy. I'd say this one is much more fun however the M&D walker is the one she really felt confident learning to walk with. This walker (Vtech) can move a bit too quickly if you're using it on hard/smooth floors so she fell a lot at first which made her gravitate toward the M&D for walking. It's definitely better on carpet though. So we'd use the M&D on our hardwoods and outside on the sidewalk and the Vtech on carpeted floors until she was confident. That's not to say this isn't a good walker for younger ones. The activity portion of it comes off with the push of a button and the can play with it on the floor. She LOVES the songs and the buttons, the lights and music. She is now 17 months has had it for 5 months and still plays with it everyday, except now she is running behind it! She will also sit in front of it for quite a while and entertain herself with the activity center. Definitely one of her favorite toys.
