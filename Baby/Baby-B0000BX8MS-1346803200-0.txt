review/summary: Great productreview/text: I ordered the large for my 10mo old daughter (20lbs). I knew it would be big on her, but that's fine with me, since it means she'll be able to wear it through the winter. The top is not so big that I have to worry about it sliding up over her face. It's large enough that she can stand up in it without tripping. Very soft and warm, and my daughter loves the puppy applique. Zips from the top down, like all HALO SleepSacks. We've washed it several times, and it still looks like new. Very happy with the purchase.
