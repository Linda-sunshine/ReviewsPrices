review/summary: It's everything it says it is.review/text: This jumperoo is great. Haven't tried any others but really like this one.It has fun jungle noises and flashing lights and other interactive toys. We put our son in this when he was around 4 mos old and 23lbs.and thought it wouldnt last long but it's stood up to his crazy jumping so far. And I feel as though his hand motor skills advanced so much since he got this. Not to mention his jumping. One of the few cons I have are that the leg holes are a little snug for his chubby little legs so it's difficult for me to get him in and out..sometimes takes 2 of us. But if you have a normal size kid it shouldnt be a problem. It also takes up some space, about 2 1/2 ' diameter for the base, but if you have the room I would recommend this. Happy jumping!!
