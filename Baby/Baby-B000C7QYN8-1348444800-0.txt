review/summary: These wipes save my skinreview/text: I really like these wipes. I have super sensitive skin, and it seems that the kirkland brand of wipes I was using would really irritate my fingers especially after changing multiple diapers a day. I do think the Kirkland wipes clean up a bit better, but the trade off is worth it.
