review/summary: Not worth itreview/text: I tried these because I used Pampers Swaddlers and Cruisers in the past and liked them (before switching to 7th Generation diapers temporarily because of concerns over my baby's skin sensitivity). The price enticed me to buy these, and I was really disappointed. They felt cheap and the performance was poor. LOTS of leaking, in my opinion. Her sheets and clothes all smelled like urine continuously. I couldn't wait to get rid of them. I bought Cruisers in the same size to replace them, and they were a lot bigger. Just an opinion, but to me I'd rather pay more for diapers that work better.
