review/summary: wonderful helperreview/text: I used it a lot for my baby's naps, when I had to do chores or go to the bathroom, I initially would put him there and swing him, then he started to look at the toys and now he's playing with them (6months), so I can have him close enough to give him things after he trows them away meanwhile I can do something :)
