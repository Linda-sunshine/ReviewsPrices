review/summary: Love itreview/text: My baby loves this toy and my older son learned how to walk on one of those and that why I got this for my baby girl. We had too other kind of walker in my house but it was so light that it would tip over the baby when they were trying to stand up, this one is heavier and also does not go so fast so the baby can follow it easily. Overall we love it and I recommend this to everyone.
