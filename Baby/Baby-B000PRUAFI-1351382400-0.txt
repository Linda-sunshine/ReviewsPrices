review/summary: Just what I wanted.review/text: Got a couple of these to keep dogs out of the kids' rooms, and they work great. Had them for a while now, and they've held up great even though, against my request, the kids use them as a kind of toy. Look good (relatively), easy to install and effective. No complaints.
