review/summary: Good seat!review/text: We picked this instead of a high chair because we have a pub height table and we couldn't find a high chair that was tall enough and easy enough to clean so our daughter could &#34;sit at the table&#34; with us. This works great! Our daughter HATES the tray for some reason and pushes herself away from the table with her feet as a game, but that's not the fault of the seat. We are considering a clear vinyl seat cover for the chair though. Without the tray, food ends up all over the dining room chair. Great solution for a pub height table though.
