review/summary: Saved My Lifereview/text: I love this pillow. I had seen it at Target, but ended up buying it from Amazon as it was cheaper. I have had the pillow for about 3 months now, and I am currently 27 weeks and it has helped me so much. I am a stomach sleeper and was having a very hard time getting comfortable and staying asleep at night. This pillow helped that a lot. As some of the other reviews mention, it is a bit tight on the top so the seam digs into your shoulde/neck a bit..but easy fix...just move down a little bit, or I place a small towel/blanket there to add cushion and no problem. I also saw online that they sell a seperate pillow cover/case for this pillow that is less tight on that part so that it doesn't dig in to you..so that's an option. Either way...great purchase, a must have.
