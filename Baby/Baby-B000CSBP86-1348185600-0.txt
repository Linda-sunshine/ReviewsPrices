review/summary: Very disappointedreview/text: I purchased this product based on the description and reviews from the vendor. When I received my carrier, I was extremely disappointed because not only did the carrier look old, it also smelled like smoke. I was aware it was a used product, however I was not prepared for an item that was in such poor quality. I refuse to use this for my infant son.
