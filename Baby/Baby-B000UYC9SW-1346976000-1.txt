review/summary: Loving this - sending my Ergo back!review/text: I had to write this, my LO is asleep in this sling as I type - which is a rarity! She's around 12lbs and really didnt like the Ergo, and I find it is really bulky. I find this moulds around my baby's body more and feels more "hugging". She fussed a little at first but then fell asleep as I sat in the glider. The only downside is that my shoulder is starting to hurt, not sure if this is just part of the design, or if I can adjust it somehow..Anyway, the Ergo goes back today!
