review/summary: Wish I'd Have Bought This Instead of the Exersaucer!review/text: A friend of mine has one of these & my daughter LOVES it! She's 13 months and can walk and she still loves playing in it every time we go over! She will stay in it for 30 minutes or more with no problem! It is wonderful.When it came time to buy my daughter a stationary activity center I bought this: [[ASIN:B007700RN6 Bright Starts Entertain and Grow Saucer, Pink]. It has a lot of good qualities and my daughter loved playing in it... until she got more mobile. Now, we use it as a way to keep her in one place while I cook or need to keep her out of things. She is pretty much over it & will only sit in it for a short amount of time. If i would have known better, I'd have gotten the Jumperoo.
