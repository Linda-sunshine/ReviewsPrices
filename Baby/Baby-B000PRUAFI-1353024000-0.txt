review/summary: North States Supergatereview/text: This dog gate is fantastic! It was easy to put up (read the directions), kept the dogs out, and is super easy to open, with one hand. It swings shut, unless you open it all the way, which you can do to keep it open. We don't have small children, but it has the added feature of locking to keep little ones out. I chose not to get a "child" gate because of this -- I wanted something that would be easy to open and didn't require both hands and lots of handling. I highly recommend this gate!
