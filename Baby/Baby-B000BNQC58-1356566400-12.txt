review/summary: Lighting effect is cool, battery life is terriblereview/text: This is a really neat toy, it looks adorable to my 5 year old, the blue and green lighting is really cool. I agree with others that the yellow color is not very visible. However, this light is a constant pain for me. The batteries only last through 3 nights and I did verify that it shuts off after 20 minutes. I bought rechargeable batteries so I am not throwing so many away, however the compartment for the batteries is so tight that it requires a small flat head screwdriver to get the batteries out. This can require some hunting around in my house. A note for the design company that If you design it after a turtle, make it a little larger so you can use C or D type batteries, not AAA batteries.
