review/summary: Big bang for your buck!review/text: This rocker has been a lifesaver for me. My son is a big boy at 6 mos. old and 25 lbs. He has outgrown so many of his infant products including bouncer chairs. This rocker has kept him entertained from the time he was 2 mos. old and still accommodates him now. The hanging toys are awesome and easily detach once they are no longer needed. The actual chair can stay in either a rocking or reclined position. The head of the seat can also recline which has been perfect in helping my son hold his own bottle. We are now able to recline the seat, strap my son in and allow him to feed himself while we prepare for work in the morning. The rocker is also easy to take with us when he head to our parents houses. It has been one of our best baby products and gives us the bang for our buck seeing as he will be able to use it for a long time. I definitely recommend!
