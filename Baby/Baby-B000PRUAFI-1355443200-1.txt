review/summary: Sturdier than other gatesreview/text: I purchased this product after purchasing a similar product that also relied on pressure mounted installation. This gate is much sturdier than the other, although this gate was a little more difficult to install than the first. This gate also comes with mounting cups that one can attach to the wall via double sided tape or screws. I opted for the double sided tape, and so far, so good. This gate is a bit more difficult to open that the other gate we have, but not so much so that I wouldn't recommend purchasing this gate.The only con about this gate is the directions. They show bare minimum, and that it. Obviously I was able to get the gate installed, but I had to read the directions a few times in order to fully understand what they were trying to convey (especially where opening the actual door is concerned- silly, I know). I never thought I'd need directions to open a baby gate, and I quickly figured out that I needed to loosen each side just a bit.All in all, I would recommend this gate.
