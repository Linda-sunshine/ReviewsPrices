review/summary: Great Sit-to-Stand!!!review/text: I got this Sit-to-Stand walker for my son when he was 7 months old. He is now almost 17 months old and STILL plays with this walker even though he has been walking since 12 months. When he first got this toy, he sat in front of it and played with the toys. He really loves the "peek-a-boo" door, and opens and closes it over and over again! This music and lights also grabbed his attention. He also loves the phone! The phone detaches and he still plays with it alone. It is also a rattle. This toy would be great for tummy time because the toy comes off the front of the walker. The only negative I have with the toy detaching from the front of the walker is that it falls off sometimes when my son is walking with the walker. No big deal though. He now runs with walker and I've tried to put it away in the closet and he keeps dragging it out. I have another walker as well but I don't like it as much because the front wheels are more narrow than the rear and when my son would make sharp turns with the walker, it would tumble over along with my son. This walker is very sturdy and doesn't flip when my son walks/runs/turns with it. I would reccomend this product to anyone looking for a great sit-to-stand at a great price!
