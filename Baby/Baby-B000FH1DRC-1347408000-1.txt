review/summary: Rashy babiesreview/text: These are causing more diaper rash than the Earths best diapers I ordered last month.We started with pampers swaddlers in the hospital, and we love the indicator line. After trying the Earths best diapers last month I missed the indicator line. But my twins are getting terrible diaper rashes and I don't like the fragrance added to these. At first it smells like baby powder, sort of, but once they soil the diaper it smells really weird. I would honestly rather smell the poo so I know they need changing.I am going back to the Earthsbest brand, I feel better knowing those are bleach free for my twins' skin too.
