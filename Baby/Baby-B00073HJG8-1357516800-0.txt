review/summary: Yes, please!review/text: This should just come with babies. Every parent, at one point or another, will look around in their child's room and think, &#34; this child has way too many stuffed animals.&#34; They're soft, they're cute, they're the perfect birthday, Christmas, Easter, whatever day present but at the end of night, kids have their favorite and the others are left to be shoveled Into a Rubbermaid or toy box.I bought this, and hung it just about eye level (my eyes, to my 15 month old) and its perfect. I can reach it, swap out a few here and there and eventually she'll be able to reach it and PUT THEM AWAY, hopefully. Highly recommend this, it's got only about 20 medium sized animals right now which is seriously like a third of its potential!
