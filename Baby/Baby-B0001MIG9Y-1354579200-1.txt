review/summary: Purchased through Amazon Momreview/text: I purchased these through the Amazon Mom program which auto ships monthly at a discounted price. Its the best program, The diapers show up like clockwork just when I'm down to my last 8-10. Very convenient, you can cancel shipment at any time, change ship dates if you go out of town or add wipes or other items you may need. Amazon sends you a reminder email when shipment will be going out and asks if you need to make any changes to the order. Beats running to the store when you realize you're out! Great diaper for my 2 yr old boy, I have tried many others and they all leak or are cheap. Pampers works the best.
