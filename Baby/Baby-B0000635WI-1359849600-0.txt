review/summary: I cannot sleep without this pillowreview/text: My husband purchased it for me when I was in the first trimester. I did not use this pillow much especially when I was nauseous and was having a heartburn. The material is quite soft and very comfortable to hug and sleep, and I started using it every night in the second semester when my belly got bigger. I put my another normal pillow on the head part so that I can sleep better even I suffer from a heartburn. This is a highly recommend item!
