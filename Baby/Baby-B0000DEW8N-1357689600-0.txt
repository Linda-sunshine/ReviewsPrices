review/summary: Wish I would have gotten these instead of the Graco Contempo High Chairreview/text: I loved my Graco high chairs in the black and white damask pattern because they were really cute. BUT, I have twins and so I had two of them, cramming up my breakfast nook. They take up a tremendous amount of space. And, although they clean up beautifully, it takes some time to do so (you have to wash & dry the fabric covers, then scrub down the whole frame) . These Healthy care Deluxe Boosters take care of both of those issues! I now have a ton of room in my breakfast area and spend a tenth of the time cleaning them! That means more time doing the stuff I want to do like play with my kiddos!!
