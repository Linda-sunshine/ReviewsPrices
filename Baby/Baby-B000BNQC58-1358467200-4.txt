review/summary: Lovely Little Ladybug!review/text: While this is meant for older kids that are scared of the dark, it has been a lifesaver with my 8 month old. Instead of crying when we put her down, she now looks at the stars until she falls asleep! And we love that it's an adorable addition to her room!
