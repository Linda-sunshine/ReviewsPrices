review/summary: My baby loves it!review/text: First we received a Bright Starts baby swing and our daughter hated it. Then we received a Fisher Price Baby Papasan vibrating seat and she couldn't stand that either. We were at a friend's house who had this Fisher-Price Infant To Toddler Rocker and she loved it right away. So we ordered it from Amazon and I am so thrilled that we've finally found something that entertains her. I am watching her now as she swats at the toys and is making happy cooing sounds. Her legs are kicking with approval and she is just generally calm and content. Totally worth $37! By the way my daughter is 7 weeks.
