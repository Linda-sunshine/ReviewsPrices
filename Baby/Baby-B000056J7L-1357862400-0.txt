review/summary: Love the simplicityreview/text: We started out with theSafety 1st 1-2-3 Teach Me Training System in Whitethat was given to us from a friend. Well my son couldn't even sit on it without screaming bloody murder! It was pretty crazy, actually.. He was about 10-11 months at the time, and the only thing I could figure was that either the hole was too big and hurt his bottom, it was too tall to sit on it correctly [he's usually in the 10-20ish % for height] OR he just couldn't balance his weight because of it. I heard several recommendations for the baby bjorn from other moms. I was able to find them at Target and Babies R Us to see them in real life, as well as a similar version by baby bjorn that was maybe 2cm shorter but had no 'back' to it.We received the larger version off his Amazon wish list for Christmas, by this time he was 13 months but size hadn't changed much. We tried sitting him on it several times right after opening and we had no issues AT ALL. He had no problem sitting and keeping his balance. He could also stand up easier by putting both hands on each side of the backrest, much better than the other potty we had. I will update more when potty training is in full swing and it gets more frequent use. But so far so good.
