review/summary: Puppy Jumpreview/text: I received the 8 panel play yard as a gift for my new Havanese puppy. He is 6 months old and weighs 7 lbs. It only took him 2 days to "scale the wall." I had to return it. Since it was a gift I'm awaiting a credit in the form of a gift card from Amazon before I can purchase another more reliable item. I wouldn't recommend it except perhaps for a toy dog of some sort.
