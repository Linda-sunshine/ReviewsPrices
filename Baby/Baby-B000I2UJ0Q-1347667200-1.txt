review/summary: Another Obsessionreview/text: Wow. Our baby LOVES this chair!!! We started using it when she was around 3 months old and she would just smile and wiggle forever in it! Now, at just over 5 months, she squeals and screams with delight while playing in it! It's adorable. We actually keep it in the kitchen area. She will stay in here for so long that we can cook, eat a meal, do laundry, etc. She rarely complains while in the chair. I do wish it was a bit easier to move from room to room, but it still gets 5 stars from us!
