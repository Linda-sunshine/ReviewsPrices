review/summary: awesome value!review/text: I love my glider and ottoman. It arrived promptly and didn't take my husband but maybe 15 minutes to assemble. It is very comfy, only draw back if you plan to nurse and use a boppy, its a snug fit, I'm very petite(5'4", 123lbs), so if you require more room than I you may want to look into a wider set glider.
