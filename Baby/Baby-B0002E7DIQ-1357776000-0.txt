review/summary: Good product!review/text: Overall, a nice product for support. I agree with several others about the tight seam at the top. You can't really understand the issue until you feel it, but I don't sleep with my shoulder nestled right into the top of the pillow anyway, so it's not a huge issue for me. The contoured sides don't stay under your back and belly, they shift away during the night, which is to be expected. Overall, though, it's a LOT better than having 3 or 4 pillows surrounding you. It's very big, taking up half of my queen bed, but hey, it's my half! Nice product for hip, back, and belly support during pregnancy!
