review/summary: Good value for the pricereview/text: Sturdy and fairly easy to set up and collapse (as far as pack n play's go). Would have given 5 stars, but I think they could have thrown in the changing table piece that comes with other sets. I find the changer more helpful than the bassinet. The diaper holder is kind of useless as well. It's not really big enough to hold anything useful.
