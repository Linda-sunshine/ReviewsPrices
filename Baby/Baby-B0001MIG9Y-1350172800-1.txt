review/summary: Pampers vs. Huggiesreview/text: And the winner is......... Huggies.Pampers overnights makes a promise it cannot keep - '12 hours of overnight protection'.Not long after I began using pampers overnight I noticed my son was waking up wet. The kicker - when he wetted himself and his dad after a mere 5.5 hours with no diaper change on a long road trip. (Oops). I even tried plastic underwear - but even that could not help. .I finally figured out if my LO had more than one bottle the diaper merely could not handle the output. Yikes. I thought I would take a chance and try huggies. It's been a week and so far no complaints. He has even woken up dry after having a second bottle in the middle of the night with no diaper change. (tsk tsk but as any mother can tell you, do not mess with a sleeping baby or you will live to regret it). I will keep you posted on any changes!
