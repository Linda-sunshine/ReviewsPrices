review/summary: Never felt like a perfect fitreview/text: I heard so many great things about the Baby Bjorn and decided to try it out. Overall, I wasn't thrilled with it. Below are my pros and cons.Cons:- Huts your back after wearing it for more than 15 minutes. Weight is distributed on shoulders only. No waist strap.- Never felt like the baby was close to me, rather more like an additional appendage which got in the way of everything.- Hard to do chores with baby in the carrier.- After the first month my baby didn't like to be carried facing me. You can wear the baby facing out, but there is no support for the head.- Once baby's head didn't need the support and she could sit facing out it wasn't long before she outgrew the carrier.- Baby outgrew the carrier at 4 months (15 lbs & 26").I also purchased the wind cover and had a hard time attaching it to the carrier. The carrier cover is to thick to attach to the carrier and still be able to buckle it. Had to hold it in order for it to stay on.Pros:- Nice design- Very easy on/off- Washable- Sturdy
