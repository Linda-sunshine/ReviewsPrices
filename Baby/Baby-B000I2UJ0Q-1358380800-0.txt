review/summary: Wonderful!review/text: Daughter LOVES her jumperoo. She loves the music, the activity stations, and the bouncing. I was able to put it together within an hour. The only thing I am disappointed in is the quality of the plastics, which is why I only rated it four stars. When I took it out of the box, I thought I bought a used product because the clear roller toys were very cloudy and the base was dirty. Overall, it has been a great product and I would recommend it to others. Keeps my daughter busy and happy!
