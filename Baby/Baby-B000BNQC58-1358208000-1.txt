review/summary: Great nightlight!review/text: My 3yr old loves this turtle. Works great, projects one the ceiling or wall well, has 3 different colors, and has an easy On/OFF switch. The batteries have lasted about a month so far. It times off after 45 minutes. I would recommend this to others....it saves my child from leaving his bedroom lights on all night (and running the electric bill up!).
