review/summary: My baby sleeps soundly at night.review/text: When the ad said 12 hours of overnight leak protection, I am sure they are exaggerating. But for a baby's whole night's sleep, it has a three-layer leak protection and it doesn't wake up my baby in the middle of the night. Good thing, too, because it keeps the baby's skin dry.
