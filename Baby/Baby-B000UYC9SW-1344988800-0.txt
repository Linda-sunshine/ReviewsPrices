review/summary: Super Usefulreview/text: Ever since I received my K'tan baby carrier, it made my life a lot easier! I used it everyday and brought it with me wherever my little boy and I went. I loved how i could hold my baby safely by my chest while having my arms free to do things. Another plus was that I could comfortably breastfeed him and no one could tell what I was doing. Great product!=)
