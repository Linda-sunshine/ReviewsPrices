review/summary: My Almost 5 Month Old Loves Itreview/text: My 20 week old little guy (16 lb and 26.5" long) really enjoys this jumper. He's likes playing with the toys that are on the sides; they usually occupy him for around 15-20 minutes or so. He doesn't properly "jump" in it yet (his feet reach the ground, but he doesn't stand flat-footed yet), but he sorta bounces around when he gets excited and starts kicking, lol. My friend suggested that I get a jumper instead of an exersaucer because the baby will be able to use it longer. All in all, I think it was a great gift from his Grandma and Grandpa and will help prepare him for his crawling and walking stages! As usual, Amazon (I'm a Prime customer) made this purchase quick and painless.
