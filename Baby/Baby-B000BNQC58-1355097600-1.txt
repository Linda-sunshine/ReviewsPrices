review/summary: Good for the moneyreview/text: My daughter LOVES this toy. We have named it and created an entire back story for it (she's four) already. It absolutely EATS batteries, so we can't leave it on all night as a nightlight like we had intended. Still, it is good for sleep overs and for evenings when it gets dark early. We bring it out into the living room and admire the stars on the ceiling. It has a feature that lets it change the light colors it projects so the stars change colors. That setting is her favorite. I think we are going to buy the adapter to plug it into the wall though so we can actually use it as a nightlight. Other than the battery problem, its great and our daughter loves it. can't ask for more than that. Plus it is pretty cute without being hot pink or having a stupid grin on its face. that's nice as well.
