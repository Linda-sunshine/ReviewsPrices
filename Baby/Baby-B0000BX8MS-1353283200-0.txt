review/summary: cute idea, AWFUL zipperreview/text: The Sleepsack is a great idea for babies - keeps them warm with their arms free and no blanket to kick over their heads, but the zipper on this brand is just awful. Unfortunately Halo seems to be sold everywhere - we ended up with 3 of these in different weights and sizes and the zippers on all of them are cheap and hard to zip up. Trying to get this on a sleepy baby is next to impossible because you end up wrestling with the zipper and waking the baby every time. I thought it was maybe just a fluke bad zipper with the first one we tried out, but all 3 of our sleep sacks have the same problem.
