review/summary: Every Baby Should Have This!review/text: I bought this for my 10 week old grandson for Christmas and the minute it was set up he enjoyed it. The lights, music, colors and activities keep him fasinated! It's so much fun to watch him laying in it. I don't recall my children as babies ever expressing such joy over a toy. This is absolutely the best!
