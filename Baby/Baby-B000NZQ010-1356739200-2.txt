review/summary: My Granddaughter loves this itemreview/text: We received this very quickly after ordering. It was even nicer than we expected. We put it together for my 8 month old granddaughter on Christmas Eve. She grabbed it, pulled herself up to standing and immediately started walking across the room. She loves the lights and sounds, and it's the perfect height. I'm so happy we purchased this item.
