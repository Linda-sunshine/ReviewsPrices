review/summary: Simply the best!review/text: I love how well the diapers keep my little one dry! When change her diaper, it is clear that the diaper absorbs the moisture away from her skin, she is truly a huggies baby! Although she is at the age of the movers, I wont change her over because they dont keep her as dry. Huggies are much better than Pampers!
