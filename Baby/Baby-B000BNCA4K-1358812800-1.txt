review/summary: My son LOVES it!review/text: I bought this toy after looking up reviews on the best toys for 3 month olds. I am a first time Mom, & I wanted to get something that he would like & other experienced Mom's thought were great. Well, my son LOVES this toy. He can easily get his little hands around the loops & he loves the bright colors. He does get a little frustraited when he can't get it into his mouth the way he wants it, but I think it's because his motor skills aren't developed enough yet. All together, I think this toy is great. The only reason I didn't give this product a 5 star review is because he gets aggravated with the toy where he can't get it in his mouth, & because of the small ball/rattle feature inside the red square at the center. This rattle only works half the time, & I usually have to smack it really hard against my palm to shake the ball inside loose.
