review/summary: UNSAFEreview/text: My 5 month old recently discovered her feet. While sitting on the Fisher Price infant rocker she leaned forward and fell right off the chair bumping her head on the floor. She was tightly and securely strapped in so this should NOT have happened especially for a product designed for infants.
