review/summary: Loved itreview/text: This was exactly what we needed after we moved into a house with narrow wooden stairs. It was a little tricky to put in but that was probably because I was trying to do it with my kids around. A couple of reviewers said the adhesive pads it comes with to stick to the wall were not needed however I couldn't get mine to stay straight for tightening without them. However, that could just be me. It's very sturdy, my daughter pulls up on it and it hasn't budged and my older kids figured out how to open and close it with no problem. I love that it swings shut automatically in case the kids forget to close it. I'm completely happy with this gate and would recommend it to anyone.
