review/summary: Great product! Wish they made adult sizesreview/text: This is a great product and we have been using SleepSacks since birth. It keeps them warm all night and allows mom and dad to not worry about blankets or if our child is warm enough, Highly recommended due to the plush fleece and well constructed zipper. We have bought several due to growth and will continue to buy them as long as our daughter can wear them. Also, we got our first sleepsack at our delivery hospital. Once our daughter grew out of the infant size, we donated them to the maternity ward so other families could use them.
