review/summary: Perfect for boysreview/text: I wanted a pot for boys and one that could be used for a healthy (chunky) child. My son used this pot for the entire potty training process. He had one at home and at both grandparents houses. The pee guard did its job and the size was great for my "chunky" little one.
