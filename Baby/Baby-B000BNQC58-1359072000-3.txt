review/summary: My kids love this!review/text: My 3 year old son loves this turtle. Turning it on has become part of his bedtime routine. We just received the ladybug night light as a gift for my 1.5 year old daughter's room and she is thrilled with it also. Both kids enjoy looking for the moon each night. The batteries last a long time even with daily use. We don't have any problem viewing the stars in any of the colors, but this is the only light in the kids' rooms so it is otherwise very dark. As the batteries weaken the stars will dim. Ordering it from Amazon is tricky, the first turtle arrived with scratches on the shell due to inadequate packing. The ladybug we received that was also from Amazon came with scratches too. If you're picky (like me) I'd suggest buying it at the store or be prepared to send it back a few times.
