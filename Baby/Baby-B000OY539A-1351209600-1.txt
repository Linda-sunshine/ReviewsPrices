review/summary: We love this wrap!review/text: I think that the Moby is probably one of the best products ever thought up for babies!! My daughter loves it and can sit in it for hours, snuggles up and falls asleep. I purchased a sling first and was very disappointed in it, the baby was all scrunched up and I am not sure how anyone would be able to wear it for long periods of time b/c it seemed to get heavy! I saw a woman in wal-mart wearing the Moby and asked her about it and she gave it rave reviews. Went home and ordered it and am amazed how I love it too!! I now get people walking up to me asking what it is and where they can get one! The reason I do not feel I can give it a 5 is that as for me it is pretty easy to get on my husband wont use it because he said it is too hard to figure out/wrap and the material is really long and he thinks it is just inconvenient. The cost is around the same for other products which isn't too much of a concern other than I honestly do feel that I could buy the Jersey Material at a fabric store and make it myself which I intend on doing so that I can have more colors and save a bundle!! But the concept is Amazing and I definitely recommend it!
