review/summary: Clip broke while trying to install batteriesreview/text: I was very excited to get my Itzbeen timer up and running and just put the batteries in. The clip on the back just snapped off as it doesn't really seem to allow enough room to get the three AAA batteries in. I don't know how much I would have actually used a belt clip but I know it would have been helpful in the diaper bag or my purse- to make it easier to find. A little dissapointing.
