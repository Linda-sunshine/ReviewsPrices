review/summary: My daughters love thisreview/text: We bought the twilight turtle for my 7 year old elder daughter who has trouble sleeping on her own at night. The product is a complete hit with her as well as the younger daughter who is 2 years old. Only problem is that the younger won't leave it alone and is constantly switching colors. She has even named it "bugzy". The pink colour isn't as bright as the other colors. The green colour seems to show up the best. The images of the stars and the moon are quite sharp and they really do fill the whole room. The really nice feature is that it automatically turns off after 45 mins.
