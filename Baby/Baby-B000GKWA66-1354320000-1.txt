review/summary: Good idea, better options out therereview/text: Fortunately my son doesn't wake when this shuts off but I could see that being a problem for many parents as it is an abrupt end to what was a constant sound. My son does love the Giraffe, more so than the sheep - makes different sounds but the only one like white noise is ocean waves, he will cuddle up next to it at night and fall asleep. It doesn't get very loud especially when the batteries get low but is enough to comfort my son.
