review/summary: works great for usreview/text: Gives us peace of mind. I feel okay about running upstairs to grab something while my son is safe in his superyard. We have 2 dogs as well and it keeps them from licking his face and stealing his toys. It also keeps my crawling baby from pulling the dogs tails and ears!
