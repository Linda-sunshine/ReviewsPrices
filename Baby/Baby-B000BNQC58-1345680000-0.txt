review/summary: my son sleeps now!review/text: My two yr old saw the dream lights on tvand wanted it but i researched and liked this better.Even in the store this looked much better.He loves it!! He goes to sleep with it next to him. No more crying when I leave the room.The stars are bright and just really cool on the ceiling and I love how you can turmoil the colors of the stars. Amber isn't to bright but if you want lower light its perfect!If it was a little less money I would buy this for all friends kids birthday present!
