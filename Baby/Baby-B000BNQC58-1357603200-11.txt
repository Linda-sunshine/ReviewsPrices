review/summary: Forget dreamlites....the cloud b constellation series is the way to go!review/text: I have twins and my girls have wanted dream lites for about a year now. I was going to cave and buy them for xmas. So thankful I got these instead. They were the same price and these are a 1,000 times better! I thought the hard shell might make them difficult to snuggle or would break quickly....I was wrong. They are actually very easy for the girls to snuggle and I can't imagine that the shell is going to break anytime soon. The girls have stepped on them, tossed them around, and frankly beat them b/c they have taken them with them everywhere we go. I know the description says the batteries don't last all that long....well we have the turtle and the ladybug...they have been used constantly (day and night) since xmas day and show no signs of battery distress. The only improvment could be if music was added. Oh...and the stars really do project well in a large room. The girls bedroom is around 20x15 and one of these more than covers the entire ceiling and walls.
