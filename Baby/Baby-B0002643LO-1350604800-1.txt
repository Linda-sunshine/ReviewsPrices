review/summary: Great valuereview/text: I could buy Huggies brand diapers at CostCo, but they don' make as good a diaper as Pampers. Pampers fit better, and keep my baby drier without the absorbing filler coming out. And since Amazon offers the best price I can find anywhere, and it's super convenient to have them delivered to my doorstep without an additional charge, I love it! The only thing you have to be aware of is shipping time. You can't order on line when you have just a few diapers left. I have found that if I order when we have about a week's worth of diapers left, they arrive just in time.
