review/summary: Awesome toy for my 3 month oldreview/text: My little girl seemed to want to grasp at toys but nothing fit her small chubby hands just right. Then I found the Winkel on amazon. I ordered it knowing it would be perfect for her and was so excited for it to arrive. I opened it, washed it, and handed it to her and she immediately grasped it with both hands and moved it to her mouth and began gnawing on it. So many milestones at once! She is 98 days and loves holding on to this toy. It's bright colors seem to hold her attention as she will stare at it, transfixed. So glad I ordered this toy! Thanks Manhattan Toy, another winner.
