review/summary: Poor construction = leaks, leaks, leaksreview/text: I understand that you can't avoid leaks all the time - babies move and diapers can bunch or gape. But we are dealing with leaky diapers on a daily basis and the leaks are consistently up the back, not through the leg holes. When I looked at how Pampers are constructed I realized why my 5mo old has been soaked in pee every day since we started using "Baby Dry" diapers. (She is 15lbs and we have been using size 2.) If you look inside the diaper the rectangular absorbent pad goes all the way up the front, but there is virtually no coverage in the back. So there is no protection for when my daughter is lying down; the pee simply runs up the back and soaks her clothes and sheets. This is particularly irritating at night because she loses at least an hour of sleep for every leaky diaper because she has to be undressed, wiped off, and dressed so she is WIDE awake. (And you KNOW how precious that nighttime sleep is.) Maybe it's different with male babies but I can't imagine anyone is getting "12 hour protection" with these stinkers. Either the makers of Pampers think babies only pee when sitting up, or they have discovered a great way for us to have to buy more diapers.
