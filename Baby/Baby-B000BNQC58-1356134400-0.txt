review/summary: Bought one for our friend's baby -- then bought one for ourselves!review/text: My friends had this on their list of baby shower presents. I thought it looked cute as hell, so we bought it for them. Once I saw it in action, I knew this was the night light I wanted for myself. The star pattern it projects around the room is great. The LEDs are nice and bright. The three color selections are neato. The turtle itself is cute. The auto shut off feature is perfect.There's nothing to dislike about this.
