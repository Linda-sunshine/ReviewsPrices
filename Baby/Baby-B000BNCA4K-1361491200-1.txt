review/summary: Great First Toyreview/text: This is a great first toy for baby because it is easy for them to grab and easy for them to put in their mouth. It also rattles when the baby shakes it, but it is not too loud. Also, it is soft enough that if an uncoordinated baby happens to hit themself in the head or face it will not hurt. It is also easily squishable and easy to transport. I find myself putting it on a paci clip so my daughter can't throw it across the room!
