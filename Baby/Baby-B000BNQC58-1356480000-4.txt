review/summary: better than expected!review/text: You will not be disappointed! I really doubted the ability of this toy to project stars on the ceiling. Wow, was I wrong. The projection is very powerful and expansive, yet the light is soothing. The three color choices make it very fun for a toddler. This would probably make a great birthday gift for almost any age child. I bought this for my 2 year old but now my 9 year old wants one as well!
