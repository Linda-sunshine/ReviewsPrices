review/summary: Love them for sensative little squiters!review/text: We were using Swaddlers for our son and he just wasn't happy with them - he would make the tiniest little pee, a couple dribbles at best and he would start screaming. We would literally go through 5 diapers in 10 minutes! We decided to go with Baby Dry for the daytime and he's so content! We still change him often but we aren't wasting diapers on an eyedropper full of pee anymore.We like them better than Swaddlers for a couple other reasons: they are perfumed but not as heavy as Swaddlers are (which my husband HATED anyhow), there is no indicator line but it is still very easy to tell when they are wet. Baby dry are thinner and trimmer than the Swaddlers were but absorb better.Downside: they are blue on the absorbent side - they make the poop look EXTRA gross.
