review/summary: great investmentreview/text: Compared to the first carrier we got, this is much more comfortable with everything padded, looks much stirdier, and a lot easier to buckle the baby up. It's also light-weight and we prefer it to the stroller for short-distance trips. Everything else is great, but the above mentioned are the most desirable in terms of carrying the baby hands-free while not worrying about the baby falling or too much weight on sholders, etc. Of course, even at home you can use it while doing household chores becaue my 7-month old now needs constant intention. This definately frees my hands while making my baby happy by being close to her. Among the baby items, this is the most frequenty used baby gear. I highly recommend it.
