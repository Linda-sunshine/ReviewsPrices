review/summary: Awesome product!!!review/text: I'm 4 months pregnant and I was having difficulty sleeping comfortably on my side. I was going to purchase a regular body pillow when I came across the Snoogle. It really supports my back and I've been sleeping much better now. It's a little pricey but totally worth it.
