review/summary: So far so Awesomereview/text: I am up and moving around a lot. I knew that my newborn was going to want to be held and moving with me. The Babybjorn has made it so much easier!We use it around the house on fussy days when my baby doesn't want to be put down. Depending on his mood we can change the way he sits in it. If he's feeling cuddly I wrap him in a blanket, he faces me, and he an fall asleep. If he's feeling adventures I turn him around, fold down the head support, and he watches me do the dishes.The head support is optional and there are safety loops for leg whole made especially for infants-Awesome. The Babybjorn is easy to get on and off. I generally put the backpack straps on, lay my baby on the padded holder and then attach the backpack. It's the easiest thing to do by myself.The Bjorne is also very secure. I only ever keep a hand on the baby for comfort never because I feel he's going to fall out.I haven't tried other carriers and I don't think I will. $90 is a lot to spend -so try to get a used one (the bjorne is machine washable) or add it to you registry. If I ever lost mine and couldn't find one used... I would spend the $90 or a replacement.
