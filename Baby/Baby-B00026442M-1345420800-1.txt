review/summary: They work, but not my favorite diaperreview/text: I ordered these diapers because there were no more Luvs in size 5 available for my subscribe and save. I have usually liked Pampers in the past, but I was not impressed with these. For a size 5 they were considerably smaller than other brands in a size 5. They have not leaked so far, but they are not comfortable for my son at all and for the price, they should be. I am on baby number four and I do know that different diapers work differently for each person/child, but I am not impressed with these.
