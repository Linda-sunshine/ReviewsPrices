review/summary: Good Wipesreview/text: These are good wipes. I like that they are chlorine free although it doesn't noticably effect my baby's skin one way or the other. They work with any plastic dispenser tub and dispense easily. I get frustrated with fishing around in the plastic tub to try to get the wipes to come out conveniently, but didn't have to with these. They clean up my little one well and do not dry out. I'm not giving them a five because they are comparable to other brand and store brand wipes overall. The only bonus is the chlorine free part. I do not know how they compare to other chlorine free wipes.
