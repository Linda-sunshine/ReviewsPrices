review/summary: does not absorb fast enoughreview/text: We switched to baby dry from swaddlers because our local club big box store had a coupon.We wanted our baby to start sleeping longer and since we really like swaddlers and baby dry promises up to 12 hours of dryness, the baby dry would be exactly what we are looking for. .... right?There are also not as absorbent, I don't mean you let you baby sit there and see how long he can go without a diaper change, what I'm talking about is the more liquid poo is not absorbed and ends up in the little leg compartment making a mess out of his chubby little tights and if not caught early enough ends up on the outside of the diaper!!. We are constantly changing his diaper, at night we dont get the *up to 12 hrs promised, not even the *up to 6 hours!!Last, there's no wet indicator ... I used to like this feature on the other diapers. Our baby does not like diaper changes (unless he's full) but sometimes even if he was full he would fuss and I don't like when he gets upset after feedings, specially at night since its harder to get him back to sleep. With the wet indicator I could make the decision to change him before or after his feedings depending on how wet was the diaper.I don't have many children but I know when something is better or worse ... I know that much! The Baby dry 12 hour diapers are much, much worse that the diapers we used to have! However if you have a baby that doest poop, pee, sleep or fuss than this might be the diaper for you!!!*** Updade 9/6/2012 ***The leaks continue .... the latest leak required an emengency bath time because there was poo everywhere!!After the last leak I'm swiching back to swaddlers .... Pampers Baby dry have only been disappointment and frustration!!
