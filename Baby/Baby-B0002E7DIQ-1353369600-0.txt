review/summary: Definitly worth the $$review/text: I purchased this "u-shaped" maternity pillow because I had a hard time getting comfortable at night and having a regular pillow between my legs was a hassle, everytime I rolled over I had to bring it with me and re-adjust myself. This pillow is awesome because you have both sides that come down around you, so you sleep in the middle and it doesn't matter if you roll over, you'll already have a pillow there, its super soft and comfy and is like sleeping on a marshmallow! It even comes with a diagram of different ways you can use it. Personally I like to use it the way it is in this picture but I just bring the sides in so they are slightly overlapping and I lay on top of the entire thing :). I also felt secure in knowing I wouldn't absentmindedly roll onto my back (a no-no while pregnant) since both sides are there to prevent that.Definitly a good investment and worth the money! I plan to also use it once baby is born as a feeding pillow or comfy prop up for her.
