review/summary: Rough and tumble 9 month old loves this!review/text: I'm not sure about other kids - but my daughter does what she wants, when she wants to and how she wants to do it.Sometimes, this means she has more bruises than other 9 month olds, but she likes the adventure!She loves making the toy makes noise and likes using it backward.I didn't get this to help her walk - she will do that when she wants to. She's been cruising for the last 2 months and I am not pushing her to walk. I did want to give her a toy she could use if she wanted to creep somewhere other than the couch.Yes - there are shapes and colors and numbers on the "toy" part and no - it doesn't teach your kid anything - but toys don't do that... parent's do.Yes - she has fallen while using it. No - she didn't cry.Yes - she uses it "incorrectly." No - it's not slowing her development.If you are looking for a toy to teach your children colors, shapes, letters, numbers, musical scales and nursery rhymes, this is not the toy to purchase. If you are looking for a flashing toy to entertain that your child can be active with - I recommend this product.
