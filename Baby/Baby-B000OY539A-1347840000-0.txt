review/summary: Complicated, but the most COMFORTABLE carrier for Mama!review/text: When I first started wearing my son...it took quite a few tries and several youtube tutorials to figure out how to tie the thing. But once I figured out there was really only ONE way to tie it, I just practiced that tie over and over again with a doll before putting my son in it. After mastering the tie, I wore my son around all the time. On a negative note, sometimes the wrap would get annoying because it's SO long that it always hits the ground at some point while tying and gets dirty. But the wide straps and stretchy material make it the most comfortable baby carrier I've ever tried (TO THIS DAY and my son is 20 months old!!). And you can breastfeed in it and wear baby a bunch of different ways!!! They DO have simpler versions of this same wrap that I have not tried but I would like to, the Baby K'Tan for example which doesn't have all the wrapping and tying, but it still has the same comfort of stretchy material and very wide straps and looks very similar to the Moby. The only disadvantage I would say about ANY STRETCHY WRAP is that they are not recommended for any type of back carry because of the stretchiness of the material. Babies can wiggle out much easier in stretchy material especially as they get older, so they are at more of a risk of falling as they are more able to move around. I had to buy a Mei Tai or woven (non-stretchy) wrap so I could wear my toddler on my back when we go to the grocery store or on a walk or outing (back carry was MUCH easier on my back once my little guy started to get heavier). Overall, I'm SO glad I had my Moby wrap and if we have another, I'll put it to good use all over again. ;-)
