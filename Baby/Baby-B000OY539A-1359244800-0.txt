review/summary: Hard to usereview/text: It was easy to follow the instructions but still it was not easy to use and felt unsafe to keep my 5 month old in it. My baby struggled to stay in it and it was not very easy to get him in. I would still stay with other brands of baby carries with the straps and clips. Just feels safer with the other products.
