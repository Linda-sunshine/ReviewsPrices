review/summary: Easy to Use and Sturdyreview/text: I put this gate up near a staircase to keep my 10 month old from tumbling down. Its easy to install (2 people can do it more easily than trying to do it alone) and its really sturdy. Opening the gate at first seemed a little complicated, but after a few minutes we go tthe hang of it.
