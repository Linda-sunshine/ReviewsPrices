review/summary: So cute!review/text: My daughter, boyfriend, and I all love this product. It is adorable, well made, and there are 3 colors to choose from. I feel like this product will last years, my daughter only likes the green stars right now so I think once her favorite color changes her interest will be renewed all over again. This is a little bigger then the star pillow pets they show on tv all the time, it was cuter, and it was cheaper to order online. This was a great purchase.
