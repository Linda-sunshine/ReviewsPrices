review/summary: Not essentialreview/text: A well made gym with vibrant colours but it's definitely not a necessity on the list of must have baby items. The mat is slippery so provides little traction/grip. It's also very small so once your child can roll over, this mat provided little coverage. The hanging toys are lovely soft and bright. They are very similar to the toys that come with the mobile. Buy that instead.
