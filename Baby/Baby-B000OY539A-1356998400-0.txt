review/summary: Well worth the pricereview/text: The Moby is very comfortable to wear and secure for the little one. We love that is doesn't have any hard edges like some baby carriers. Just a heads up, read the instructions because we didn't realize in the beginning that we couldn't cradle our son in one side. This position would have resulted in his chin resting on his chest and a restriction of his breathing.
