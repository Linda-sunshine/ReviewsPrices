review/summary: Wife loves thisreview/text: My wife loves this pillow. One thing to know when looking a this item is that it is HUGE! We have a king size bed and it still feels big. i don't know if this would be very good in a smaller bed. Stiching is good and it is nice that it comes with a pillow cover. I would suggest buying an extra just in case and you can find them here on amazon. Pillow is not flemsy, flat, or anything like that plenty of stuffing. My wife started having trouble sleeping around 5 month pregnant. I bought her this and even though it is exspensive it has been well worth the price for both of us. She has stopped tossing and turning and is finnaly able to get comfortable which means now I can sleep too. My wife has found that there are many different ways you can situate the pillow depending on how she is feeling that day. It not oly supports her belly but it also supports her knees when they are sore. If you can afford the space for it, I would highly reccomend this product.
