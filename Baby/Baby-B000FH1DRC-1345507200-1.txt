review/summary: Best diapers - best pampers - bummed they don't have larger sizesreview/text: These are the best Pampers. We have tried them all and these are the best fit and most absorbent out there. I am bummed that they don't make them in larger sizes (only goes to size 3). All the other diapers leak, are not as absorbent, don't fit as well. Love the wetness indicator strip. No wonder these are the diapers they use in hospitals. Please make them bigger!
