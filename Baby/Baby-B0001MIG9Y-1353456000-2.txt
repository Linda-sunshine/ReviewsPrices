review/summary: A defective packreview/text: This is the first time I ordered size 5. It was a defective pack. The sides stick to the inside of the diaper when I try to open up the diaper to put it on my child. When I forcibly pull them apart, plastic is left on the area my daughters bum will be, as well as strands of plastic left hanging that I have to be careful to pick off so my child doesn't get them. Hopefully it is just this pack. It still absorbs as Pampers usually do.
