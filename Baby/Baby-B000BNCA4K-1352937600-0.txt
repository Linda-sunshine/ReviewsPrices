review/summary: great for small practicing handsreview/text: My 4 months old is teething and this was a great teether for him. I don't like it when he puts fabrics in his mouth 'cause i think of him eating little lint pieces, and it's too early for him to be able to grasp big plastic toys, so this one is just perfect. He is able to catch it and pick it up very easily. Also, the cube in the middle rattles so it catches his attention. The colors are beautiful and interesting for him. Over all I highly recommend this for ages 0 and up.
