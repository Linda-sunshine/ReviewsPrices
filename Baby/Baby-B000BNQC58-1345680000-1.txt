review/summary: Great item for kids, or anyone!review/text: Bought the turtle for my daughter when she was an infant, and she loved it. Unfortunately, I dropped it on my tile floor one time too many and broke it after 4 years of nightly use. She wanted the ladybug, so it was one of her gifts, and she loves it just as much. She uses it every night, takes it on trips with her, sharpest it with her friends. The only problem is when the lights get dim due to batteries being worn down. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
