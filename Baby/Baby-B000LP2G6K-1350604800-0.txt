review/summary: Perfect "crib" for Grandma's housereview/text: Just had my first grandchild in September. This was recommended over any other product by anyone I asked. It sets up easily, breaks down just as easily and quickly. Its versatility is very clever. It's been nearly 30 years since we've had a baby in the house and I'm amazed at the wonderful products available today!
