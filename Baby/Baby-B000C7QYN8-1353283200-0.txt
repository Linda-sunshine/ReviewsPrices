review/summary: These are all right.review/text: We keep buying these because we think maybe they are better than "regular" wipes.I don't really know whether they are better or not.The wipes are fairly thin, and when you try to pull them out of the package, you usually end up with more than one. Frequently they get kind of tangled near the spot where you pull them out.That used to bother me, and then I realized I pretty much always need more than just one anyway. These wipes are so thin that they don't pick up much. So, maybe having multiple wipes come out at once is a feature and not a problem with the product.We will probably continue to buy these. Theoretically I would like to make my own wipe solution and start using the reusable wipes that we bought before my daughter was born, but actually that just seems like one more thing to worry about at a time when we are too busy for extra projects. So, here we are back at square one, with our 7G wipes that get tangled as we pull them out.If you're considering these, eh, they're okay. They don't amaze and delight me, but they get the job done...after 2 or 3 wipes.Happy diapering!
