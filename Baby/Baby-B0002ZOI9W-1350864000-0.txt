review/summary: Great concept!review/text: I loved the idea of the rocker, but it's rather poorly executed. There isn't much difference between the height settings. The lower setting isn't very reclined, but the higher setting doesn't really allow the child to sit upright. My 1 yr old finds that very frustrating, and won't sit in it. Plus, the product we got is slightly defective. The motor in the vibrations emits a high-pitched whine. My husband took it apart and oiled it, which reduced the whine some, but it's still there.
