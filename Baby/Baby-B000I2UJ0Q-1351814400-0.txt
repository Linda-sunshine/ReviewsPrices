review/summary: a great purchasereview/text: I had my doubts regarding the great reviews i saw on this product, but for sure it was worth it. My granddaughter, (4 1/2 mo) absolutely LOVES this jumper. She laughs and gurgles and bounces like crazy! An amazing purchase. I would strongly recommend this to anyone considering a jumper type toy.
