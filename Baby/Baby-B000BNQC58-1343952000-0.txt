review/summary: Cloud b Twilight constellation Night Lihgt-Lady Bugreview/text: Excellent product! I bought this in an effort to get my 2 year old to like sleeping in his new toddler bed. He loves looking at the " stars" and the lady bug. He is able to go off to sleep by himslef in a dark room gazing at the stars. A must have- I am glad I bought it. I also love that the stars can be illuminated in 3 different colors and the labybug itself glows very brightly yet softly. Well worth the price- the concept is unique!
