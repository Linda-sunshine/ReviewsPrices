review/summary: Made it through two kids and still looks newreview/text: They both played with this toy daily! I love that you can take the main part off so that little ones can Play with it for tummy time. Provides hours of entrainment. Only downside is when the batteries start getting low, pushing the cows makes a weird repetitive noise! Great item otherwise!
