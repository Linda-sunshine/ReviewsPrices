review/summary: Pampers Swaddlers great for thin babiesreview/text: Our baby was a little butterball after she was just born and the Huggies worked great for her but as she grew and thinned out, we found that the Pampers worked a lot better. She is currently 75% height and 25% in weight. They fit her great and have the handy stripe that turns blue when wet. We have been using these diapers for over a year now and have been very happy. We use the Pampers Baby Dry for the night time since they seem to be able to be better for higher volumes, but use Swaddlers throughout the day.
