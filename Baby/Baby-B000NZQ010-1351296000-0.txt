review/summary: 9 month old daughter loves thisreview/text: We bought this for our 9 month old opting for a stand up walker over one that a child sits in. She played with the activity center a lot for a few weeks before actually grabbing onto the handle bar, pulling herself up and pushing it. It's so cute to see her walking. It seems pretty stable and sturdy; hasn't tipped over from her pulling up on it.
