review/summary: The best jumperoo bar nonereview/text: I did lots of research before buying and it was clear that all other models and brands had some issue. Th e rainforest jumperoo was the one that time and again had recommendations or people regretting they hadn't bought it first.I can confirm it it as good as they say.Fisher price should just cancel their current models and base new ones on the rainforest model.Top marks.My only complaint would be that I couldn't buy this in Canada and had to order from the USA, so shipping was well overpriced, but I blame fisher price for that. Other than that this is a great buy. No regrets from this customer.
