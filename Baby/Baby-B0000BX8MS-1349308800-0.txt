review/summary: Geniusreview/text: HALO sleep sacks are the best twenty bucks you'll spend on your infant. Forget messing around with blankets. Drop your wee one in one of these! Warm and cozy, helps our little guy feel secure and sleep more soundly. High quality construction. I'm not a SIDS expert, but the safety features can't hurt, right? Also, the zipper is installed upside down which makes diaper changes super easy. Clearly designed by a parent. Get 2 or 3 in case you have a nighttime blowout.:)
