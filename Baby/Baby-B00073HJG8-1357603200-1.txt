review/summary: Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammockreview/text: It's bigger that we expected when it's hung up and filled with stuffed animals! I recommend it be hung up high as it sags down quite a bit when full. My 6 year old daughter got a little step ladder and meticulously placed all her animals in it. When she was done she stepped back and looked in delight and said, &#34;Yeah.... I LIKE that!&#34; She is very pleased with how everything looks. We are too. It was a good buy. It keeps all her friends off her bed, looks nice and neat, and leaves room in her toy basket for TOYS :)
