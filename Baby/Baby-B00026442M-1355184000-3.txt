review/summary: Wanted to find something better in an alternative/green brand but it doesn't exist.review/text: Like most people we were originally given pampers in the hospital, I never would have bought them otherwise. I've tried all the decently priced small brands & green brands but unfortunately none of them compare to pampers baby dry. They've consistently held up through teething poops & 12hr nights. They're now holding up during crawling, climbing & bouncing.
