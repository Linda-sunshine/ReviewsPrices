review/summary: Great Dealreview/text: I have a 1 year old and a 2 year old who constantly were getting into everything no matter how much we baby-proofed... I set this up differently than the pictures shows... I made a long rectangle and a smaller square portion to prevent tipping. It is great. I bought some of the bright color padding on amazon and the kids actually get excited to go into the play yard! Love the ivory color as it looks nice in the living room. I bought the 8 panel play yard. More than happy with this purchase! Both of my children have plenty of room to play and now I do not have to chase my kids around 24/7. Definitely worth the investment, it has really made life easier!
