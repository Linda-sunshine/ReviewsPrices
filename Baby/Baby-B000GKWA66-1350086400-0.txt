review/summary: Worked well...for a whilereview/text: The sleep sheep is a good idea, and it's cute, but that's about all it has going for it. We bought this for my son when he was a few months old; now he's 11 months and it has already stopped working. When you buy this, you're paying for the cute sheep; the sound machine part is very cheaply made. It has a knob that, turned one way, turns the sound off, and, turned the other way, turns the sound on and adjusts the volume. After just a few months, the knob started malfunctioning; it would only work in certain positions. Annoying, but it was still usable. Then, about a week ago it just stopped working altogether (while we were travelling, no less, and really in need of it!).We went to Target to find a replacement and found a great sound machine with more sounds and more options for less money, and it seems to be of very good quality. It has one feature I really love that the sleep sheep doesn't; you can let the sound run indefinitely without it timing out.Spend your money elsewhere if you want a decent sound machine!
