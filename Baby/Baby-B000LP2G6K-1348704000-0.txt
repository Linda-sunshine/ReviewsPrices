review/summary: Camo Pac n playreview/text: I bought this for my Granddaughter...She loves it...Not sure on how the baby will feel about it as he hasn't been born yet...but I am sure he will love it too...It is very nice and seems to be made very strong. Very happy with this product. Not overly fancy,which is good. Baby can sleep in top part until he is to big,then move to the bottom. 2 beds in one great buy. The price was great...and nowhere else could we find a Camo Joe bed like this one. I am sure it will well get its use over and over again...Would buy again!!!!
