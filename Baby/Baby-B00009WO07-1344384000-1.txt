review/summary: Pampers diapers - have they changed???review/text: I was tired of the tabs on luvs and decided to go back to pampers, but when I tried both the cruisers and baby dry diapers this time around, they both gave my little guy diaper rash (they didn't do that a year and a half ago). The baby dry didn't do it as bad as the cruisers. I love pampers products - both the baby dry diapers and the cruisers as well (great fit, quality product), but they are useless if they give your little one diaper rash. Otherwise, amazon does a great job delivering their product.
