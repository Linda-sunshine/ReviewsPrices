review/summary: Swaddlers are the best, they need to make them past size 3!!review/text: We have used Pampers Swaddlers since our little guy came home. They are perfect and he hardly ever leaks. I really wish that they would make them past size four. I am going to be sad when I have to try a different style of Pampers. If we ever have another child, we will use the same!! Great diaper!
