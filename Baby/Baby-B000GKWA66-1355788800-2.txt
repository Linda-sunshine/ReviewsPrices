review/summary: awesome white noisereview/text: we have rambunctious boys so it's a must have to drown out their noises when putting the baby down for naps. great quality. i only use one of the sounds- the water/ white noise. one of the noises is supposed to be a heartbeat, but it's a little scary sounding. the other two noises are nature sounds of the jungle, but they don't really help my baby calm down.
