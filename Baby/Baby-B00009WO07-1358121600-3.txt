review/summary: Welts and red rashesreview/text: I have been using these diapers for both of my girls for years. My last Subscribe and Save box landed on my doorstep last week and my 15 month old daughter has had welts and red hot rashes on her diaper area ever since. I hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else and that whatever has changed is fixed quickly. For now I will switch to Seventh Generation.Last week I received my box on my doorstep and due to the new frustration free packaging, couldn't open the box with my hands anymore due to all the tape on top of the box. This makes it a bit of a frustration, instead of less.
