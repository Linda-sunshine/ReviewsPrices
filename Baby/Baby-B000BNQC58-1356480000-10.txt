review/summary: Charming toy/ nighttime sleep aid!review/text: Wonderful toy! It fills the room with a starry night sky setting a peaceful atmosphere. My toddler as well as 3 month old infant love it at bed time as well as to play with at other times. I wish the red light was brighter- it doesn't project well, however the red light illuminates the red ladybug perfectly.
