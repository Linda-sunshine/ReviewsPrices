review/summary: Works well to calm babyreview/text: The Moby wrap did not meet my initial expectations but it works great to calm a baby. I already own a Baby Bjorn carrier from my first child. The B.B. is great for babies once they can hold their head up on their own but not for newborns; it doesn't support their head and neck enough even though it has a "newborn setting".Now that I have 2 kids under the age of two, I needed something to help carry my newborn while I run after my toddler. I was hoping that the Moby would allow me to carry my baby while keeping my hands free to do things around the house. It doesn't really work like that for me but it does work very well to calm my baby. It also allows me to carry my baby around while removing the pressure from my arms and back. It does keep me "hands free" enough to do basic things like write this review or go outside with my toddler. My baby settles down very quickly in the Moby and usually falls asleep within minutes.The reasons I only gave it 3 stars are the following:*it is made up of a lot of material that you have to wrap around your body making it hard to handle if your baby is already upset or if you're trying to put it on when out in public (the material drags on the ground);*the way you wrap the Moby around your body restricts your arm movements so you can't lift your arms up very high; you also have to support your newborn quite a bit making it less helpful when trying to do household chores (this may improve as the baby gets older);*it can get quite hot.However, I would recommend this product for its calming effects on baby. It works very well in helping put baby to sleep, allows you to carry your baby for a long time without any back or arm strain, and therefore increases your overall snuggle time with your little one.
