review/summary: Very practical, great for grandparents.review/text: I registered for this because I knew my parents wouldn't want a free-standing crib taking up room in their house, and this playard folds up relatively quickly and compactly and can then be stashed away in a closet or under a bed. It's pretty simple to set up, mostly because it doesn't have a million pieces to assemble, and the directions for opening it and folding it are printed on the outside of the carrier (genius!). Also, the bassinet attachment is sturdy, and makes it easy for my poor old parents to pick up the baby. Material-wise, it's nothing special, and the mattress isn't the softest thing in the world, but you can buy a playard mattress if that bothers your baby. I also attached my own crib toys to the bar because, like most baby products, the "toys" that come with it are an afterthought-the Miyim stroller toys are a good substitute because they velcro around the bar and jingle. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the locking mechanisms on the side rails are a little tricky; you have to make sure they are all depressed, or the joints get stuck and you'll be wrestling with it until you either give up, or your father takes over. Like a lot of things, practice makes perfect, and this does get easier the more you do it.
