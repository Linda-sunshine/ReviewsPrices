review/summary: LIFE SAVER!review/text: So glad I made the purchase to get this Bjorn carrier. I needed something I could use for my 3 week old that never wanted me to put her down. This was super easy to use and I liked that I didn't need an insert for it since she was so small which most carriers need. She instantly falls asleep in it which is an added bonus as well. I've actually found it pretty comfortable, but then again she's 6 weeks now and only about 10lbs. Not sure how it will feel once she's bigger, but I would definitely recommend this for newborns.
