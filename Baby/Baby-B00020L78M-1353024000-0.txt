review/summary: Great productreview/text: This is absolutely worth it. We got this most specifically for a camping trip. But have since then used it to section off the yard, use it in the house when cleaning and cooking.. It has been a huge help and lifesaver. When we set a pool in the yard (small one for the bigger kids) we can put the gate around the pool or put the gate up in another part of the yard where it's shady for my 1 year old. Now that we are closing in on Christmas with decorations and trees.. I think it will yet again be a huge help with my little munchkin turning TWO. She is already affectionately called our "mini monster."She loves having her own space where she an have her own space (she has 4 older siblings) or she likes having one on one time with her siblings in the "cage". She is always excited when I ask her if she wants to get in the cage! She gets her studies and blankets and a pillow and dollies and has her own quiet time.
