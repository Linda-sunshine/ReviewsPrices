review/summary: Gate Stays Put Without Screws.review/text: This gate stays put without screws. We have this gate in our main hallway, so everyone in our house, including two young toddlers, uses it many times a day. This is so much more convenient than the standard gates that you have to put up and take down. Also, I think this one is about $20 less expensive than a comparable gate at our local big-box hardware store.
