review/summary: VTech Sit To Stand Learning Walkerreview/text: I purchased this product for my grandson and he thoroughly enjoys it! I love the fact that the play portion comes off and he is able to play with it in a variety of positions, whether he is standing, sitting or even lying on his side. He loves the lights, the sound effects and the activities involved in the design. This keeps him busy and interacting in a positive learning experience. I am happy when he is entertained in a positive manner that promotes learning!
