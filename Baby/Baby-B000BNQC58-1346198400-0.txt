review/summary: Adorablereview/text: I haven't given this to my daughter yet because it is for her 5th birthday next month but I tried it out. It casts so many stars onto the ceiling. It actually surprised me that it covered the whole ceiling of my bedroom (my bedroom is pretty big). I guess I just imagined it would project enough to cover a small section of the ceiling. My 2 year old son was in the room when I tested it out and he was amazed by all the stars as well. He was mad when I had to put it away. Guess he's getting a turtle version of this for Christmas. The ladybug is also adorable. I saw that some of the customer pictures featured one with closed eyes but in the main picture her eyes were open. Mine arrived with her eyes open and I was pretty pleased about that. I think she's cuter that way. Anyway, I think my daughter is going to love it. If not, I'm giving it to my son. :)
