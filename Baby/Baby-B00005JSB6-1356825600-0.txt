review/summary: Over a third of the diapers didn't have a tab on the side to secure the diaperreview/text: I usually LOVE these diapers and they are always great, but thisfirst and last order I got through Amazon, almost a third of them didn't have a tab on one side of them to secure the diaper to my child. I had to throw out a lot of unused diapers and frankly that really sucked because diapers are expensive and I don't like wasting my money. I think I will steer clear of buying diapers from Amazon from now on.
