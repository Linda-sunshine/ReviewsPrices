review/summary: Great for elderly folks too =)review/text: I got this for an elderly person. EVERYONE loved it. You get a choice of RED,BLUE, or GREEN stars. I think they are actual constellations with a cute cresent moon. You can put it on your bed makes finding a bed in the dark lots easier if you get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Very tranquil and relaxing with the stars on your ceiling. Goes off after 45 minutes.Do NOT make the stars move its very disorienting and makes you dizzy and nauseous. Lay on the bed and have someone move the thing and you'll see what I mean.The product is perfect the way it is.
