review/summary: the best!review/text: I got this gym based solely on the reviews because I wasn't crazy about the design (big yellow giraffe) and the bold colors. There are cuter, more attractive gyms out there. After putting my baby in this gym, I can now understand why it is the best! The music is great, not annoying, catchy, I sing it all day long. The lights capture the baby's attention. It really does feel like a rainforest in there! I think the toys are great to bat at. There is a blue spinner thingie and a bead rattle thingie that is perfect. It seems to have more hoops to attach more toys on it than the others. My baby is just now starting to look at the pictures on the mat at 3 months. The hideous giraffe that almost made me not want to get this gym is actually coming in quite handy now. I hang several toys around the giraffe's neck for tummy time. I hang chains of links between the hoops for the baby to grasp. The mat is silky smooth and easy to wipe off and throw in the washing machine. It is sooooo light and easy to fold and carry it over your shoulder like a pocketbook. I haven't tried the other gyms out there but I wouldn't need to because this gym is awesome!
