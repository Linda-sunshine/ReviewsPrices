review/summary: My son loves his 'raffe!review/text: My son loves to chew on this. The play setting drumbeats are incredibly upbeat and fun! I do find the sleep (mother's heartbeat) to be a bit on the creepy raspy breathing side, but my son likes it and falls asleep to it easily. It also looks incredibly life like and has a sweet little face, it sits up so tall that it encourage my baby to lift his head to stare at it in the mornings,which is just adorable to see. The box had a wonderful presentation that it came in if you are into astehtics and something I wasn't expecting it came with a small booklet and adoption paper that I could read to my son. I am considering their night light turtle toy because of the quality of this.
