review/summary: Great toy!review/text: My daughter isn't at the walking stage yet, but she loves to stand up. This toy with it's walking settings is wonderful. I don't have to worry about it coming out from underneath her and her falling. She loves all the sounds, colors, movements, everything! It's overall, a great Christmas present.
