review/summary: Great organizer!review/text: I could never get my 3 year old to pick up all of the stuffed animals in her room until we purchased this product. The hammock is a &#34;bed&#34; for her stuffed animals and she picks all of the animals up and puts them to bed. GREAT product.Good quality and includes mounting materials. Super easy to install.
