review/summary: Nice booster seat...review/text: It was a little smaller than I had expected, and I realized that I, a clean-a-holic, was going to have a tough time with all the straps on this chair. The baby I watch keeps reaching down and grabbing them with her messy hands.. :) Other than that, I think it works very nicely and the plastic parts on it are pretty easy to clean.
