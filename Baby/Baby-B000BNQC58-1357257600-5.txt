review/summary: Fun after darkreview/text: Now that we're in full winter mode, I'm constantly looking for things that my kids can do after 5pm, when it gets dark here. This lady bug provides great entertainment for my 5 year old and 2 year old. They dance, they invent games, they play "camp out" in the bedroom.Two features I wish the toy had: a timer option that would automatically turn it off after a certain amount of time, and some sort of rotation feature. That being said, it's a great toy and I'm hoping that the light bulb won't run out as quickly as some of the other reviews have stated!
