review/summary: Best gift idea for almost anyone under 8review/text: I saw this in use at one of my friend's houses, and I had to get it for my 3-year-old daughter. These are the COOLEST things - I would halfway consider buying one for myself! The entire bedroom ceiling lights up with stars and the moon. It is mesmerizing. They are the perfect gift for any kid, boy or girl. I can't recommend this enough.
