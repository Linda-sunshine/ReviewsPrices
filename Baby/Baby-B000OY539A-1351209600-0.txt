review/summary: Waste of money!review/text: I read such great reviews on this product, and I was really excited at the idea that I could carry my baby and breastfeed discreetly and hands-free! Unfortunately, learning to put it on and having the time and space to tie the damn thing was ridiculous. As a new mom, time is non-existent. I needed something that I could put on and just go! In the end, I reverted back to my Baby Bjorn carrier. My suggestion is to ask around, even try a few out before purchasing if you can. Save yourself the waste of time and money to see if you will actually use the thing. Gonna be posting mine on Craigslist now.
