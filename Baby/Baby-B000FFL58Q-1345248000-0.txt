review/summary: This gym is amazing, and a lifesaver!!review/text: My son used this gym pretty much since he was born until he was 9 months old and could crawl and stand! HE LOVED IT. I cannot stress enough how much of a lifesaver this thing was. He LOVED everything on it, especially the monkey. I personally found that it had plenty of toy loops to add your own, and all of them were filled. He would spend up to an hour even as a young baby just playing or napping on this gym. He loved the little extras on the floor of the gym, like the lions tail that sticks out, and the leaf that crinkles. He also REALLY loved the lights at the top of the gym, especially on the setting where they were synced with the music.I didn't have any problems with the mirror falling out (sounds like that one was faulty...) but I do agree that the way the mirror hangs does not face the baby. The EXTREMELY EASY solution to this problem was just to add one of those plastic toy links that your probably already have a million of. Problem solved. Also loved that it was super easy to clean. Even when my son was older and could sit, crawl, and pull to standing, he would pull up on the gym and stand there playing with the toys hanging down, or crawl and sit under the toys. I was surprised that we got such extended use out of this (we finally put it away sometime after he turned 9 months to make room for other toys)
