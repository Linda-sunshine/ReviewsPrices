review/summary: Diapers are diapers?review/text: We just went with the same diapers that our hospital had used. This diaper has a "wetness strip" that allows you to know if the diaper is wet or not. This keeps you from unnecessarily from changing a perfectly good diaper. Diapers did well keeping the wetness where it belonged (inside the diaper). You just want to make sure you do not have too many diapers. Our child grew faster than we expected, so we had to cancel the "subscription" feature before the second box shipped (we had received some diapers as a gift).
