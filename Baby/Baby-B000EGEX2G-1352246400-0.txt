review/summary: nice piecereview/text: This is a nice rocking chair ... it is comfortable, the cushions are soft and easy to sit on for quite sometime ... i like the side pockets on the covering of the handles of the chair ... the ottoman is just at the right height for me ... all in all, a good buy ...
