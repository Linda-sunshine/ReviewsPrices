review/summary: Baby is leaking all of the time!review/text: We used the Pampers Swaddlers (NB and Size 1) prior to these. I ordered these thinking they were the next in the Size 2 line; however, our baby is constantly leaking and smells like pee immediately after a diaper change. We are going to switch back to the swaddlers and hope that solves the issue. They may cost a little more, but hoping they keep our daughter dry. Since she is only 13 pounds, there was no need to move her to size 3 as someone recommended. I would think twice before ordering the Baby Dry.
