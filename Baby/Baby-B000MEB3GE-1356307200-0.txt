review/summary: We use the heck out of itreview/text: We received this at our baby shower. When our son was born it was a life saver. Being our first child we hardly knew what day it was much less when the last time he was changed and/or fed. Our son is now 5 months old and we still use it every day. It's very easy to see when he was last changed by myself or my spouse. I would highly recommend this to new parents or even parents that are having there 2nd, 3rd, etc.
