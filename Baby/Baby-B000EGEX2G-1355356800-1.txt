review/summary: Waste Of Moneyreview/text: I bought this chair for me to rock my daughter in and was looking for something sturdy since I breastfeed and wanted something comfortable, as I would use it often. It looks nice when put together but the pads are just tied onto the wood and the sides on the arms do not stay snapped. The padding on the bottom is also very thin making it uncomfortable to sit in. Not only is the chair very uncomfortable but it was broken within 6 weeks! It started squeaking and all the screws in it became very loose. I am NOT a big girl by any means! I weigh 125 and this chair is supposed to hold up to 250 lbs. Right now, the back of the chair is getting ready to fall off and the left arm of the chair has broken completely. I am still using it until I can find a new one, but it seems like any second that thing is just going to collapse. I will end up throwing it out before I get a replacement. This chair is certainly not something I would EVER purchase again or recommend to anyone. It looks nice once it's all put together, but the quality is just not worth it. If you are looking for a nice, quality rocker, spend the extra money and get a better one. This one is cheap and cheap quality. You get what you pay for! I will end up spending more now when I replace mine than I would have if I just would have gone with a nice one to begin with!!
