review/summary: Good, solid wipesreview/text: I usually cloth diaper, but was on vacation so I purchased these after doing some research. You can't really expect any disposable, pre-moistened wipe to be completely chemical-free and environmentally friendly, but these are a good option. They don't smell great, but it's not bad either. If you have to clean up a diaper mess then it's going to take 3 or 4, but that's the same across the board.
