review/summary: Nice idea but could be betterreview/text: I got this at my baby shower and was excited but that died quickly when I realized that it has some flaws.Pros:1) Different brightness settings2) Actual constellations3) Cute!Cons:1) No option for how long you want it to stay on, like the sound soothers by Cloud B2) The lights are stationary, which doesn't always keep baby's interest for longOverall, I like it and so does my son but some improvement could be made and if it broke I wouldn't purchase another.
