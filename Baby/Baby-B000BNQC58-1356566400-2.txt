review/summary: Wonderful!review/text: We are so glad we opted for this original Night Light, rather than the newer ones that seem to be selling everywhere. It truly lights up the entire ceiling with a calming array of stars and a moon. The blue is a bit bright for sleeping, but the green and gold/orange do have a calming effect.We used it inside our son's Tipi (also a Christmas gift) and he drifted off to sleep under the stars.My 14-year-old would like one!I definitely recommend for kids of all ages!
