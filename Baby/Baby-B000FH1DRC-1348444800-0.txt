review/summary: Best diapers out therereview/text: According to the 3 different Pampers reps I spoke with, as of 2012 no Pampers Swaddlers from NB-3 have dry-max. It's only when you reach size 4 is that added.With that done, I've been a swaddlers fan since my LO was born and they have never disappointed me. If you get leakage or blowouts, the diaper is either too big or too small. Going up or down a size fixed that issue every time for us. They also hold so much liquid it's ridiculous! I've removed diapers heavier than softballs after a solid 9hrs sleep with NO LEAKS!Still the best deal out there too for the quantity and quality.
