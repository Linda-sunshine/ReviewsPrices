review/summary: Excellent productreview/text: These walk through gates are marvolous ! I have 2 here at home and one at work. They are easy to install, dogs are not afraid of them, they actually listen better behind these gates than baby gates. There is no jumping on these gates or climbing over as you have with baby gates. I have 2 - 6 1/2 month old German shepherd pups and 2 adult cocker spaniels. They all heed the gates ! Watch the video.... No need for the added step unless you want it. They install in minutes.
