review/summary: Accidentsreview/text: Overall a great toy. My son loves all the lights and sounds and colors BUT he was using it one day with the slower speed and in his excitement to be standing on his own he started bouncing up and down and the wheels slipped out from under it and he fell flat on his back. He was not a very happy camper
