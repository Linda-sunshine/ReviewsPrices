review/summary: Poor quality and uninterestingreview/text: I bought this for my almost 4-month old, mostly based on its favorable reviews. However, I was disappointed when it arrived without a working rattle. There must be one tiny little pen-sized ball in there, and it makes noise only if I vigorously shake it - can't really justify this as a &#34;rattle.&#34; Also, while it is easy for little hands to graps, my baby holds it for about 5 seconds before losing interest. I've been retrying for a month now, and she still hates it. Waste of money for me.
