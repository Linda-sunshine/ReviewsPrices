review/summary: Great potty chairreview/text: Our 2-year-old-son is being potty trained using one of these chairs in each of our bathrooms. He's very large for his age, around 40" tall and 37lbs. He fits on the chairs with no problem, seems very comfortable on them, and they have been working great for us. They're very easy to clean, and the splash guard is useful, although it's not a substitute for gentle reminders to point the, erm, "hose" down when he's sitting down to pee. The grips on the bottom seem to work well on our tile/vinyl flooring. Definitely recommend.
