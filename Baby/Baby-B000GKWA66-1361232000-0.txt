review/summary: Fabulous for getting the little one to calm down and sleep!review/text: This is a necessary addition to our family. It is so nice to have a white noise function, so I don't have to say &#34;Shhhhh&#34; for hours and hours. The two first sounds are great for entertaining baby, the white noise helps calm baby, and the 'womb' sound is good once the baby is calm, and it helps baby fall asleep. It's also easy to attach to the crib or put on the stroller or take along in the car. I would recommend this to any new parent who'd like to give their voice a break and keep baby calm.
