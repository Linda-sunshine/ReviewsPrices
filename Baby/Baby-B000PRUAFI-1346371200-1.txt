review/summary: Great deal!review/text: Love this gate! I am curently pregnant and watch 4 kids during the day. I needed a gate to put up so the little ones would stay out of our kitchen. I bought this one because it opens and closes and I don't have to step over it. Which would not be easy the further along I get. It is made of very durable metal and looks like it will last a long time. The price is awesome, too! Amazon never lets me down!
