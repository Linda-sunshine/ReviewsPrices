review/summary: fabulous giftreview/text: was a shower gift & was met with great appreciation & surprise, the mother had not ever seen one of these. the battery pack was not hard to install. it is an adorable stuffed animal. the sounds it makes are great. the straps are inconspicuous: they don't take away from the giraffe's cuteness! i would highly recommend this little guy.
