review/summary: Better Diaperreview/text: I used hugggies when my daughter was newborn and had a lot of leaks. However, my sister's baby was much smaller than mine and did better with huggies. In my own assessment with friends...it seemed the bigger babies did much better with pampers. This is probably not the case for everyone, just my own observation. I love these diapers and would never consider switching to an off brand.
