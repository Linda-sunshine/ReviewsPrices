review/summary: Cool Item, Wrong Fit For Usreview/text: I received this item through Amazon Vine, and while it is a very cool, well made item, it just didn't fit our nine month old quite right. The bar that goes across is as such that anytime she'd sit up even a little, the plastic items on the plastic bar would hit her in the face. When we took the bar off, she would lean as far forward as she could and have the thing about tipping forward. For the record, I think it's designed so that it can't tip all the way forward, but it had us nervous nonetheless.If she were a little younger and not yet sitting up and wanting to walk, I think it would be great match for us. Or, if she were a little older and content to sit in it as a rocker, it also would have been great. For us, though, because she's pulling up, she's not really happy in it in either the recliner or the rocker stage.That being said, it was a simple item to put together, very pleasing to the eye, and I thought it was well made. The transition from infant to toddler rocker is easy. My only complaint is the bar that, for my daughter, was right in line with her head when she tried to sit up. Again, though, this is more a circumstance of her particular growth stage than anything.
