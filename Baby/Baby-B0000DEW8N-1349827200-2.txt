review/summary: Great Product!review/text: I'm glad I didn't spend the money on a large high chair for my 8 month old. I have already taken this chair with me out of town and to grandparent's houses, and I am pleased at how portable and light weight it is. It so easy to use and doesn't take up any space at all. My son and l ove this product!
