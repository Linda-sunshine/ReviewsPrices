review/summary: Worth every penny and then somereview/text: My husband bought me this for Christmas, and at first I thought it was probably not necessary... I was wrong! The bigger I get and the more my back aches the more I appreciate this pillow. It is the only thing that gives me relief after a long day, if you are experiencing pregnancy aches and pains buy it you will have zero regrets!
