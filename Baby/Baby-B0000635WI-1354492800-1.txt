review/summary: Good for Sleeping and Loungingreview/text: I went looking for a prenatal pillow in my 4th month to alleviate stiffness and pain in my hips, lower back and abdomen that develops through day while I'm working. The pillow is great for arranging in different positions for lounging. For sleeping, I line the pillow along my back and use the bottom loop to prop my top knee a little higher. In one night, it's made a world of difference in my posture and discomfort. I strongly recommend getting the pillow case, which comes in a nice jersey fabric.
