review/summary: bestreview/text: I have always used pampers and have never been disappointed. I never tried any other brand but once i had to get huggies. however, i thought huggies was more coarse and my baby was itchy and uncomfortable in it. I immediately moved back to pampers. Its soft and absolutely perfect for baby's tender soft skin.
