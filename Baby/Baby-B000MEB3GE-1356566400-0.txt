review/summary: The ONE thing we could not live without!review/text: Highly recommend this product for new parents! It is great for night-time feedings....if daddy feeds her, I don't have to wake him up to ask when she's due for her next feeding or diaper change and vice versa...I just look at the timer. Very easy to use...just push each button to reset...also has a night light and extra timer...we use the extra one to keep up with any medications we give her so we don't overdose:) GREAT product and small enough, we take it in the diaper bag wherever we go!
