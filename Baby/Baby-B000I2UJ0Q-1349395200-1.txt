review/summary: jump for joy!review/text: we have this along with theFisher-Price Fold 'n Stow Swingand theFisher-Price Rainforest Bouncerso our baby would have some variety. the jumperoo is my son's favorite because he can see what's going on all around him and move freely. the sound is very audible, but not obnoxious. i loved watching my son discover all the features for the first time. he's just now coming into the phase where he wants to touch anything and everything. the frog liner is removable so it can be laundered, but it is quite the ordeal to take on and off (i always put a bib on my son before i put him in it). i would highly recommend this jumperoo to any new parent!
