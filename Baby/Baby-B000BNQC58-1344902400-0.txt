review/summary: Very cool; Twins love it; Works reasonably wellreview/text: This was a 'long shot' because I figured, for the money, would it really work, well?Surprisingly it does! And our twins love it.Strengths:* produces cool star-field (inc'd a moon) on ceiling and walls (on our 10' ceiling)* three colors: blue (great), green (ok), red (doesn't work so well)* appears to be safe for toddlers to play with* LED lights, so I figure batteries will last a while* good value for the priceChallenges:* as others mentioned, red doesn't work very well (not a big deal)* I think the ladybug itself looks funky (but kids love it, so ok)* rather than "constellations", its really just a bunch of stars (but still cool)* some folks complained about it not working close to a wall -- indeed it works best when simply placed or held in the middle of the room -- again, no big dealGiven the price I didn't expect much but was pleasantly surprised. My boy in particular just loves the toy ... we actually can't leave it in his room at night because he'll just get up to play with it. But we let the kids play with their light toys in a dark room as a break from daytime activities.This is a very clever toy -- considering the price, I consider it a great value. Highly recommended.
