review/summary: Swapping from pampers to huggies now!review/text: So after always being a strict pampers mom I finally am switching to huggies. Pampers worked fine for my daughter and did not leak at night but for my twin boys they seem to always leak. I thought I'd try the huggies because there was an amazon coupon in addition to the amazon mom and subscribe and save discounts....boys am I glad I tried them! Amazing nighttime dryness! And the closures work so much better too. I really hate I didn't try these out sooner.
