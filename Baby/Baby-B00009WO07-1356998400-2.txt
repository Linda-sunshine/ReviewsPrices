review/summary: Just as good as any diaperreview/text: After 5 kids, we used all kinds of diapers. While some store brands were less than expected, Pampers, Huggies, and Luvs were the ones that performed the best. As long as it holds in what it's supposed to hold in, I could care less what they looked like!
