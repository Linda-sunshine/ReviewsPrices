review/summary: Vibrates Loudlyreview/text: I like this chair for my son; however, it is it very loud when the vibrate mode is on. He currently weighs 16 lbs, and I hope it will be quieter when he weighs a little more. Right now I stuff a pillow under the seat so it will help absorb some of the vibrating noise. He seems to like the chair.
