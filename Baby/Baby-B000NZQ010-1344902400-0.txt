review/summary: Best walker ever!!!!review/text: I bought this for my boy girl twin at nine months when my daughter started to learn to walk. It definitely helped with her gross motor skills and was a great aid which made her walking experience more pleasurable. Her brother is just now trying to walk at 16 months and this has really helped with his confidence. Last night I did drills with this walker and this morning he's taking a few more steps. My daughter Stills loves the music and plays peek a boo when it comes on and they do occasionally fight for this toy. Great purchase!
