review/summary: night buddy and paci replacementreview/text: This turtle has been a lifesaver! I was trying to break my 18-month-old of her pacifier, and nights were not going well at all. After a couple of rough nights I showed her this thing, and she has been attached ever since. She was immediately entranced by the stars, and she snuggled with it right up against her nose so she could get a close look. She was in the middle of learning her colors so she likes to switch the colors and tell me what they are. She ends up putting the turtle in the corner of her crib and looking up at the stars until she falls asleep. No more crying for "Pa-Pa" (her pacifier). Now all she cares about it "Kur-kle" (turtle). So glad I got this thing!
