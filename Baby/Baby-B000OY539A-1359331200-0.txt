review/summary: Infant Nap Lifesaverreview/text: The Moby Wrap has been a godsend for my baby's nap times. While he sleeps well through the night, he's never been able to nap well on his own. A friend mentioned that she used the Moby Wrap for her children's naps. We decided to try it out, and got somewhat mixed results in the beginning.After getting a bit more experience with the wrap, we found that the most important thing was to make sure his legs were properly and comfortably folded underneath his bottom. Secondly, we've found that keeping the wrap looser works better for him to nap easily. I used to try make it as snug as possible, but found that this makes it very difficult to keep his body straight (which makes me have to keep my body in a weird position).Overall, this is probably one of the best purchases we've made for our little boy.
