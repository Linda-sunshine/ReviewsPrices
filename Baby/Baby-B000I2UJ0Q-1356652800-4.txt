review/summary: Baby loves it!review/text: I bought this for my then 3mth old. She was standing up on our laps a lot and thought that maybe she would love to have something she could play in while standing. At first she was a little hesitant with the flashing lights and music but before long she was jumping up and down and grabbing at the toys. She's tall enough that we had to move it to level 2, but she's not well... fat enough to fill the seat up, so we put a baby towel behind her. If we didn't, she would lay back and tuck her hands into the seat. She gets a little spooked by the hanging bird/frog sometimes when she bounces too high, but its cute. Great toy, so happy I bought it!
