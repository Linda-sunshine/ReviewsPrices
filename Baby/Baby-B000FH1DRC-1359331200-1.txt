review/summary: In Love !!review/text: I was put onto these from the hospital where I had my son, and let me just say 2 years later, and I have not switched yet ! These diapers are awesome !! They hold every mess in place and have not once leaked out on me !! They really show their full potential through the night ! My son sleeps on average 12 hours a night and I have not once found him soaked through the diaper come morning! And he eats a lot and his messes are not that little! Great product, worth every penny !!
