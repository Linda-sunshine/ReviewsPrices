review/summary: Pampers Baby Dry diapers don't hold nearly as much urine as Huggiesreview/text: Our daughter is 22 months and we just got a box of Size 5 baby Dry diapers. We can't use these at nighttime and we have to check her diaper frequently. If she drinks a lot of water, the urine leaks right out of the diaper.My wife had me order another box of Huggies Snug & Dry Size 5 immediately. We'll try to use these ones up, but when we run errands or go to church, we will use the Huggies.I do not recommend these diapers at all. It's not worth the $0.03 difference per diaper from Huggies. I gave it a fair chance and learned my lesson.
