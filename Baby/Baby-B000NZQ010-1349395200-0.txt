review/summary: Great Toyreview/text: I got this for my son when he just turned 1yr. This is a good product. Kept him entertained and he enjoyed the music/sounds it made. I think it also helped him speed up the learning curve to start walking. Be sure to keep a close eye on your child because some times if the baby pushes too hard on a flat smooth surface (my hardwood floor) it can slip and cause the baby to fall. I would recommend that the maker of this item seriously think of adding some resistance so it is not as easy to push. This is the only reason I gave it a 4 star and not 5.
