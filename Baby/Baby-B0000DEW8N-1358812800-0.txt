review/summary: Fantastic Purchasereview/text: This is fantastic! It easily straps to any kitchen chair. It also folds flat and you can throw it in the car when you travel. The tray washes off easily too. My only complaint is the tray liner has become really loose and my seven month old can pull it up off the tray. I no longer use it for that reason.
