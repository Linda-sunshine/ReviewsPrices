review/summary: perfectreview/text: This booster seat is really all you need for feeding a little one. Forget the big bullky high chair. This seat straps onto your kitchen chair easily, and the height can be adjusted as the child gets older until it eventually becomes a booster seat. It also has two trays, one with a cup holder that snaps onto the main tray. I don't have to wash the same one after every meal. I can start with the top one for breakfast, use the second one for lunch, and wash them before dinner. The trays are dishwasher safe, which is great, and the seat itself is easy to wipe down because it is all plastic. I like that my daughter can sit right at the table with the family. This is a great chair for saving space and money. The price is perfect and so is the chair. One of our must-haves for sure!
