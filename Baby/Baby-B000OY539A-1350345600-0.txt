review/summary: Great for newborns!review/text: Love the Moby Wrap! It was a great gift I received for my baby shower. I used it when my little one was about a month old and used it for about 4 months until she just wanted to be carried and not "put in a carrier". Even though I only used it for 3 months I would defintely recommend it! It was very easy to use and wrap once you practiced with it a couple times. There are a bunch of ways to wrap it, too.
