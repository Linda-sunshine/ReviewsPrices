review/summary: solid support, correct sizing (for me)review/text: I'm in my third trimester and starting to feel the pressure increasing due to my growing baby. I'm also very active and have been having some bad cramping and back pain after being on my feet for long periods of time, so I thought I would try this support belt. I like it a lot and it it seems to really help reduce the pressure I'm feeling. Not too sure how much it helps my back pain, but I'm sure it helps some. The belt is very comfortable for me as long as I'm standing and wearing it over my full panel pants, but my baby is not hugely fond of it as I can feel him squirming more than usual when I'm wearing it. He really doesn't like to be compressed at all (helps me to keep good posture though as he protests when I slouch). It's also not very comfortable when sitting or when worn against the skin. One note about sizing as I hemmed and hawed over what size to get: I bought the recommended size for my current weight and it fits great. I'm relatively tall though (5'9&#34;) and currently at 172 pounds at 32 weeks. I bought the small and am using it on the middle setting, so I have the option to drop down to the lowest setting as I get even bigger.
