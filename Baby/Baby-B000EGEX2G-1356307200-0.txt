review/summary: Absolutely LOVE it!review/text: My husband and I ordered the natural/blue rocker and we can't stop raving about it to everyone. It's incredibly easy to assemble. Took my husband about 10 minutes and he is the least &#34;handy&#34; person I know. It doesn't squeak and rocks smoothly. The color of the blue is just a tad bit darker than the picture but it's still a very beautiful, light, airy color. It fits the theme of our nursery perfectly.
