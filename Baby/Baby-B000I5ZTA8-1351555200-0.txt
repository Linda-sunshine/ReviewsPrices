review/summary: Runs a Little Big?review/text: I read all the other reviews before ordering mine, but I ended up ordering the size as listed by the manufacturer's chart. I'm 5'8" and pre-pregnancy I was a slim size 8 tall, with hips. I gained about 60 lbs with my first pregnancy, dropped all but 10 lbs within first six months post partum. Then, got pregnant again. I am currently 34 weeks pregnant with baby #2, have high amniotic fluid which means my belly is very heavy, but have gained just 7-15 lbs this pregnancy so far. However, ALL of the weight is in my belly, so I definitely needed more support to stop the feeling that my belly may very well fall-right-off-my-body.I ordered a size Medium, since the majority of the reviews listed say to order UP. I thought I'd be safe ordering a Medium thinking I'm on the very low end of the size guidelines. The chart says to go based off your CURRENT weight, so I figured I'd order this size and possibly have a little more room to grow in the next few weeks.I am currently wearing the cradle and it is barely small enough. I have it on the smallest setting, but I wish I could tighten it maybe one or two settings tighter. I should have ordered the Small. I wear the cradle on the lower part of my bump, with the back of the cradle about two inches higher, nearly at my natural waistline in the back. It is offering some relief, but I believe it would be more relieving if I had ordered a size smaller.I agree with a previous reviewer that the cradle is more comfortable if you hook it, then shift the hooks to the side instead of wearing the hooks in the front of the belly.SHIPPING: It wasn't supposed to be delivered to my house until Thurs. I got it Monday in the middle of a hurricane. Very pleased it got here so quickly as I was really suffering from the heavy belly.
