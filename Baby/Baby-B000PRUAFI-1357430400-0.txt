review/summary: Nice gate, well made, narrow openingreview/text: Purchased this gate based on reviews to replace an automatic closing gate from Muchkin that fell apart at the hinge. The assembly of the gate was simple enough and I just used a magnetic torpedo level to make sure it was all plumb and level. It opens easy enough and stays open if you want it to with a very smooth feel to the hinge. I had to use the extensions to fit in our opening. This gate does have a more narrow opening than the previous gate that we had in its place which is why it receives 4 stars vs. 5.
