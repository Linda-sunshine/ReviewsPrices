review/summary: Great product, hard to sizereview/text: I initially ordered a medium based on previous customer reviews about the sizing. It fit but was too loose to actually offer any support. I returned it and reordered a small. Yesterday was the first day I wore it all day, on my feet, at work and it made a HUGE difference. My back pain was barely there by the end of the day.The item has 3 different sets of hooks to adjust to the proper size and allow for room to grow. It would be very helpful if they posted some sizing recommendations in inches instead of just weight. I'm 5'9" and carry weight ALOT different than someone who is shorter.
