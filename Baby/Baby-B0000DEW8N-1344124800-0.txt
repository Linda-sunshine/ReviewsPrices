review/summary: Great Booster seat!review/text: I bought one for my daughter and myself since I watch my grandchild a lot. We love this booster seat! The reviews for booster seat products helped a lot in making my choice. It's great for parents without a lot of room for a regular highchair and for grandparents who need to store a highchair when not in use. No tools are required to assemble, the booster height is adjustable and it sits securely on our dining chairs. I like that the trays are dishwasher safe. When he no longer needs the "highchair" it's still a great booster for sitting at the table. We've had no trouble with the way the tray attaches or detaches as I've read in some of the reviews and we feel he sits safe and secure in the seat.
