review/summary: Simple in the very best way.review/text: Everything is so easy! There are instructions but you won't need them! Each part of the tray snaps on and off easily and intuitively. The mechanism to extend the legs is also super easy and intuitive.Easy to wipe down. Minimal crevices for food to get stuck in.This thing is awesome. I store the trays in my kitchen and just snap the green chair back down after my daughter eats. This way the chair still fits right under the table like my other chairs.I love it.
