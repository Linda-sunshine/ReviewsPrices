review/summary: Great Buyreview/text: We got this for my sons 3rd Bithday. He loves stars and this was an instant hit. We have had it for over 2 months and haven't needed to replace the batteries yet. It's small enough that my son can carry it, but large enough that it supplies plenty of stars. The blue and green lights show up great, the red lights aren't good at all. That is my only complaint. We are purchasing one for our daughter for Christmas...she wants one so bad!
