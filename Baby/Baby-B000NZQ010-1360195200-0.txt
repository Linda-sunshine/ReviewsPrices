review/summary: Fun toy, but a couple of flaws.review/text: We bought this for my son to play with and also to work on sitting to standing. It does have a lot of great interactive options on the front, and he loves pulling the phone off, flipping the gate open and shut, and playing with the shapes. It is a fun toy for him. But a few drawbacks of the toy - 1. the "low" volume is really not very low. 2. There is not really enough of an angle between the legs of the toy so it's hard for him to pull up on it. 3. When on "music" mode, each item you touch makes a sound, but if you touch something else, the first sound doesn't stop, and so on. It's hard to learn cause and effect if there are 5 things making noise at the same time and he doesn't know which is which.
