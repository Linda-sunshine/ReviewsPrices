review/summary: Not sure if it is BPA Free - It matters because your child WILL chew on it!review/text: Pros:+ colorful, cute and makes a slight noise when shaking it+ light and easy to hold for babies+ so far no safety hazards+ small enough to b put in the diaper bag+ durable, hasn't broken yet after 5 months of usageCons:- time consuming to clean- BPA or Phalate free? - still not sure. It matters because your baby will definitely want to chew and bite on it- bleeds colour? - I read in some reviews it bleeds color when washed, thank god this did not happen to me. I use a bottle detergent to clean this toy once a week. so far haven't had colors bleed.- odor? - when i received it, it had a plastic smell to it as some reviewers have noted, but after several washes it went away.overall cute toy but not a must-have.
