review/summary: Won't buy any other brand!review/text: I have tried store-brand, Hugs, Luvs, and Pampers and I will only buy pampers!! They seem to work so much better than other brands do. My daughters (now just over 3 months old) always seems to have leakage problems with any other brand, but the Pampers always work great! They also feel a lot softer than other diapers, and she rarely leaks out of them (even when she sleeps for 9 or 10 hours in a row).
