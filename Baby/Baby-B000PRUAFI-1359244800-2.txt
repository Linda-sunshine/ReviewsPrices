review/summary: Built Baby Toughreview/text: I bought this gate for my 10 month-old daughter. Assembly was straight forward and not very complicated. The gate is very sturdy and the metal is solid and not flimsy. When taking the gate out of the box, and setting it up for the first time, the gate will not close. Make sure you tighten the grey square screws with the wrench. After tightening the square screws, the gate will eventually close. Just don't over tighten the gate may not open. The only downside is the price, but the quality makes up for it.I highly recommend this product.
