review/summary: As many wipes as we go through as parents, you might as well save the earthreview/text: These wipes smell good, are sturdy without being rough, and (very importantly!) don't dry the skin. I can use these on my 2 year old's face after meals and she doesn't get hit with that chemical smell. Until they can make a sanitary post-consumer-all-recycled wipe, these non-chlorine bleached wipes are the best choice for cleaning your kid without being totally planet-destructive. I also like how they get shipped- in resealable refill packages with no wasteful plastic film binding them together. Just 12 packets loose in a box that's no bigger than it needs to be. Thanks guys, this has made one thing about parenting easier.
