review/summary: Great Diapers, Great Pricereview/text: With 2 babies, we go through a lot of diapers. I found the Pampers Baby Dry diapers to have just the same quality as the other Pampers, but the price was so much better and the quantity is greater. My babies stay comfortable and dry, and the subscribe and save feature through Amazon enables me to get a great price without the added hassle of always looking for the best deal at a regular store. Having the regular delivery set up is a real convenience for any mom!
