review/summary: THE BEST wipes!!review/text: they are the perfect thickness and I love that they aren't all connected together for when you have only 1 free hand (and then all of a sudden end up with 10 wipes stuck together when you only need 1 or 2). we use them not just for changing diapers, but for wiping dirty fingers and faces after mealtime. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!
