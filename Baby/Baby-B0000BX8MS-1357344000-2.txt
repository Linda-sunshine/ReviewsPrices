review/summary: Love this productreview/text: We love our sleep sacks. We like the flannel sleep sacks as it allows our baby to stay warm without us having to turn up the heat over 72 which is too hot for us. This way everyone is comfortable. We use this for naps and sleeping through the night. We started to use the sleep sacks when our baby would break out of his swaddle which was around 3 months. The first three months swaddling was great and then we transition to this product. This product has also held up to the washer and dryer without falling apart or shrinking. I recommend having two on hand in case of spit up or diaper accidents during the night.
