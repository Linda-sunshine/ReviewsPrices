review/summary: not for all babiesreview/text: I was introduced to this baby carrier by one of the instructors at a prenatal education classes that I attended who raved about it. I decided to buy it and try it on my twins because it was less expensive than the other baby carrier styles. My babies didn't take to this carrier and didn't like being placed in this at all. Putting it on was a pain too. Ended up returning this and now have a BabyBjorn carrier.
