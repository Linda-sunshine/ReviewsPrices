review/summary: Gave my baby a rash!review/text: We had been using pampers sensitive swaddlers since birth but when baby hit size 2 figured we would use up the pack of size 2 baby dry's we recieved as a shower gift..well within the first day of use my baby got a horrible diaper rash!So bad that her skin is bleeding and cracking :(..They even feel cheaper...way more of a plastic type feel to them. I do not reccomend!
