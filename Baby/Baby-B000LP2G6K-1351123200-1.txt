review/summary: Perfect for our new granddaughterreview/text: Like another reviewer, we got this for when our new granddaughter spends the day with us. It was really easy to set up, even with the added time of reading the directions, which are clear and well written. One of the things that led me to choose this one is that I'm just 5' and having to reach into a full-sized playpen is hard, but the depth on this is just perfect. I don't think anyone else mentioned that there are wheels on one end, so if you want to move it around the room, etc., you just lift the other end slightly and you can roll it anywhere you want. It seems really well made, the price is excellent and I can't wait for baby Emma to try it out!
