review/summary: Highly recommend, my son loves it!review/text: I bought this Jumper based on the reviews, and I am very happy with the purchase. It arrived as promised, was easy to put together, and my son loves it. I like that it uses smaller batteries, I dont like to have to buy cases of C and D batteries for all of the toys....My son will spend 30-60 minutes in this once or twice a day, and I am grateful. He often doesnt even need the music on. I will definatly be keeping this jumper for our next child.
