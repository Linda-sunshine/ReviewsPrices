review/summary: It really is Jumboreview/text: First off, I was a bit worried when I ordered this. I read some reviews of people saying that they could only get a few stuffed toys in this thing, or that the animals fell out of it easily. Well, I was relieved when I recieved it. It holds my daughter's bazillion stuffed toys no problem. Now my only concern is that we are over the weight limit of 20 pounds, but the hooks were placed into studs and the thing is holding strong. To the people who say they can only put a few stuffed toys on there before they all start to fall out, the only thing I can think of is that there wasn't enought slack left in the hammock. If your kids have a ton of stuffed toys and you are tired of having them in a box or on the floor, then I highly reccomend this Jumbo toy hammock.
