review/summary: Would give it 5 stars if the case wasn't unfit for human contactreview/text: I am 19 weeks pregnant and bought this to help with the back pain of pregnancy. The shape and design of this pillow is great, and night one I noticed a huge difference in the comfort and quality of my sleep.Now the case. For $60+ dollars, I expect a decent case on this. The case is made of a cheap, really scratchy fabric that is really uncomfortable. I could not put my face on it. It irritated me that a pillow at this price point would have such a useless cover that no woman in her right mind would ever sleep on.So now I'm torn between dropping $30 on the Leachco "plush" cover, or just making my own. Given the quality of this cover, my guess is that Leachco's definition of "plush" and mine are going to differ. Substantially.
