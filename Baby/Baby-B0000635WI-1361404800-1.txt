review/summary: it works :)review/text: I was experiencing shoulder pain from sleeping on my left side, as is recommended for pregnant women during their 2nd trimester. My hips were having a hard time of it as well. This pillow really helped a lot. The only thing that happens sometimes, is my left knee begins to ache - I put another smaller pillow underneath and that does wonders. I also purchased a wedge for my tummy - I look like a cocoon of pillows! It really helps me stay on my side - before I would wake up kinda dizzy and find myself on my back - this helps. I've had it for a month or so and it retains its shape. The only complaint I have is the pillow cover is HOT - I wish it were made of 100% cotton. I found a replacement cover made by the company that is 100% cotton and it cost $30! I thought that was kind of rip.. bringing the cost of pillow to a whopping $80? ... but I'm most likely going to splurge and get it, because being pregnant and super hot at night is not comfy. I still love this pillow though. :)
