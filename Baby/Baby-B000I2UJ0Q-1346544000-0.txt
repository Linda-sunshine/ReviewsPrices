review/summary: Jumparooreview/text: My daughter began to enjoy her jumparoo between four and five months. She likes the lights and enjoys sucking on the floppy bee toy. She loves to stand, so this is one of the best ways to keep her entertained if I need to set her down for a few minutes.Edit - I felt the need to add that at 6.5 months, my daughter was no longer entertained by the jumparoo. She preferred to move around on her own and didn't like being restricted. Because of the short duration for which it entertained her, and the relatively large price tag, I'm reducing my original rating.
