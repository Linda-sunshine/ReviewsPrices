review/summary: Perfect Gift and Toy!review/text: Purchased for my neighbor who is not walking yet! This toy is great because it comes apart and you can take it with you, lay it on the floor or hook it to the walker anf he can practice walking then when he wants a break he can play until he is ready to try again.
