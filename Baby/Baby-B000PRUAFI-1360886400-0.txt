review/summary: For kids and dogs!review/text: At first I wasn't really sure if I liked the way you had to open this gate, but after a day of use it's second nature now. There is a small button on the bottom side of the knob that you push/slide while you pick the gate up and swing it open. It just seemed too small and uncomfortable. However, now it's not a problem at all.Wow, is this thing tight! The only pressure mounted gates I've used in the past were the type with the bar you pushed down. I was always turned off by pressure mounted gates because they just were a pain. This thing feels just as tight and secure as the gates you screw into the wall. Amazing! Especially in our old farm house that still has door jams in place between the living room and kitchen. (Why would anyone want a door there?)Dogs and kids are kept secure, while my 8 year old has no problems with this gate. My 1 1/2 year old hangs on the gate and it has no problem staying secure.My favorite part is that the gate easily swings in either direction and closes then latches behind you as you pass through. Just push it open a little farther and it will stay open. Comes with a couple extension bars for the wider door ways. We didn't need it. Installation was easy. We didn't use the "cups."A+ purchase and VERY fast shipping.
