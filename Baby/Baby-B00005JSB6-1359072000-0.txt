review/summary: Huggies Snug and Dry have worked the best for our toddler boysreview/text: Our boys are 2.5 and 3.5 years old. They have used a few other brands at times, but Snug & Dry has contained most all messes the best. The extra leg elastic, the absorbancy and the back eleastic have allowed for very rare leakage. The only gripe I have is that sometimes the diapers have a rough bit of padding just below the waist band and I do not think that it would be very comfortable for them while lying on their back to sleep or during long car rides. I have brought this up with Amazon and they were going to speak to Huggies about it (especially important in the night time diapers - up to 12 hours in the same diaper with rough spots against their skin would not be good.) Amazon was great about refunding or giving credit for the rough/stiffly lumpy diapers.Huggies Snug and Dry are the best diaper for the 1-4 year old age range though! (However, I'll be glad when they are potty trained!)
