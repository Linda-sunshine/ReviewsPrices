review/summary: Great for newborn, not so great for heavy babyreview/text: During the first 3 months my husband and I loved our Bjorn. It was so easy to put on and our newborn was very comfy in it. When she got to be about 12 lbs though it started to kill my back (though my husband still liked it). When she reached 15 lbs I ditched the Bjorn and went for the Ergo because I needed the hip support. Bottom line: this is a good carrier but don't expect it to be the only one you'll ever need!
