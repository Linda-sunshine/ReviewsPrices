review/summary: Pampers works bestreview/text: We have twin boys and we go through diapers very quickly. We've learned that between Luvs, Pampers, and Huggies, Pampers has the best leak protection. Other store brands have inferior leak protection as well.No, I'm not employed by Pampers, they're not paying me for this review, and I have no agenda that I'm trying to promote here. I'm just trying to share with other parents what works well for us.
