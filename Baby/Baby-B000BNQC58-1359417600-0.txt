review/summary: preciousreview/text: our family loves these and thinks they are super cool! the turtle's body is soft and the shell is plastic. When turned on they shine light through the plastic shell and project stars on the ceiling in a dark room. It is pretty neat!! Even if you choose a green turtle body, it has the ability to light up in three colors (blue, amber and green). We own the purple turtle as well and it also can be adjusted to display those colors despite the shell color.We only bring these out at night time and allow our kids to play with them gently as they are unwinding. We have them put them near their bed and not sleep with them. I only do this so that they last and don't get broken, probably being a bit over cautious, but I want them to last.I also like that the battery door is screwed in so that it can't be easily removed, and then covered with a piece of fabric so it isn't hard against a child's skin.I also noticed that some turtle's eyes are open and some are closed, so if that is important to you, you may want to double check how they will appear before ordering.Totally recommend!!
