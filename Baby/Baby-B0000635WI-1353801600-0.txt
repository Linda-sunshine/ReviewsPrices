review/summary: Sleeping is EZZZZZZZZZreview/text: I bought this product for my expecting wife. Before she had trouble sleeping when she is was 20 weeks. She would use close to 4 pillows just to try and get comfortable. When she had to get up at night it was a 10 to 25 min wait for her to find her sleeping spot with all the pillows. Now she loves the pillow. Great quality, and Ive tried it when taken a nap and can really understand why its great. She has been able to sleep better and faster which means I can sleep better and faster. If your an expecting father do yourself a favor and get this pillow for your expecting girl.Only problems are she could not sleep in all the suggested positions and sometimes her neck gets achey from sleeping on the same side all night. But she still loves her pillow.
