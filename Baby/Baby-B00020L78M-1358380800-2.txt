review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: I bought this for my seventh month old. It is large enough that she is able to crawl around inside of it. We are able to hang toys on the inside panels for added exploration. It is easily reconfigured for smaller rooms or different shapes. It also works well as a deterrent for large room openings that traditional baby gates cannot block off.
