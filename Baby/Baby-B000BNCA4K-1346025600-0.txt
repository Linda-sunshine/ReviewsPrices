review/summary: Questions about pthalate and BPA contentreview/text: We were given this toy and the Skwish as gifts. My daughter loved both (I've put them away). That said, I've looked at the packaging and the Manhattan Toy website, and cannot find any reference at all to pthalate and BPA content. I've emailed the company, Manhattan Toy, twice, asking them about the pthalate, BPA and paint content, but I've received no response, which makes me think they would rather not say. Their website says they comply with all laws, etc., but that goes without saying. Some toy companies voluntarily keep pthalates and BPA out of their toys.
