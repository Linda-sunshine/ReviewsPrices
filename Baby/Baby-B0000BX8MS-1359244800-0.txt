review/summary: Must have itemreview/text: We used the smaller HALO sleepsack when our son was born and swaddled his arms with the wings. It was then very easy to slowly start leaving his arms unswaddled at around 3 months of age. We have since been putting him in this sleepsack. He is comfortable, and the fleece keeps him nice and warm all night. The zipper is sometimes tricky to put together when he is squirming a lot, but with practice it gets easier.
