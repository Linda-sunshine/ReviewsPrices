review/summary: Our Daughter Loves, Loves, LOVES this Toyreview/text: We ordered this as a Christmas gift for our 9-month old daughter. She absolutely loves it. She's not yet walking so we set it in front of her, and she is entranced by all the sounds and lights. It's not so loud that it's obnoxious and has so many different options for their explorative minds. She has been busy playing with the shapes at the top and opening and closing the &#34;barn door&#34; as well as spinning the wheels on the bottom. We are absolutely satisfied with this purchase!
