review/summary: Awesomereview/text: Worked great as a bassinet easy to set up, Baby was comfortable and it was safe. Now that our son is older he uses the playpen still in good shape, Its nice to get multiple uses out of one thing. Over an extended period of time, totally worth it.. Just would have wished they had more color choices.
