review/summary: Buy it!!! with the extension for sure.review/text: We love this play yard. We have twins - one year old. We purchased this play yard with the two piece extension and it makes a very good size play area.The colored gates are great for stimulating the children and our children's developmental specialist loves it as well.The gate is very sturdy as the twins are learning to walk and use it to pull themselves up (19lbs and 16lbs), walk around, lean on and sit back down.We've been using the gate for about a month and have not had any problems with breaking when moving around. The sections are very sturdy and we have no worries about the babies moving them or being able to push them out/open at a joint.I would recommend these for anyone, and really recommend purchasing the extension with it.
