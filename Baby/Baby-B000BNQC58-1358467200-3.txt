review/summary: Snuggle Bugreview/text: I bought this lady bug as a slightly cheaper alternative to the dream lites all over tv. Both of my children requested them and I am very glad I purchased this instead! First off, they look amazing. The back is hard but it's looks very nice with the soft bodied bug. There are three color choices and it comes with a little book of &#34;constellations&#34; to pick out. I like that there is a moon and the rest are stars. It helps my little girl sleep in the dark, which is a BIG plus. She used to demand a light, and now she demands the lights be off for her &#34;dream lite&#34;.
