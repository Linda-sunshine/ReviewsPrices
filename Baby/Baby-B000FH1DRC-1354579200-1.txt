review/summary: Buyer bewarereview/text: I didn't think to check the reviews, because I didn't realize that by going to size three our beloved diapers would be anything but bigger than size two. Immediately out of the box the first thing I noted was the smell, which stays on the diapers even once out of the box. We will be trying to find a different diaper when these run out. Such a shame, because we really did love the swaddlers in the smaller (non-smelly) sizes.
