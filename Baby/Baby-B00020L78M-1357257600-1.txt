review/summary: easily 5 starsreview/text: This free standing,fully assembled,large[ with 8 panels] is worth its weight in gold. After your baby is getting too big for the playard/diaper changer,they can play inside the safe and strong confines of the Superyard. It will fit them and all their toys and you too, if you want to play with your toddler. Nothing to get hurt by,they can see out,and of course you can see in,they can even watch Sesame Street or Barney through the sections, Their items are kept inside the playard and not all over the room,plenty of room for toybox. Easily large enough for twin toddlers,it gives parents the chance to go into kitchen or bathroom for a short time and know the children are safe.Also could be used for keeping small to medium size dogs in the area you want them in. Can be used outside on camping trips and cleans easily.
