review/summary: Baby boy LOVES this!review/text: My almost seven month old loves this Jumperoo! He has been using it for a couple months now and it still keeps him entertained. It is something nice to have to keep him busy for 10 minutes or so while I get some stuff done around the house. He is always laughing and bouncing all over the place and soon as he gets in it and is now starting to fuss when I take him out.
