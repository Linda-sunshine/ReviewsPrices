review/summary: I bought it just for vacation. Don't regret itreview/text: As long as you add a Dream on me Mattress it's the only thing you need for a toddler's great night sleep.I bought it just for vacation since I couldn't ship or check my baby's current Graco playard, so Amazon flawlessly shipped to my destination. Don't regret it.Don't over expend in more advanced options, this model is fine.Also the color it's not that bad once you get used to it.
