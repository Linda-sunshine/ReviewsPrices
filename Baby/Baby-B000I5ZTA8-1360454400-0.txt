review/summary: Great purchase!review/text: Although this band is a lot smaller than most belly bands you see in stores and might not seem like it would support well, don't be fooled! it is worth every cent! I've been using it for almost 2 months now and whenever I forget to wear it, my back pays the price! It really lifts my growing belly and supports my body. I did order a medium, despite my weight/size, because of all the reviews and it was a good choice! The medium fits very well, and there is still room for my belly to get even bigger. VERY pleased with this purchase.
