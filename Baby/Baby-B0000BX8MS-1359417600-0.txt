review/summary: SIDS preventionreview/text: I've lost two nieces to SIDS,so this is a must for my daughter, I paid around $20 for a 0-6 month sleep sack at walmart, so I needed to replace her sack with a bigger size. Retail stores do not carry these!!! Thank you amazon, as a parent who is constantly worried about SIDS this sack came in a variety of patterns and sizes, it was even nicer quality than Walmart's, a very thick fleece, I bought the large size as my daughter is 8 months old, it is a little big on her, and I was worried about her head sliding down into the sack, but this was not an issue at all, the arm holes prevent this, i just tucked the extra material around her toes, never came up at all to cover her face etc like a traditional blanket, so she has plenty of growing room. This is a must for our children!!!!!!!!!!
