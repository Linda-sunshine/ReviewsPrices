review/summary: Good for babies, not toddlers....review/text: We used pampers almost exclusively when our son was born and they were great. Now that he is 1 I find that the sticker tabs come off too easily and he has too much pee for them. We have started using the Kirkland diapers from Costco and they are MUCH better...and cheaper!
