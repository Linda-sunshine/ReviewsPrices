review/summary: Great. Can't sleep without it now.review/text: Overall, I like this pillow. The reason I did not give 5 star is that the cover is not super smooth compare to my regular pillow case which was nice and thick Egyption Cotton. I ended up putting my pillow cover on this pillow for the portion that my face touches. It did not bother me much before, but now I put that cover, it's much much better. The top part which is for the head position is not too thick and I like it that way. The body part of the pillow is firmer as well as bottom part of the pillow. It did not deflate much which I like. I would recommend this to my friends.
