review/summary: Affordable and easy to assemblereview/text: I am 37 weeks pregnant and was able to lift and assemble this playard by myself. It is light, with minimum assembly. It also comes with a duffle bag which makes it even easier to transport. The price is also fantastic. The pink camo pattern is tasteful. I would definitely recommend this product.
