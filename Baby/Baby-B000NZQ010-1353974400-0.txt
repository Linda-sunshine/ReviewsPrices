review/summary: best choice i madereview/text: I had done research before purchasimg this product. I was not happy with the products I had seen in action with other children. They were runaway trains when it came to the child pushing them and the item would tip fairly easy...this VTech has balance and duribility as well as the fact that the wheels do not turn freely.i would highly recommend this product, not to mention that my Grandson loves it. Added feature I didnt mention is that the learning actitvity pad comes off.Thanks VTech from a Grama X's 5
