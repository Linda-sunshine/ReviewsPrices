review/summary: It's "okay"review/text: I mistakenly thought this product had a walk-through gate -- it doesn't. It should. While you can climb over it easily enough, it's a little more precarious to do so while holding an infant. While each panel opens, it doesn't open easily at all, and certainly not one-handedly.It's also a real pain to fold up. The panels do not fold up easily. While they probably are difficult to fold so that it's sturdy for the baby, I'm sure there must be a better way to do it. It's probably better if it's a more permanent structure - we find that we want to move it and take it down from time to time, and honestly, we just end up not using it much because we find it to be difficult and inconvenient.
