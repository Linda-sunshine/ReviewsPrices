review/summary: Facing outward is awesome!review/text: I love this carrier. It feels very sturdy. I have used slings in the past and always felt the need to have a hand on the baby "just in case." With the bjorn I can use both of my arms and not worry. The reason I got it was that it is outwards facing. My son loves looking at the world and he can with this carrier. I would recommend this product to anyone having a baby.
