review/summary: Keeping it simplereview/text: When it arrived I was a bit underwhelmed by its simplicity. I guess I thought it would be more high-tech. Obviously I am not the target market. My 4 year old nephew adored it! Because it is simple he can work it by himself. It was by far his favorite Christmas gift out of a literal sea of Christmas gifts. He carried it around everywhere he went, and still does - a month after he got it. My sister says it is helping him to stay in his own bed at night instead of trying to sleep in hers. Wonderful, simple, sweet, useful, favorite toy.
