review/summary: The reviews were correctreview/text: After a lot of research we settled on this one, glad we decided to order this ( couldn't find it around us in any store). We had purchased another jumper and had received one of the jolly jumpers from a friend - both did not support our daughters neck and back like this one. I found that most had way to much room in the seat. It's a great fit and the toys are easy for her to grab and play with ( unlike the other one we purchased). She plays with all but the sun/ rainbow - but she may once she gets older she was 4.5 months when we purchased.
