review/summary: Excellent Idea!review/text: I really love this toy, and so does my baby! The best part of it's design is that no matter where/how she grabs it, she (at 5 months) never has an issue with grasping. The inner cube also makes a rattle sound. A really unconventional, but also really ingenious design. I can't recommend it enough!
