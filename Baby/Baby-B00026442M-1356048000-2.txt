review/summary: These have never leakedreview/text: We have 2 year old twin boys and sometimes it's just hard to grab them to change them. We have not had any problems with leakage, even overnight! Our boys sleep 12 hours and these diapers last! Plus they are very thin before being put on so you can stash a large number of them in a diaper bag. About 1/2 as thin as the Target brand and buy buying at Amazon with the reoccurring shipments they are cheaper (per diaper) than the Kirkland (Costco) brand.
