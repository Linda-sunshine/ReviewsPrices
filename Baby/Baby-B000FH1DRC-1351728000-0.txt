review/summary: Great Containment!review/text: Every time we anticipate that the situation down below is going to be too much for the diaper to handle, we are pleasantly (as pleasant as you can be in this situation! Ha!) surprised that the diaper has indeed kept everything contained. We have experienced any leaks and we even use them for overnight. Initially we bought one pack of every brand out there to try and this is the one we are going to stick with!
