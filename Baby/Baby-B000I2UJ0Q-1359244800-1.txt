review/summary: We love this thingreview/text: I recommend this to parents who are looking for a jumper but don't feel comfortable with a door-way jumper. I haven't used this but judging by the air-time my daughter gets I think if she could talk she would give it 5-stars. The chair has a swivel function so your little one can turn to face you. The only improvement I would make is that the fabic chair be easier to remove for clearing in case he/she throws up or slobbers on it.
