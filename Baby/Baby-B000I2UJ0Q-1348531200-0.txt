review/summary: Rainforest Jumperooreview/text: After searching for a Jumperoo for my baby nephew, 5 mths old, I decided on the Rainforest Jumperoo based on previous reviews. I was NOT DISAPPOINTED and neither was my nephew. He loves jumping up and down and gets very excited about all the different things going on ( the sounds, toys, movements, etc.) The seat is the cutest thing with the bright colors and the eyes which my nephew seems to find intriguing. Most of all, the seat is the right size, keeps the baby well protected all around as if hugging him, comfy but not too wide. Consequently, when he jumps he does not move all around the seat nor he gives the impression of being unsafe. It was easy to put together and can be folded for storage or to take with you on a trip (fits in car's trunk easilyl) Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
