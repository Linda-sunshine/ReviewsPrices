review/summary: Not worth it.review/text: I give it 2 stars for the 2 weeks i used it...my son was about 3-5 weeks old..Material stretched too much. Baby would sag in it after I used it once, Until I washed it again...Doesn't hold in head easily... I had to use my hand hold it to keep his head properly in place...so this wasn't a hands free apparatus.WAY over-priced.I don't recommend this... I do recommend the Bjorne... Used it with 3 children up until the were about 8 months. Then I moved to the baby backpack when they were a bit bigger...
