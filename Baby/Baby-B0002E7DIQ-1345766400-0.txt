review/summary: Does its job but it's pretty bigreview/text: This pillow works very well but takes up half of the space on a king size bed. Technically the wife owns that half, so, no biggie. :DMight be too big for a queen size bed.Also, would have preferred an easy storeaway bag or something, because you cannot just leave it lying on the bed and its too bulky to store in a closet. Hence the 4 stars.
