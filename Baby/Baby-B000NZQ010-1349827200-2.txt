review/summary: nice designreview/text: our son is beginning to pull up so i thought this would be a nice addition to his toy collection. i especially like the design of the agled face; many other similar toys are either flat on the floor and hard for a baby to reach all the parts/buttons OR too high up on legs and can't reach at all! the angled face allows our crawler to enjoy the entire toy until he can stand by himself.
