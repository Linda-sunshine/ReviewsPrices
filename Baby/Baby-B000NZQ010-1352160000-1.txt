review/summary: Obnoxious.review/text: I bought this for my 8 month old. It was fairly easy to put together, but the quieter setting is still pretty loud and the thing won't go more than 10 seconds before going off again without the child pushing anything. She still plays with it with the batteries turned off and likes to open and close the door and play with the detachable telephone. I was hoping for something she could interact with and play the piano, but am fairly dissapointed with my purchase. We still have a few months before she can use it for a walker.
