review/summary: Amazing!!review/text: This product is very nice to have I was afraid to get it but after thinking that it might be more comfortable for my little girl we got it. There are so many different ways to put her in it and she likes it and will fall asleep being in this. She hated the evenflo baby carrier that had all those buttons and adjustments it was very complicated to put on. I got the Moby on right with my second try and loved it right away. The kangaroo hold is the easiest to use though. Would suggest this product to anyone!!
