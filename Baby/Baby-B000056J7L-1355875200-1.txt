review/summary: BabyBjorn Potty Chair - Pinkreview/text: We bought this potty to train our daughter off diapers. At first she seemed like she was avoiding it. Then one day (just about 2 years old) she started asking to go to the potty by herself. It is easy to clean. It is stable. It is easy to move around the house and most importantly she likes it.
