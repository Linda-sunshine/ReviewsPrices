review/summary: The best diapers I've usedreview/text: My wife and I have used several diapers and these are hands down the absolute best. If properly used, these simply do not leak. We have no worries about leakage when using them and they are so easy to use. Our seven year old daughter is able to change the diapers, too. We will only buy these for our kids from now on.
