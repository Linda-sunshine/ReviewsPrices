review/summary: Peace of mind for momma!review/text: This is exactly what we needed. We needed to fence off a large around our L shaped couch configuration and this did the job perfectly. It is hard to tell the size from the photo but it's fairly big. It is pretty sturdy. My son has been trying to use it to pull to standing and the thing hasn't budged yet. Very happy with purchase.
