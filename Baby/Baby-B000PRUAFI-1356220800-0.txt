review/summary: Classy looking easy open gate!review/text: We are in love with this gate! We are using it between the kitchen and laundry room so the dog can stay there while we are at work and elsewhere. : ) (It's a big laundry room.) We got it just before the onset of winter which kept our sweet pup from spending any cold time in the garage. : ) We got the bronze color and it's so classy looking. Wish we'd had this gate years ago. : )
