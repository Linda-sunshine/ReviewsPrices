review/summary: The best one out therereview/text: I have looked at all of the projecting lights and this by far is the best one! It is bright but not overly so and the auto shutoff feature is great. I use it in a room that my 1 and 2 year olds share and they love it. Note that the blue is a more purplish blue and the amber is not near as bright. We use the amber color for a "barely" there light which works great when they are almost asleep or have already fallen asleep. The blue and green are definately much brighter and both of my sons like the blue the best.It's great because you can simply move the turtle around for either larger stars or smaller stars. When placed on my sons bed the stars cast the entire ceiling and half way down all 4 walls. Pretty good range! Well worth the price and such a hit at night. I could never get my 14 month old to go to sleep on his own but after purchasing the turtle he is out like a light.
