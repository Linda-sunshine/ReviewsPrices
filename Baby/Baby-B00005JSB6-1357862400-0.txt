review/summary: Leaks, leaks, leaksreview/text: I have tried Huggies in the past and should have known better. I can buy ANY other brand of diapers for my kids with no problems, but we always have issues with Huggies. I have tried these with all 5 of my kids and we have always had issues with leaking out the sides (especially overnight). I have learned my lesson and will not buy Huggies anymore.
