review/summary: Second pregnancyreview/text: I don't usually write reviews but thought I would for this. I love this pillow. I am 24 weeks along and started having bad hip pain from having to sleep on my sides and a body pillow was not working. This works great, I love that whatever side I turn in the middle of the night I have support on front and back without having to shift the pillow. I was worried about it being too big for my queen sized bed, but I have no complaints from the hubby. Fits perfect.
