review/summary: Greatreview/text: It keeps the mess most of the time inside even though we are pretty close to the upper weight limit. Recently we had few rush but only because it's getting too small for my son. We are just upgrading to size 2. Generally, I would recommend to upgrade as soon as the baby hit the lower limit of next size.
