review/summary: Great potty for potty trainingreview/text: This is an excellent first potty for a toddler as they are going through potty training. My son loves this potty and the color. He feels that it's his &#34;special potty&#34; and has taken to it very easily. The fact that it's &#34;his own&#34; has made potty training a breeze, as he loves the experience of going completely on his own on a poty that's his favorite cover. The little guard on the front ensures that there are minimal accidents and the plastic surface makes the potty easy to clean.
