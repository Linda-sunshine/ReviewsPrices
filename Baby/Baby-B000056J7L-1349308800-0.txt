review/summary: Great for my 19 month old son!review/text: I purchased this potty chair after researching and reading reviews for the most popular ones. I was concerned about comfort, how easy it would be to clean, and if the shield was tall enough so that my sonwould not pee overit onto the floor. So far, he loves sitting on his blue bear potty and has peed in it several times!! It is so easy to clean and there are no small crevices that would be hard to clean out. The bottom of the seat stays put on the floor and keeps my son from moving it all around the bathroom scooting it. It is small and fits great in our small bathroom, but still plenty big enough for my son who is 27 lbs and 33.5 in tall. He will still be able to use this potty for awhile! This potty chair is definitely worth the price and I would and have recommended it to friends! The only thing I would change about this seat would be to have all these same features but still come apart to have the seat sit on the big potty and be used as a step stool, but there are several seats that already offer that. I am so happy with this potty that I don't really mind that I need to purchase another seat for the big potty and astep stool. For now, this seat is perfect for my little one :-)
