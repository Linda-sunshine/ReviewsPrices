review/summary: Makes an excellent gift....review/text: I bought three of these for my nieces (9 and 7) and nephew (5) for their birthday's and they love them. They love looking at the Constellation Guide and looking for the stars. My son owns a Dream Lite and was over at their house and when he came home he asked for one of the Cloud B lights. Very pleased with my purchases.
