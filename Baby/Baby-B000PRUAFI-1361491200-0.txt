review/summary: Very Impressedreview/text: I have had the gate for only a week but absolutely love it. Its easy to open even while carrying my daughter and it locks automatically which is perfect. The gate is easy to assemble and unlike many other companies North States does not charge for extensions which is perfect. I would definitely recommend this gate infact I just bought 2 more of them.
