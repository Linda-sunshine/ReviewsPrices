review/summary: No Better, No Worse than Other Carriers on the Marketreview/text: I purchased the Baby K'tan carrier when my daughter was about 3 weeks old. She was fairly fussy and wasn't soothed when I put her in the Baby Bjorn carrier that I had used with her older sister. I thought that she might do better in a sling-style carrier since she could be in a cradle position close to my body, rather than dangling in a kangaroo-like position in the Baby Bjorn. Indeed, the first time I put her in the Baby K'tan (she was screaming her head off at the time), she drifted right off to sleep and stayed asleep for several hours. However, when I tried to use the K'tan a second and third time with her, she wasn't having it! I tried her back in the ol' Baby Bjorn after several more attempts in the K'tan and she was soothed after all. My conclusion, it's not really the type of carrier itself, but the baby's mood. Both carriers worked with her on occasion and both didn't work on occasion. What I did like about the K'tan was that it WAS easy to put on, especially compared to the Moby wrap (also a soft, sling-style carrier) that I had tried with my first daughter. I watched a quick You Tube video on how to use the K'tan and mastered it in a jiffy. I did find that I needed to adjust the baby in the K'tan often to keep her head from slipping too far under the fabric. As far as comfort for mommy, I found the K'tan to be just OK. I find that ALL carriers take a toll on my neck and shoulders, but that was probably a bit more true with the K'tan as compared to the Baby Bjorn. Overall, I would say that this is a good carrier, but if you're looking for a better solution in terms of comforting your baby, I don't think you will find it in the K'tan. If you're buying it because you like the Moby wrap concept, but want something that's easier to put on, I would recommend the K'tan.
