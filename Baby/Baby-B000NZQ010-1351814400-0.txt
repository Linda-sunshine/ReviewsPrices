review/summary: Great learning and great fun.review/text: Out of all the toys my children (now 2 1/2 and 11 months) have ever received, this is their/my favorite. It helped them get around the house during the transitional stage between crawling and walking. My 2 1/2 year old still sings the songs from it and my 11 month old dances like crazy to the music. He loves the ducks and their peek a boo. Yes, both of them fell and tipped a few times walking with this. It's all a part of learning to walk. Kids are going to fall regardless if it's from a toy or standing against a couch. Just keep an eye on them with this toy around sharp furniture and they'll be okay! Both kids used this toy indoors and outside and it still looks brand new.
