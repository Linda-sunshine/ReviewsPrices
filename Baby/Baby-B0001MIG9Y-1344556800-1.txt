review/summary: Great Diaperreview/text: I love pampers....they have always worked so great for our son. This product does state protection for up to 12hours and it did work that way until my son was about a year...but then he started leaking thru the diaper. So we had to move to the Pampers Overnights which do work much better. Still highly recommend.
