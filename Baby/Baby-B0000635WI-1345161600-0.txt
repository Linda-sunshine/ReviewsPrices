review/summary: Worth every penny!review/text: I am 5 months pregnant and I decided to give this pillow a try after reading all the great reviews. I am so happy I did. I am finally sleeping better. I tried a normal body pillow but it was not helping. This pillow makes it easy to switch sides. Also my arm doesn't go numb in the middle of the night. I cannot say enough good things about this pillow.
