review/summary: very comfortable and stylish, not espresso thoughreview/text: This was very easy to put together, i assembled it in 20 min with no issues. It arrived on time with no damage to the product. I use it everyday at least 5 times a day and it's very comfortable, the seat cushion is a memory foam type material. The fabric is very easy to wipe clean and seems fairly durable. Only complaints i have so far is the color is very dark brown- almost black- and so does not match the brown espresso in the rest of my nursery. Its not a huge deal to me, it still looks good and is stylish, and really is not that noticeable unless you look closely. The other thing is every once in a while something will squeek, but its usually only one time, so i dont know if things are just shifting around, or if i need to grease a hinge. All in all, i'm very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend this glider and ottoman.
