review/summary: Baby Loves Jumperoo!review/text: My nephew LOVED this jumperoo! He would jump himself into nap time. The fabric is washable, and the seat looks like a cute animal face when you pull them out. Because of the time, energy, and durability of this toy, it was a Must have when I had my baby. COMPLETELY Worth the Purchase!
