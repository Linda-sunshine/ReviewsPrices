review/summary: Fantastic Multi-Use Toyreview/text: I highly recommend this toy. I got it for my baby when she was 7 months old. She loved all the fun sounds & different things she could mess with on it. I love that the face detaches so you can put it other places. I would often put it in my baby's pack n play so she could play while I was putting away laundry & stuff. It held her attention a lot longer than most toys she has played with. She just recently started using it as a walker. She is 10 month old now & loves using it to walk across the room. A great toy that grows with your child & can be used in many different ways!
