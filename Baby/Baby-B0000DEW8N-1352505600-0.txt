review/summary: ANOTHER WINNER FROM FISHER-PRICEreview/text: As grandparents, we bought this for use at our home for our 12 month old grandson who we see almost daily. It is very simple to put together and is very secure. It seats him at just the right height and the adjustments avaIlable will enable use for well into the future. We strap it to a chair which is dedicated for his use and can even use it to seat him at the piano to tinkle the keys as well as to cut his hair. Well made, portable and excellent value for money.
