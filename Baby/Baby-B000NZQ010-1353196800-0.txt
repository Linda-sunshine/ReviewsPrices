review/summary: VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walkerreview/text: My son enjoyed this as he was learning to stand and walk on his own. We also loved to take off the front part and play together without the walker. He is an experienced walker now who stilll enjoys playing with this, as does his 2 year old cousin.
