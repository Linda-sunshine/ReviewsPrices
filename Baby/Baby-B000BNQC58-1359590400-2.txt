review/summary: Great customer servicereview/text: My daughters (6 and 9) both love the turtle, but the company's great customer service is why I'm writing this review. The blue LED light started going bad after about 6 months. Cloud b quickly sent a FEDEX label by e-mail so we could return the product. Two weeks later a brand new turtle arrived. No charge. Buy with confidence. The company stands behind its products.
