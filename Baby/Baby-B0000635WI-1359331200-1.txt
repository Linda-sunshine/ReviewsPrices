review/summary: Wife loves itreview/text: My wife is about 3 months pregnant and loves this pillow. She's about 5'3&#34; and while it's a bit large for her, she wraps herself around that thing every night. When it arrived a month ago she was apprehensive and did not use it, but after some time she began complaining about her back hurting every day and she began to use the pillow occasionally. Now she's hooked and doesn't complain of back problems any more! Now it's just everything else that hurts :)Not sure about using the J end for supporting a baby while feeding though. The shape makes it awkward to move around and I can't imagine my small wife being able to muscle it in to position while holding a baby. She complains if I ask her to carry a sack of potatoes, so baby + pillow? I don't think so. We'll probably have to buy a smaller pillow to support the baby for feedings.Also, buy it through Amazon! I ordered the pillow PLUS an additional cover a week before Christmas. Not only did it arrive on the 24th (with standard shipping) but the total price was still LESS than buying just the pillow at retail stores!
