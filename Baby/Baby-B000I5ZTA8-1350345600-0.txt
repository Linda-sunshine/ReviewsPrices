review/summary: Didnt helpreview/text: I bought the mini cradle because I was getting bigger and needed support to hold my growing belly. This didnt help much. Sometimes I thought I felt the support but it didnt last long. The belt also kept biting into me and that hurt. I felt it should have been a tad broader.
