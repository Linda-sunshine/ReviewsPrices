review/summary: So far its helping!!!!review/text: I just got this in yesterday and read many reviews before I purchased. So far, I am very pleased. One thing that I would recommend is DEFINITELY buy a bigger size. The size chart is WAY off. I am 21 weeks pregnant with twins and currently 152lbs. The size chart recommended a small, but after reading reviews i ordered a medium and glad i did. I am wearing the medium on the tightest setting and its perfect! Conceals nicely under clothes and very comfortable. Looking forward to seeing if it reduces my back pain over the next week:)
