review/summary: 2 Month Old Baby Loves Thisreview/text: I just love this infant to toddler rocker!!! I used it with my 3yr old who still sits in it to watch TV!! Now I started using it with my baby since he was born and now is 2 months old, he just loves it.. The bottom of the rocker turns into a bed which is so convenient when you need to put baby down to sleep, you just pull the bar out and it turns into a little bed. Not sure how the last comment about the child landed on it's head happened, but we have never had a problem with it since I used with my 3yr old and now my 2 month old. I felt more then secure with this product. I even bring it with me to my kitchen so I can see baby and he can see me while I cook. The colors on this rocker are very colorful which babies love and the toys are interesting enough. I just wish the song would play a little longer too. The vibrating is great to massage babies back which my little baby likes. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a newborn, infant, or toddler.
