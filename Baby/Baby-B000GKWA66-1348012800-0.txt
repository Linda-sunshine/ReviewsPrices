review/summary: Great for crib at baby's daycarereview/text: My daughter is addicted to white noise and (I decided) giraffes were here favorite animal. The daycare center won't allow us to play her white noise CD in her crib there so we bought this could B giraffe and attached it to her crib. The only sounds she uses is the white noise one (I think button 3) and it's worked great! The daycare ladies say that she always falls asleep facing the giraffe. She is used to napping in her crib at home with no noise except her white noise CD. Now that there are kids running around and making a lot of noise at daycare it was difficult for her to settle down and fall asleep. This giraffe has helped a lot! I gave it 4 stars, because the other noises are annoying. We only like the white noise one. The safari one is too upbeat and the heart beat is kind of annoying too. There is one other jungle sounding one that is OK. I wish it had more soothing sounds.
