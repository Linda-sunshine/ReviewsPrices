review/summary: Great buy!review/text: I got this for my 11 month daughter... And its one of the best purchases I've made. She always wants me to hold her so it was hard to get things done around the house, but after I got this for her, I put some toys in there with her and she plays while I get things done. It's very easy to set up, I got 2 extentions to make her space bigger. It makes my living room look colorful, but what can I expect with a Baby around the house :)
