review/summary: Just Okreview/text: This was not an amazing addition to our nursery. The product was OK, it didn't dazzle. The motivation for this review is durability. Somehow my 18 month old, while exploring the turtle, managed to pull the soft stuffed part away from the shell. I didn't think that would be an issue.
