review/summary: Amazingreview/text: This bouncer has been a life saver! my boy friend is currently working away from home, and cooking dinner or cleaning was so hard to do trying to entertain him. But once I received the bouncer I would move it to whatever room it was in be it the bedroom, and even the kitchen so I could get work done. And he LOVED it, he could bounce in there all day and night, it is simply his favorite toy! it has also made his little legs so strong! I would tell any parent that this is a must have item for keeping a baby entertained, the lights and music he likes, and he loves reaching for the frog and bird!
