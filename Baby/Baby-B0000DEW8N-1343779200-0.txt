review/summary: Don't think we'll need a high chair. Ever. Be careful though when putting the trays together.review/text: We have been using this for our 6th month old at home and at restaurants. He sits in it just fine and it is super easy to use and clean. One of his favorite activities is when I put baby puffs on the tray and he will grab them and try to feed himself. Due to the tray *most* of the puffs will stay on the tray and not end up on the ground.One word of warning though, be careful while putting the upper tray on if your child is already seated with the lower tray in place. I accidentally snapped the white upper tray onto the lower blue tray when my son's fingers were resting on the lower tray because he was already seated. He cried but thankfully it wasn't more than that. In the future I will snap the two trays together FIRST before attaching it to the booster.
