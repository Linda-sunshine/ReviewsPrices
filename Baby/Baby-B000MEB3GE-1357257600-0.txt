review/summary: Good Ideareview/text: I got this for my baby girl. I had two boys before her. I really loved this idea, because my oldest was pretty unpredictable schedule wise and I kept records for him on paper. I thought this would be very handy, especially with a few care givers in the household to keep track of things. She turned out to be a VERY easy baby and was like clock work so I never really needed it. Gave it to a friend.
