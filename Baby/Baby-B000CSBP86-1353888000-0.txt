review/summary: Very Helpful to get around!!!review/text: This carrier is comfortable, even for a new born. My son is only a few weeks old, and able to sit in the carrier while I do stuff around the house. I was concerned that he was too small for it, but its adjustable to suit your needs....I'm looking forward to using it in the summer when he gets a little older as well. Also the material is very sturdy.
