review/summary: Shipped fast, easy to assemblereview/text: I ordered this chair for the nursery and it looks great and is very comfy! I was surprised at how easy it was to assemble (which was minimal)...basically just putting the chair back & sides on and then attaching the cushions. It's sturdy and a good quality for the price!
