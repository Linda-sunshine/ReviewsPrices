review/summary: Cheaply built, overpriced, daughter loves itreview/text: First off, the positive- our daughter loves this thing- a key component of her "settling down and falling asleep" process. It makes a great night light and goes off by itself after awhile. She can identify one or two constellations, but don't expect much in that regard. It mainly looks like a bunch of stars on the ceiling and walls. Orange isn't very useful and quit working shortly after we started using it. She likes green the best.But it gave out after two changes of batteries. After putting in the third set, it just wouldn't turn on anymore. I guess I expect better for the price. It should last longer. I'll leave it up to readers of this review to decide whether that expectation is reasonable or not..
