review/summary: Oh My!!!!review/text: I saw that I get to write a review for diapers and jumped on it.Everyone has a brand and opinion. Shy of using brown paper bag diapers or the organic cloth diapers (which actually harm the environment more than these diapers due to laundering), all diapers will serve their purpose. If they are cheap, you change them more frequently. The gal that said her child's clothes get soiled easily, might want to change them more often. We've had mishaps with even the best of diapers.Bottom line, whether its number one or two, Pampers Dry will do! Even better if you have Prime membership.
