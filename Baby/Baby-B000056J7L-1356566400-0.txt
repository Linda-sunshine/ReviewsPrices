review/summary: EXCELLENTreview/text: We've had this for 2 years now and its an excellent product. My son is 5 already and he still using it because its in his bedroom and he doesn't have to go all the way downstairs to pee if he doesn't want to since there is no bathroom upstairs. I love how I can just remove the insert and take it down with me on my way down, its small enough it can be rinsed out in the sink. So we use it long after he's potty trained its just a useful little thing, and portable if you need to take it on a trip or somewhere. My only regret is not buying it sooner. This would make an excellent gift for a baby shower!
