review/summary: Great for wrap-challenged babywearersreview/text: I am not new to babywearing, but I am new to using wraps. In the past I used a structured carrier and a sling. I wanted the flexibility of a wrap but, the ease of use of a structured carrier and I found that with the Baby K'tan.It is very easy to get the hang of, no complicated wrapping to learn or long piece of fabric to drag on the dirty ground.It is amazingly comfortable,I have tried several carriers/slings and this is much more forgiving on the shoulders and back.It is quite snug, but I found my 7 week old likes that and it keeps him safe and secure. The fit is proper if it is snug. I am 5'5" and about 160 right now (gained a lot of weight with my pregnancy) and the size SMALL is perfect. I wasn't sure if it would work because my impulse was to buy a medium but, after reading reviews and going on prepregnancy size I went with the small hoping it would work. I also plan on losing 20 lbs pretty fast and want this to still fit me. I would definitely lean towards the smaller size if you are unsure.I am very happy with the Baby K'tan and very thankful to have my hands free and baby is happy and I'm not sacrificing comfort either. Definitely a win-win!
