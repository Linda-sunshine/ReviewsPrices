review/summary: Pregnancy Bliss!review/text: This pillow is AMAZING! I am so happy I ordered it! I am currently 22 weeks pregnant (5 1/2 months), thin build, not big in the hip area, and have had trouble sleeping for the last week and a half. This is the 3rd pillow I have ordered since my 4th month and I finally got the PERFECT one for me! I love how you can put it in different positions to sleep with and it is so EASY to shift sides during the night because you are in the middle of the pillow. I may even use it to sit in/on during the day to relieve my hip and pelvic stress/pain. This may not be the pillow for all pregnant ladies, but I would HIGHLY recommend this pillow for the slim Mommy to be who wants a good comfortable night's sleep. Love it! Love it! Love it!
