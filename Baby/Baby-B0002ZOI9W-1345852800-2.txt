review/summary: Great Infant Seatreview/text: So far I am very happy with this seat/rocker. My 2 month old is happy to sit in it and I like having her off the floor when I am playing with her. I also have a 14 month old who loves her little sister but doesn't always understand how to be "gentle" so it is nice to have the baby in the seat rather than on a play mat on the floor. I like to use the rocker to help sooth the baby but love that the kickstand comes out to stop the rocking when my older daughter is around (she rocks it a little too hard).This product also appears very sturdy. When my baby isn't in the seat, my 14 month old likes to play with it (put her dolls in) which includes leaning over the sides and putting a bit of weight on it. I don't see any reason to worry about it tipping over or being damaged by the way she plays on it.The music on the toy bar drives me a little crazy but my older daughter loves to play the music for the baby so it is a nice addition to the rocker. I could go either way on the vibration feature since my baby doesn't seem to care about it but I know it is good for many babies.
