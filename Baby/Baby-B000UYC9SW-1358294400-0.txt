review/summary: easy, quick, and magicalreview/text: It's easy to put on, quick to put baby in, and magical because my baby goes to sleep in the matter of minutes of being snuggled in there. I have accomplished so much more in a day simply by using the baby k'tan. My baby is 3 months old so I've only used two positions so far, but plan on using it for awhile. Just makes life easier when baby wants to be held 24/7 and you want to get things done. I'm 5 feet tall and about 100 pounds. The XS has worked well for me. I thought it was too tight at first, but if it were bigger it probably wouldn't work as well.
