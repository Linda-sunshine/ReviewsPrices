review/summary: Love itreview/text: I absolutly love these! They are the best value for the product.Safe, effective, and enviromently friendly,I know most Moms say just make your own with a roll of paper towels that is the more eco friendly thing and for your baby. But my thought on it is &#34;your using more tree pulp in the paper towels then you are on these baby wipes&#34;.I always get these when they are in bulk, I never run out.I also like to cut these in half for when my son only pees works great, you use less, still gets the job nice and clean. It only takes a moment.
