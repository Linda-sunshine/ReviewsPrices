review/summary: Very helpful and very handyreview/text: This product has been indispensable for us. It is easier than writing down times everyday in a notebook. Even my four-year-old daughter can help; she loves to press the buttons. I don't know why they didn't think of this sooner. The only thing, though, is I wish it had a feature where you could manually enter in the elapsed time. There were times where I forgot to press the button and like an hour had passed. I wish you could enter in &#34;1:00&#34; instead of waiting until the next feeding to reset. But other than that, this is going to be my shower gift for everyone.
