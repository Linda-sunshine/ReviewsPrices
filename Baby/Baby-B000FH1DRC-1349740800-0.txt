review/summary: Defective and low quality diapersreview/text: I bought pampers swaddlers because I thought these were premium diapers with the color changing strips but this latest batch has a bunch of leaky diapers. I have found my baby and her crib all wet because the diaper does not seem to absorb any liquid. I have come across many diapers in which the color changing strip does not change colors even when it is full. Either the quality of these diapers has gone down or I received a defective batch. Also, my baby never had diaper rash before; the diapers in this batch are giving her a diaper rash as well. I am going to be switching to other diapers after this batch is used up.
