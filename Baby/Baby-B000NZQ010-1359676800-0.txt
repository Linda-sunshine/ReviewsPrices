review/summary: Good for new walkersreview/text: This toy helped my daughter walk, but she only had interest in it from ages 9 months to maybe 11 months. Now that she walks by herself, she hardly glances at it. But it is a cheaper version of other "walking toys" and I think it has a lot of fun parts. I also think that she is just into walking and exploring now, and not so much into these types of toys.
