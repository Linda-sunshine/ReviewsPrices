review/summary: total lifesaverreview/text: After reading the other reviews, I purchased this for my son. At 3 1/2 months, he was a big, active baby who loved to practice standing and kicking, and had outgrown his swing. I thought this would help him get a workout so he would be tired out at bedtime. It's a great product. You are not supposed to leave your child in for too long a time, but it's great for when mom needs to grab a bite to eat, cook, or wash dishes. It was easy to assemble and easy to clean. Some of the toys seem less than entertaining for him. He likes the chewy bug toy, the rotating lizard toy with beads, and the spinning wheel toys. The other toys don't really interest him much. The real fun is in the jumping and bouncing. If you have hardwood floors, it's best to put some sort of socks or booties on the baby so they don't hurt their little tootsies with vigorous bouncing.
