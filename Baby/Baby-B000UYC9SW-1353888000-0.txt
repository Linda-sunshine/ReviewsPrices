review/summary: A must if you want to be a productive mama!review/text: I love my k'tan. I went to Costco today with my 8 week old and had her in it for about an hour. We've only tried the hug hold and kangaroo but my little one seems happy in both. It's very comfortable for both of us and I feel like I have my arms back! I only wish I'd had it sooner.The size definitely matters. Check the chart on their site. At 5'6&#34; and about 120lbs, the s was too big. I had to return it (which Amazon was awesome about) and get the xs.A note on Amazon: DSL apparently lost the package when I had ordered the correct size. Amazon refunded me the shipping and eventually sent me another. Customer service was awesome and made the whole thing much less annoying!
