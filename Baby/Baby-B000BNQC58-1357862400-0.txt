review/summary: dreamlite on a budget..review/text: I purchased this for christmas as well as a butterfly dreamlight. By comparison, this one has four buttons for color selection, dreamlite has one. They both turn off automatically. My 3 year old loves this and her 6 year old sister can't tell the difference. It's a great product.
