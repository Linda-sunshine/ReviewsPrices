review/summary: So helpfulreview/text: I ordered this produced during my 31st week and the only time I take it off is when I shower. I'm 38 weeks now. It has helped so much with lower back pain, ligament pain and whatever that pain is that feels like I was sunburned on the inside of my belly! It helps me roll over when I sleep (although that still takes a lot of effort, it's not AS uncomfortable as it was).I have not had any sizing problems. It has stretched with me as my belly has grown. I highly recommend this product.
