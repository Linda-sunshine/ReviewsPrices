review/summary: Useful, easy to usereview/text: I'll start by saying that this is a must-have to anyone ever traveling with their baby/toddler or even if you want to feed them in separate rooms and don't feel like carrying around the big chair. That's what we do. We keep this for when we're having dinner and she wants to join (she's 18 mo); also that's a way of keeping the little monkey out of our food:))) even if it's for a little while. That way she gets her own &#34;table&#34; (that she really loves) which is comfortable, just the right size, easy to clean and easy to attach to just about any chair. Highly recommended.
