review/summary: Comfortable, Safe, and Affordablereview/text: This is the second time I have bought this carrier and it is very good.Appearance: The color was good and the pin stripe white interior and the white piping makes it look classy. The size is not overwhelming and the overall look is clean and does not look outlandish.Comfort: The straps on the product are wide and padded and sits well on the shoulder and back and does not weigh down and bite into your skin. the padding and opening for the baby's limbs are good and the baby sits comfortably. The baby can be carried facing forward or facing you. The top flap can be folded down to let the baby see over the carrier or folded up to support while the baby is asleep.Ease of use: there are three anchors and the whole carrier comes off the straps making it easier to just leave the strap on. The bottom anchor is a sliding clip as is the middle one and very easy to use with the baby on or off the carrier. the stiffness of the carrier and the stiff foam padding makes it easy to put the baby in and take the baby out.the straps can easily be adjusted by pulling on them from the sides and bottom.A very well designed product which is easy to use.
