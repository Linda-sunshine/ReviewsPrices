review/summary: Quick to put on and baby loves itreview/text: I originally asked for the moby wrap in my registry and then returned it after a doula introduced me to the baby ktan. I also saw a video online comparing the two and was sold on the simplicity of the ktan. My newborn cries soon after I put her down because she wants to be held. This carrier is super quick to put on and keeps her cozy and warm. She falls asleep in it right away. Also gives me a chance to get things done by keeping both hands free. It is also convenient to nurse in while sitting down since I can also keep my hands free this way.Cons are that you have to order by size so my husband can't wear it (i was a size 6 pre pregnancy but even with my post partum belly the small was the right size). So we also have an ergo baby which is great but more cumbersome for just using around the house. Also with the ktan all the weight is really on your shoulders so it can leave you achey after a while.
