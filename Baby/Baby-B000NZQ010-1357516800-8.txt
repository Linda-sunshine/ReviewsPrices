review/summary: Cute toyreview/text: Really cute toy. I love that the wheels have two speeds. Level 1 is for little ones getting comfortable with cruising and learning to walk and level 2 for little ones with a little more confidence. The learning games and music are amusing to my 11 month old son. One of the shapes at the top does not stay in place but that may just be a flaw in our particular walker. It would be nice if the little phone was connected with a short cord like the shapes at the top. It would be much easier to keep up with. All in all...a good buy.
