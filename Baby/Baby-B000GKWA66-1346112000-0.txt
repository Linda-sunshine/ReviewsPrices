review/summary: It is great to have the rain soundreview/text: My wife was not too thrilled when I got this. Neither her nor my daughter cared for the sheep itself. The sound box on the other hand goes with us when we travel. It is nice to have the rain noise on in whichever room our daughters sleep in. Just a little white noise to prevent them from waking up when noises they are not accustomed to are made.
