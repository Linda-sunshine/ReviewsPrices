review/summary: Very Best Daiperreview/text: The diapers are good. As with other diapers we have used, you have to put them on tight enough so they don't leak. When used correctly they work great.These are the best diapers I have found anywhere. We tried several. They are very soft, fit perfect, and he never gets rashes with them. My husband LOVED the wetness indicator .
