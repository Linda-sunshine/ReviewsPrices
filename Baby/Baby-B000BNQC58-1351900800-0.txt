review/summary: So cute!review/text: I originally bought this as a gift and was going to return it but my daughter really liked it so i kept it. It's kinda cool cuz of the stars and it's different colors plus it was a pink ladybug! I like the timer on it so i don't have to worry about getting up to turn it off,that's a plus for me! I would recommend this product.
