review/summary: Gives Reliefreview/text: Works really well, has provided me relief from back aches and some round ligament pain.BUT -- don't go by their size charts. I got a medium but am much smaller than the weight recommendations they provided. When in doubt, go up a size. You're already pregnant and uncomfortable enough as it is; why squeeze yourself to death?
