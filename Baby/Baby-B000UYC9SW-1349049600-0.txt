review/summary: Great, easy-to-use carrierreview/text: I love my Baby K'Tan carrier, and so does my daughter, as she really likes to be held. I started using it with her shortly after we brought her home. Now, at one month, she and I are still loving it. Unlike other wraps I have tried, I was able to figure out how to use this one correctly right away. It only takes a minute or two for me to get my daughter into it in the kangaroo position, and then I'm able to move around hands-free. There are no long "tails" that drag on the floor. The only drawback is that because it does not tie, it's sized, and it's not really adjustable. As you wear it, it does stretch out, and it can start to sag a bit. I'm also sort of in-between sizes. I opted for the larger size since I figured that would better accomodate my daughter as she grows, but consequently, it can be a little loose in places. Nevertheless, my daughter always feels secure. I never feel like she's going to fall out of it, and I'm able to use the fabric to secure her head/neck as shown in the directions. When I wash and dry the Baby K'Tan, it goes right back to its original size. It'd be great if they could figure out some way to make it more adjustable, but it's really a minor concern. This is a GREAT carrier for busy Moms who aren't comfortable with the more complicated wraps. Highly recommended.
