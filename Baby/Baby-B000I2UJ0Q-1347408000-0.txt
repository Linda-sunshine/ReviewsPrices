review/summary: Center of funreview/text: My daughter is 6 months, and jumping all the time in my arms. When we tried out a friends jumper, we knew that she needed one of her own because she loved it so much. This activity center isn't the most engaging, but she seems to love it so far. The best part is that she gets to jump over and over and over again! She's a bit afraid of the music, so we leave that part turned off. The only negative is that it's such a large toy for our small apartment, and we only have enough space for it in our living room so we have to break it down if we want to watch TV.
