review/summary: keeps em occupiedreview/text: this is not for a first time walker unless on carpet. Got this when she started pulling up and cruising the couch. due to tile on floors it would get away from her and cause a fall but she quickly learned not to push just sit and play with it.After a month ... she was nonstop all over with this.
