review/summary: Better than average diaperreview/text: For the first few months of his life, our son had both colic and a sensitive diaper area. We discovered he HATED a wet diaper, and we had been spoiled with Pampers swaddlers at the hospital. It was so nice just to check for a blue line (which shows up when the diapers are soiled) and think, "Oh, he just needs a diaper change." I have continued ordering Pampers swaddlers because frankly, we just prefer being able to glance at his diaper and know whether or not it's wet. He's not so fussy anymore, so we will probably transition away from these in the coming months, but for now they still work well for us (he is 3 1/2 months old). My one complaint is that he does have a "blow out" in these about once a day, but I'm not sure it's the diaper's fault. In my previous experience I had worse luck with Huggies than with Pampers in that area. He's a breast-fed baby, so he tends to have messier and more frequent stools anyway. Overall, this is a good diaper and it's nice to get so many in one box. About a box and a half lasts us for an entire month.
