review/summary: Use the manufacturer's size guidelines!review/text: Around 33 weeks I started to notice round liagment pain more when I'd walk so I wanted to get a support belt for the remaining weeks of pregnancy. (Especially for walking and exercising) I read all the reviews on the sizing of this band- I almost ordered a medium based on what everyone was saying. But I settled on ordering a small. My pre-pregnancy pant size was a 0 but I've gained about 39lbs putting my weight on the low end of the current weight range for the small band. I'm now 35 weeks pregnant and wear the band on the smallest setting. This is my first pregnancy, so I'm not sure how much larger my bump will become over the last few weeks. The small does fit, but I sometimes think that I maybe could have purchased the petite because I feel like the elasticity of the band might become lose. Overall though, I'm happy with this product! I do enjoy the support it gives while I'm exercising, running errands or cleaning the house.
