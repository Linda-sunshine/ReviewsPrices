review/summary: Must Have!review/text: This is a true must have for infants three months to eight months+. Our daughter graduated from the play mat and we had no idea what to get her next, but ran a bunch of searches and came across this and the other jumparoos. Our day care also had a number of jumparoos, although not this one. In comparing them, the Rainforest wins easily.Yes, it takes up quite a lot of space.Yes, it is extremely colorful and won't go with modern living room decor (if that's where you place it, like we did).Yes, it only plays two types of music so you may tire of the sounds after a while.But the important thing for us is that our daugher ADORED it. She would happily sit in that jumper for an hour while I got ready in the morning, ate breakfast, cleaned up, and then played with her. She was typically happier in the jumper than in my arms for the first few months. In addition, there are a number of different "toys" scattered around the jumper and my daughter would cycle through them on her own. She really enjoyed the spinning aligator and both of the dangling toys (it took her three months to finally catch the tucan(sp) but WOW was she happy when she reached it!).Our daughter was about 24/25 inches when we first bought this and we had to place a game box under her feet so she could bounce. She's now about 27 and we've moved her into the second rung of sizing. I'd say she gets less joy out of the toy now as she finds it too confining, preferring to sit and crawl on her own on the floor. It was still very worth it for the five months if daily use.
