review/summary: Very comfortable!review/text: I was suffering from a case of lower backaches throughout my first trimester and a part of my second trimester until I started using the Snoogle. I tried experimenting using it in all the different ways that the pamphlet suggested but ultimately decided that the best position was for me to lie right on it, so that my upper back was comfortably cradled by the pillow. I felt really snuggly and safe lying on the pillow like that. The quality of my sleep overall improved, and I also noticed that my backaches weren't nearly as bad anymore. This was definitely a good purchase!
