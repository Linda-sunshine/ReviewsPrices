review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I love Seventh Generation products, especially the baby care products. They ate environment friendly and usually work really well, but these wipes were disappointing. They are extremely thin, so it's me 3 times as many wipes to get my little one clean. They are very small and have a very strange smell to them. Also, she has had mild diaper rash since using these wipes, and they were the only thing that changed. I only gave them two stars since they are cruelty free and vegan. Will not be buying these again.
