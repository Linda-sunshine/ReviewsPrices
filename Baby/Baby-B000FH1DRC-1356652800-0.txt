review/summary: pampers are wonderfulreview/text: These are great diapers for newborns because they have the indicator strip. They only fit my little one for a month, then we had to switch to a bigger size, I was worried we would end up with a ton of tiny diapers that didn't fit buying so many at a time. This amount was just right for our needs.
