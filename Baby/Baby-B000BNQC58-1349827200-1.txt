review/summary: All the kids wanted onereview/text: Started out 2 years ago buying this for my 4 year old. He loved it as a night light and loved how stars were projected onto the wall. Then his 2 year old brother wanted one for his room. One by one the cousins who came by also wanted one for their rooms. In total I have bought 5 of these and the young kids all love it.It's great as a night light and I like that it automatically turns off after an hour or so. I haven't experienced battery drainage as others have described, at least no more than what normal toys would use.
