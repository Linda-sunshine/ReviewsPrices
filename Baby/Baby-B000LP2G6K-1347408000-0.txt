review/summary: defective construction and poor design.review/text: This product arrived with one rail that won't lock. I don't know if I will take the trouble to send it back, but I will surely not buy anything from this company again and will advise friends or family likewise.All that said, there was one problem not related to the quality of the construction. The assembly instructions are on the inside floor of the playard. The first instruction is to raise the rails, the rails cover the floor. Honestly, the instructions are UNDER the first thing you are supposed to move. In addition the instructions are not readable once the rails are up because they are on the floor of the playard, too far away to see well enough to read!! My vison isn't perfect, but it isn't bad. I can usually read anything but the very smallest print. But I couldn't read the assembly instructions.I'll make it work because I need it NOW, but won't need it for long. Obviously I can't pass this along to anyone else once I am done with it. Maybe that was their intent.REVISION: Thanks to my sister, who had the same kind of playpen, I was able to get it to work right. So my earlier comments about the rail that wouldn't lock are hereby withdrawn. That doesn't solve the problem of the location and visibility of the instructions.
