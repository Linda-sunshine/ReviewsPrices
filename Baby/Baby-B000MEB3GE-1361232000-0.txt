review/summary: Easy to break the belt clip plasticreview/text: Haven't had a chance to use it with our babies yet because they haven't arrived yet. But within a few minutes of getting the product the clip on mechanism is already broken. The plastic that holds the metal clip in place is so flimsy it broke almost instantly. I barely put any pressure on it to open it and it snapped. I thought about returning it but doubted I would be using the clip anyway so I will just keep it as is. I will update my review once I have used the timer more. I gave it two stars due to the cheapness of that design.
