review/summary: People writing these reviews must be first time parentsreview/text: I have read a lot of reviews on here and apparently you are down grading a product over stupid things such as the wheels roll too fast on hardwood. Common since tells you well duh it is a hard wood floor the wheels are going to go faster. Note: it is made for a child 6-36 months. Why? Most babies walk at 10-13 months. The front detaches so your child can play. Not meant for a child to pull up on duh. So I find it a great toy. I am a mother of 4 and this is one of the best I have seen on the market.
