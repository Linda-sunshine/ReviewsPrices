review/summary: My daughter loved this for many yearsreview/text: We bought one for my daughter when she was born. You will get many years of use out of this. The red stars are not that bright, but the other two colors are more vibrant in the room. I like how it shuts itself off after a set amount of time. We like to give these for baby gifts.
