review/summary: Love It!!!!!review/text: I absolutely LOVE this carrier and so does my 3 month old son! It does not make my back hurt like my baby bjorn. My son is extreamly gassy and fussy and when i put my him in it he sleeps for hours! Definitely worth the money!Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Black
