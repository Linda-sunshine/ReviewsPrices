review/summary: Not as good as Snugglers. Leaks!review/text: We have tried several brands of diapers and different styles within the line from Pampers Swaddlers, Swaddlers Sensitive, Huggies Little Snugglers, Luvs, Kirkland and now these, Huggies Snug and Dry. Our favorites so far have been the Swaddlers Sensitive and Little Snugglers because it had the softest, cushiony quilt but they don't make them in size 3 and up. The Huggies Little Snugglers run a bit smaller than the Pampers Swaddlers. We've had rear blow-outs with all of these at one point or another but we've had the most with these Sung and Dry ones. The inner fabric doesn't seem to be as thick or as absorbent as the Little Snugglers and it is definitely not as well fitted. For breastfed babies whose poop is more runny, these don't work. They don't absorb fast enough and ends up leaking through the back when you lay baby down to change. Now we are off to try the Pure and Natural which a friend says is much better fitted and cushioned.
