review/summary: Great Diaperreview/text: This is a great diaper for daytime. But, lately my baby has been leaking at night.I tried a bigger size and that didn't work.My little boy sleeps on his one side and now I have to switch him from side to side during the night to avoid leaks.I think I am going to try one of the nighttime brands and see how that goes.
