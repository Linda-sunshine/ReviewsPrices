review/summary: Omg, this has been a life (belly) saverreview/text: I'm at 32 weeks now and my belly tends to get really heavy and uncomfortable so i decided to use this. It has definitely eased the pain of gravity that's been pulling on my belly but best of all, it helps to relieve my sciatic pain too. I walk around a lot for my job so this has been a life saver.In regards to the sizing, mine fit perfectly. For those that were complaining that the fit was 'too small', perhaps you just got the wrong size. Eitherway, Amazon makes it so easy to return so it shouldn't be a big deal.
