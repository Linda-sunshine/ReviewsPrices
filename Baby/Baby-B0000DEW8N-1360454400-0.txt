review/summary: Love it!review/text: We had a big high chair which was great, but we were finding bubby getting too hot sitting in there. We went on holiday and hired one of these booster seats and were amazed at how easy and practical they were. Very easy to clean. Now we have one the old high chair sits in the corner. Our bubby loves being able to sit closer to the table and it will be perfect as he grows. It's very portable so great to take away with us on holiday next time!
