review/summary: Neither durable nor solid enough as a barrier.review/text: We received the item 3 weeks ago to keep our 1 year old in particular rooms / areas. It has proven to be light enough for her to manipulate past and has broken at one of the joints. The thing that prompted me to write this review was the fact that my 2 year old just stepped on a shard of the breakage that was very difficult to see on our carpet. I wish I could show a pic of this shard as it is very jagged and large enough to wedge quite deeply into a child's skin yet small enough to choke on.
