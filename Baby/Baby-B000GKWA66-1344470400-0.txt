review/summary: SWEET GIFTreview/text: So I don't have kids but got this as a gift for my sister in law. This will be her first and I thought it was adorable. The volume control is great, has settings for 23 & 45minute timer, and the sounds are great. I'm excited to see which one my nephew will like the most. The best part is the sound box comes out of the lamb, so any child could have this as a cuddly toy and use it for soothing/settling pre-nap/sleep time for years. The lamb is adorable, its dark cream, super soft and lush, and slightly vintage looking. It definitely won't show dirt if it got dragged around the house with a toddler either. It looks much more expensive then I expected and is absolutely adorable. Better looking appearance wise then most toys/teddy's I've seen in stores.GREAT GIFT!
