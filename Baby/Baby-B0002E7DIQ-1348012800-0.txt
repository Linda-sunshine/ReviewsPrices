review/summary: Very helpful during 3rd trimesterreview/text: I was starting to wake up from bad back pain in the beginning of my third trimester. I bought this pillow and it's been great. I can sleep longer without waking up from back aches. I also plan on using it for nursing. I like that I can sleep on either side without having to adjust the pillow. Some reviewers complained about the seam digging into their shoulders. I did not have this problem. I'm 5'2" and found that the size of the pillow was fine for me. Seems pricey for a pillow but the comfort is well worth it.
