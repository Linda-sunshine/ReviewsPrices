review/summary: Much better (free) version available for iPhone--don't waste your moneyreview/text: I bought this product and used it quite a bit for the first 4 weeks, mostly for feeding. It has 4 timers (feeding, diaper, sleeping, and other),the clip is nice and it's small enough to throw in the diaper bag. When you are out of your mind tired, look at the timer and realize it's been 3 hours and that's a hunger cry, it's great. BUT...it could be so much better.Pros: Small, functional, has dim nightlight and nice blue backlightNeeds improvement: There is no way to track all the feeds or diapers, etc. from one day. The timer just resets and doesn't have a memory. For example, you can't see how many diapers you've changed that day or what was the longest time between feedings...you just know it was 3:15 since the last diaper, etc. It is waaaaay overpriced for what it is.So, I quit using it the minute I found the Baby Journal app on my iPhone by a certain formula maker. It is waaaay better (and free). It times the feeds, does R/L for breastfeeding or number of ounces for bottles, differentiates between wet and dirty or combo diapers, tracks the color of the poo and number of diapers in a day and number of ounces in a day, average time between feedings, etc. WAAAY cool and much more applicable. I am now able to graph the information to look for trends and try to put her down for naps if I know when she'll sleep and for how long, etc. Plus you can email the information from the app too. Made traveling for our 5-day trip much easier because I knew exactly how many diapers to pack.Bottom line: Overpriced but handy product for those without iPhones. The Similac product is 100x better (and free)!
