review/summary: Not as picturedreview/text: Be forwarned. Most buy this because we want something less like a white baby gate with lots of plastic parts. If you are looking for a less offensive home decor look, this AS PICTURED will lead you to believe you've found the answer. Its funcionality is great. Not too hard to install but there is a very ugly, bright white warning label that is 14" wide that goes along the bottom rail ON BOTH SIDES. Apparently it is required by law for safety reasons. I understand that when used for children. I am using 2 of these for small dogs so the labels s/b provided separately & up to the buyer to use or not use. My objection is that both Amazon & manufacturer photograph this with a clean bottom with no stickers. Even the box it comes in shows an all bronze gate with no ugly stickers. That is misleading. When I called the company, I was told the VP said "it was the law and can't be removed". My husband used a plastic pot scraper & Goo Gone Spray Gel. Good luck! That was the hardest work of all. Amazon should really not use the very misleading photo provided them by the manufacturer! Remember if you want this, PICTURE A 14" WIDE WHITE STICKER ALONG THE BOTTOM and picture it ON BOTH SIDES. Again it is a nice gate that opens both ways but it isn't quite like the photo.
