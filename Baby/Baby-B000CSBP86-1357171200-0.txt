review/summary: Must have...couldn't get housework done without it!review/text: The BabyBjorn carrier is phenomenal! It is definitely a must have around the house. My newborn loves to be held and cries every time we put her down. We put her in the carrier and within a couple of minutes she is completely calm and sometimes even falls asleep since it is so comfortable for her. I am able to continue to do housework, etc while still keeping her close and content. I would recommend this product to anyone.
