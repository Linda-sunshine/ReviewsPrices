review/summary: Sturdy, decent quality, kid enjoys itreview/text: This isn't the first product we've gotten from Fisher-Price, they are well known for their children and infant products. This one is no different. It is sturdy, and has quite a bit to do on it that my kid enjoys (especially the things you spin). He started using it at 3 months old (he's a pretty large baby), and loves to bounce in it.The seat height is adjustable so you can raise it as your child gets bigger (three height settings). It has an average footprint, so if you live in a smaller house it might take up a bit of space, but otherwise it should be fine. The product seems to be holding up well, and it was very easy to put together.
