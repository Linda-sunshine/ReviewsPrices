review/summary: Simple to Use and Adaptablereview/text: I purchased two of these (8 segments each) in an attempt to babyproof my kitchen and living room. I like that I can move them easily and reconfigure it in minutes. This is particularly useful when we have company and I need to designate a safe play area for all the children. It is also great to contain the mess!
