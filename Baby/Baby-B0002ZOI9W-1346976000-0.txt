review/summary: Great idea... poor executionreview/text: Although it was ridiculously easy to assemble, this chair wasn't an instant hit with my daughter. It only has one speed on it (rough and choppy), and apparently it doesn't work for her. It leans back so far that she can't reach the attached toys and that frustrates her. Hopefully she can use it when it converts to a toddler chair?
