review/summary: Simple design and easy to cleanreview/text: Have been using this chair for three weeks now and love it. My son is 10 months old and fits great in this chair. It also works great to place him in while I cook, he can watch whats going on. Its really easy to use and clean. The belts come off the chair to wash and the trays fit easily in the dishwasher.
