review/summary: Only brand I use!review/text: My son is 15 months old now and in the first few months I tried different brands. Once I started using pampers swaddlers, we have not gone back to using anything else.We have had no issues with leaks, it hold really well and the best part is the blue indicator telling you when the diaper is wet.
