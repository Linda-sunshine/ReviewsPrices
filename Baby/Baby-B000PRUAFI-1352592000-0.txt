review/summary: This worksreview/text: This gate is sturdy and easy to assemble. I have a shitzu who is an escape artist. He could jump over every other gate. Now, when I leave the door open to this gate, he goes in and out, and when I close it, he finally understands he has to stay put. He cannot jump over it and I can leave it up all the time.
