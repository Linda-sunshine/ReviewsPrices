review/summary: Love this product!!review/text: Ordered this chair in lieu of high chair for 8 mo old...Love it!! I think she could have used this even as six month old but we already had another "chair" we used for a limited time but she outgrew this. Great price. Only negative is she can pull off the white feeding tray herself...should have additional fasteners to prevent this.
