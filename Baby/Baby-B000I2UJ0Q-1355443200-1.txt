review/summary: Thank you for saving my arms!review/text: My baby is very large. (He was wearing 12 month clothing at 6 months.) He likes to be carried because I think the bouncing movement is fun for him. Enter this jumperoo. We got this when he was a little over 6 months and he took to it naturally. It was a lifesaver for my aching arms. Putting it together was a bit of a pain (in particular, putting the seat and connected the loops to secure the seat) but everything else was easy.Changing the height of the jumper is easy (we started at the lowest setting and moved it up a notch at 7 months). I suspect we will be at the highest setting in a month.Be prepared to wash and wipe down the jumperoo about once a week when your baby is teething.The red bird hangs down lower than the blue critter and that's nice because it teaches your baby to reach. I recommend using this product on carpeted floors or something soft. If your baby is like mine and a bit on the big, heavy size, he will jump with a lot of force.Our part-time nanny also cares for twins and she highly recommends this as a way to get a breather to eat!
