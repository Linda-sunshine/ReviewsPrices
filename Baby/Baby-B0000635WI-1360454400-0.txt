review/summary: Finally can sleep!review/text: This pillow saved my life! I am now 23 weeks pregnant but I think around 16 weeks or so, sleeping (and life in general) became so terribly uncomfortable that I was waking up angry and irritable. I kept stealing my partner's body pillow but he has back issues and can't sleep without that so then he would steal it back, and war was close to erupting.After a week with absolutely no sleep, I broke down in tears on my commute and decided I didn't care how much it cost, I was getting something to make me comfortable enough to sleep. I was overwhelmed with choices! I finally picked the Snoogle and I couldn't be happier! It works in so many different positions and supports my back and neck while also wrapping around for knee and belly support...omg its like magic.As far as space, we have 2 normal size (ok, 1 pregnant sized) people, 1 regular body pillow, 1 snoogle, and a 15 lb dog in a queen bed and its a little cozy but better than the alternative!The only reason this snoogle doesn't get 5 stars from me is because it doesn't come with a cover. It feels like every other uncovered pillow in the world (ie not soft and lovely) but for a $60 pillow, I feel like I shouldn't have to spend another $30 for a cover. Luckily I found a jersey cover on sale at Babies R Us for $15. Overall though, I can't imagine sleeping without a snoogle. If you're pregnant or someone you love is pregnant, this pillow is a necessity!
