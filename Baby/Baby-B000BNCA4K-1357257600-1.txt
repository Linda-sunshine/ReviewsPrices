review/summary: My 6 MO twins love this toy!review/text: We already have the Squish, and they both liked it, so I purchased this so they'd both have one to play with. Now, they both love this one. It's funny watching them trying to grab it from each other. It's soft for teething, the rattle makes sound, but is not overly loud, and all the loops make it easy to grab for little hands and fingers. I might have to get another one.
