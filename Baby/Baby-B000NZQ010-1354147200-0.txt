review/summary: Thank You Amazon!review/text: This arrived so fast. Normally it takes so long for items to arrive from out of the Country. I am in Canada.I bought this for my Grandson for his birthday and I know he is going to love it. It was so easy to put together. I also ordered it wrapped and it was sent in such an amazing jumbo gift bag made of velvet. I was able to build the toy for him and have it already set up inside the gift bag.
