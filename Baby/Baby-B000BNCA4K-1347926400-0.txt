review/summary: If you can only buy one toy, BUY THIS!!!review/text: My son LOVES this toy. Hands down, it's one of the best toy purchases we've made. In fact, he loves it so much that when the first Winkel (we call it an "atom," or the "interstellar communication device" in our household) was lost, we had to overnight another one to our house. Why my son loves it: this was the first toy he was really able to pick up, because it's extremely lightweight and the tubes are easy to grasp. He'd been getting pretty frustrated with some of his other toys--he was about 3 months old when he first really got interested in toys, so the will was there but not the strength or dexterity. But, since he could pick this one up, and it interested him--this is one of the ONLY things that'll reliably entertain him on long car rides--he kept playing with it. It's really, really helped him with grasping, bringing his hands together, transferring from hand to hand, etc.Over this summer (my son was born April 24), we--unfortunately for him and us--had to do quite a bit of driving due to a possible work-related relocation, family issues, etc. My poor son, who doesn't even like the car, had to spend a lot of time in it. He took his Winkel everywhere, and even started "talking" to it. That's how it got the "interstellar communication device" nickname--he turns it over and over in his hands while making these hilarious Klingon-esque noises at it. Well, what we noticed was, after a few hours of playing with the Winkel, he was suddenly able to pick up OTHER toys as well! It turns out that, in addition to being (apparently) a lot of fun, it really does seem to have some meaningful educational value. I also feel a lot less guilty about him having had to spend so much time in the car.This might seem like it's a little pricey, but it's NOT. If you can only get one toy, or if you're looking for a shower gift, etc, BUY THIS. My son is now almost 5 months, and he still adores it.
