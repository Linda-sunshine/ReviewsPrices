review/summary: Use every nightreview/text: My only wishes are that they would put a slightly bigger zipper pull on these so when squirmy baby doesn't want to go in I have an advantage. The fleece is perfect for winter. This is more of a celery green than a lime. Medium still fits 8 month old son who is in 9 month clothes.
