review/summary: Baby absolutely loves this thing!review/text: Our baby was 4 months old and almost 25 inches long when this was first introduced. On the lowest setting we had to put a pillow under her, but it was fine and she loves it! I can sit her in it for 45 minutes and she just bounces away! When she gets tired of bouncing, she just turns around and plays or chews on the toys. This is by far one of the best purchases we have made as new parents.
