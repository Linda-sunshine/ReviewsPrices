review/summary: simple gate, works greatreview/text: This Easy Close Supergate works great. I did not have a need for the included extensions in my bedroom doorway. Installation was a breeze. I use it constantly every day to keep dogs both in and out of my room. The best feature is the automatic closure. I walk in the room with my hands full and to have the gate swing closed behind me is prefect. It does make minimal metal on metal sound when closing but it's nothing annoying. At night, I close it with my hand to prevent noise from waking the room mate and I've never had any complaints from her. I don't use the lock function so I cannot comment but it seems very easy to use, just a twist and its locked.
