review/summary: New born diapersreview/text: I ordered these new born pamer diapers in advance so I would be prepared for when my baby came. To my surprise these diapers were a bit larger then the new born pamper ones the hospital sent me home with and they didn't have the stripe indicator that turns blue for when they have a wet diaper which is important when dealing with a new born. I havent used the diapers yet i ordered from Amazon because they r a bit too big for my new born, even though they say new born on the box and they don't have the stripe indicator..... I wouldn't recommend getting these new born diapers.
