review/summary: Baby Dry = Leaks!review/text: We tried Pampers Baby Dry on vacation and our had leaks at least once and up to four times per day! Our one year old baby is a size 3 and doesn't have any problems in swaddlers, cruisers or other store brand diapers. I couldn't believe how leaky these were!
