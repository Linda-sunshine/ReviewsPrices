review/summary: little guy loves it! easier to get aroundreview/text: not one for writing reviews, but this carrier is great. much easier to get around a busy place with the little guy in this and he loves being able to look around so it is a win-win all around. went shopping in the mall for the first time without a stroller and it was glorious! no having to bob and weave through people with a bulky stroller bumping into everything. i'm not sure i'm going to ever want to use the stroller again... very easy to use and the directions are simple. this may not be for you if you have back problems or have trouble carrying around your own weight. not hating, just telling it like it is...
