review/summary: Baby to toddler love!review/text: I got this for little girl when she was about 2 months old- of course, the rocking wasn't a feature she used then, but the vibration was a great useable feature. She would bat at the toys starting around 4 months, and within a couple months could grab the music ring. I thought around 10-12 months that I would put the chair away, then she suddenly started crawling in and out of it, bringing books and toys with her. She's 2 now, and still loves this chair. It's a great height for her still, as a skinny thing, she'll be well within the weight limits for another year or two, and I'll probably keep it out for her. One of the best plus' for me was that it breaks down so flat. I've actually taken this with me on a couple of trips- fits in the bottom of a suitcase easily and relatively flat, so easy to pack around. I had a conference when little girl was 3.5 months that my Mom accompanied me on the trip- it let my Mom get showers in the hotel to keep LG entertained and contained, and then a month or two later, went on vacation, brought it with us- let my husband and I relax a little or cook while she was cooing away in her chair. I highly recommend- it's been a great purchase.
