review/summary: A must have !!review/text: I loved this pillow it has helped me so much with the back pain and sleeping at night especially in this last trimester.The only thing is that the pillow is huge but its so worth having trust me you will want this on the last month pregnancy there are so many ways you can position the pillow to fit yor needs.I have a king size bed so its really not that bad.I think if you have a queen bed you will still be ok it will take up ur whole side of the bed.
