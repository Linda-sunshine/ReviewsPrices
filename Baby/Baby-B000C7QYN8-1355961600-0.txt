review/summary: The best wipes for sensitive skinreview/text: I have used Seventh Generation wipes for all three of my babies. I order them through Subscribe and Save. I recently ran out before my new shipment arrived, so I bought a package of Huggies Sensitive at my local store to tide me over. My three month old almost immediately developed a bad diaper rash. She had never had one before, so I tried some cream, but it didn't clear it up. I couldn't believe that wipes marketed for sensitive skin would do that. When my Seventh Generation wipes arrived a few days later, I immediately switched back. The rash, which by now had made her little area very red and almost raw, cleared up in one day! Less than 24 hours, even. I couldn't believe it! I promised myself I would never run out of Seventh Generation wipes again.
