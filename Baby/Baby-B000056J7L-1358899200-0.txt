review/summary: Great!review/text: This potty seat is perfect. My daughter is almost 3 so a bigger potty was necessary. I love the back on this as well as the splash protector in the front. Even girls can spray and make a mess! LOL My little girl picked out the green color herself and it's very pretty. It's easy and convenient to lift out the white part and pour the pee in the potty. The bottom has a good grip so it's not sliding all over the floor. Excellent product.
