review/summary: Alleviating Discomfortreview/text: I am in my first trimester and already suffering back pain. My husband's purchase of this product has helped out greatly.Take a night or two to get used to the unconventional shape. After that, you will find it helps with back or tummy support. It can be bent into a number of shapes for a variety of uses, including watching tv or sleeping with the infamous pregnancy indigestion.A word of caution, though. Definitely wash the cover on the pillow with some fabric softener before use. It is scratchy when it arrives. Also, it is a little difficult to put back on the pillow.
