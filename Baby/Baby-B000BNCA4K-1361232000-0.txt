review/summary: GREAT for little hands.review/text: I bought this after seeing a 6 week old playing with one at my post-partum yoga class. I was like, &#34;My 6 week old can't grab nuthin'... :( &#34; Well, that was because I didn't have any toys good for teeny tiny hands. I don't think a little baby could *not* grab this toy - where ever their little fingers go, there is a perfectly-sized tube to grab. The rattle is a very nice touch. Now, at 6 months old, he still plays with this, but not as much as when he was even smaller (I'm thinking because he has more options now). The little tubes are also great fun for him to chew on. I recommend this for EVERYONE with a little new baby. I had bought all kinds of rattles and baby toys, which he eventually grew into - but this was the early toy that he was really able to interact with.
