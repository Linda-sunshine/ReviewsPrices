review/summary: AWESOME!review/text: I have had enough kids in my life to know (now) that buying all kinds of furniture and baby stuff just makes you regret the money you spent/wasted later. They grow so fast. They're using something one day and their done with it the next. This is a very inexpensive high chair that you can take anywhere easily, clean every inch of (parts go in the dishwasher) and get years and years of use out of. You have to have room or make room for a regular high chair. This one straps to whatever chair you have. And when they're toddlers, remove the tray altogether and it's a traveling booster seat! Cheap price, easy to clean, and years of use!
