review/summary: Life saver!review/text: I started having lower back pain at the end of my first trimester and wearing this all day and while on my feet really really made a difference. By the third trimester I was in need of more support(large baby + excess amniotic fluid) but I could still feel a difference when I wore this if just standing in the kitchen cleaning dishes.
