review/summary: Worth itreview/text: I was doing well without any sleeping accommodations until I reached 20 weeks in pregnancy. The Snoogle works great for me. During the first nights I felt a bit weird but then you get confortable with the way the pillow is shaped and then you are in heaven. It supports my belly, the high for the head is good and I can also get confort on my back (before I was putting pillows for back support). I wish it would come with a better cover though.... You need to buy one separately, that will cost around $25 (which I did not buy).If you are pregnant, this pillow is a must have!
