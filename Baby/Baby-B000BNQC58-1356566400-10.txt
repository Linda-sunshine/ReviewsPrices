review/summary: Just what I wanted!review/text: Upon taking it out of the packaging and turning it on, I realized that this did not make noise. I think I just expected it too and didn't really read if it truly did or not. Either way, that wasn't the reason I bought it. I have a toy in my infant's crib that projects light on to the ceiling and my 2 year old always likes it so I wanted this for her so she would have a similar experience when she goes to bed. We have only had it for a few days, but she has to have it before she goes to bed. It says it is recommended for ages 3+, however once the batteries are in and secured there are not small pieces and is just fine for a 2 year old. There are 4 buttons on the top where she can change the color of the light and also turn it off. Love this toy---it's just what we were looking for!!
