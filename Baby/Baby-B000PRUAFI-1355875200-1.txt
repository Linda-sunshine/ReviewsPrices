review/summary: easy to install, children ages 9 and 6 can work itreview/text: We bought this gate to keep our boxer/pit bull from going up the stairs. She is a strong stout puppy, and I was concerned she would be able to knock it over or jump it. We put the gate on the second step of the stairs, and it's high enough she can't jump it, and she can't move it. The kids learned how to open it in about a day, but we wanted that. my 3 year old nephew can't open it, and he figured out his gates at home.great product, not &#34;big and plastic&#34;, so it doesn't look obnoxious, and it's very functional.
