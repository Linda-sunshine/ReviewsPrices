review/summary: Wish it used something other than C batteriesreview/text: My son loves this. He enjoys watching the colorful lights flash on the top. The soothing jungle sounds are nice too. It is large but does fold flat for storage. The hanging toys are colorful and eye catching. I was disappointed that the two butterflies that hang from the center do not turn by themselves. I originally thought they would be like a mobile and would turn automatically. Instead they just sort of hang there.The batteries in the unit are installed within the giraffe's bottom using two screws (as with most children's toys). I wish it used AA's or even D size batteries as C's are not something we usually keep on hand in our house. The battery life is pretty long though.
