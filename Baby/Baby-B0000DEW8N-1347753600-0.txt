review/summary: Gets the job done perfectly!review/text: I love this chair! It is compact & lightweight; very easy to travel with. It is sturdy, too - so I don't worry about my little guy flopping around. He loves sitting in it for a meal, or even just to be eye level with everyone else. Great purchase.
