review/summary: Love these!review/text: Pampers Swaddlers are my favorite! There super soft and I simply love the indicator in the front. I've tried Huggies and up & up, Swaddlers beat them both! I wished the made them in all sizes. We're ready for a 3 and I'm sad to say goodbye. We will be trying cruisers or baby dry (pampers) next!
