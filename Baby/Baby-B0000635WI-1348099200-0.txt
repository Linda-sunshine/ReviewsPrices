review/summary: Love this pillowreview/text: It's a great pillow, and has really helped me sleep better. Nice design, soft and comfortable. I wish the bottom for the legs had a wee bit more padding, since I have wide hips, but it hasn't been much of a problem for me. I don't like the cover, it's too itchy, which is why a dropped a star. Just ordered the jersey cover and hope that will help.
