review/summary: My Sons Favorite Toyreview/text: My 14month old son loves this walker and has for awhile now. We received this as a gift when he was maybe 6 months old. Before he could walk, I removed the activity board and he loved playing with that. Once I was comfortable with his walking skills, I let him use the walker. We have tile floors so I didn't want him to bust it. He now loves to push the walker all over and is still loving playing with the activity board. It is part of his daily play. We recommend this product!!
