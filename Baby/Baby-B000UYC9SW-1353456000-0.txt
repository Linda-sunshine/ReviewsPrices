review/summary: Great so far!review/text: I just got this carrier for my newborn due in 6 weeks. I didn't babywear my son till he was about 6 months old and I wanted something that would be more cozy for a newborn than the sling I had. I haven't had a chance to try it out yet as my daughter hasn't arrived yet but I did stick my 15 month old in it just to see and he actually loved it. It felt real secure and I'm sure would fit better once I don't have a giant pregnant belly. So definitely great for all size kids and I'm hoping cozy for my newborn as well.
