review/summary: awesomeness!!!review/text: Delivered quick, no hassle.Five stars for speediness, good dealnessand just cuz i like the sesame street on the pampers.smells like powder, funny to look at (i find it funny we once wore these, well some of us. The old school people used cloth)overall good! Nice big boxits awesome just awesome..bought these for my first baby too....**OH and for those new parents that are buying these for their first baby, and looking around at different pricesfor diapers, online or in-store. Looking at reviews and doing research:1) first off congrats! kids are an awesome gift dont take them for granted2)make sure you DON'T get unknown brands or real cheap stuff, because your baby could get a rash3)online is cheaper unless you got coupons, and know how to get the in-store diapers for less4)ask people, friends, family what diapers they use, especially if they had a baby recently5)be prepared, and have diapers on hand before the baby is born...you will run through them fast
