review/summary: Can be cumbersome if you move a lot but worth itreview/text: I have had this pillow for about 3 months now. I definitely like sleeping with this better than just a normal pillow under my head and between my legs. I went on vacation recently and was debating whether to lug it along, so I tried sleeping with normal pillows for a couple nights. It made me realize how much more comfortable I can get with the support from this pillow.I followed another reviewer's suggestion to cover the top of the pillow with a pillow case- great idea. That's the main area that I like to change often, anyways, and covers what other reviewers said was scratchy. The rest of the pillow seems fine with the cover it comes with, not too scratchy for my body at all.When you first get the pillow, the head part does seem a little fluffy, but after using it a week or so, it flattens out a bit and has pretty much stayed the same from that point.I like the different positions that you can get from this pillow, and I switch sides throughout the night to take advantage of them both. This is a bit annoying because of how the bottom curves so much, but the curve does help support your back when using it that way, which really is nice, so I guess I'm glad for it.Here is an overview of the two ways I use this pillow:Belly toward pillow: you can prop up one arm, have legs either bent and totally supported or out with knees supported, and tuck the back support under your rear which keeps your back supported.Belly away from pillow: allows you to lay your whole back on the pillow, relieving pressure from your side, and lets you stretch your legs out (or bent). This is nice because once you get to the point in your pregnancy when you aren't allowed to lay on your back, you feel as if you never get the chance to really stretch your body (and belly) out.All in all, I am glad that I bought this. A little pricy, but I have definitely appreciated it (especially because I am expecting twins, so my belly was larger earlier and will be for longer!)
