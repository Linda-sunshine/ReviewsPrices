review/summary: Use your common sensereview/text: Before buying this wrap, I read a lot of reviews saying the "tails" of the Moby wrap drag on the floor. Or that it's impossible to figure out how to tie. And that they couldn't imagine trying to use it in public because it's so complicated. Well, before buying, I viewed a YouTube video showing how to tie the wrap for the most basic carry. "Looks pretty simple to me," I thought. I went ahead and purchased the wrap. In short, this wrap is brilliant. My month-old baby girl is curled up in it as I type. I put it on for the first time this morning, put my fussy baby into it, and within five minutes she was sound asleep.The tails don't drag on the floor. If yours do, you're wearing it wrong. I mean, *really* wrong. If you find it impossible to tie, well ... surf on over to YouTube and watch an instructional video. Make an X in back, an X in front, wrap the ends around your waist, double-tie them, and voila -- insert baby and you're good to go.Also, know your baby. I looked at how a newborn will end up "compacted" while riding in the Moby wrap, and I thought "great, my baby girl will love this." When she was in utero, I knew from an ultrasound how she liked to sit "Buddha style." The Moby wrap facilitates that exact posture. If your baby doesn't like to be "squished," for heaven's sake, don't blame it on the wrap. Buy something different that lets him/her stretch out more.It's a good wrap. I'll come back and update my review if our opinion changes.
