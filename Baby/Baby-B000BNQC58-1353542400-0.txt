review/summary: Perfect night light for little onesreview/text: I had been eyeing these since we had our first child, who is now 5. His little brother, who is 2 1/2 has been suddenly having issues with going to bed - scared of monsters, ghosts, you name it. He started getting out of bed 2 - 3 times each night after we put him down, and not sleeping until 2 hours or more past his bedtime. I was going to get the turtle for him for Christmas, but decided we needed it now. And it has actually helped him stay in bed. The first night, we all lay and sat as a family in the boys' room and looked at the stars together. Now we put him in his bed, turn the turtle on, kiss him and that's that. It was between this and one of those Dream Lites, but those are made by the Pillow Pet people and seem so cheap in comparison. (I've had to fix stitching in Pillow Pets a few times, and the plush fabric on them is not the nicest.) Plus the Dream Lites only put stars straight up on the ceiling. This puts stars all over the room. If it's in the middle of the room, it will project stars on every wall and the ceiling. Our son's bed is by a wall, so it doesn't reach the far wall, but projects enough on 3 walls and the ceiling so that both boys can enjoy the stars. It turns itself off after 45 minutes - brilliant!! My husband likes that since he doesn't have to change batteries constantly. And you can change the color of the stars, although our guy always chooses blue, which he calls purple. I don't know why people complain about the hard shell, because if the shell were plush, um, the plush piling would block the stars. It's a beautiful product, excellent quality and now our 5 year old wants one too. I wouldn't hesitate to get this for my kid or another child. Oh, and I did mention it comes with a constellation guide for the star pattern it projects. Our boys love to point out Orion's belt! It's actually educational too - bonus!
