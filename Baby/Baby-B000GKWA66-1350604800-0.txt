review/summary: Great sleep aidreview/text: I purchased this for my son prior to his birth and have used it since day 1. I have used the heartbeat noise almost exclusively for putting him to sleep however when playing in his room he will now hit the buttons and try the other noises. originally I had this hanging by the velcro on his crib but once he woke up in the morning (starting at 9 months) he would un-velcro and it would either be in his crib or on the floor. I started putting it on the table near his crib and that worked best for me, I could easily hit the button if I needed more time on particularly fussy nights and it was out and being adorable. He has other non-noise animals to sleep with. I have had it and used it every night for 17 1/2 months and only changed the batteries 1 time. We love this also because when we travel it provides comfort and familiarity for him.
