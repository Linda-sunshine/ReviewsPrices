review/summary: Best diaper I've tried so farreview/text: Best diaper my BABY has tried. I have a 3 month old who can blast his poop and spray urine like a fireman on a 10 alarm blaze! These bad boys do a GREAT job absorbing the mess and keeping it from leaking through the legs or the belly. Other diapers would leak but the elastic IF properly placed flush against the legs does a great job!Make sure to put it on carefully and it will do a great job.
