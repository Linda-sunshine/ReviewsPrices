review/summary: a lifesaverreview/text: I LOVE this product. As a first time mom with a 7 week old infant who likes to be held constantly it has been a life saver for me. I can now eat something, do dishes or laundry, walk the dogs, check email... the possibilities are endless. And I still get to cuddle with my sweet baby, which makes her feel safe and loved. She fussed a little the first time I put her in but after I walked around a bit she fell right to sleep. Now she falls asleep almost instantly when I put her in. (She did not like the sling that goes over one shoulder.)I did not think it was that hard to learn to wrap this product. I watched a you-tube video and was able to do it on the first try. And it gets easier each time I use it.I do agree with some other posters that the one down side is that it's hard to put it on outside the house without it dragging on the ground. But if you stand next to the open car door you can leave one end in the car and pick up the other end so it doesn't drag. Or you could put it on before you leave the house.
