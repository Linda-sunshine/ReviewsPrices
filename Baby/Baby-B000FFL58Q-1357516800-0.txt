review/summary: Rainforest Gym A Hitreview/text: I purchased this for my 2 month old granddaughter. She absolutely loves it. While under she never stops moving and cooing. The rainforest sounds seem to calm her. It folds up easily for travel or storage. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has an infant.
