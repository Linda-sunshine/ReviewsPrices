review/summary: Grandma's secret weaponreview/text: BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original - Black, ClassicI watch our granddaughter a day a week. At almost 6 months old the Baby Bjorn is my secret weapon. I can accomplish things and have my hands free while carrying her around in this. It protects my back, it provides her with some stimulation and it really supports her facing forward. To be quite honest, sometimes I forget I am even holding her!
