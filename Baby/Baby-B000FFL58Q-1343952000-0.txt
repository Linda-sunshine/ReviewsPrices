review/summary: Fun Playmatreview/text: Our little guy loves this. We started him at 5 weeks. He would just look at the toys as we moved them around. A week later he was so involved. We can comfortably leave him under the mat for almost 30 min while we grab a snack or get dressed. We haven't even placed the batteries in yet so we assume that will entice him even more. We can easily add more hanging toys or move them around. Such a thrill to hear him hit the toys and make noises. So cute.Just bought batteries. Not really necessary. The butterflies don't work, too bad it would be cute. The music is okay and the lights are cute but my child is more interested in all the other toys.
