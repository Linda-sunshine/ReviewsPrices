review/summary: fun, but the rattle gets stuck a lotreview/text: A little disappointed about the quality since the little things inside the cube that make the rattling sound often get stuck.But it's too much trouble to get a replacement or return. So we kept it.My son prefers sophie (http://www.amazon.com/Vulli-Sophie-the-Giraffe-Teether/dp/B000IDSLOG/)and the haba clutching toy (http://www.amazon.com/Haba-1121-Kringelring-Clutching-Toy/dp/B0002HYCMI) a lot better than this one.
