review/summary: Great toyreview/text: I have had a couple of iterations of this, and it is great for the "everything goes in the mouth" phase. Baby can put it in his mouth without swallowing, lots of colors, bright. Some of the other similar toys are kind of heavy and i feel like baby bangs them into his head. Not this one.
