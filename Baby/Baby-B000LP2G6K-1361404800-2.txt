review/summary: good simple pack 'n playreview/text: Simple to use, very basic pack 'n play. Just keep the center up when deploying or taking down or the arms won't lock/unlock... the directions make that very clear and I believe that's very standard. Two levels, not three like some... but that works just fine for us.
