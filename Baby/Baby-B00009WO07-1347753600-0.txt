review/summary: WARNINGreview/text: Having used Pampers for the last year and been very happy with them I was more than shocked when this last box arrived and the absorbency pad was half as thick as it used to be. Needless to say - my son can't even make it through a nap without soaking through his diaper let alone the night time. I am now switching to Huggies in hopes of not having to get up at 3am to changed a sopping wet, screaming child.
