review/summary: love it - everything as expectedreview/text: I bought 2 gates to keep my very active new dog confined to one room while I am gone.The gates came really quick (thankfully!!) and went up in minutes. They came with the option of using screws or double-sided sticky pads (provided) to mount onto the wall. I decided to go with sticky on the bottom and use the screws on the top two points.So far everything is working well. Charlie hasnt attemted to try crashing through the gate, but if he does it seems more than strong enough to hold.I really like the ease, the quality and the price. I've seen cheaper-looking products in the pet stores that easily were twice as much in price. I highly recommend this one.
