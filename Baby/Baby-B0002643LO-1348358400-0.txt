review/summary: NEVER AGAIN!review/text: These diapers are awful and we'll never get them again. They seemed thinner than the Huggies we normally buy, so I guess the only plus is that you can fit more in the diaper bag/in the basket on the changing table, but the positives end there. They leak like crazy - esp. when they get pretty full during naps/bedtime - we have to wake up our son to change him in the middle of the night so he doesn't wake up in wet pajamas and a puddle in the morning. Also when they fill, they sag so terribly. Our toddler quickly learned he could easily reach in when they were saggy and mess with his poop if he had any. He also easily took them off, unlike the Huggies - probably because they were sagging and uncomfortable. Unfortunately we have 222 to get through... ugh...
