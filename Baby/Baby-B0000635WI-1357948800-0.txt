review/summary: Not life-altering like I'd hopedreview/text: I was so excited to get this pregnancy pillow - I'd been told over and over again by friends and my midwife that I just had to get a pregnancy pillow, that I'd feel so much better once I did.Alas, that didn't happen.My major two issues with this pillow are this:- It's hot. Or, rather, it traps my heat, so I wake up much sweatier than I do without it. I don't particularly like being hot while sleeping, so I rarely use this as a result.- It's awkward when rolling over. I have to reposition myself to make it work, which means that I need to kinda sorta wake up to do so, rather than just readjusting while sleeping like I'd normally do.I also wish the pillowcases for it were cheaper - I can't see investing more money into this to use it more than I do, but because I end up kicking it to the floor midway through each night I try to use it, I would like something that's easier to clean.Mostly, I wish that I hadn't spent the money.
