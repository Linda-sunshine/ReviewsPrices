review/summary: Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seatreview/text: I bought this for my baby girl when she was old enough to sit up at the table with us. She enjoyed sitting with us and she enjoyed the tray system that she could play with her food in. The chair is easy to take with you as it folds and it has two belts with buckles for you to secure it to whatever it will be standing on. The tray assy consists of three pieces: 1. the blue tray that snaps onto the seat (3 positions depending on your child's size) 2. The white tray that snaps onto the blue tray. That is where the food supposed to go, it is slightly smaller than blue, surely thinner and easier to clean in that sense. 3. The green cover to keep the white tray clean while you carry it.The green cover does not always stay put when being carried. My daughter wasn't having it with the white tray and would find it funny to snap it off the blue tray (nearly right after we started using the char). The blue tray she uses to this date as her eating tray if she's not sitting at the table. Recently we've been having her sit in this char but eat at the table like us.This tray in inexpensive and very functional. A few small design issues (mentioned above) were not safety related and we're able to live though them :)
