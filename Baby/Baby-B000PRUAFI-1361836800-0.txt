review/summary: Best Gatereview/text: This is the third baby gate we have used in our house. The first two we were displeased with, so we wanted to give this one a shot.Installation was a BREEZE for this one compared with the other two. To be fair, the other two were in more difficult locations (bottom of stairs and a large entryway) but I was pleasently surprised at the ease of setting this thing up.We used the cups but did not screw them into the wall, because we plan on moving it again soon. i have had zero issues with it moving at all even though we didn't screw into the wall.THE GATE ACTUALLY CLOSES ON IT'S OWN! both of our other gates claim to "automatically latch closed" after you open them, but they don't. this one does! every time. i also love that it stays open if you want it to.the dual locking mechanism is nice too. we like this gate so much we ordered another for our house. highly recommend this gate to anyone.
