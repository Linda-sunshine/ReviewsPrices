review/summary: Great chairreview/text: This chair deserves all the good ratings out there. It's held up all kinds of beatings from my toddler and will be used again (round two) by our next baby. The only negative thing I can think about it is that my baby learned how to pull the removable serving tray off the first time I used it so we ended up not using that tray which we didn't mind at all.
