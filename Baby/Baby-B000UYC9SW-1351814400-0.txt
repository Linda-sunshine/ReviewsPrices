review/summary: Little guy likes it !review/text: There are way to many carriers out there and I don't know why I chose this one, but I'm glad that I did. At first, it was a little confusing to set up ( first kid, no idea what I was doing ) but after using it once, I can now get it on and him set in in under a minute. I've only used a the newborn position but he really enjoys it. It's freed me up to be able to eat and go for walks while still letting him up with me.Totally happy with it.
