review/summary: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Sleep Sheep!review/text: Oh My! I was absolutely not going to 'buy into' this whole soothing noises thing. After 3 months of a baby who wakes at every sound and simply won't just fall asleep I gave in and started researching noise machines. We have been using the sleep sheep at nearly every nap and bed time for the past 2 months. There are 4 sounds. Heartbeat, Rain, Waves Crashing and Whales. The whales seem to be the winner. The timer is great as well so we aren't running batteries down. Speaking of which, we have yet to replace the batteries and like I said. It's used on a regular basis. Our little one also loves looking at him and loves squeezing it. Would definitely recommend and I will be buying this as a gift for any friends having babies in the future!
