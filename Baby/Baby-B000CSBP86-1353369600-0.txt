review/summary: Waste of Money - get the ErgoBaby!review/text: This is the 3rd type of carrier that I've bought - I was really happy with it until my daughter got to be over 10 lbs. She's 6 months old, 13 lbs. (which is really small for her age) and it gave me severe back pain to carry her less than 1 mile. The ErgoBaby is designed to spread the weight evenly and I'm now going to spend another fortune for the Ergo. Advice to all expecting parents: DO NOT get the Bjorn. Get a Moby or other wrap for the newborn and then get the Ergo.
