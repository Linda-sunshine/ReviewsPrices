review/summary: Sizing is really trickyreview/text: Okay I read tons of the reviews listed here and figured this wrap would be easier than the Moby. I wanted something fast and simple, just like all the countless videos I watched. Okay....first, ya gotta get the size right. I'm 5' 8, slim frame so I went with the small, since everyone mentioned how stretchy it was. After I washed it first, tried it and it barely fit me, let alone my son. The wrap so shrunk and it doesn't matter how &#34;stretchy&#34; it suppose to get, it wasn't gonna fit. So I exchanged it for a medium. Initially, I thought it was still to small, but still gave it a shot. It was better, but not by much. My son is 4 weeks and I felt like I was squishing him. I'm going to put this on hold until he's older.
