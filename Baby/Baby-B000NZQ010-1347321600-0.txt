review/summary: Eh. It's just okreview/text: I bought this because my six month old is already crawling and I wanted to have something ready when she was standing. As others have pointed out, this (and all of these kinds of toys honestly) is too light for a baby to "learn" to walk with. It's really only useful if they're already steady on their feet. I knew that from my older girls and was ok with that. The item came without the handle, so I had to call VTech and ask to have one sent. Customer service was fine-- quick answer, quick response-- although it took about two weeks for the handle to arrive, which would have irritated me if I had any plans to use the handle right now. At first, the baby just thought this toy was AMAZING. She would crawl across the room in a flash to get to it and make the noises. But, it was her first "make noises" toy. Now that she has other ones, this one is about as popular as the others. It's not particularly "learning" friendly (again, not something I was looking for, since I don't expect my kids to learn much of any "educational" value from their toys-- it's more about the physical stuff). But it is lacking in the sense that I don't think there's enough stuff to "mess" with to work on her hand eye coordination and motor movements. She basically just bangs at it until something happens, which is probably why it's worn off in terms of popularity after only a couple of weeks. For this kind of toy, it's fine. It's not something I would spend extra money for, however, than just any other old walker toy.
