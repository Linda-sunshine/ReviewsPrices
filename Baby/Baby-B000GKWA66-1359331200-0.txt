review/summary: Not just for babiesreview/text: Ok. I admit it. I am over 50. And this little lamb helps me sleep. My quest for better sleep has included special pillows, amino acids, hot milk, eye covers, a wrist pulse thumper etc etc. And fuzzy lamb actually helped - it is so soothing and relaxing. I can feel my aggravated, tension filled muscles just melt and my breathing deepen. It is so much better than wearing a headset playing white noise and nature sounds. It has two time spans and four optional sounds. The longer time span with the waves is my favorite. And during the day, it decorates my bed. So you don't have to be pre-verbal to enjoy this little lamb.
