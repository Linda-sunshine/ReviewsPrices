review/summary: Works as Advertisedreview/text: I am in my 6th month of my second pregnancy and the doctor suggested I get a support belt to help with lower back pain and other pain associated with the loose muscles (from the first pregnancy) and the way #2 is sitting so low in my pelvis. I read the reviews for this and was glad I did, especially about sizing. I am not a small person and ordered the Medium Size thinking I still might grow. I am glad I did because I have it on the smallest notch and its not tight at all. Definitely order down a size. Overall, its a nice product that I can also wear right against my skin without any irritation and it does help with the pain - although I don't wear it every day.
