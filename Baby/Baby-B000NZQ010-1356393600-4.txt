review/summary: dont miss it... kids love itreview/text: My daughter calls it "step step"... and she loves it. In the beginning you might feel that the music is distraction, but let it be... its all intentional. Once they figure it out, its this music which motivates them to keep walking. We travel a lot and this is a blessing ad we can carry this with us after disassembly.
