review/summary: Baby Loves it!review/text: My 5 month old baby loves her jumper, but at 26&#34; tall and only 15 # she can't quite touch the floor in the lowest setting. We had to fold up a couple towels to put under her feet. When she isn't jumping she is playing with the bug or swatting at the toys in the front. Be careful putting your child into it though, it can be a little tricky to get their feet into the holes. I bought this one because it can kind of fold up, and we have a very small living area. It doesn't save a lot of room, but in our house any extra space helps. It is almost a two person job to move it when it is folded, though, as it loses it's stable foundation. Overall, easy to put together, easy to clean, baby loves it, what else is there to say?
