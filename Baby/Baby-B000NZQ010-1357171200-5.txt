review/summary: Wonderful Toyreview/text: This toy is amazing for any child beginning to walk. I first saw this toy in person and saw how engaged the child was with it and how well it worked. When I was looking for a gift for another child, I knew I wanted to see if I could get it. I was surprised by how inexpensive it was. After seeing it in person, I thought it would cost much more. You're really getting a good value for your money with this one!
