review/summary: Wonderful giftreview/text: We gave theCloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtleand heard that the parents like it as much as the baby. It's not a soft toy, but a soothing light that is comforting. Knowing that it turns off automatically is an asset, and hearing how it is soothing to watch, I'm tempted to buy one for us, too. I guess this is as good as they say.
