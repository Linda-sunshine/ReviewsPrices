review/summary: Great Purchase!review/text: Bought this for our now 3 month old son and he loves it. Prior to getting this, we only had an expensive swing that just wasn't giving us the results we had hoped for.This Fisher Price chair is great! It is battery operated (D) and is a go to favorite for my son. After play time, tummy time, etc...sometimes he just wants to sit up and look around. This chair soothes him, often puts him to sleep and is easy to move around the house to keep him in the action.We haven't used the mobile attachment, he isn't really that interested in it, so we just keep it off.I would have given 5 stars if the frame was a bit more sturdy. Overall, a great chair for a little one, not sure how it will hold up over time, but then it was not that expensive.
