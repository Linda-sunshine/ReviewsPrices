review/summary: Made in Chinareview/text: The product appears to be colorful and perfect for a teething baby, HOWEVER...I bought this solely because it came up when I searched for "toys not made in China". The list was extremely limited so I trusted that the short list would include only what I had requested. I purchased two toys. Both toys, selected from this very limited list, say very clearly that they were made in China. This is the second time I have purchased and returned "toys not Made in China" from Amazon. I am so frustrated and disgusted.
