review/summary: Over the moon for this turtlereview/text: I have had my eye on this turtle since I found out I was pregnant. Now my son is two and I finally bought it for his birthday. His reaction has been amazing. He adores this turtle. He carries it around daily and sits in our long hallway with it on, star-gazing. At bedtime, he cannot wait to turn out the light and see the moon and stars appear on his ceiling. While he's always been good at bedtime, now he actually asks to go.As other reviewers have mentioned, the green light is really the only one that shows up clearly. The blue is a little too dark to show up, and we have a hard time seeing the orange light at all. The hard plastic shell feels a little more fragile than I would have expected for the price, although it has certainly shown no sign of wear, having been dropped many times.The most important thing about this turtle is my son's response, and I could not have asked for a better one.
