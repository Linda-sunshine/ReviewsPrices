review/summary: VERY useful, but AWFUL qualityreview/text: I used this so much for the first 3 months of my baby's life. It was my go-to baby product and a life-saver for keeping track of his feedings. I didn't use the sleep and diaper buttons as much. The fourth "open" button was great to keep track of when I pumped milk or to keep track of any medicines my baby was on. However, two of the buttons suddenly stopped working after I'd been using this for just one month. As it was still under warranty, I sent it back to the manufacturer with the receipt. They sent me a new one. After a couple months of using this second one, some of the number characters have burnt out. So I can't see what time it is, for example. Even though it's a great idea and makes for a thoughtful, cute gift, the quality is VERY iffy. Don't buy this expecting to use if for very long.
