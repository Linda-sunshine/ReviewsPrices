review/summary: Unsafe for sitting infantsreview/text: Just wanted to add another cautionary post here about your baby tipping over. My 7 mo. old was within a second of face planting as she reached for a dropped toy--I luckily looked over and caught the chair right before she smashed into the hardwood floor. It's kind of disappointing since I think of Fisher Price as a gold standard in child product safety, we grew up with Fisher Price products ourselves. Some other people have written here not to use the chair in rocking mode with infants of this age, but this isn't really made obvious, and I naively thought that since the product says 'safe up to 40-lb. toddlers', it was engineered to not tip over. It's not a bad product overall, but this is something that anyone who uses this chair should be aware of.
