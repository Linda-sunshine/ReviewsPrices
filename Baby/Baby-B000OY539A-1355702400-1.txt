review/summary: Comfortable, Easy to store, Baby is comfortable in itreview/text: We bought this for our infant before she was born. We waited until she was 8 lbs to start trying to use this. At first, it takes a little bit to figure this wrap out, but it is extremely useful. Our baby is 3 months old now, and she seems to enjoy this wrap. She will usually sleep on either my wife or I when we wrap her. It's really easy to throw this wrap in the diaper bag, stroller, etc. It travels really well. There are many different ways you can wrap your baby up. We found a way that seems to work best for us right now, and it holds our baby in a really good ergonomic position. Our baby is very secure in this wrap as well.The only cons for this product are:-Baby & parent can get warm in the wrap-Wrapping without a helper can be more challengingThe pros for this wrap:-Many different ways to wrap your child-Very comfortable and supportive-Easy to travel with-Easy to wash-Ergonomic carry positions for baby-Can be very supportive for baby-Can be used over a wide weight & age rangeWe love our Moby Wrap!
