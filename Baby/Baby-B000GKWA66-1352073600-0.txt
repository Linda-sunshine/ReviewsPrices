review/summary: Cute, not so practicalreview/text: This is cute and convenient that it can be easily moved, but in hindsight I would have gone with a normal sound machine that plugs in and doesn't turn off after 45 minutes. My daughter wakes up to changes in noise and resetting this gets old. Also have to turn the knob to turn this off which is inconvenient when holding a baby, but its for baby so the batteries aren't easy to change, don't want to waste them.
