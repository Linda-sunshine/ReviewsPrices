review/summary: Almost perfect!review/text: I'm 6 months pregnant and have been using various pillows for head/body/legs, including a "Made for TV" side sleeper pillow. The one I've been using is U-shaped but uneven, so each time I turn over I need to turn the pillow. However, it also has an "ear well" - an indentation that keeps my ear from getting sore while sleeping so much on my side.I had hubby buy the Leachco for me so I could have one big pillow that doesn't need to be turned over in the night. I love it so much - EXCEPT that my ears start hurting in a matter of minutes. I've tried making it work for a couple of nights, but I'm starting to lose hope - I just end up with this other small softer pillow, in the middle of this huge leacho thing that just isn't working out :-(This pillow would be SO PERFECT if they added that "ear well" feature!
