review/summary: Sorry - Too Dangerous!!review/text: I read all the reviews and decided to buy this for my 10 month old since he was already sitting, crawling and could pull himself up and walk around furniture like a pro. Seemed like he was more than ready for this toy. Wow, was I wrong!!He never pulled himself up on it cuz it started rolling away!! Even on a rug!I tried to lift him up to it myself so he could walk and push it along, but even then the darn thing went flying!! Luckily I was right there and caught him.The musical toy part of the walker was really cute (to me...)and it detached from the walker so I thought maybe I'd just keep it and let him play with the toy part and save the walker until after he was walking better on his own.Well, he had no interest in the toy whatsoever. I started thinking that the whole reason I bought this was because I wanted something to help him learn to walk.Needless to say, I sent it back. No baby is going to learn to walk with this thing! They need to change the name because it is VERY misleading. Doing a face-plant is not going to teach any baby how to walk!!
