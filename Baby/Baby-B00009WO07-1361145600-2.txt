review/summary: Good Productreview/text: I went right back to baby dry and no more leaks. I have also tried other brands and I loved Huggies for my daughter but they don't work for my son. Funny how each is different. I am a mother of 4 and Luvs worked for my other son. You just go with what works for your child. I also have noticed that they work differently for different ages as well. Good idea to try a few out before you buy the jumbo packs.
