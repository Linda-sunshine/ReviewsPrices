review/summary: One of our best purchasesreview/text: This is one of the best things we bought for our little guy. Like a lot of new parents, we're terrified of letting him sleep with a blanket while he's under 6 months because of the increased risk of SIDS. I don't know how substantial the risk actually is, but no matter how small, we'd probably sleep a little less because of it. This keeps him warm, and works great.
