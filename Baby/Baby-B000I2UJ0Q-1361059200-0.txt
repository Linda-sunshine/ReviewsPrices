review/summary: Great Jumperooreview/text: My daughter has been using this jumperoo since she was about 4 months old (she is now 6 months) and she loves it. She jumps and screeches (happily) and turns herself around and around. The toys are great and she loves the lights on it. We can also hook some other toys onto the leaves to give her additional items to play with. This is one of the best purchases we made and I highly recommend getting one.
