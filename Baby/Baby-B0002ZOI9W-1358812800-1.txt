review/summary: My baby doesn't like sleeping in the crib as much as in this rocker!review/text: My baby is 3 weeks old and he started to get really cranky for some reason. So sometimes he doesn't want to sleep in his crib (both he standard size crib and portable crib we have for him) and he'll keep crying for a LONG time once we put him down. But then when we put him into this rocker chair, he'll cry like 5 mins and start to fall asleep. Usually we turn on the vibration function in the beginning and this will work better. Also we added a head support and I think this helps too. So I'm here to get 1 more of this same rocker (different pattern) so we can have 1 upstairs and 1 downstairs ( I didn't realise having a 2-story home is so inconvenient for a baby).
