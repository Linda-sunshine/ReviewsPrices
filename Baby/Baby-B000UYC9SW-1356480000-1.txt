review/summary: Love thisreview/text: I have an expensive brand name front carrier but my new infant likes to be cradled so it wasn't working and she's colicky so I wasn't getting anything done all day. I did a lot of research on wraps and other pouch type carriers. I decided on this one because I'm petite (my baby isn't!) and those wraps are way too much fabric. I love how this is sized to you. I feel it is much more secure and safe. My baby loves being in it and falls asleep instantly in it. My husband was jealous so I ended up having to buy him one also!
