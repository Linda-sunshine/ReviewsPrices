review/summary: This baby corral is fantastic!review/text: Length:: 2:43 MinsThis is the best baby product that has come out in 30 years! I have a 7-1/2 month old grandson who is crawling, pulling up, chewing on anything he can get his hands on because he's teething, and I've been trying to baby proof everything in our home to keep him from getting injured. I purchased two units along with two expansion panel kits (one for our home and one for our daughter and son-in-law for their home). It was very easy to set up since the panels are already connected, so we just snapped in the extension panels and it made a huge play area for the baby! You can bend it into any shape (circle, square, rectangle, etc.) to fit your space. We just tossed in some toys, set him down inside the corral, and he played happily without us having to worry about him bumping his head on the fireplace, etc. He would pull up on the panels and they were tough enough to hold his weight and there was no way he could turn it over because it is very sturdy. It folds back up like an accordian taking very little space for storage. WalMart had the best price and we ordered ours online from site-to-store so there were no shipping fees. It arrived within one week and I couldn't be more pleased with it! I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a little one. My daughter is equally pleased and said it is like having a babysitter around so she can actually cook, clean and take a shower without worrying about him crawling off and getting into something! This would make an excellent shower gift! Sincerely, Barbara Chumbler
