review/summary: Nice design, but needs more bum cheek roomreview/text: We had been struggling with getting our 3 1/2 yr old to want to try and potty. I looked at all the potty chairs possible and read reviews and this one sounded perfect. So I got my boy excited about this one and let him pick the color out. He was so excited when it came and wanted to sit on it right away (this is what I was hoping for when I bought it) he probably wasn't on it more then 10 seconds and said it hurt his bum. We tried several more times and same thing. He is an average size toddler so I am not sure what size of kid this would be comfortable for. I ended up getting next the babybjorn toilet trainer and it is awesome. He loves it, it doesn't hurt him and the splash guard is great for a little boy.
