review/summary: My daughter loves it.review/text: We purchased this for our seven year old daughter for use in her bedroom at night time. She loves it so much she named her sleepy, it lights up her room so she can go to sleep faster. The lady bug stays on her bed and when on it lights up her room with a lot of stars and a crescent moon, blue is her favorite, as well as mine, it also has red and green. It also shuts off after twenty minutes which is great. The top is plastic but doesn't cause any problems because she keeps it closer to feet, actually I'm glad it's plastic because if it was soft she would probably hold it and the light would be close to her eyes. I looked at quite a few of the "glow toys" and am glad we went with this one.
