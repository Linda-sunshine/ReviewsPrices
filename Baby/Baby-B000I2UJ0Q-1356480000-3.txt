review/summary: Awesome!!!review/text: So it took many tries until my 5 month old son got it! I knew he would like this toy because he just loves kicking his legs and his other favorite toy is the Fisher Price Kick and Play piano gym. My son doesn't like tummy time, so we are so happy that he's not on his back all day long now. He also jumps himself to sleep, it's so cute. I make sure lo can see me and he's usually content chilling in it. It has given me so much time to get other things done. Like I said, it took maybe a week when he finally figured out what to do in it, but I am so glad we kept trying :)
