review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I bought the baby k'tan after reviewing many different carriers because I needed one for an infant. When i received this, the instructions were fairly easy to follow, but was disappointed in the sizing recommendations! I got the XS (i am 5'3, and petite) and although the way it fell on my body was correct like the instructions said, my baby of 3 weeks ( 8 lb 6 oz right now) barely could fit in it. It was super snug and difficult to get one of the straps on my shoulders without feeling like i was smashing the air out of my baby. She would fuss and cry as I would try to adjust her. There is no way that she would last in this carrier longer than another week before I would have to upgrade in size. Very disappointed that this carrier seems limited, not sure if i am going to attempt to try a size Small or go with another carrier altogether.
