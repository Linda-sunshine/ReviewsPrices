review/summary: Highly Recommend the Cloud b Turtle Night Lightreview/text: I bought this for our grandson when he spends the night with us. He is a little over 3 years old. He has one at his home. He loves it as we do. It automatically times off in 45 minutes. I was going to get him the new sea turtle that they have out to have at our home and am happy that I didn't. I bought him the same one here that he has at home but just a different color. I have a friend who bought the sea turtle for her grandson with the same idea...to have a different turtle at their home. The sea turtle does not light up the ceiling at all like the original cloud b turtle. Am not sure what they did wrong as the only difference is the turtle but I have been to her home and she had both turtles there and I saw the difference first hand. I highly recommend the original Cloub b Turtle but not the newest sea turtle
