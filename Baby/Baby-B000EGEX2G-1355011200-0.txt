review/summary: Love it!review/text: I bought this rocking glider for my 11 year old daughter. She is special needs and is very hard on furniture. This glider is very comfortable and looks great in her room! Although it looks a little bigger in the picture then what it actually is, I would definitely recommend it. So far, it's well worth the money!
