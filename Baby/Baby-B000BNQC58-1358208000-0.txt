review/summary: Perfect for my kidsreview/text: We have the turtle and the ladybug (because each kid had to have their own). While pricey, I got this with a coupon from Amazon during the holidays & free shipping, so it was a good deal. This is a quality item. The lights are bright & shine around the room. Comes with a book of constellations and a story. 3 different colors (though the gold is hard to see) and shuts off after 45 mins. Even comes with batteries & that NEVER happens!!!!
