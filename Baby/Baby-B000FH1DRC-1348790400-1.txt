review/summary: soft and cuddlyreview/text: I have used Pampers Swaddlers with all 4 of my babies. These are the best diapers! They are soft and stretchy and the most comfortable for tiny babies. I ordered these from Amazon in the bulk package because it was the best way to save money on diapers and so convenient to have them delivered to my door.
