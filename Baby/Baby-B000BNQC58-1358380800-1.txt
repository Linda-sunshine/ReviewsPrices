review/summary: love itreview/text: I bought it as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She simply love it and use it every night. She got amazed by the moon and stars shooting on her ceiling. The green and purple light settings work well. The red light is not so noticeable as other reviewers mentioned. But overall this is a great purchase.
