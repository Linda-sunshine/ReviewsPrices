review/summary: Very disappointingreview/text: I bought these not knowing that they are Pampers "bargain" brand. Well, they are certainly no bargain, they are a waste of money. They make the claim that they offer 12 hours of protection but I can hardly squeeze a few hours of protection until they leak or blow out the back. I will definitely NEVER buy these again. The swaddlers are much better diapers
