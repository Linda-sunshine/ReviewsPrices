review/summary: Small, dry, but easy to get out!review/text: I compared Earth's Best wipes to Seventh Generation. The Seventh Generation wipes are cheaper per wipe, but they are much smaller and dryer so you have to use more. I much preferred Earth's Best!!The only thing I liked about the Seventh Generation wipes was that they were so easy to get out of the container one wipe at a time. Try doing that with Earth's Best and you will get a string of wipes that you have to whip with one hand to break apart while you're holding your child's ankles in your other hand!
