review/summary: It works-- but buy the next size up!review/text: Just what I needed in the third trimester for support. Was having trouble standing and walking around due to the 35 lb baby load but this belt is helping a lot. Suddenly everything is not so exhausting. Great buy for $15! Agree with other reviewers that buying a size up from what you think you need is probably best. I'm petite but purchased the small size-- very glad I did as I'm using the largest notch on the small belt. The petite probably wouldn't have fit at all.
