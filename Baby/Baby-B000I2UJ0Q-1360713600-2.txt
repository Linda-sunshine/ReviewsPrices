review/summary: Great toy, fast shippingreview/text: After reading multiple reviews from multiple websites I decided to order this for my 5 month old daughter. It arrived yesterday, we set it up immediately and she (and our dogs) took right to it. Very easy to put together and break back down to move up and down the stairs. Our daughter loves bouncing in it and playing with the hanging and spinning toys. She played so hard that she fell asleep in the seat, but was still supported by the cushy, high back. Five stars!
