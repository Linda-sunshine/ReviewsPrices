review/summary: &#34;There's so much to dooo-ooh!&#34;review/text: Got this for my daughter last Christmas. She never did use it as a walker but she loved playing with all the buttons and music. She spilled her bottle on it one day and the telephone part doesn't work right anymore. I took it apart and tried cleaning the switch to no avail. Also I noticed that if the on/off switch is left on it will sometimes start talking and singing at random, even in he middle of the night! She is a little old for it now and isn't so interested so it is probably going away soon. There are lots of sounds and silly songs to keep the little ones occupied for a while, so overall I would recommend this.
