review/summary: Best Purchase EVER!review/text: I cannot tell you enough good things about this pillow. I got it when I was 20 weeks pregnant, when the backache started to come & the headaches because my body & head were not positioned properly thru the night. After much research & talking to friends about a body pillow I decided to purchase this one and can honestly say I don't regret it at all. The price was a little hard for me to swallow for a pillow I would only use until the labor & delivery but something had to be done since I wasn't sleeping well. The pillow supports your belly & legs & is long enough & fluffy enough that I don't even need anything for my head or back. It's pretty large but does the job of 6 pillows and stays in position all night. After the first night I would have paid double what I did because I felt so much better. Now, 2 months later I can't sleep without it and have even talked about missing it after my babies are born!
