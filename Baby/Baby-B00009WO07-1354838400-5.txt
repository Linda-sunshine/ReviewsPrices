review/summary: Best diapers ever!review/text: I've tried other brands, but with my daughter's sensitive skin, these seem to be the only ones that she doesn't get a diaper rash from. They last all night, so I don't have to disrupt her sleep to change a leaky diaper either. Love, love, love Pampers Baby Dry.
