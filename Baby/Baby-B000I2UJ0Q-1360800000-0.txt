review/summary: My daughter can't get enough of this jumper!review/text: When my daughter started to bounce while standing on our laps, we knew we needed to get her a jumper! I did a lot of research on the different jumpers out there and read a ton of reviews on Amazon and made the perfect decision of getting this item. My daughter has been a jumping queen for the past month since we got the jumperoo. My husband assembled the jumper in less than 15 minutes and I took 5 minutes to clean the plastic parts on the jumper and she was in the jumper. Because she was 3 months (24 inches) at the time, she was alittle short to reach the ground (even at the lowest setting) so we just placed a pillow on the floor and that gave her enough leverage to jump away. She is also starting to play with the different toys around the jumper which is so cool to see. All of the toys are easy to clean and even the toy that serves as a teether is easily able to go in the dishwasher for cleaning. Oh and my daughter loves that the chair rotates around so that she can play with the different toys around the jumper. She also likes the gecko and bird that hang over her. And the chair cover is also easy to clean by removing it and placing it in the washer. Awesome jumper! Don't know what we would do without it! My daughter can stay in there for an hour jumping like crazy which helps when I'm cooking dinner!
