review/summary: Cool night lightreview/text: My daughter, age 5, wanted one of the dream lights. I had seen these way before the Dream lights even came out & knew this would be a much better product. Not to mention that almost everywhere I checked for reviews on the Dream lights they were rated poorly. Cloud B & their products have very good ratings & now I know why. Very cute, light can be changed to 4 different colors, there is an off switch, and there are actual constellations projected on the ceiling. Love this product! would recommend to anyone, with or with out kids!
