review/summary: Great but there are apps for your smart phone that do the same.review/text: We bought this when our baby was born 11 months ago and it really is a useful item. My wife loved it. It does a great job keeping track of and timing various activities. It worked GREAT until we spilled a glass of water on it and the insides got wet. Once that happened the display messed up. I was about to order another one when I thought about apps for our Android phones. I looked around and found a really good app that keeps track of everything. The app times feedings, diaper changes, sleep and more. It also lets you track height and weight and email all this info to yourself or your doctor. The app was cheaper than buying a new Itzbeen and it's one less thing my wife needs to carry around. She always has her phone with her so it's always ready.If you don't have a smart phone I highly recommend this product, just keep liquids away from it. If you do have a smart phone, find an app. They do more and cost less.
