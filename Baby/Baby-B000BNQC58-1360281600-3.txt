review/summary: Love it! Easy to use, bright. But eats batteries...review/text: We love it! It is big beautliful and bright!!! Just the perfect amount of brightness though for us to sleep easily, see at night to check on the baby or go to the bathroom ,etc. perfect amount of light!Only gave it 4 stars though as it seems to eat through batteries pretty fast... bummer since I thought the LEDs would last longer in it.
