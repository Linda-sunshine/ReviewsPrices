review/summary: absolutely loved itreview/text: my daughter is 9 months old and loves to pull herself up with anything she can get her hands on. This toy is fantastic. Its very durable, she pulls herself up on it everyday and it has yet to fall. She also loves walking it around the house. We have carpet so it works great but also works great on the kitchen floor. Whenever we bring her to her grandparents house with all her cousins, this toy is the highlight for all the little ones. I would recommend this toy for eveyone
