review/summary: More Leaks Than Pampers Swaddlersreview/text: I have used both Pampers Baby Dry and Swaddlers for my newborn. Baby Dry diapers puff up like a marshmallow when they are wet making it very easy to tell when it is time to change baby. Stage 1 seems to be a different size for the two styles with Baby Dry less roomy than the Swaddlers style. I have never had a leak with Swaddlers but with Baby Dry the liquid poop keeps shooting up the back of the diaper and onto baby's clothes. Other than the leaks, the ruffled edges that keep contents inside the diaper often fold inside and I have to manually pull them out after changing baby. If I forget to do that the diapers aren't sealed properly and poop has a way to get outside of the diaper around the leg area as well. With Pampers Swaddlers the ruffled edges are always properly aligned.
