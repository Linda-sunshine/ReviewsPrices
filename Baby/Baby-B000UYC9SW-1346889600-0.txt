review/summary: sizing wrongreview/text: I went by the sizing recommended and ordered an xs. It is TOO SMALL!!! I can bearly get my tiny newborn in the wrap. I was worried about the size when I received it but went ahead and washed it according to directions because multiple reviews said it would stretch out and not to worry about it feeling too small. I've tried stretching it out multiple times and wearing it with my baby in it but I'm still not happy. I'm only 5'0" and lost all of my pregnancy weight right away so I feel like it should fit without a problem. I think I would really like it if I had the next size up but don't want to spend the money after I bought this one in case the next size up doesn't work either. Wondering if I should have just purchased the moby wrap even though it seemed intimidating. I will say that my newborn does seem to like the wrap but I really don't think I will be able to get her in it much longer.
