review/summary: Sent defective, bent gate TWICE!review/text: So disappointing. I returned the first gate because it was bent so out of shape that the latch would never line up properly. I communicate this to the vendor and reordered the gate only to receive another bent gate. What a waste of my time. Don't bother with this vendor.
