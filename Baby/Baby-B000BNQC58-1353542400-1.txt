review/summary: Perfect night light for kids of all agesreview/text: We bought this after our daughter was born to help her sleep at night, but it has helped our 6 year old, who shares a room with her, too. He is afraid of the dark, and the nightlight he had by his bed just wasn't cutting it. We'd routinely go to check on him before we went to bed and find he had gotten up and turned on a lamp. The Cloud b Turtle casts enough light to help him get to sleep without being distracting to the baby. She loves to play with the turtle (she's now 10 months old) and has figured out how to turn it on and off and change the colors (there are 3: orange, blue, and green). When we looked at the stock photos we didn't believe it would really project stars that well, but it really does. The stars are easy to see in the dark and very soothing to the kids. We've had to change the batteries twice in the almost 10 months we've had it. An indicator we realized, is that the blue light stops working first. That's how we know it's time to change the batteries.
