review/summary: LOVE it - totally recommend for jobs where you sit for hours on endreview/text: I bought it at the beginning of my pregnancy and haven't really used it until my 6th month, because I didn't have much of a belly (people at work didn't notice until I was 6 months....) but now I use it all the time. The baby is a very fun one, and he is full of life.... he hates anything on my belly, and he has previously pushed the elastic of my panties down a couple of inches because apparently it was annoying him. He kicks and kicks until he moves it down. Hillarious. So, the craddle wasn't his favorite thing, he was pushing it, and kicking it, and no, it is not tight, it is not meant to be digging into your skin, but my baby is like that.I like that it feels supportive while it doesn't feel like you are lifting it, or like you have anything strong pulling it up. I also have something like a panty with a thing craddle around the lower belly and more panty covering the belly. That is not comfortable for me, because I work sitting on a chair 8 hours, and what that thinner piece was doing was to dig in my belly and like fold it down there. It is not comfortable for me sitting, while for a nurse friend it is comfy.This, though, feels great when I sit down because it does exactly the oposite. There is no fold when you are wearing it under your belly. It feels like your belly is perky naturally and it super comfortable. The baby is now used to it, because I decided to be more stubborn than him, and I loved how it feels. It also feels good when walking around, but it makes me want to go to the bathroom more often (like anything else).
