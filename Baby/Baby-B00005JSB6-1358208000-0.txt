review/summary: Product would bunch upreview/text: I have twins, so we go through a lot of diapers. Huggies are known for quality, but this box of diapers were horrible. I have bought about 12-15 boxes of various sizes from Sam's club and they were of nice quality. The diapers would bunch up really bad and when I would change them, the diaper filling was all seperated. I was very disappointed with the quality of my online purchase.
