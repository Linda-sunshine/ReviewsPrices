review/summary: Awesome high chairreview/text: I wish I knew How hard it was to keep a regular high chair clean when I registered for my shower. My oldest is 18 months and I originally purchased this for when we're not home, and for him to use once is baby sister is old enough to use the big high chair. This is great, it's very easy to clean and comes in handy if I want to feed him a snack in the family room. Awesome purchase for the price.
