review/summary: Just as good as the othersreview/text: I had spent the extra money on the Little Movers for my 27 month old but these are just as good. I have not had a leak yet. My only complaint is the Amazon Mom discount shrinking every time I blink. They are thicker than the Pampers version. I tried the Pampers but stopped after too many leaks. Huggies are the superior diaper.
