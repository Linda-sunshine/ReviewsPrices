review/summary: A complete life-saver!review/text: I am so happy I ordered this product. I am not necessarily sleeping better, because I still have to get up and pee every two hours and am constantly getting beaten up from the inside by this little boy. But when I am in bed and do manage to catch some Zzzz's, I am so much more comfortable.I have two complaints, which aren't even really complaints because I know they can't be remedied:1) Because of the shape of the pillow, the cover is very difficult to get on and off for washing.2) It is hard to turn over from side to side because the pillow is so big and oddly shaped.Again, those are both pretty much unavoidable grievances, because what makes the pillow so great is the odd shape and size. So there you have it! Great for those who can't get comfortable in bed! I am SO happy I have mine--I don't know if I will go back to my regular pillow after this pregnancy is over!
