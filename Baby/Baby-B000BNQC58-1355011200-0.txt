review/summary: Great little toy!review/text: My son is like any kid going through the phase of being afraid of the dark. This really helps light up his room and he counts the stars as he goes to sleep. I like how it turns off after 45 minutes. His favorite color is blue, so he puts it on the blue stars. : ) I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a kiddo that needs a little something more than a night light.
