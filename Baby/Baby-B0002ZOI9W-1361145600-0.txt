review/summary: keeps my kid happyreview/text: it is a little rocking chair, portable and small easy to take from rooom to room. has the little mobile and lasts quite a whiel without it, my sister actually has a 5 and 3 year old and htey both still have and use these as little rockers without the mobile bar of coarse. my kid is prett yhappy with it to plays with the bugs but hates the calming vibrations, no fault of the chair though my neice loves it, it is more of a kid by kid basis i would imagine
