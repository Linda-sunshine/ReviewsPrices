review/summary: Thank God for ITZBEEN!review/text: My mono-mono twin girls came home at 3lbs on Christmas Eve. Our heads were spinning and I was EXHAUSTED. My brother-in-law brought this home for us and it really helped me keep track of the basics. I label each device with their names and you simply press a button and it keeps time for you. It has a button for the following: diaper, feeding,sleeping, a clock and other helpful features. It has a small "night light" and lighted display. I think ppl should use it for what it was made for to indicate how long its been since... Nice gift for a parent with multiples. It was easier just to use the Itsbeen than trying to write stuff down in the dark at 2am when your brain seems full of marshmellows!
