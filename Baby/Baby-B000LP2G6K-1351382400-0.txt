review/summary: I'm a believerreview/text: Sturdy construction. I bought this because I hoped I wouldn't have to buy Crib and this would serve as a dual purpose option. Best decision ever. It is spacious, and the bassinet is 5 cm taller than the crib I was thinkingabout so this was even better. It is better to get this model over one with the changing table since I have found that they are not as sturdy as one might think. Overall great buy. Highly recommend.
