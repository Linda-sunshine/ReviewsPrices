review/summary: 1st time mommyreview/text: This is a great toy! I love that it has the removeable portion that has the toys on it-that is great if I need to set her in her crib for a few mins to do something quick-keeps her busy. She loves the phone and the barn door that opens, along with the shapes that she can take off and I love that they are attached so that I don't have to hunt them down when we put it up! And she pushes this around the house forever, it really encourages her to walk---if she could just learn how to turn it now, we'd be set!!
