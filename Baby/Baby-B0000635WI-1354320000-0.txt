review/summary: Too big and uncomfortable.review/text: I found this beast of a pillow to be way too large and poofy to get comfortable with. I had a kink in my neck after sleeping with it because it kept my head so far off the mattress. I also felt like it was way too big when I tried to use it to support my top leg when sleeping on my side. It was also a huge pain to try and punch into place after getting up to use the bathroom at night, which happens frequently when pregnant. By the time I had it arranged, I was wide awake. I had better luck getting some inexpensive down pillows that I could mold around me as needed for support, and that were easier to get into place after getting up in the night.
