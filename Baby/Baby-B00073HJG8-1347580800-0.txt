review/summary: Secure!review/text: This holds my massive collection of stuffed animals that I have been collecting since I was a child. I am glad to have them out of the box. Now if I could just keep the cats from nesting in it all would be well with the world. So far it has been hanging for over a month with no tearing out of the walls or falling apart, or any fluffies falling out. Certainly worth a try.
