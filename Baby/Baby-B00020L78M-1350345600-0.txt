review/summary: Play yardreview/text: This has been a life saver. We've been able to block off our twin babies from our 18 month old who doesn't know how to be gentle, yet. It's flexible in its "joints" so you can choose how much to angle/bend each panel. I don't think we've ever had it in the same position twice. I step over it (I'm 5'5, but my husband pulls out one end to go in and out).
