review/summary: BEST Potty of ALL!!review/text: I tried the Cars potty, like this one:The First Years Disney Pixar Cars Rev and Go Potty Systembut all my son wanted to do was play with it - colossal fail! Then, I tried a potty seat that fit on my toilet seat, but it required so much help from me that it removed the biggest motivator of all: being a "big boy". When I put this potty in the bathroom - my son immediately recognized that this was like "Mommy's potty" and sat right down! He has loved it ever since! He is comfortable sitting for long periods of time due to the shape, contours and material. It is a DREAM to clean - it gleams such a shiny white when wiped up with Clorox wipes. Such a breeze to clean, my son sometimes even cleans his own potty. He enjoys dumping his bowl into the big potty and flushing it. My next step when he gets a bit bigger will be to get a great stool like this one:The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stooland a toilet seat like this one:KOHLER K-4732-0 Transitions Quiet-Close Toilet Seat, White. But for now, this is all that a three year old needs! The pee pee barrier is wonderful - not too obstructive to mount but keeps pee from getting everywhere. And I love the non skid bottom. Overall, I rarely give products five stars but this one deserves it! Like the Puj tub, it is on my list of baby gifts forever!!!
