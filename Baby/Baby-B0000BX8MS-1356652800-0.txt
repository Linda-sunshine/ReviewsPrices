review/summary: Great for cold weather!review/text: Love this product. Fits my 29 lb, 17 month old toddler perfectly with room to stand in his crib and move around, but prevents him from trying to climb out. Don't know what I will do when he grows out of it, as he will not sleep with a blanket on. I may just have to buy two of them and sew a giant one of my own!
