review/summary: Love this booster seatreview/text: We are really happy with this booster seat. We leave it in the car and take it with us when we go out to eat. It was a lifesaver during the holidays when we went to visit friends and relatives who did not have high chairs. It's not compact so if you want something small this isn't for you. But I did research and ultimately decided that this one best fit our needs. When you turn the straps into a handle, it's easy to throw over your shoulder and bring with you. I also love how it can adjust for different table heights. Our baby loves sitting in it and loves being able to be at our level at the table.
