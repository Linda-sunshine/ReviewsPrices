review/summary: PERFECT!!!!review/text: Seriously perfect. My baby is just learning to walk hasn't taken any steps on his own yet and needed just the little support that this walker gives. The toys are entertaining and WHAT I LOOOVE is that the wheels have a tension adjustment so he doesn't go flying. Why all walkers don't have this is beyond me. duh! Just perfect.
