review/summary: Great for the boys, but wish it was also a stoolreview/text: This works better then any chair I tried for my 18 month old son (3 total). The seat is long enought to fit his butt, and the cup is tall enough to stop the mess, the back keeps him from falling off the back, the rubber keeps the whole thing in place, simple clean up. However, I wish it also closed to a stool, my daughters did and she is 6 now. We still use it as a stool in the bathroom. It just seems that it would be nice if it grew with the kid.
