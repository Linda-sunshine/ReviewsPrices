review/summary: Outstanding Quality and Performancereview/text: I purchased this gate in order to limit access to an area by our 5 dogs, 3 of which are larger, the largest being a boxer, and this gate has worked flawlessly. I purchased the light gray, which for some reason is more expensive, but the room I bought it for is in blue colors and I just thought it would work best. The gate was very easy to install - I highly recommend that you watch the video which is located in the pictures at the top of the listing that will quickly guide you through installation. The metal was thicker and of a higher quality than I expected, and definitely the best of all the gates I have purchased in the past with the possible exception of a 5 piece wooden gate set that is only about 18 inches high - used to corral our pugs. We do not have human children (!) so I can't speak to the functionality with kids, but with our 4 legged 'kids' I can highly recommend this product. I love how the gate will open in either direction, and how it stays open if you open it fully (it kinda 'clicks' in place) but if only opened partially it closes itself. It is so easy to open as well. I can't think of a single negative thing to say with this product, and that is really saying something. It's nice looking, well made, functions well and a flexible design. What more can you get from any product? This exceeds my expectations and therefor gets a 5 star rating.
