review/summary: Perfect for baby's confidencereview/text: My daughter was been able to take a few steps (2) for a while now but then lacks the confidence to keep going. with this walker I have seen an improvement in two days! I love the fact that there are two speeds for the wheels which keeps her going on wood/tile floors as well as carpeting. Also she loves all the toys buttons and music on the front sometimes she will even walk around it to start pushing the buttons. Overall great purchase for the money!
