review/summary: Great pregnancy pillow!review/text: I was having a very difficult time sleeping before buying this pillow! This pillow has made a huge difference in helping me sleep better and not be so sore in the morning. I am normally a back sleeper but since becoming pregnant for the second time not being able to sleep on my back has been very problematic. Starting at about 14-15 weeks pregnant I wasn't able to get a good night's sleep. I would commonly develop a headache at night and wake with one in the morning. Before purchasing and using this pillow I would toss and turn all night. I would sleep on one side and after an hour or so the whole side of my body I was sleeping on would be sore, tingle, and feel numb. I would then have to rotate from side to side all night and by morning I hadn't slept and was sore on both sides of my body. Since buying this product, I prop myself up with this pillow and neck pillows to sleep somewhat sitting up. The pillow makes this very comfortable. Then about halfway through the night I lay on on this pillow and rotate sides. Somehow the soreness has gone away since using this pillow. I love the back support it provides and cradling of my growing tummy. Of course curling the pillow in between my legs for additional support is crucial and very comfortable! The pillow is very large and bulky and takes up a lot of space in the bed but it is soooooooo worth it! My husband doesn't like it very much since it is like a wall between us in bed but my sleep has dramatically improved since using this pillow. I can't imagine making it through the last half of my pregnancy without it! I would recommend this pillow to anyone! It has so many uses as well that I can see using it even after my pregnancy. It folds around you in so many different positions. It comes with a hardcard that shows all the different positions and uses for the pillow. Great price and great buy!
