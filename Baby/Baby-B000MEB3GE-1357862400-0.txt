review/summary: Saved my life with baby #2, Buying again for #3!review/text: I picked one of these up for my second child, wondering if I would *really* need it, since I fed, diapered, and napped my first completely on-demand for the first six months. However, I knew that with two little munchkins, that exhausting game was not going to work, and hoped this timer would help us to establish a better routine. As it turns out, baby #2 was a high-needs newborn, complete with a fun little colostomy. When I say that the Itzbeen baby timer saved my life, I'm not sure this is an exaggeration. Those first few months home with him (and a two year old) were the hardest of my entire life and this timer helped me to understand his rhythms so that I could work with them to establish a routine that worked for all of us. I used the "90 Minute Miracle" principles to help him sleep and the timer really helped me to keep track of his waking and sleeping. My only complaint is that I wish it had a memory so I could go back and see the last, say, 5 or 6 time intervals for each button. However, I guess that's what a good old fashioned pen and paper are for.Oh, and my other complaint... Child #2 became completely fascinated with this little gadget. One day shortly after his first birthday, he got a hold of it, and while my daughter was bathing, he decided to see what would happen if he chucked it in the bathtub. Our beloved Itzbeen did not survive this unfortunate event. Now that our third child is on the way, I plan to purchase another of these and hope it does not suffer the same fate as its late cousin.
