review/summary: Too much too figure outreview/text: I recommend this product before your baby arrives. Trying to figure it out with a newborn is no fun. Honestly it's a huge pain to put on!! It's super long and I'm a skinny person. I also have zero patients. I also felt like I couldn't get it tight enough and didnt feel safe putting my baby in it! But that's just me and lots of people use the moby and love it. It's just not for me. I tried various products and the only thing my baby will sit in is a balboa sling! Used safely and properly of course. Good luck!!
