review/summary: LEAK, BLOW OUT, MESS MESS MESSreview/text: These leak so bad. Any time my 1 yr old goes number two, I have to change his clothes and mine. His PJs are soaked around the diaper if he sleeps through the night. I am terribly disappointed. I love pampers swaddlers for babies and thought I would try these to save some money, well no money was saved because I feel like I use double the diapers to keep my "baby dry"
