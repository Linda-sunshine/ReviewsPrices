review/summary: my 9 month old loves it!review/text: i chose this rating because my baby loves this, she loves the lights and sounds.what i like aout it is that you can remove the top portion and take it anywhere. the only i dont like about its that is very light weight and when she pushes it , it can tip over very easlily.
