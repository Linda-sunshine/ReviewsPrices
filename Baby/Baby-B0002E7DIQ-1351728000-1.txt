review/summary: nicereview/text: I have had this pillow for about 4 months now I am 7 mths prego and I was just thinking last night I would love to order another one because this one has flattened out so much. When I first got the pillow I feel like I laid about 1 foot higher than my husband! It was HUGE! I still do love it though because it has the support for your back and front. You can lay on back in such a way that it is not quite flat on your back and not quite on yourside, but just enough support to keep you comfortable. I still am sleeping really great through the night. Only getting up once to use the restroom.
