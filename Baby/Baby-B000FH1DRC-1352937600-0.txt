review/summary: Best diapers we've triedreview/text: Used these since our son was born. The color change strip is helpful, especially for newborns. Most importantly they leak less than the other brands we tried and they seem to wick away moisture better, keeping the baby's skin drier and rash free. Cheaper when bought through amazon warehouse deals and perfectly fine quality.
