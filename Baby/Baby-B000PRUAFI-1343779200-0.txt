review/summary: SUPER B GATEreview/text: I got this gate for a Yorkie puppy, a small dog weighing about three pounds, delivery was very prompt and setup of the gate was very easy. Everyone in my house hold loves this gate cause its easy to swing open and then can lock when you want to leave it open and it confines our puppy very well. Overall its been a great experience with this product and I would buy it again in a heartbeat. (Worth every penny) and a great gate for the price!!
