review/summary: Worth the good pricereview/text: We were given an older booster seat for free and after finding it frustrating to use, we decided to bite the bullet and pay for a nice seat. This is an excellent seat. The ability to fold up and be carried has been great for trips and meals out. It is very easy to clean and having a one piece base means food doesn't get stuck everywhere and it's really easy to clean. The ability to adjust the height is something we rarely use but is very convenient.
