review/summary: Great pottyreview/text: I bought this chair as a second potty for my 1 1/2 year old daughter while I potty trained my son. I already owned a a white one for him.The great part of this potty is its simplicity. The high back is genius. The 2 piece design is perfect. My wife thought my son would like a "car" potty. It broke down into 4 pieces. My kids tore it apart playing with it.
