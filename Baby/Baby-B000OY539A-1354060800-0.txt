review/summary: Best carrier of 4 we've triedreview/text: We have tried the baby bjorn (absolutely the WORST carrier ever, I have no idea why they are so popular), a sling carrier, the Boba, and the Moby. Of all four, the Moby is BY FAR THE MOST COMFORTABLE.Also, because my daughter has had tight muscles since birth that effects her digestion and general comfort, we have been going to a physical therapist and the therapist says the moby is the best for baby's bodies. That is a big deal for us.Pros:Best carrier for baby's bodyBest carrier for parent's body (Mom who has a really bad back can wear it comfortably for over an hour)Fits Mom and DadCons:It's true, the moby takes a week or so to get the hang of, but after that it is really no big deal.It's also true that because of its length it is better to pre-wrap it at home before you go out so you don't end up getting the ends dirty in a parking lot, etc.I think the fabric is a bit too stretchy, which means if I take my daughter out I usually have to re-wrap it before putting her in it again or it's too lose and stretched out. If it's not tight, the baby will sit low and then it will be hard on your back.Not as quick to put on as the soft structured carriers (Boba, Baby Hawk, etc)It can be HOT in the summer, which is nice in the winter thoughWe like having the Boba for situations when speed is crucial (baby is about to have a meltdown if you don't get her wrapped and out the door in 20 seconds) but we always use the Moby when we have even a bit more time because it is much more comfortable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
