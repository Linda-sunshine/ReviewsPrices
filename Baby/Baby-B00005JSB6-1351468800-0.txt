review/summary: Reliable, Quality Diapersreview/text: I use these as an everyday diaper for my 12-month old daughter, and fortunately they work well as an overnight diaper too. They've never given me a problem - no leaks or blow-outs and they fit well without digging into my baby's skin. My baby has sensitive skin and she doesn't get diaper rash with these, only an occasional irritation if the diaper is left on a little too long (which basically will happen with any diaper brand). I buy these diapers every other month in the 192-count box, which is a good deal, and they tend to last for 1.5 months. I highly recommend them!
