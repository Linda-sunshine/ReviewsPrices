review/summary: Worst diapers everreview/text: As soon as I put one of the diapers on my baby it was instant trouble. The diaper wrapped around his waist tightly and thus began the symbiotic relationship. It began controlling my baby, making him do things he wouldn't normally do. Within seconds of wearing the diaper my baby began strangling the family turtles. For years we have had these turtles free roaming the house, and not once has the baby ever attacked them. When I tried to stop him from killing Hector(our eldest turtle) he spit some kind of corrosive material directly into my mouth, which then destroyed most of my front teeth. At night my son walks the hallways scratching the walls, and rattling the door knobs. So far we've lost seven of our thirteen turtles. The others can't be found but based on previous happening I assume they're dead. The other day my wife was breast feeding our son when all of a sudden I heard her screech. The baby had a tentacle coming from deep within his throat, and was injecting some sort of toxin in through her nipple. My wife has fallen ill and the doctors can't seem to find a way to help her. I've tried taking the diaper off, but unfortunately the baby and the diaper have amalgamated. It's only a matter of time before he takes me down. I would not recommend this product for babies.
