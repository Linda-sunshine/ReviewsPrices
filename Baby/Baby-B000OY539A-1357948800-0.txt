review/summary: Trickyreview/text: I have not been successful at figuring out how this wrap works. I got it a while ago and it is just too much fabric and wrapping for my needs. I needed something quick and more user friendly I know some people that are successful at it so maybe it's just me but it just didn't work out. Great idea though. I am going to borrow my friends K'Tan and see if that works better for me.
