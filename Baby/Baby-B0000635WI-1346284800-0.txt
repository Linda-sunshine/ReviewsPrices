review/summary: Love the pillowreview/text: I am 24 weeks pregnant and have started getting uncomfortable in bed. I heard this was the best and most popular pregnancy pillow and I love it! It is definitely big but it's the only pillow I need and I can support my head, belly and legs with just this pillow. I didn't notice the fabric being scratchy at all. It's not silky super soft fabric, but it's just fine for me. And there is a cover on it so I can wash it which is really nice. I imagine this will be nice for breastfeeding as well.I highly recommend this pillow to help with sleeping and making things more comfortable! It's kind of like another person in our bed but it's worth it! It's also pretty pricey but I'm glad I bought it and I have loved it so far.
