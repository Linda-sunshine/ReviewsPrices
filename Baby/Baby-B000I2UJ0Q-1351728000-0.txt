review/summary: Loves it at 5 months old!review/text: My 5 month-old LOVES this jumperoo. My oldest, now 7 year-old daughter, had the first generation Jumperoo (it did not rotate, just bounced) and she only mildly enjoyed it, so we gave it away once she outgrew it. We bought this Rainforest Jumperoo on Craigslist last week; it took my daughter 2 days to figure out how to bounce in it and she'll happily play in it for 20-30 minutes at a time. She likes the teether and all the spinning features that she can study and bat around. Not sure how other 5 month-olds would do on it; she is big for her age (more like an 8-month old in weight and length) and has no problems sitting up in it. This toy folds up reasonably well if you want to stow it in a corner, and the music/sounds are only mildly annoying (like all baby toys); we keep the sound off most of the time.
