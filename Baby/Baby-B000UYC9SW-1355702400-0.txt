review/summary: Saved my arms and back!review/text: When I was on maternity leave I needed something that would help keep my hands free. I used the Ergo witht the infant insert but that was too bulky so I needed to find something that was easy to use and was not bulky. I bought and returned the dr. sears sling because it had way too much fabric. A friend recommended the moby wrap but I didn't want to deal with the wrapping. Someone else recommended the K'tan and I'm so glad I bought it. It takes a little practice but it works. If you're looking for something easy and keeps your baby snug get the K'tan!
