review/summary: Life saver!review/text: THis pillow is an absolute life saver. Although big, I wouldn't trade it for any other pillow or pillows in the world. It can be used several different ways. It is so comfortable and I am so glad I still have mine for my second pregnancy. If not for this pillow, my first pregnancy would have been so miserable laying in bed. I reccomend this pillow to every pregnant woman.
