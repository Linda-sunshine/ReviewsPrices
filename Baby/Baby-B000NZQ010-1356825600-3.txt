review/summary: great for walking and learningreview/text: My daughter had this on her sons Christmas list.He loves pushing it all over.Lots of musical songs and buttons to push.I wish they just didn't have all the flashing lights on toys. Kids don't need all the stimulation from lights. Everything is brightly colored.
