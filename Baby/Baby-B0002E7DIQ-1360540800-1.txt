review/summary: Annoying Seamreview/text: I really like the pillow and it helps me, but I have had to add a pillow in the center because the material used for the liner and cover does not stretch or give and the seam in the neck area is tight and puts pressure on any part of your body that happens to rest there. Very poor design. I am going to have to make my own liner and case, which is a real bother.
