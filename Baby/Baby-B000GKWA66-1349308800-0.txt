review/summary: Wonderful toy!review/text: We bought the sleep sheep 6.5 months ago for my newborn and she loves it. There is a timer switch that has it turn off at 23 min, 45 min, or if you put the switch in the middle it has continuous play (45min is usually long enough for my daughter. It is very soft and portable. I love the size of the full size sheep although I like the sound options better on the travel size one (although as stated above this one is also very portable). In 6.5 months we are just now replacing the batteries. My only complaint would be that the buttons can get a little touchy.
