review/summary: strong chemical smellreview/text: I bought this one because I had read about the strong smell of some of the other Graco pack and play porducts online, and I had seen no such reviews for this one. MY mistake! this one too stinks so badly that I get headaches. God knows what it'll do to a little baby, so I returned it.Oh and it probably won't fit through your doors unless you pack it.
