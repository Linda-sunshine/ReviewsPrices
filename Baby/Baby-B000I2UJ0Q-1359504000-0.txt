review/summary: A must havereview/text: I highly reccomend this to every parent. My son loves it and has been playing it in since he was 3 months. At first he started to just bounce around and listen to the music, but then each day he discovered something new to play with. It also helps him build leg strength and coordination. Also for parents it's great because you set your baby in it and let him play while you grab something to eat or clean up around the house. Definitely a must have!!
