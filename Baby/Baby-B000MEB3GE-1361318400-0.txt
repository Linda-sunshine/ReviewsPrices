review/summary: The best piece of equipment you will EVER own as a new parent!!!review/text: My girlfriend recommended this to me, and just because of her glowing recommendation I purchased it. I owned it two months before giving birth to my son. As a new parent, I knew life would go from normal to psychotic, but it wasn't until I gave birth that I got to truly instant what that meant. In the midst of NO sleep for many consecutive weeks, no time to eat, drink, shower, brush my teeth, pee, or for that matter think, this product saved our lives. We used it to track everything from feedings to naps to diaper changes. The best part is that it has a bonus button you can use to track anything you want (I used it to track my pain meds after a C-section delivery). Today my son is 11 weeks old and we still use this thing religiously. In the middle of the night it lights up at the touch of a button, and also acts as a flashlight. Parents to be, get this today. If you have a friend that is expecting, get this for her today! You won't be sorry, I promise.
