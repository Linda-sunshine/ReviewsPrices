review/summary: love love lovereview/text: Super soft , super absorbent and super cute.. never ever leaks with pee but sometimes leaks with a blowout. But that's pretty normal specialy if the baby is on his back..holds pee for 12 hrs at night with no problems at all.. My daughter is 4 months old 16 lbs..she's in size 3 now although size 2 still fits her, I prefer going one size up when the baby is about to reach the weight limit..I was going to switch to cruisers after size 3, but now swaddlers have size 4 & 5.. so I might keep using them..
