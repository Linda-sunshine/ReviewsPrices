review/summary: Love this seat!review/text: When I first looked to get a potty, I asked a few friends with kids who had potty trained, and they said a seat is a seat, there's not too much difference. The first seat I bought, I just picked based on price, and the fact that it could double as a stool, and it works just fine. I then had someone hand me down this seat and realized how much better it was than the other that I had. It is simpler - only 2 pieces, no moving parts or ways to get pinched, like with the other one. It was easier for my daughter to sit on - the back, plus that splash guard guide her to sit in the exact correct spot so she is aimed over the bowl (the other one she moves around on it all over the place and sometimes doesn't sit in the right spot). Finally, she likes to empty her own bowl into the big potty, so this makes it much easier to do that, I have to help her with the other potty...although I realize this might not be a benefit to some families! I really just like this one a lot better, the quality is clearly higher.I have to say, my daughter is small, and after reading some other reviews I see it might not be good for very large children, but from my experience it fits her fine and she will not likely outgrow it!
