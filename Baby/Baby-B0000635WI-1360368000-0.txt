review/summary: Great for Breast Cancer Reconstruction, too!review/text: Since undergoing numerous surgeries for breast cancer reconstruction, it becomes difficult to sleep only on my back. Now, I can get a 45 degree angle against my back plus have the pillow under my knees...and it doesn't move like regular pillows! Love it! Now my 11 yr old want to use it to read!
