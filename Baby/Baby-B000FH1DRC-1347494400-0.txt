review/summary: Disappointed.review/text: I gave birth in April 2012 and we had been using cloth diapers during the day and Huggies Little Snugglers at night/while out until my daughter grew out of size 2 diapers a couple weeks ago. My husband and I liked having the convenience of the wetness indicator strip, so I ordered a case of Pampers Swaddlers assuming they would be the same as the Huggies. Unfortunately, after the first night of using Pampers my daughter started to get a diaper rash, and by later that afternoon it looked like a chemical burn with layers of skin sloughing off and bleeding at the areas where the diaper was resting on her skin. We immediately bought some size 3 Huggies and a week later she is almost as good as new. This may totally be a coincidence, but from doing some online research it seems like this is a common problem with Pampers. Every baby is different and I guess mine just didn't work well with Pampers. My recommendation would be to try out a smaller pack before buying 174 of these... lesson learned! They also smell very strongly of baby powder, and the smell drove me nuts all night with our daughter in our room.
