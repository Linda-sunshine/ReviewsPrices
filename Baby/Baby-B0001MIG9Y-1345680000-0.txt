review/summary: Huggies are better . . .review/text: I, like many other reviewers, fell into the trap of buying these because they were going for a great price. My son had been wearing Huggies size 3, but I thought these might be worth a try. My husband and I now have a joke that our son has been crawling in the cobwebs again. These diapers fall apart and the fibers look like little spiderwebs hanging off his little bum. Sometimes we find our son plucking the "webs" off his diaper like someone plucking a chicken. I would not recommend these diapers, especially for active babies.
