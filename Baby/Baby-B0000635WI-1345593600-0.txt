review/summary: Adequite size with nice shapereview/text: The pillow is quite large, which can probably fit for a person 6' tall. The shape works great with one side holding my neck well and the other side between legs. It does occupy quite some space, but not a problem at all for a king-size bed. The cover is white, which is easy to stain. Fabric is OK but not the most comfortable. Overall a good buy!
