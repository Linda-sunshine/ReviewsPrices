review/summary: Almost never leak out the sides, and have the wetness indicator I do not see how anyone can do without.review/text: These diapers almost never leak (maybe once a week on a powerful number 2).Plus, I do not understand how anyone ever did without the wetness indicator strip--you do not have to feel for the weight of the diaper, you just look at the strip. Simple. And to me, every other diaper without that strip is...not a diaper I would want to use.
