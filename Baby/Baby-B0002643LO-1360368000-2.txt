review/summary: Love Pampersreview/text: Pamper diapers are my favorite. I love being able to order the bigger box and get free shipping. Plus, after hunting around price shopping Amazon does pretty good. And it def beats Diapers.com. I will continue to buy pampers. They don't leak very often at all. And they don't bother my now 5 months old bottom at all.
