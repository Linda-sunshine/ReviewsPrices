review/summary: Top purchase for new baby at home...review/text: I live in a cold appartment and although I have a heater it is not ideal since it only heats our room and it dries my baby's nose... so we decided we needed to put more layers on him but without the risk of adding blankets which is very dangerous and honestly didnt let me sleep calm thinkng the baby might suffocate.Neither my wife nor I knew these sleepsacks existed but I found it on Amazon and decided to purchase one ... SURPRISE!!! After 3 weeks of continuous using it (with occasional washing of course) I realized this was the best solution for the night and immediately ordered 3 more of different colors and sizes.Only important detail: try getting synthetic fabrics instead of cotton if you are using a drier after washing them since they do shrink. Also the model that does not hold the baby's arms is a much better option, our baby didn't adjust well to the swaddling and he is comfortable moving his arms at night
