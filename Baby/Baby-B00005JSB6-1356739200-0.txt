review/summary: leaky, corse, and loosereview/text: I usually use the &#34;Little Movers&#34; style for my daughter, but I thought I would try these to see if I could save a few bucks. Unfortunately, I didn't really like these diapers.Here are my issues:- Size for size - the Snug and Dry are a little larger than the Little Movers- Many more leaks w/ the Snug and Dry - hardly ever any leaks w/ Little Movers- Corse, hard, bulky and crunchy material as compared to Little MoversI will not buy these again - I'm going back to the Little Movers as soon as this case is used up!
