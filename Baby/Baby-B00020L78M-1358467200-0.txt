review/summary: Not so sturdyreview/text: I got this for my grandson. At eight months, he is able to push the sides and move it across the floor. He almost pushed it down the other day. That being said, It still proves useful in containing him for play and gives him more freedom that a play pen. I would not leave him alone in it as I would be afraid he would push it down and fall.
