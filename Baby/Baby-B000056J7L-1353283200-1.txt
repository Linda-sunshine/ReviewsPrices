review/summary: Excellent potty chair for boys!!review/text: My son loves this potty chair! We had another but the pee guard wasn't up high enough to keep him from making a big mess everytime he used it. The gaurd on this potty chair is one solid piece apart of the area he goes in, so the guard can't pop off. We tried potty training 6 months ago, but it became such a hassel with the other chair that he didn't want to use it. With his new Baby Bjorn chair we're having no problems, he actually wants to use it.
