review/summary: So glad I bought it!review/text: I know there's been many, many reviews about this pillow but I'm adding mine anyway! I've been debating on buying it for awhile since it's a substantial purchase for a pillow, but after having 2 babies already and dealing with the discomfort, I finally decided to splurge. I'm about to enter my third trimester with my 3rd baby and have only recently been having lots of back and hip pain. I had no trouble getting comfortable at night, but would wake up exhausted, stiff, and sore from the ways I slept. I went and bought this pillow yesterday and while it took me a little while to get situated with it, once I did, I was in heaven. Several reviews I read complained about it being too big...well both my husband and I are larger people and we have a queen size bed and it didn't bother us at all. In fact, my husband kept commenting on how comfortable I looked :-) My ONLY 2 complaints are that the fabric is cheap feeling and itchy, and it is too long for me. I'm 5'3 and I kept having to shift it back up between my legs or shift it back down under my neck. I do normally move a lot at night, but I just took care of this by switching the side the pillow was on every time I got up to use the bathroom.Overall, after one night with this pillow, I'm very satisfied. I only deducted a star because of the cost and quality.
