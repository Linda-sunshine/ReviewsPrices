review/summary: It worksreview/text: I got this belly cradle when I was about 5 months along, I really didn't use it much until I got to 8 months though. I am on my feet 8+ hours a day and when my belly started to get really heavy and started hurting my back I began using the cradle daily. It really does help support the weight of your belly and take some strain off of your lower back.My only complaint would be that it's a little uncomfortable to wear while sitting for long periods of time. Also, I will agree with the other reviewers that you should most definitely purchase the size larger than what they are recommending on the package. I am 5'1" and weigh 160# at 9 months pregnant but if I would have purchased the small size (which by their standards would be my size) it would not have fit. I am now on the last set of loops on my medium and it fits perfectly.
