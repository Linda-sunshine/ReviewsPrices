review/summary: This is a must purchase for the pregnant woman!review/text: This is coming from a 6 month pregnant lady. I purchased this on Amazon, it came right away and it has been heaven sent. I am a stomach sleeper, and was 5 months along when sleeping on my stomach was getting uncomfortable. This got good reviews so I gave it a go. Well it has been the best investment so far during my pregnancy. I wrap it around me on long car trips because it supports my back, I have had terrible back pain, and this support really helps.It is hard to go anywhere and not take it. I started sleeping on it when it hurt too much to sleep on my stomach, it certainly is not as good as sleeping on my stomach, but I don't have a choice, and this is the most comfortable I will be having to sleep on my side, the support is wonderful.Every pregnant lady needs this, it helps with back pain, and makes you sleep on your side. It has many uses. My husband also uses it when he watches tv, before I an steal it back from him.I call it my "snuggy"...yes I love it.
