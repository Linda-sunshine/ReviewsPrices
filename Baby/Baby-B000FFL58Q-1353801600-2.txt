review/summary: There's a lot to do!review/text: I bought this for my 3 month old, and am happy with it. I like how you can change all the toys around so it doesn't get boring. I also like the material the mat is made of. It's easy to clean and it feels different than a blanket so my baby knows she's in a new place. The only thing I can think of that I wish was different is the lights. They are small, and even in a dark room they are not very bright. I bought this specifically because it had lights, so that was a little disappointing. But overall, my baby likes it, so I do too.
