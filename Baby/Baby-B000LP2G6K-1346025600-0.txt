review/summary: Works great for usreview/text: I bought this even though I was worried about some of the reviews about the stability of the mattress. Well, I'm glad I did. We are using it as a bassinet at grandma's house. The mattress, though not super cushy, is plenty soft for a baby. We also had it set up as a pack n play, and the mattress locked in to the metal frame with both snaps and Velcro. It was very stable, it didn't move. Perfect for what we need it for!
