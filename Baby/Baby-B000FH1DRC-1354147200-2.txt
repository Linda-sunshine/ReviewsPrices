review/summary: Love the EBulk Packagingreview/text: We are a Pampers family, but we like best about this product is the Ebulk packaging. We have the diapers on a subscribe and save delivery once a month, and the count seems to be perfect each month. I love that there aren't multiple diaper boxes to throw away - the packaging reduces waste.
