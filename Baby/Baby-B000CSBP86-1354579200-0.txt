review/summary: I can get more stuff done!review/text: I have other baby carriers and not one can compare to this one. It's easy to use. I do not have to have any help to put on or put baby into, Baby is very cozy in this. My baby usually falls asleep within minutes. I like this product also because I can get stuff done...while toting him around! And the best part.... i can open it up and lay him down, without waking him!!! Super easy and a comfort for mom to wear too! Would hghly recommend
