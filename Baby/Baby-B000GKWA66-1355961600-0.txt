review/summary: Cloud b Sound Machine Soother, Sleep Sheepreview/text: My baby loved it so much it almost felt like cheating. If my baby was changed and fed but was still not happy I would turn this sheep on the setting that sounds like mother's heartbeat when she was still in the belly and she would calm right down and go to sleep. It is very soft and my baby loved looking at it. It has several sound settings - of which she loved the heartbeat the best.
