review/summary: A must-have for momsreview/text: LOVE my K'Tan! It's very handy when I need to be hands-free. And it's easy to get on and get him in and out. The only issue I have is I'm not sure if he's sitting in it quite right. But he seems cozy and falls asleep fast most of the time. I just need to have more patience. I'd totally recommend it.
