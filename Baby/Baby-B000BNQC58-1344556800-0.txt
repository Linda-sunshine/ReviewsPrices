review/summary: Love it!review/text: My 3 year old daughter loooooves this ladybug, my 5 year old son is even jealous but he doesn't sleep in his own room so he doesn't get one.If the room is nice and dark the lights are nice and bright and changing the color is fun for the kids!I love that it is only light and no music. I also love that it has a moon not like those other ones made by the people from pillow pet.I would even by this as presents!!!
