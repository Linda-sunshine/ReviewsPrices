review/summary: Great product for exhausted parents!review/text: This was an invaluable tool in our new parent arsenal. When you have a newborn it can be so easy to loose track of time and forget how long it's been since that last feeding. It makes it easier too if you are lucky enough to have multiple people to take care of the baby, you dont have to remember to ask when they ate last as long as the other person hit the button you know. I didnt use it so much to track the diaper changes, it's pretty obvious when that needs to be done; or to track sleep times since it doesnt really matter as long as they are sleeping! I did find it very helpful for tracking time between doses of teething medicine, since you want to be careful to not give too much too frequently.Overall I would definitely reccomend this to new parents.
