review/summary: Makes me to stiff to movereview/text: I got this pillow because of an injury in my left hip makes me unable to lie on my left side. I can only lie on my back, right side and sometimes my stomach if I'm careful. I like this pillow but using it all night makes me to stiff in the morning. I don't roll over when I use it and I feel a bit like I'm lacking something in the front so I have to hug my old pillow as well. I think I'll keep it around but I won't use it every night.
