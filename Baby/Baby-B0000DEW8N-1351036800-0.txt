review/summary: Love this product!review/text: I love this seat! I can sit it on the couch or floor and it fits great (and securly) in our chairs. We haven't traveled with it yet, but it folds on top of itself into a nice cube and with the tray cover it keeps it sanitary. I look forward to many more years out of this product.
