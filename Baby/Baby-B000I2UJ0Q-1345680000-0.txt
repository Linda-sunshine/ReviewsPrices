review/summary: Hands down the twins' favorite toyreview/text: Length:: 0:40 MinsWe were gifted this toy from a friend. My babies had really good head control early on so we used it pretty early. The frog design of the seat has a high back which I think helps with the support. We have used it since 4+ months and at 8 months it is still their favorite toy. At friends houses we have used others with a different seat design and they wobble all over, in this they have a blast. Its big, as all of them are, I would have two really if someone gave us another one. It is worth every penny to be able to go to the bathroom or cook or just watch them jump for joy.I would recommend this to everyone.
