review/summary: Does its job and less expensive than Pampersreview/text: I was told by several of my colleagues to switch to Huggies Snug & Dry after I complained about my son leaking out of his diapers using Pampers Swaddlers. Since we've made the switch, we've had minimal issues and as an added perk, these diapers were cheaper than Swaddlers! They fit my son well and with Amazon Mom pricing and free shipping, we feel we are getting a good deal compared to buying in the store. Great product!
