review/summary: Amazing star displayreview/text: LOVE this product. We gave it to my 6 year old daughter for Christmas and she uses it every night. She sleeps in an upper bunk bed and the star display is amazingly clear and 'realistic', especially in the green color. There are 3 different color settings. Definitively a great purchase! I like this one much better than the pillow pet dream lite because it displays only stars rather than the funny face the dream lite displays in the center.
