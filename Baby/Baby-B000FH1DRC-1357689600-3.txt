review/summary: works wellreview/text: I recently subscribed to Amazon Mom to have these diapers regularly delivered. I have been very pleased with the quality and have had no surprise leaks. The price through AmazonMom is fantastic and saves me the trouble of hauling 2 little ones out at the last minute in winter to pick up diapers.My only complaint is a slight chemical smell. It's not enough to deter me from using them but it is enough that I notice it each time I'm changing my daughter. We have tried several brands and use Target brand for our older daughter (20 months) but don't like the quality of the generic brand for our littler (4 month old) daughter and you can't beat the convenience of having them regularly show up at your door step. We will definitely stick with Pampers Swaddlers for a while.
