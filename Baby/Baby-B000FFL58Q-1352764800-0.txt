review/summary: Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gymreview/text: This was purchased last year as a gift for my daughter's baby shower. I would recommend it as it has sounds, is colorful and fun and ended up being a favorite once our grandson started laying on it. Again, a great Fisher-Price toy.
