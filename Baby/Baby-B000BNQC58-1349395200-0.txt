review/summary: Long time favoritereview/text: My son accidently recieved this turtle as a Christmas present when he was four. His grandmother meant it for his baby cousin, who has a similar name, but put my son's name on the package. What a lucky mistake for him, as this was one of the best presents she ever gave him. He is seven now and still sleeps with his turtle. He keeps it in his bed and takes it on family trips and it makes a strange place more familiar. When he was younger he'd wake up in the middle of the night, turn on the turtle, and go back to sleep.He now tries to read books in bed by turtle-light, or evturns it on so he can find something in the dark. His sister has the sea turtle, which is also nice.
