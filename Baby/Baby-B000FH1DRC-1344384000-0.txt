review/summary: Love these diapers!review/text: Great diapers, great deal through the subscribe and save program. I buy all my diapers through Amazon!I went up to size 3 for my 7 month old 16.5 lb baby. I think the 2's probably still fit better, but don't want the risk of having a case of 2's on my hand if he has a growth spurt.
