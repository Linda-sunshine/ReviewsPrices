review/summary: Wonderful product!review/text: This turtle was given to us as a baby shower present for our first. I can't imagine having a child without something as terrific as this turtle. It was a great night light and visual soother for him as a baby, as he turned into a toddler, he slept with it- changing the colors and projecting it onto the ceiling and walls as a ritual of security before falling asleep. He looks for the moon, we point out the constellations, and no matter where the turtle is in the room- floor, bed, the stars are perfectly visible and bright. I love the automatic turn off, as he always falls asleep with it on, usually in his arms. He is three and a half now and we've only had to change the batteries twice.The bulb however is failing, and I actually searched for replacement bulbs but can't find any. For the $20, I feel it's absolutely worth buying another one. I also plan to buy these for friends as baby shower gifts. This turtle is well made, works perfectly as stated, and is essential for a positive bedtime experience- young or old. Well done, cloud b!!!
