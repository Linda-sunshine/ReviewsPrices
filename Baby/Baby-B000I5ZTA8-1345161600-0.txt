review/summary: Fits.....but barely. Too BIG. With Adjustments? Perfect.review/text: The size charts never really work for me. Pre-pregnancy I was 137 lbs and a size 2 (ish) smaller at times. But I am 6ft tall----very lean. So I bought the SMALL. I happen to be carrying smaller than most. BUT I have scoliosis and back pain...and also had pressure and achiness when walking or standing for long periods so thought to give this a try. Straight out the box I had to hook it on the second tightest hook...but that was a bit loose for me still..and the tighest hook is around 3 inches away and woudl be too tight at this point (will get there soon though as the betl stretches out.) I think my plan of cutting off the first notch and re-attaching it in the middle of the next two hook sets will work. From what I see...the petite belt woudl have worked best. I am now 24weeks. Have gained 8 lbs total....but am still small. I guess it will fit well by month 7, 8 or 9?It has INDEED allowed me to walk a bit more now (as I do LIKE my long walks!) and to get on my elliptical without the crazy pressure down below...so the purchase was worth it for me!NOTE TO MANUFACTURER: Make the notches (hooks) closer together!
