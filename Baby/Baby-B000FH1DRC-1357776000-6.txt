review/summary: best diapers!review/text: We have used these diapers since we brought our daugther home from the hospital. No issues with diaper rash or big blowouts (that we had with Luvs or Babier R Us diapers when we had some of those diapers passed down to us from friends). The yellow to blue line is also a quick visual to see if she is wet. You can buy these diapers at time at even a greater discount if you look for &#34;open box&#34; deals-these are repackaged diapers (sometimes from returns) but the diapers themselves are perfect and have never been opened from the plastic bags inside the box. These diapers will save you from getting stains on your baby's clothes.
