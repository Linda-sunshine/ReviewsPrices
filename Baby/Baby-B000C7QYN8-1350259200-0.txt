review/summary: Smell funny and not much liquidreview/text: These are OK, but I am switching to another brand. They have absolutely no fragrance, and when wiped on a dirty bottom, leave a funny smell. They are also stiff and have very little liquid. I recommend Earth's Best Sensitive wipes (the new ones in the purple wrapper). They have a lovely natural shea butter scent and are thick, flexible, and very moist.
