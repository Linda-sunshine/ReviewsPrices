review/summary: Yay!review/text: I wanted this for my almost 2 daughter for as long as I can remember.Should of gotten one sooner! It's adorable. It was a toss up between the ladybug and turtle but I love sea turtles so I had to get this for her. I tried it in our bathroom to make sure t works. Yup it does and it's adorable.Maybe I'm more in love with the face of the turtle! I read in another review that there are some fakes out there on amazon so beware. I got a legit one :) the shell is hard so I hope she doesn't wake up if she ends up sleeping with it. But hey it's cool I love it. I also have the sound sheep from cloud b and she loves it too ;)
