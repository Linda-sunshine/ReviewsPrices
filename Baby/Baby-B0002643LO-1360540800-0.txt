review/summary: leaksreview/text: The baby dry diaper is not as good as swaddlers for leakage proof performance. It leaks quite frequently from the back side. One reason may be that my baby has some gas issue. But the swaddlers worked much better to prevent leakage by adding thicker layer on the back. I should have bought it even with the little additional cost. So be warned if you do not want to wash baby cloth that often.
