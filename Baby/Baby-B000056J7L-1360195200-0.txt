review/summary: Excellent potty trainerreview/text: This is great, partly because it's low-profile and doesn't take up much space, and also (best of all) because it's SO easy to clean! The plastic seems super-slippery so all potty messes slide off OR are easily wiped away with cleaning solution. Even the white doesn't discolor over time. The slight rubber bottom keeps it sticking to tile, so that's convenient. I would definitely recommend this to any and all looking for a small, simple quality training toilet. For boys, the pee guard lip works pretty well.
