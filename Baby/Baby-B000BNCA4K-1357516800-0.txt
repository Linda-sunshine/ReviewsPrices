review/summary: Colorful!review/text: This toy would have been a bigger hit with my 5 1/2 month old grandson if the arcs had been slightly firmer. He's at the age where everything goes in his mouth - we think he's teething - and he seemed to prefer slightly &#34;harder&#34; toys. This one is very soft and pliable.
