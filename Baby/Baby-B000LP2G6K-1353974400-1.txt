review/summary: Not Sturdy for a 16lb infantreview/text: I received this as a registry item. I am very disappointed in the product. I only just opened it b/c my daughter is beginning to learn to crawl and we need a safe location for her while we get ready in the morning or cook dinner. Unfortunately b/c the mattress is so flimsy and she doesn't crawl yet, she falls over very easily (even with a boppy to hold her up). The mattress bends both ways and does not use the legs to support it. I am looking to replace or return this item. The bassinet (which we never used) is a little more sturdy b/c of the metal bars, but she's too big and pulls herself over to the edge and could pull herself up and over.My sister has a great pack and play (at my mom's) where the bottom does not bend the opposite direction, which I think makes it a ton more sturdy.Very disappointed.
