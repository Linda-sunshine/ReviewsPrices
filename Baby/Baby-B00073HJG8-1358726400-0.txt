review/summary: Excellent Hammock but use your own wall anchorsreview/text: Just recently installed this hammock. After stretching and marking the drill points with a pencil, I installed the corner hook into the wall stud and the two perimeter hooks into the drywall, using the supplied anchors that came with the screws. Unfortunately, these anchors do not have any teeth and could not grip the drywall. Hence, once all my child's stuffys were loaded on, one of the anchors begin to pull out of the wall. I took out the cheap anchors, filled the holes, stretched out the hammock a couple more inches on each side, re-drilled, and installed two screw-in anchors that grip the drywall nicely. I screwed in the hooks and now the hammock is nice and snug.My tips: Really stretch out this hammock - it can stretch a lot farther than you think after first pulling out of the box. Do not hang too close to the ground if you are going to load it with a lot of stuffed animals as it will sink down a couple of feet. And, if you have drywall like me, toss the flimsy anchors they supply and use a screw-in anchor that really grips the drywall (like Zip-It).
