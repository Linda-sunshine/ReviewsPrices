review/summary: Excellent Learning Walkerreview/text: My 10 month old grandson just loves pushing this toy. Thankfully, the wheel adjustments put enough tension on the wheels so the walker would not fly across the room when in use. What a thoughtful idea for being at the begining stage of learning to walk this walker went at his speed. The other part of the walker that was throughly enjoyed was the phone. My grandson just loved playing with it but the only downside was when he tired of the phone he threw it down and it would take awhile to re-locate and place back on the walker. He thought it was a game when we would replace the phone, he would take and throw down again. He received the VTech Walker at Christmas so there is plently of time to enjoy all that it has to offer.
