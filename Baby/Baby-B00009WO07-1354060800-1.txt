review/summary: Great diaper, except the sticky tabs didn't stick.review/text: The diapers are super absorbent and do a great job. Half way through the bag, we noticed that the sticky tabs weren't sticky. The diapers weren't staying on. This could just be a bad batch of diapers with no sticky, but for the cost of diapers, I am not going to take a change on buying another set of diapers. We are sticking with the Pampers Cruisers - love them!
