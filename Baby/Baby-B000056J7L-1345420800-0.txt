review/summary: Perfect Pottyreview/text: My daughter loves her personal pink potty. It's the perfect size for her (2 years old). It's very easy to empty and the surface of it is exceptionally easy to clean. The back on the seat is nice for when my daughter is having a longer potty experience, she just leans back on it.We have a fairly small bathroom but this potty fits with no problem!
