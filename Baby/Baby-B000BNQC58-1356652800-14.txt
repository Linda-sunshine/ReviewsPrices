review/summary: Kids love it, good quality, nice starsreview/text: Our 3 year old really wanted the "other star projecting animal that's advertised like crazy" but it had AWFUL reviews so I talked her into the cute pink CloudB ladybug instead of the "penguin". We received the real CloudB ladybug, not a knock-off, I'm not sure what that other review was talking about. The ladybug us adorable, the 45 minute auto shutoff is great, the choice of red, blue/purple or green illumination is nice, the stars and crescent moon are really clear and pretty on the walls and ceiling. Very happy with it so far, our 3 year old and 18 month old want it on every night. We plan to buy our younger daughter her own for her 2nd birthday.
