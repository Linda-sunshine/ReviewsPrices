review/summary: Good buyreview/text: I bought this pack and play because it was one of the least expensive and had the buttons on the sides for easier opening and closing. I am very pleased with this so far. The pattern in really lovely, much nicer then it looks in the picture. No need to spend more on the fancier models, this one looks great and works well.
