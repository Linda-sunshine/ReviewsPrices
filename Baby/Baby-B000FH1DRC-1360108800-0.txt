review/summary: Excellent diapersreview/text: My twins had been in Swaddlers since birth through size 3 and we rarely have experienced leaks or blowouts. I thought all diapers were like that and never bothered to review... until I bought a package of Baby Dry when my babies graduated to size 4. Baby Dry leak constantly: I had to change my twins three times today. We are going back to Swaddlers even though they are much more expensive - they are worth it.
