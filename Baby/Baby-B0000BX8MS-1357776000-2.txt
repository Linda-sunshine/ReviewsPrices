review/summary: great productreview/text: I love this sleep sack. It is easy to put on and makes diaper changes easy since the zipper unzips from the bottom up. It's just the right weight for cool weather sleeping over some cotton pajamas, but you need to make sure arms and neck stay warm in this since its sleeveless.
