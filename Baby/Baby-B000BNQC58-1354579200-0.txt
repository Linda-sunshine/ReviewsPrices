review/summary: Great toy but not really orangereview/text: This is a favorite toy of my grandson. He was so excited about the idea that he might get this for Christmas that we couldn't keep ourselves from giving it to him early. It's a great toy that helps make going to bed at night more fun. Be aware though that when the lights are not turned on, the turtle's shell is a mocha color with a hint of green rather than the orange shown in the picture. That's why I'm giving it the 4 stars. The stuffed part of the turtle is a medium green.
