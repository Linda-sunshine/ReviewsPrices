review/summary: Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Lady Bugreview/text: &#34;Wow, what a wonderful item. I am convinced that my grandson is truly going to enjoy this little birthday gift. I know I really like it myself. It really shows up and there are so many stars. You can even see the little dipper. I purchased one for my other grandson and he sleeps with his. I wasn't able to see what it does because I had it shipped directly to him. I am so glad that I was able to experience this because when your grandchildren live in rentals, you can't just by those stick on the ceiling stars. This is totally awesome.&#34;
