review/summary: an affordable 5-star masterpiecereview/text: Pros:+ affordable+ portable+ secure+ easy to clean (very important!)+ height adjustable+ compactCons:- no option for 5 point harness- only three adjustments for the trayWe used the Bumbo with tray for a couple of months with our infant daughter and really tried to like it since everyone raved about it. It's cute (according to my wife) but that's about the extent of it and whole other story. The Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster has minimal cons besides the long name. Really it has three adjustments for the tray and that's not much of a con. It will fit most children I think, no problems with our daughter who is 6 months. The only other problem is that I wish it had an option for a 5 point harness for safety. Some high chairs have options for both 3 point or 5 point harness.Otherwise, let's get to the part why I rate this affordable masterpiece 5-stars.I purchased this booster for about 30 bucks. Super easy to use on the floor or strapped to a chair at the dinner table. The tray has three parts: the base tray, the removable tray, and the top that keeps everything clean when not in use.After you feed your child, you can take off the removable tray to wash it and your child could still have the base tray to play with her toys. It's pretty genius!The chair can be height adjusted so your childs leg could be dangling down if you prefer and supports your child's back more easily depending on how tall your baby is.This chair is so easy to store because it is so compact. I could transfer the chair in my car from one house to the other so easily without even taking up any space. I think this is one of the best features of the chair.I would highly recommend this chair as it is so useful!!! It does exactly what it should do.
