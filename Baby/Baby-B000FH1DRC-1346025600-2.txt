review/summary: Not Happy might be got wrong batchreview/text: As a first time Mom i expect that Pampers will be the best for my little one however i was wrong with this pack of Pampers Swaddlers. The inside diaper pad that supposed to be super absorbent it was not. These diapers are not that good ! Found some of the Diapers leaked, The diaper leaked liquid everywhere. Some Diapers had their flaps broken and I had to use tape to put the diapers on my baby. Very, very disappointedI'm not sure if we got a bad batch or if this size is just made cheaper; but I wouldn't recommend them at all.With my son it cause red irritation
