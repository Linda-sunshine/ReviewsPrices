review/summary: Just another junky plastic toy!review/text: I ordered this after reading many good reviews on the product. However, when I received it I was really disappointed. It's just another junky plastic kids toy. It's not sturdy at all. My 8 month old tries to pull up on it to stand and it topples over on him. It's flimsy and wobbly. I don't recommend it unless you are on a severe budget. Invest in something better. I have since ordered the Haba wagon walker. It's made of wood and seems much more sturdy. In fact I've decided to do away with all these junky plastic made in china toys and start buying less toys, but better quality toys (old school wooden ones). I'm sick of all the crappy plastic. Not only does it look cheap, but it is cheap! Cheaply made. I guess you really do get what you pay for.I gave this toy 2 stars because the removable piece does entertain my son somewhat.
