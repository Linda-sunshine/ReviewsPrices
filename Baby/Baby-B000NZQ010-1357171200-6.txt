review/summary: Great stimulationreview/text: I think this toy is great for 6 MO - 1 YO+. It provides great stimulation for our child with a number of different activities, and it also doubles as a walker once they are big enough. One slight negative is that as a walker it is only good once they are a bit more steady on their feet though. At first, it can topple over to the side (as many walkers) if the child falls to the side holding it. But that is part of the learning process in reality! We liked this toy enough that we purchased it for our niece for Xmas (she is 8 MO). Great toy.
