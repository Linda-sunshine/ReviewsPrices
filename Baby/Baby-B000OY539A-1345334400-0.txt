review/summary: Best Wrapreview/text: I love my Moby Wrap. I got one with my middle son (now 4) and used it with my youngest and am now excited to get a new one with our soon-to-be-born baby. I am 5 foot nothing and I have NO problem using it. Yes, there is extra fabric but I like that it wraps around my waist an extra time. I love that it gives me a bit of tummy coverage especially in the first month after birth. I live in Las Vegas and have used the Moby in the summer without either of us overheating. When my boys got a bit older (6-9 months), I loved using the Hip position. Much easier than just holding them on your hip. I admit that I have yet to test the 35lb limit of the wrap as my boys started walking before they were that big. I can see that it is a bit cumbersome to put on in public. I have found that the way the Moby wraps around you almost looks like a shirt and if I am at a restaurant or somewhere sitting down, I can take the baby out but keep the wrap on. Then I can just put my baby back in the wrap when I need to, no need to re-wrap. I don't usually wear it in a situation where I am taking it on and off again. And I have gotten very good at wrapping it and can do it quite quickly. All-in-all, I can see where most of the complaints come from but they are not an issue for me. I love mine and am excited to use one again. Also I get so many compliments when I'm using it!
