review/summary: ICKreview/text: I received the item from amazon and upon opening the box, discovered mold, cobwebs and some other disgusting substance on several of the parts. Who knows where the box had been stored, but I was repulsed. It did not appear to have been opened before. I took photos and immediately packaged it up for a prompt exchange. Really hoping the next one is not disgusting, so I can properly review the product. I will say free return shipping and the amazon process to return was seamless, so this reviewer gives one star.
