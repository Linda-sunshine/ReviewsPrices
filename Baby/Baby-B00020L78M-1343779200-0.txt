review/summary: So glad I had this- recommend to all moms!review/text: This is a great product. It made my life so much easier. I used a 6-gate kit with 2 extra, and I think you really need those to get good space- those two extra really expand the area. I used mine in a big rectangle in a corner, so maybe that made mine sturdier, but I never had any issues with kids getting out or pushing it around. I put all the baby toys in there, keeping the rest of my house neater. I wish I would have had this with my previous kids because it really helped me out when I am too busy to watch everything a baby is sticking in their mouth. My kids never liked a tiny playpen, but these are much roomier. I highly recommend getting this!
