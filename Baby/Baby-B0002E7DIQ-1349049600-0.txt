review/summary: It's good. but..review/text: It was a necessary item for me to sleep now. It's not too bulgy, and comportable.But, it's a little bit difficult to take off the cover from pillow and is stained easily because the cover is white.Meanwhile, an alternative cover with a zipper is expensive.I hopte that the color of the cover is made by darker shade and with a zipper.
