review/summary: Fantastic Nite Lite for your little onereview/text: My 3 y/o loves, loves, loves this! She was given the Pink Lady bug. The red light doesn't show too well ( I think because the shell is pink) but the 2 other colors show out great. I love that it has a timer so it doesn't kill the battery right away. She's used it pretty much since Christmas and I just changed out the batteries a couple days ago. (It wasn't completely dead but it didn't project as far. I also bought the eneloop rechargeable batteries which are fantastic!) Wish it had lullabies or natural sounds to make it more perfect.
