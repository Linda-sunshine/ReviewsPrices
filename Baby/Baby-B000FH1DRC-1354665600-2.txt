review/summary: Why buy diapers anywhere else?review/text: Let's face it - if you have a new born then WHY would you not want diapers delivered to your door? I am an Amazon Mom member and I would recommend it to all parents! With the Amazon Mom additional 20% off I can buy name brand diapers at store brand prices ... and they arrive on my door step. While I have been impressed with Target's store brand when I used them with our first child, nothing compares to the Pamper's Swaddler for a newborn. You won't regret trusting a brand like Pamper's, and you won't regret purchasing them via Amazon.
