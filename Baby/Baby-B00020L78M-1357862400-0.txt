review/summary: Don't question yourself.....BUY IT!!!!!!review/text: Amazing product I've had this for about an hour and I'm in love!!!!! super easy set up comes already put together just open the box and pop it together, if you're a parent and unsure on if you should buy this play yard I would buy this all over again and I would be willing to spend way more just for my sanity!!!! My baby is 7 almost 8 months old and is into everything, this gives me the peace of mind to know I can do a load of laundry or use the bathroom quickly without worrying shes chewing a wire or sticking her finger in a socket lol exaggerating but you catch my drift!Buy this play yard!!!!! I got the 8 panel color and its a decent size for my living room, I'm even thinking of buying another one!!!! :)
