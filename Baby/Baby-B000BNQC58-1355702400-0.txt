review/summary: Love itreview/text: Watched reviews on this before buying and we are not disappointed. A few things that would improve this product are:1) one review said the stars were semi accurate in terms of actual placement. This will vary greatly based on the size of the room you are lighting up. Our nursery is small so the ceiling is showered with stars that appear much more randomly placed. If there was a smaller version available I would like to have that option as well. Having said this, the plush part of the turtle is huggable size for a child as is.2) an option of music or white noise would be a nice edition to this item.Overall, We are very pleased with this product and are hoping to get a lot of use out of it. It has varying degrees of brightness based on the star colors and is fun for adults and children.
