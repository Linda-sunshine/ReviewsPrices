review/summary: Greatreview/text: My son loves to push this around. We have to help him though because it goes kind of fast. We live in an apartment so we also have to help him turn and maneuver around the areas he can go, which is to be expected. I think the wheels could be a bit tighter in order to help him get used to it and go a bit slower. He was 8 months when we bought it. He is getting better at it and will probably love it even more when he gets a little older. He loves to take the phone off and shake it!
