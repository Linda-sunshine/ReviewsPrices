review/summary: A True Heaven Send!review/text: I am a stay at home mom with a one year old. My husband and I bought this play yard and paired it with the EDU Playmat. It makes the PERFECT playpen for my son! It allows me to do things like change the laundry or, quite frankly, go to the bathroom and know he is safe! It is nice and big so now that he is trying to walk, he hasp plenty of room to practice. It also makes for a great place to keep all his toys! The gates detach from one another and make it super easy to take a smaller version of the play pen outside or other places we go. The only thing we're a little bummed about is that it does not have a door panel. That would make it much easier and safer. RIght now, we're making a pretty poor example for our son by climbing over the gate each time we are in and out. The company sells one separately but it does not match the colorful gates and it is also super expensive. But - aside from that - this is one of the best purchases we've made in a long time!
