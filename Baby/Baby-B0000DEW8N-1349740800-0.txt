review/summary: Easy to use, easy to cleanreview/text: I am like most everyone else who has reviewed this seat in that I loved it. I will keep it short and sweet.-Very easy to put on a chair nice and tight (we have heavy chairs so he seems pretty snug and safe)-No padding and comes apart easy for easy cleaning. The tray is even dishwasher safe-It was hard for my tall and thin 4-month-old to sit in it at first as he would tip over, once he got stronger it was smooth sailing.-We have the red one, and the color is nice-The price is very good, too.Our baby likes it and we like it. The whole crew is happy. I would recommend trying this before a high chair because of the ease of cleaning it and the price.
