review/summary: These are greatreview/text: I've used this brand since my child was 6 months old or younger. We always have two, one to wear and one for the wash. They are great, and while they run big, just keep that in mind When ordering. The 12 month size fit our little one until he was about 18 months old. The microfleece is great in case they wet them selves in the night.
