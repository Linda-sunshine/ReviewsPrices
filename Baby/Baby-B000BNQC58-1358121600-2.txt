review/summary: Cute and durablereview/text: My daughter has had this turtle for 2.5 years now. It has been durable and reliable the whole time. It is adorable and she still loves it! Worth the price, you will get a lot of use out of it. The best part is this thing is rough and rugged and takes a lot of abuse (and sometimes love) from little kids.
