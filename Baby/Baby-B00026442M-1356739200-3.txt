review/summary: They leak when regular swaddler diapers don'treview/text: I originally bought these diapers for my daughter to wear at night. They leaked so badly that I couldn't use them. My daughter would be soaked from her chest clear down to her socks. Of course she would wake up early. I had to wash all of her bedding and her jammies every night. You can imagine what the scene looked like when she pooped! To get rid of this box of diapers, I used them during day use, but, again, the swaddlers worked better and seemed more comfortable for my daughter. The Baby Dry seemed very thin and very uncomfortable....almost papery. Not good.
