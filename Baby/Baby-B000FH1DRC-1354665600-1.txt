review/summary: Two different diapersreview/text: I have ordered this twice in the newborn size and gotten what appear to be two different types of diapers each time.The first time I got packages that looked like what the hospital gave us and worked the same. They had a light scent and didn't stick to any of the baby.The second order came in different packaging and look and smell different. They have this mesh on the inside that sticks to my boy's parts and the smell is horribly strong and chemical-y.I would order these again if I could be assured that I'd get the same product as the first order of NB diapers, but I don't want to put out the money and simply hope that the diapers will be the non-stinky non-mesh ones.
