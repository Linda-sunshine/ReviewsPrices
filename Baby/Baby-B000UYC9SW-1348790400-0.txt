review/summary: Stick to the size recommendations printed on the boxreview/text: I got an extra small, thought it was way too tight, returned it, got a small, realized that it was supposed to be really tight, and ended up going back to the extra small. That said, now that I have the right size, I love it! I use it all the time. When my son is sleepy, I face him in; when he's awake, I face him out. When he was smaller, I breastfed him in it, too.
