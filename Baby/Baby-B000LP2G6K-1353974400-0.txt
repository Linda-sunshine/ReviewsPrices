review/summary: Exactly what we were looking forreview/text: After reading several reviews for various playpens my husband and I decided to register for this product. It's main purpose will be to serve as a travel crib once our baby is born. I'm not going to be using it as a main playpen so I love the smaller size. It doesn't take up very much room at all but still will be large enough to serve as a travel crib.This playpen is extremely easy to set up and break down. The product manual that came with it has several very helpful pictures and goes through each and every step without skipping anything at all. Which is great for people like me who need idiot proof instructions. :)Several reviewers have said that this playpen has a strong chemical smell. They are right. It's extremely smelly out of the box. Since we read reviews before we got it though, we anticipated this and have it set up and are airing it out.
