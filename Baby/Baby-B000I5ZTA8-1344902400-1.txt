review/summary: Order per the manufacturer's recommendation!!!review/text: I listened to all this crazy talk about how the band runs bigger than what the sizing info states. NOT true!! I'm 5'10", ending y first trimester at 165 lbs and the medium was huge!! Since I am a tall gal, my tummy does not get very large when I'm pregnant, but I guarantee I will wear a small clear through delivery. (and I don't wear a small ANYTHING! Lol) I suppose if you have a very large stomach (I.e. a very petite lady who has a huge baby and is late in pregnancy) then maybe you should order up. Or if you carry a majority of your weight in your midsection, order up. Everyone else, order per the instructions!This is what I'd consider a 'minimal' support belt. I want something for light aerobics, yoga and Pilates. I wouldn't recommend this if you need a good deal of support. Looks easy to clean and put on. I'm waiting on my replacement. I think I'm going to like it. I didn't want a massive stomach-binding girdle!
