review/summary: Amazing Toy with something for everyonereview/text: This toy is great as it allows for my kid to play keep playing with all the various buttons and features. It has a spin wheel and toy which she enjoyed and as she gets older she likes the little phone on it. There are also multiple options for the music/voice feature allowing even more variety. It also works pretty good as a walker, however it can be some difficult to steer and doesn't work well on thick plush carpet
