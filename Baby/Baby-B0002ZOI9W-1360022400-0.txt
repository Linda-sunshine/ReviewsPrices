review/summary: My Little Man Loves It!review/text: If you are looking for that perfect baby gift-look no further this is it. This is the one item I didn't receive during all the baby showers and gifts I received while waiting for our newest addition. I never thought at my age that I would have a little one in my house again as my other children are now grown. Of all the swings, seats and play mats, this is the seat that my now 4 month old loves. He sits in it for very long periods at a time, completely at ease and entertained with the vibration on. Day-care also has these seats and they have told me that he loves it. The colors are bright and eye catching, the toys are placed where they can easily be seen and grabbed at when he reaches that stage.Assembly was very easy. All that is needed is a Philips head screw driver and a little time. Instructions are easy to follow but I didn't need them. There are just a few parts to put together and you can see from the picture on the box where each piece goes. The cover is easy to put on and remove in order to clean. The batteries are under the cover, closed with a screw to keep little fingers and mouths out of danger. It keeps him happy and entertained while I am working around the house and that makes me happy. I would rate it more than 5 stars if allowed.
