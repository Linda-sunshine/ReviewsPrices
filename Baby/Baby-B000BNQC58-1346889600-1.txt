review/summary: Helped my daughter overcome her fear of the dark.review/text: I purchased this for my daughter when she was 4 to help her overcome her fear of the dark. She loved it and would not sleep without it in the beginning. Now she is 5 and we've had it for 8 months. She no longer sleeps with, nor needs it. The defect in this product is what got her to transition to the dark. Here is how it happened... At first it worked perfectly for the first 6 months. By the 7th month only the amber worked, which is the lightest color, so she could only use that. By the 8th month, the amber was so light she may as well had not even turned on the turtle, so she didn't. She now sleeps without it and without complaint. She is also no longer afraid of the dark. It served it's purpose, but not the way it was intended to. All in all, I am grateful for the toy, but it is definitely not durable.
