review/summary: Love it:)review/text: Bought this for my 9 month old grandson. I like it because the activity pad is removable. He played with it a lot while they were here. Walking with it doesn't confine him as traditional walkers where they are set inside a ring. With this he can walk, stand and play, and have floor play with the pad removed. Great product.
