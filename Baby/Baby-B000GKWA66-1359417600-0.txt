review/summary: Miracle worker!review/text: My Grandson was not sleeping well, and giving his parents grief each night at bedtime.I bought Gentle Giraffe for a Christmas gift. My son called after the first night and said it&#34; was a miracle worker &#34;. Now it's a regular bedtime buddy and has helped enormouslywith the fussy bedtime issues. LOVE it.
