review/summary: 3 year olds Best Friend!review/text: My son needs a light on every night, this is the best. He love, love, loves it and it has helped with night time darkness scares and I don't have to keep other lights on. The 45 minute auto shut off is perfect! It sleeps next to him on his bed! I only wish I would have bought it sooner.
