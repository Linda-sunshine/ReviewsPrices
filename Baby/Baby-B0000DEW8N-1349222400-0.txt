review/summary: Just ok...still searching for great boosterreview/text: This isn't the best booster out there, but works in a pinch. It doesn't adjust to the right height for my dining room table, so she's always kind of eating "up". I don't like the tray because she can unsnap the blue one super easy and the white one she can softly tug on and off it comes. This will be the spare seat in our home as soon as I can find the perfect seat...haven't found it yet.
