review/summary: Won't Leave Home Without It!review/text: The snoogle is a lifesaver! I vowed not to forget it when we went out of town for a few days and of course I accidentally left it at home - I was so uncomfortable without it! You can bend and manipulate in all sorts of ways and sleep in many different positions. Great for a growing belly! I plan to take it to the hospital with me when I deliver.
