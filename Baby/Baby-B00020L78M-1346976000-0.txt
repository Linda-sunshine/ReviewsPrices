review/summary: Great Productreview/text: We bought this play yard to box off an area around our sectional couch. It has worked perfectly and keeps my daughter out of harms way. It is sturdy and allows her to pull herself up into a standing position. I would recommend this product to anyone with little ones. We can put her inside the play yard and know she will be safe.
