review/summary: Comfortable and convenientreview/text: I love this little band. I began using it in the beginning of my pregnancy to provide support for my lower belly pains. Now I find relief wearing the band for hip support later in pregnancy. Some days my hips feel so loose it hurts to walk, then I wear the band and it seems to help hold my hips in place and relieve some of the pain. I like that I can easily take it off when I'm out and about and slip it into my purse since it folds up small.My only complaints are that it presses against my bladder and makes me feel like I have to go to the bathroom all the time. So I wear it mostly while I'm walking around since its not so bad standing. I also would prefer if it came in a black color so it would blend in with my clothes.
