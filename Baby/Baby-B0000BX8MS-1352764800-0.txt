review/summary: Great concept!review/text: We didn't have this when I had our first daughter 12 years ago, but I wish we did. Now that we have a baby again, this has been so helpful. We keep our house really cold during the winter. Since babies are always rolling around the crib, this has kept our baby nice and warm. He sleeps longer at night when it's cool, but he's toasty and comfortable in his little sleep sack. I like this because his arms don't come out and he doesn't get tangled up in it. I don't worry about the risk of SIDS, because there are no blankets in his crib near his face.
