review/summary: twin mom on the goreview/text: Having twins unexpectedly I wasnt in a position to buy two cribs. I purchased two pack and plays instead after doing a lot of research. Every mommy is so drawn to the ones with the changing table, mobile, pockets and what have you. Personally pac and plays arent at the proper height to change a baby with out bending at an akward angel and causing pain and im only 5'4.This pack and play has been a huge part of our every day life. My twin boys cosleep in this for the first 5 months. Then I have placed them in their own.. When we are going to be gone all day, for family get togethers or just hanging with friends it takes less then five minutes to take it apart and throw it in the trunk. I havent had any problem with the hard mattress part that the babies sleep on at all. Its sturdy and easy to keep clean. I do use a sheet and water proof pad! I have considered purchasing a better mattress to place on the inside but havent felt like I absolutely need to have it.I think this is a great choice for any parent and saves money. Other pack and plays or even cribs can be extremely expensive. Its not necessary to spend that money! Save it for diapers, clothes, or even start a bank account. With my oldest I bought the big crib and matching bedding, $700 dollars later my son only slept in his crib once. We coslept then he went to a toddler bed at 1.5yrs old.
