review/summary: Horriblereview/text: If we don't change the diaper at least every 3 hours, there is a spill. So every morning when our daughter wakes up we have to wash everything in her bed. The jell in the diapers gets saturated so easily. Some of the jell has actually leaked out and given our daughter a break out on her tummy and legs. Not to mention everything else she has leaked on. The swadlers were the best. I should have just sticked with them.
