review/summary: Works great for daily use, easy to pack up for travelreview/text: Been using this for a few months now - got this instead of a floor-based chair since we have a tall dining room table. Works great! Very easy to adjust and get a good fit. We've taken it to the in-laws for the holidays and it packs up into one small bundle, easy to transport. Very happy.
