review/summary: Best walkerreview/text: This was one of the best toys I purchased for my 9 month old grandson who is standing on his own. He loves to play with the different items on the front and has started recently to actually walk behind it. It is one of the first toys he goes to when he comes to my house. The music can be a little annoying but you can turn it off. When he was younger we were able to remove the front part to make it level so he could play with it on the floor which is a good idea too.
