review/summary: Invaluable tool, could be betterreview/text: While I think that this is a great tool to have, I think that it could be so much better. I'd pay a couple extra bucks for a bit more functionality - maybe a way to keep a history and/or upload this information to your computer. Also, I don't know how many times I've forgotten to reset the time until 15 minutes after I've fed the baby. It'd be nice to let me add minutes to the timer.I'd like to see Coast Innovations get together with Belkin and get some Wemo technology in this thing. I feel like if Belkin can give me basically a cloud device for $50 that will connect to my network and gives me the ability to send information to it - then this thing could be $50 and provide similar functionality. A computer could query the device periodically and download a history of what's going on, as well as keep the clock correct (I hate that we still have to set clocks).I had to purchase 2 of these. We didn't realize that the first one came broken (the back-light didn't work) until we got the second one and the back-light did work. The first one broke after dropping it, once, on the hardwood floors. The timers stopped working and we couldn't reset the clock.Decent device. Could be much better with existing technology.
