review/summary: Probably the same as Pampers New Baby diapersreview/text: I got a sample of a size 2 "New Baby" Pampers diaper, which I found out seems to be the EU version of Swaddlers. I used Swaddlers in the Newborn and Size 1, but the Size 1 seems too small compared to the Baby Dry diapers and my son (less than 2 months old before we gave up using them) would constantly leak through them and have blowouts so we were stuck using Baby Dry which just fit him weird. When I finally decided he might be big enough for the New Baby sample diaper we had, it worked great! Unfortunately, I couldn't find any "New Baby" diapers on Amazon except the UK site. So I decided to try the Size 2 Snug and Dry Huggies diapers which have held everything in great but have a weirder fit than the Baby Dry but atleast they also held in everything (even better than the Size 1 Baby Dry we had).I did some research to try finding those New Baby diapers and came to the conclusion it might be the same as Swaddlers, and after reading that the Size 2 Swaddlers should have the Dry Max feature, I ordered these. =] So far, they're great and the elastic is so much stretchier than the Size 1 and Newborn, letting me thing they are also more comfortable for my son (which is why I loved the New Baby diaper) and they seem to indeed be the same thing.Also, the Size 1 Swaddlers didn't even go up to his bellybutton which probably helped the blowouts happen, but the Size 2 go a lot higher. =] The Newborn and Size 1 worked great for when he was first born.
