review/summary: Okay but not greatreview/text: We only use the rain function since the others don't offer a real white noise our daughter needs. We ended up buying another white noise machine that was louder and stayed ON until you turned it off. Babies wake up from their startling reflex every so often, even when swaddled, so I wanted to have white noise playing throughout the night so she could put herself to sleep easier. Not so good for very particular or fussy babies.
