review/summary: Very nice play matreview/text: This mat was wonderful and we just stopped using it at 13 months, the attached toys are still in use, however. Out of the box this wonderful and whimsical play mat even caught my attention. The giraffe helps hide the batteries and is part of the rainbow supports and also holds a mirror in its mouth. The green leaves are soft and hide a four color light circle that with either classical music or rainforest sounds change colors and pattern with the music. The toys were great for my daughter as she got older say 5 months and up. The parrot has a fun spinner perch, the monkey rattles, the toucan is soft with crinkles wings, the soft monkey has been put on the stroller because she loves its large soft hands and ears.Pros: Great for older babies. Gets and maintains baby&#8217;s attentions. Fun colors and lots of options for play and motor/visual learning and growth. As our daughter grew, the supports were strong enough to use to stand and bounce a little. Fischer Price really did a nice job choosing materials that easily clean. For those &#8220;Oh no&#8221; mornings, she would lay under the leaves and watch the lights change and roll to play on her own.Cons: Would have loved if the rainbows collapsed and could be easily removed for travel and/or storage. Takes a lot of C batteries BUT we have not had to replace them even after 13 months of solid use. Can only hang toys on designated soft hooks. Monkey did not come with hanging ring, I had to fabricate one. Overall though a great item and a godsend on most days!Would recommend!
