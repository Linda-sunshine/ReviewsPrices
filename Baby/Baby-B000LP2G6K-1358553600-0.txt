review/summary: Graco playardreview/text: My only complaint is you can't just lift the bassinet out and have the base ready to use right away. You have to take the bassinet base out and insert it in the bottom of the playard to use the base. Minor detail, but it does add another step and takes away from the convenience of use. (FYI, buy the little mattress that goes with it. These are super hard for baby to lay on. With my first children, they didn't sell the mattress. So glad they came up with it!)
