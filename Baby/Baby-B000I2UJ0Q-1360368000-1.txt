review/summary: Best toy EVER!review/text: I think it's officially a toss up to determine who loves this toy more... my adorable little girl or me! If I could attach some of the videos I have taken of her, any written/typed words here would be unnecessary! If any of you are my friend on Facebook, you'd TOTALLY agree :)I bought this for my almost 4 month old who started jumping around a few weeks ago. She has always been a multi-tasker and the slew of toys around her keep her fully occupied and giggling for hours! The jumperoo'ing-activated music and sounds aren't annoying at all and it is so much fun watching her react to the lights and play with all of those cool toys.Just a few notes:Some reviewers have commented about the backwards elephant... but make-no-mistake about it Fisher-Price knew what they were doing and this is by no means indicative of a mistake in production or design, but rather the opposite. Baby pulls the elephant around to see the adorable face... that's the whole point! It's like a rotating peek-a-boo!Yes, it does fold down, but truth-be-told... it's still a bit bulky even then... BUT why fold it down? No need to put it away... did I mention it is the BEST TOY EVER!I was torn between the Rainforest or the Luv U Zoo and actually preferred the look of the Luv U better (the seat kind of freaked me out a little bit and I thought the Luv U Zoo was more aesthetically pleasing)... but after reading the comparisons that favored the Rainforest, I sucked-it-up and bought the Rainforest and am SO happy I did... in real-life, the seat is actually one of the cutest parts!
