review/summary: A good choicereview/text: I brought this home for our 6 month old son. He was too little for it on the stand, but enjoyed playing with the tablet on the floor. Now that he is 10 months old he is using it to stand, and will soon be walking with it. I would say this is by far his favorite toy.
