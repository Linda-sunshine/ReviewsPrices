review/summary: Great first toy!review/text: My 2.5 month old son was becoming very frustrated because he wanted to put everything in his mouth and did not have the coordination. I searched for a toy that he could easily hold and cram into his mouth at the same time. This fit the bill! It's very colorful and got his attention right away. It was the first toy he could easy chew on his own without my help. Now that he is 3.5 months old, he still loves to chew this toy, even though his coordination has improved and he can hold and chew others. It holds his interest for quite awhile and he's learning to shake it for the rattle noise as well.The toy seems very durable and is easy to rinse off. Anything that makes playtime fun for my baby gets an A+ in my book! Great first toy.
