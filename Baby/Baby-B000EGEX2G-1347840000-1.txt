review/summary: Good product but annoying noise!review/text: This is a great rocker chair and ottoman which I am planning to use for my baby due in november. We have started using it right after it arrived. Easy to assemble. The only downside to this rocker is that it creates an annoying squeaky noise when you rock the chair and we are not sure how to fix and does not serve the purpose of rocking. That's why only 4-star for this item. Also wish it had more space, since it feels cramped when you sit in it.
