review/summary: Great sitting to standing!review/text: Love! Our 6 MO loves to play with it whether he's on his tummy or sitting, and he never seems to tire of it! He loves to walk behind it with us supporting him. This is one toy we're glad we decided to buy (he's usually more interested in our cell phones and the remote than his toys)!
