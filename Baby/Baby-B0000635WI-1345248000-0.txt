review/summary: Love it!review/text: I was about 17 weeks pregnant when I purchased this pillow and I am so glad I did. I was having a lot of back pain at night and needed many pillows to help relive the pain. This brought me down to one main pillow. I still sleep with pillows under my head, but that is for my acid reflux and allergies. I would highly recommend this pillow to not only pregnant women but also to anyone who need more support at night. The only thing I did not like is it does not come with a real pillow cover. There are tags sticking out that bother me while I sleep. I would recommend buying a pillow case to go with it.
