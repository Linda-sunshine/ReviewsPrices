review/summary: My granddaughter loves it!review/text: When I come for a visit, I share a room with my granddaughter. I couldn't sleep with the glaring wall nightlight she had and she'd cry if I turned it off, so I needed a solution.I was so happy when the Cloud b constellation nightlight arrived and I could actually see that it was soft and just bright enough that my granddaughter was able to fall asleep, and not so bright that it kept me awake. Now she falls asleep hugging it across her chest. She loves that she can choose the light color and that 45 minute timer saves on batteries. The added bonus was that it mimics actual constellations and the little book it comes with explains them. Functional and educational. I've seen similar toys at Wal-Mart, but these by far are so much better! There is something so soothing about watching the stars before falling asleep.On my next visit, I asked my granddaughter if she liked her new nightlight. She said, "Grandma, I LOVE it!" That's good enough for me.
