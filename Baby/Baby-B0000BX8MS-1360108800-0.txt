review/summary: Cute and warm for winter!review/text: HALO sleepsacks are great in general. We have used them for our toddler since she was born. I like that they make them in toddler sizes (our daughter is a year and a half and still fits in the large, but we ordered X-large for the future). The fleece is great for layering over cotton PJ's, and washes like a dream. The colors don't bleed, and it dries quickly. The cupcake pattern is also very cute in person, especially on our &#34;little cupcake!&#34;
