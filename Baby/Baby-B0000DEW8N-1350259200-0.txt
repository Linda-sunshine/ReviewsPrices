review/summary: I'd give it 10 stars if I could!review/text: I love this booster!It fits our average (maybe even smaller than average) sized kitchen chairs when other similar products did not.Easy to clean, easy to use, works perfectly, etc... Honestly, no complaints.I highly recommend it for anyone living in a small space. I also recommend it for anyone who is looking for a chair that will last a long time. I bought my first one when my baby was 6-months, just starting to sit at the table. She's now almost 3-years-old and still fits in it and it is in like-new condition. I purchased a second one for baby #2 and it's holding up just as well after 7 months of use.Great item! In fact, one of my Top 10 Must Have Kid Items!
