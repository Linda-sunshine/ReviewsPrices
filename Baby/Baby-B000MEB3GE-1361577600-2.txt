review/summary: Works great - but watch out what you clip it toreview/text: Works great - but watch out what you clip it to. Clipped it onto metal tray at hospital and clip broke. Still works well just realize that the belt clip is pretty flimsy. That said, this works wonders to help you keep track of time and get baby into a routine.
