review/summary: Decentreview/text: These do the trick, but are lacking a bit in the moisture department, which makes it a bit difficult to clean up a big mess- if you catch my drift. Aside from that, Seventh Generation is a great brand worth supporting (eco-friendly- right? I hope!), so I continue to purchase. I've had better wipes, but these are fine.
