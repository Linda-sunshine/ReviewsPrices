review/summary: pretty good retaining wet diapersreview/text: I really love these baby dry diaprs. The huggies snug and fit gave my daughter a really bad rash. These have never been an issue regarding allergies/sensitivity and both my girls wear them. The only time I've had an issue with the leaks with my 2 and half year old daughter, not sure why. I've had no more than 2 leaks with my 10 month old. These are the best diapers we've ever come across
