review/summary: Replaced our old bouncer for this great chair.review/text: I purchased this as one of my 3-month-old daughter's Christmas presents after reading other reviews. So glad I got it--and I think she is as well because she loves sitting in it, where as she didn't care for her bouncer seat. I think she prefers this over the bouncer because she can sit more upright, which will be necessary for when I start feeding her cereal. I also like that it reclines when she falls asleep. Only minor thing I would change is that the little bug on the toy bar is quite loud for little ears.
