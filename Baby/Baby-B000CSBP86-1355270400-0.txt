review/summary: Great simple carrierreview/text: I like this carrier better than my ERGO Baby Carrier or Stokke MyCarrier and It's much less complicated and &#34;strappy&#34; and just has a nice and clean simple design and easy to use functionality. It's very comfortable and lightweight, yet still feels secure and sturdy. The Stokke MyCarrier is so heavy and complicated. The ERGO Baby Carrier is a little better but not as aesthetically pleasing.
