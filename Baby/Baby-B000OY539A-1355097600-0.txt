review/summary: Nice and snugreview/text: I bought this for my daughter. Since my daughter was going to be wearing this with my new Grand Baby in it, I wanted to know how it worked. I had a doll that was life size and proceeded by the instructions. The instructions were very easy to follow. The first time takes a little time to do but once you do it the second time should be much easier. If applied correctly their is no way your baby could possibly fall out of this. I suggest practicing with a doll or stuffed animal though. My only complaint is that the bag that comes with it is too small to properly put the Moby back into it. I spent more time trying to fold it and stuff it back in the bag than I did trying it out. I finally gave up, crammed it in the bag as best I could and shipped it off that way.
