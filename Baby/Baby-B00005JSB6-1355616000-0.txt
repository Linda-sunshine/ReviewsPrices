review/summary: Everything stays inside!review/text: We've had several instances where the little extra side wings have helped keep everything in the diaper instead of on his clothes. I've tried pampers and target brand and those don't seem to keep in nearly as much. My 21 month old wears these during the day and night. Plus he loves the Mickey cartoon on them.
