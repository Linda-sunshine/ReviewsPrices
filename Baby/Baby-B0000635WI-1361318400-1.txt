review/summary: Comfy!!!review/text: Love the snoogle! Very comfortable to cuddle up in. I was hoping that it would prevent me more from turning onto my back while I sleep...but somehow I still wake up on my back. I seem to squiggle my way off it somehow, but I still love the pillow and would highly recommend it for preggo's!
