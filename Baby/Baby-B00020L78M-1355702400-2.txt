review/summary: My 2nd Gate :)review/text: I first got this for my oldest child about 5 years ago so I decided to get one for a friend of mine. She LOVES it! She has twins and its big enough for the both of them. She made it so that it is squared (2 panels on each 4 sides). She place a color play mat under it for a nice feel for the babies. You should be warn that once the kid gets a certain size that they may be able to push it a bit but WE found that by placing something in front of it like a weight or heavy book does the JOB! :)
