review/summary: My daughter loves it!!!review/text: I love that this jumper folds in on itself. It is still large but much less than when opened and the best part of all is that my 5 month old daughter absolutely loves it. There are some toys she could care less about on it but that doesn't seem to effect her enjoyment. Love it!!!
