review/summary: The Best Jumper Aroundreview/text: We searched and searched for the perfect jumper, and finally we found it! She has since outgrown it, but used it for quite awhile. It always made her so happy. It was like a revelation the first time she used it. She jumped and jumped and didn't want to stop. She didn't bother with the toys at first, but quickly came to love them. All of the the built in toys are WONDERFUL. They kept her entertained. We have it stored away now for the next baby, but it still looks brand new. It's durable and the design is very cute. She liked the stuffed bird hanging down. She would try to grab it an reach it. A great motivation. It was also nice that you could adjust the volume.A definite must buy!
