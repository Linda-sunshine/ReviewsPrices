review/summary: Worth it!review/text: We got this turtle when my son was only 6 months old. For awhile he was to young to fully appreciate it, i would even say it was distracting. But,about age 3 he started having trouble falling asleep. We brought out the turtle and he loves it! He uses it at nap time and night time. The amber stars (yellow) are quite faint, but the green and blue are very nice. My son uses the blue most of the time. He likes to sleep with the moon directly over his bed. This is a very durable product, he is a big and tall boy, (56 lbs) and he has stood on it many times (even though he knows better!) and the turtle shows no wear and tear. We liked the turtle so much, we have bought the pink lady bug one for our daughter. Really helps with independent falling asleep.
