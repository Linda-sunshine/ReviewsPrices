review/summary: Not for all table heights.review/text: My only problem with this booster seat is that it will not work beyond the point when the trays are removed and it becomes just a booster seat. My table top is at the standard height, but the skirt of the table goes down too far to allow the seat to go under the skirt area. The booster does strip snugly to both dining room and kitchen chairs so there is no safety issues. The top sections of the tray are no longer used as a child can take them off too easily so I just utilize the bottom tray. It is a very economical way to have a high chair equivalency that works well and I would recommend this item for that purpose. It will also work well with a table that does not have a skirt to block it from scooting up to your table.
