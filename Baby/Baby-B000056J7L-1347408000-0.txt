review/summary: Great Pottyreview/text: I love this potty. Because it only has two pieces to it, its easy to clean. The high pee-guard means no need to supervise when my son is using it. We don't ever have any splashing incidents. Like most stand alone potties, it is very small and low to the ground so I don't anticipate being able to use it for much longer.
