review/summary: Perfect for the baby that likes to bounce!review/text: I bought this for my 4 month old becuase the activity saucer that we had just wasn't cutting it. I was nervous getting this at first becuase I wasn't sure how she would fit in the seat. Mainly was it going to be so she wouldn't be held in when it she was jumping around. I'm so happy with this! The seat is a good size and good depth that she fits snug in there, but has room to grow. The head support in the back is a great feature, it prevents her head from going back and gives her a place to rest it too. She is a bit too short to touch the floor but that is remedied by putting a pillow under her feat. I know it's suppose to fold up to save space, yes it folds, but it doesn't save that much space. This item takes up a lot of room, but it's worth it!
