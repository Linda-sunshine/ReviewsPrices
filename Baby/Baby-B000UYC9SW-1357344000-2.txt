review/summary: We love it and the baby does tooreview/text: But we got the wrong size. We both wear large so we got that size, but we are both short (I am 5' 3) so it didn't fit right so we had to exchange it so keep that in mind. My husband and I both use it and for now the baby prefers it to the Bjorn we got, and since I am nursing and my chest is very sensitive the Bjorn caused a lot of discomfort in that area, but not the K'tan! It is comfy for both parties and very easy to wear/travel with! I wish we would have gotten this from the start instead of waiting until the baby was a month old.
