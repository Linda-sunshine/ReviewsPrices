review/summary: Good price at Amazon once you Subscribe and Savereview/text: They are diapers, and with an infant...well, it's not like he's going to complain about this.It does the job - keeps his clothes dry, and the poop in. I would NOT RECOMMEND this for night time sleeping if the kid is fortunate enough to sleep through a good chunk of hours (say 4-5) as the combo of poop and pee will cause an overflow and leak out. But for infants that have a sleep cycle of 2-3 hours at most, it seems sufficient.I would try cheaper diapers (say target and other store brands)....but i like the fact that they show up on my doorstep and the price isn't bad with the Subscribe and Save option.
