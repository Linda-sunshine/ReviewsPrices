review/summary: love this gatereview/text: we purchased this gate because we were tired of climbing over the gate we had to keep our dog from going up stairs to the second floor. it was the best purchase we made. it is sturdy and well made. i love that i can open the gate like a door and it closes automatically and if i want to i can also leave it open and it stays open. just a suggestion. when we first installed it we put it on top of the step. we had to keep stepping over the bottom bar and it could be a tripping hazard. so my son suggested putting the gate in front of the step with the bottom bar even with the step. what a difference. because the bottom bar is even with the step there is nothing to step over. i really love this gate and would recommend it to any one.
