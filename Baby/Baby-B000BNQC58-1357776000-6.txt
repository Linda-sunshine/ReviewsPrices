review/summary: My 5 year old niecereview/text: This thing is amazing. I got it for a Christmas gift for my niece and she totally loved it. Since she was born she had been sleeping with her parents in their bed. She had never slept in her bed alone. The first night that she took this home my sister told me she turned it on and set it on her dresser and my niece crawled right in her bed and fell asleep with no problem. My sister told me she never even got up in the middle of the night to crawl in their bed. My sister loves it as much as my niece does. I would recommend this to anyone who has a little one who just might have a problem sleeping alone in the dark. If i had more little nieces and nephews they would all have one.
