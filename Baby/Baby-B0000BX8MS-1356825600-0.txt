review/summary: Baby must have!!review/text: My daughter and I both sleep better at night because of the sleep sack! She stays warm and cozy and I don't worry about her suffocating. I would say these are must haves for anyone with a little one! I've used them with both my daughters and highly recommend. They hold up well considering how often they need to be washed, no pull seams or fading. We have the fleece for cooler nights and the cotton for warmer nights.
