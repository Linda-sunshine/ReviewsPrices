review/summary: my angel's first carrierreview/text: It is my 4-month-old baby's first carrier. At the beginning, I wonder if she would like the carrier because I used to carry her in my arms. When I slide her into the carrier, she looks comfortable and enjoys staying in it. I am so happy, and my hands are free now,haha.
