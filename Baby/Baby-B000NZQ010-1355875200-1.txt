review/summary: Perfectreview/text: My 10 month old nephew is just about to walk, and needed something to pull himself up with and hold on to when he takes off. This is perfect. The front panel is removable so he can play with it while sitting on the floor. The phone rattles when you shake it, there are lots of buttons to push and wheels to turn, all with music, numbers, colors, or animal sounds.The best part (one I hadn't thought of): There are wheel locks on the back wheels. With these set, he can pull himself up with the handle, but the walker won't just runaway and make him fall down. However, they don't lock completely, so once he is up, he can still push along. Once he gets his balance, we'll disengage the wheel locks. I couldn't be happier with this!
