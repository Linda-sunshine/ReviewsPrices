review/summary: VERY BAD ODOURreview/text: I really like Pampers Swaddlers Newborn and Size 1. Size 2 has really bad chemical odour. First I thought may be because of the package it has storng perfume and used it for my son for a day, It has caused rashes right away. Disappointed and returned the product. I will not be buying Swaddlers again.
