review/summary: This takes 1 small amount of stress off your mind, when caring for a newborn!review/text: This is amazing! I got this when my baby was about 6 weeks old, I wish I had it from the beginning. My baby is now almost 8 months and I honestly stopped using it only a week ago. It makes passing off the care for a baby so much easier. The next caregiver knows when the baby ate last, was changed, etc. Also, my baby now loves to play with it as a toy! Of course it isnt baby proof, so obivously I dont leave her alone with it, but it distracts her when she is about to cry and gets her to focus again.
