review/summary: Better than I even expected!review/text: My son is 20 months old, he LOVES this turtle. Every night before bed he says &#34;turtle&#34; and runs over to turn it on. Then he turns off the light and we both say &#34;wowww&#34; at all the stars on his ceiling. The stars show up bright and clear, especially on the green light setting. It's a great buy :)
