review/summary: Great value for the price.review/text: Good construction. Great price. You can't go wrong with this product.I use it for my pet dog Havanese to keep him secured in his room at bedtime. Can also be used for a toddler although not certain if the locking mechanism would be ideal. Even in the lock position it can be pushed to break open with moderate force. For a pet, it's great. For a toddler, not certain. You might have to consider a higher priced gate. But for me, very satisfied. Would recommend.
