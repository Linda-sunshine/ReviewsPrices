review/summary: By far my favorite diapers on the market!review/text: I have tried every diaper I could find and always end up going back to pampers swaddlers. They are the softest diapers. They also have something like a mesh lining that captures poopy messes, which keeps a lot off of their soft behinds. Amazon has the best prices that I have found.
