review/summary: Worth it on amazon - Happy and Dry, Never had an issuereview/text: My son has worn these since moving out of the infant diapers and we see no need to change. Amazingly good at stopping leaks and few diaper rashes.Very reasonable price with the subscribe and save / Mom discount on Amazon, normally ~30% off retail. If I had to pay regular store prices I may have been tempted to try a bargain brand but with the discount its worth it going with the name brand quality.
