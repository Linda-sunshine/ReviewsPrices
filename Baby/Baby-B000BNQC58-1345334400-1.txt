review/summary: Nice product BUT too fragilereview/text: I have been through 4 of these now and they are a nice product that my 5 and 3 year olds love, but the light is extremely fragile. One fall from the bed or bonk with a hard toy and the light breaks - that is the end of the toy. Then you have to buy a new one, as there is no way to replace the light component. This is very discouraging, as the older the children get the more "accidents" occur, and it becomes a big waste of money replacing them every couple months.
