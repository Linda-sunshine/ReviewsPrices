review/summary: Perfect for the kid who needs a nightlightreview/text: We previously had a turtle that lasted about 6 months, the light went out and there was no fixing it. :( Then we bought another one because our daughter was very attached to it and it really did work well until the light just went out. That one lasted about 18 months. The light also just went out with no real explanation in that one. Ultimately for the price considering it goes everywhere with my daughter. (vacations, sleepovers...etc) It is a good buy as long as it lasts more than 3 months. However this is an issue I think people should be aware of before they buy it. We are currently on our 3rd in 2 1/2 years. I still love the product.Batteries need to be replaced about every 6-10weeks.
