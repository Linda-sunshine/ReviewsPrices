review/summary: Wonderful gatereview/text: I spent a lot of time researching gates to use in the doorway of my toddlers' bedroom and based on other Amazon reviews, I selected this one. I have been extremely happy with this gate. These are the features I love about this gate:1) It can be pressure mounted directly against a doorframe, with no need for screwing hardware into the wall.2) You have the option of keeping it held in the open position (in either direction) or of automatically latching shut.3) Extension pieces are included, so need to spend extra.4) Very sturdy. Great quality.
