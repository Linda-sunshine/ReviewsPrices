review/summary: Keeps little hands busy, but pretty darned noisyreview/text: My 17-month-old son received this for Christmas last year and he still plays with it every day. It has two volume settings but he now knows how to turn it up, himself (joy...). The phone has no cord or string to keep it attached to the pop-out tray so it sometimes gets misplaced as my son loves to take it around the house. I wouldn't buy this thing for an educational purpose, but its entertainment value is second to none. My boy was never one to walk with it, but he will push it around when he wants it somewhere else. Make sure to turn it off when you're done playing, as the slightest jostle could make it start to play music, if you leave it on. Battery life is pretty good; we've only had to change them once in the past year, and he uses it all the time.
