review/summary: Must havereview/text: I LOVE this carrier & so does my 2 month old. We bought this when she was 6 weeks old and I regret waiting so long! It is incredibly comfortable for both of us. I also have the bjorn which I hate. I thought the wrapping part would be daunting but there are multiple ways to wrap it and the baby loves it. She sleeps, hangs out... It's amazing and I have my hands free!! Perfect for a baby who wants to be held all of the time and affordable.. Washable... Etc etc! It is a must have and I regret not having it for the first 7 weeks. U can nurse in it... Though I have yet to try. U can wear your baby while giving them skin to skin contact. It's quite soothing. Don't look any further... Get a moby!
