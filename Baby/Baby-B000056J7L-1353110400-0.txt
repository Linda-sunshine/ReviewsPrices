review/summary: So happy with this!review/text: This potty chair is awesome! I have had this chair for about two weeks. I bought it for my sixteen-month-old daughter. I also purchased Leslie Patricelli's "Potty" book in the same Amazon order. When the box arrived, I took it into my daughter's room (I had already cut through the tape) and we opened it together. She was so excited. We took this right into the bathroom, so she could see. I put the chair in our bathroom across from the toilet and the "Potty" book is on a stand next to her potty chair. She immediately sat down on it and opened her book.I didn't intend to start potty training her until after the holidays. I have been trying to get her to say the words "potty", "poop", and "pee". She hasn't said any of those words yet. However, she is starting to comprehend the words. She loves sitting on this chair and reading her "Potty" book. On an even better note, she has peed twice in the past two days, while sitting on her potty chair! I was so impressed!About the chair:It's so perfectly simple! It is just the base and the bowl that the poop and pee go into. The bowl has a fairly high and wide splash guard, but it's not so big that it is difficult for her to sit and get situated. So far nothing has splashed onto the floor. The design of the bowl keeps things from sliding down the sides when you empty it into the toilet. The bowl doesn't have anything to lock it into place, so be sure to teach your child not to play with it from the very beginning. As the description notes, the design is ergonomical and stable. The chair is high, wide, and well-curved. It would be difficult to tip over.On the (barely) downside. The seat is hard plastic and doesn't seem comfy. However, my daughter doesn't seem to mind. It would also be nice if there was a way of locking the bowl into the base so that curious children don't try to take the bowl out.
