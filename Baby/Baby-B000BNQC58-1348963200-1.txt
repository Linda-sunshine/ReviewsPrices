review/summary: Very pleasedreview/text: Our son just loves this turtle. He is 2 1/2 yrs.and still in his crib. He has it in there and knows how to turn it on himself. His big boy bed is soon to arrive and we will have it on his night stand or in bed with him! Perfect amount of light, it covers the entire ceiling! And it shuts itself off after 45 mins. We are very please with this turtle!
