review/summary: The Bestreview/text: This is the most sturdy potty chair I have ever seen. I highly recommended it. The high back is perfect for long and comfortable encouraging sits. The variety of colors to choose from is excellent. I got this for my 1-1/2 year old grand-daughter. Parents have already introduced it to her and she had a good response. More on the progress later!Great buy folks!!
