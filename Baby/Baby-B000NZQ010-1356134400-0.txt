review/summary: great until...review/text: Less than a year after purchase, it suddenly stopped working. Replaced battery- didn't work. Took it apart to realize that a thin wire had disconnected. Fortunately, we have the equipment to solder it back, but you'd think a kids toy like this would be designed a little more sturdy to handle repeated impact, especially since the front toy is difficult to connect to the push cart.
