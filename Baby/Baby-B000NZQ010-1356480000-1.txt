review/summary: New Favorite Toy!review/text: This is my 6 month old daughters new favorite toy! She loves sitting there and moving all the parts and being able to make it sing and light up all by herself. She is not walking yet of course, but when she starts there is a way to adjust how "loose" the back wheels are. Basically you can control how fast it rolls. This is a great feature so that you dont have to worry about it slipping away from your little one and them falling. The only negative thing I have to say is that my daughter has pulled it over on top of herself a few times. I wish I could figure out how to anchor it down so she didn't do this. But it's really not a big deal. Definitely a great toy and worth the $!!!
