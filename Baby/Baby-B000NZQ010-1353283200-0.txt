review/summary: VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walkerreview/text: This was a wonderful birthday gift for my one year old niece. She loved it and immediately stood up and started to push and walk with the item. She is not walking on her own but with this item she will be soon. This is the first time I have used this product. I like convenience of shopping through Amazon on line.
