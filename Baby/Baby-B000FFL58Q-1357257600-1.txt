review/summary: launder with carereview/text: As a play gym, it provides the entertainment expected for an infant. However -- I chose to launder the mat before letting my granddaughter play on it. I followed the instructions on the label to the rule, but the backing partially MELTED. I am able to sew additional backing on it, but my suggestion is -- DO NOT machine dry, despite the label.
