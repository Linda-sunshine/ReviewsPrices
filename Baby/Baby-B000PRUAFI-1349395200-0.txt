review/summary: Strong and Functional, holds up well.review/text: Our family uses this gate to barrier off our dogs from certain areas of the house if we are not able to watch them in that area. The installation of this gate was a bit slower than I expected because of interference with the trim at the base of my walls but still installed relatively easily. Following installation I have zero complaints about this gate. It is extremely sturdy, the auto open/close cam feature is phenomenal, and the locking mechanism works very well.
