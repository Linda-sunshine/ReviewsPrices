review/summary: Good for the price point, keeps diaper rash away.review/text: I keep coming back to these diapers. The swaddlers for little babies are GREAT - love the indicator line, the softness, and - best of all - the way diaper rash magically stays away from my babies with these diapers. Whereas with more eco-friendly diapers (Honest Company, Whole Foods, Seventh Generation) I ALWAYS have to apply barrier cream to prevent rashes - maybe because the material is rougher, or the lack of chemical stuff means they really sit in their pee more? Who knows, I'm speculating - with these I don't need any. Do I feel a little bad that these are not eco-friendly? Yes. Do they smell a little chemical-y? Yes. But they absolutely get the job done, keep my babies comfortable, and are at a fantastic price point. Definitely some trade-offs to consider but ultimately these win out for me. I wish I was the type to cloth diaper but I don't have the energy! I will say I do NOT like these diapers for toddlers - the chemical smell is really strong and they don't seem as well made.Can I also just say that while subscribe and save brings these to a great price point under the Amazon Mom program, it is so annoying to not be able to order an extra package, or even an initial package, outside of my subscribe date and still receive the discount? It means the first time I need something I have to wait until my subscribe date (but I need it now!) and if I run out early, I have to wait until my subscribe date, otherwise no discount. With a new baby this can be very tricky. The old way of doing it (subscribe and save price applied no matter when you ordered it) was MUCH better.
