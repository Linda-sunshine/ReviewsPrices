review/summary: Good diaperreview/text: I like these diapers, they're easy to put on a squirming baby. I like that the swaddlers have a wet indicator, but those aren't available for Amazon Prime, so I went with these. No real complaints, I can usually tell when my baby needs a change without a wet indicator.
