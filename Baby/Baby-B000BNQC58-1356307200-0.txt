review/summary: This Turtle is greatreview/text: Our 1.5 year old loves the turtle.He got it yesterday and was running around with it all day. He loves to steer the lights himself and is exited to go to bad in the evening! He stares at the stars and tells himself a story (it must be about stars I guess ;) and falls asleep. We hope his excitement will last. So fare we are very happy with this cute little thing. We called her Rita...I don't agree with reviews that the shield of the turtle is maybe not robust enough or that the stars are not bright enough. In fact I think the stars are a little bright at the moment so that we stay on the yellow color, which is the weakest one. The turtle stands on the floor in the child's room and projects stars over the entire ceiling. They are as large as tea candle and bright enough that you can see without turning on another light in the room. It is dark enough for sleeping though.Again: No complains. The turtle is even better than I expected.
