review/summary: finally no leakingreview/text: i've been busy cleaning up wet & messy leaks and washing dirty undershirts & clothes for 8 months when my friend suggested that i switch from luvs to pampers. now that my baby NEVER leaks onto her clothes and i have no dirty undershirts to soak i regret not having known earlier that it wasnt my baby who's messy, it was the luvs that didn't suit her no matter what size i tried. pampers are definitely more expensive than luvs but they're so worth it!
