review/summary: Never &#34;came together&#34;review/text: No matter how I tightened or adjusted the closing never fully came together. Its also EXTREMELY narrow. I was using this at the bottom of stairs and it just made going up and down soooo difficult! Sent it back and got another Cardinal Gates Stairway Special gate (which I also use at the top). See my review there.
