review/summary: Love Huggies, but...review/text: Love Huggies, but...buyer beware. When the product description says "economy", they mean it! We've used Huggies for the past 2 1/2 years and have been very impressed. We bought these thinking "hey, this is a great deal. And they're Huggies, so what can go wrong?" However, at least 1/3 of the diapers in the box were defective and the strip on the sides that attaches the diaper ripped, making them extremely expensive per diaper for those that actually worked.
