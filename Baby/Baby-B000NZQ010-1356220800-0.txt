review/summary: Daughter Loves this!review/text: This toy is perfect for our daughter! She had learned to pull herself up and take steps with this toy! She is only 7 1/2 months and she knows exactly what this is for! The detachable part is perfect for helping her sit and play. She loves all the lights and sounds!
