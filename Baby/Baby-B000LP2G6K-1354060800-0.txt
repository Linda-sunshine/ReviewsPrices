review/summary: So easy to use, great product for the pricereview/text: with 2 babies we needed to get a pack n play, this was a great choice. It is just the right size and with the added bassinet feature, both of our children were able to benefit from it. My only complaint would be the case; it seems to be more difficult than it should be to make everything fir into the case. the play yard is very easily collapsible and the mattress surrounds that with ease as well. However, when it comes time to put the bassinet netting, the poles and the mobile in side the case as well - you really have to get creative! More often than not, I have to fidget with all the accessories to get everything to fit in smoothly.
