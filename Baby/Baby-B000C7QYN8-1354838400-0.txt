review/summary: Washing is best thoughreview/text: Although washing is the best option for the babies (and I normally do so when daughter poops) maybe this is the best wipe for babies, with least rashes and chemicals. Other than the quality of the material, the size is just nice- not too big or too small. No need to waste paper.
