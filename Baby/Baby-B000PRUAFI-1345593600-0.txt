review/summary: Best features in this price range.review/text: We bought this gate initially to keep our pets out of the bathroom, and are going to be buying a couple more for our baby.While initially "bent" when it comes out of the package, this is not a defect. There is a bit of a spring effect that gives this gate a pressure fit inside a door frame. Once the ends are properly adjusted (and the included wrench lets you tighten it very well), the latch lines up and the swinging gate works perfectly.At this price (~$36) I have not found a better equivalent product anywhere. We've had it for almost a year, opening it dozens of times a day, and it is holding up very well.
