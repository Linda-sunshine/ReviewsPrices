review/summary: holds up my pants great!review/text: as others have said, this is a little big on me to be supportive. I ordered the medium at 190# and 28 weeks. It's snug, but not supportive.HOWEVER! i have a few pairs of full belly pants that refuse to stay up over my rump. this band works great at holding up those problematic pants. i can comfortably wear it all day while sitting at my desk, and it does a great job holding them up on the weekends when i'm running around (bending) more when they really slip down. i'm very happy with it as a belt for the listed price. who knows, as i get bigger, maybe it'll start to be supportive, too.*edited* at 32 weeks this is supportive, and i wear it daily. i'm shocked at how much a little elastic band really helps support. i love it, and well, well worth the price.
