review/summary: Horrible chemical smell on the hammockreview/text: I gave this 3 stars because the size of the toy hammock is exactly what I wanted but the minute I opened the box the smell was unbearable. It is such a strong smell and there is absolutley no way Im putting it in my kids room or even my house. Im going to try and let it air out for a day outside and if that doesnt work its being returned.
