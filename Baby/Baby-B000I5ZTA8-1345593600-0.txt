review/summary: Order a size up!review/text: Great product - but really order a size up... I am 5 feet tall with a current weight of 113 pounds at week 29, a relative small belly and ordered size "Petite". It fits with the largest setting so I hope the band will stretch out so I can still wear it the next 10 weeks... Maybe a size "small" would have been better for me, even if I am far away from 135 pounds!
