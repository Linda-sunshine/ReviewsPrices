review/summary: works for my needsreview/text: needed for dogs (labs) I have installed on stairs to be able to keep dogs up or down. Like that you can walk thru and door will stay open if you wish. once installed it is very sturdy. Takes a bit to get it up, about 15 minutes, but once up... I am very pleased.
