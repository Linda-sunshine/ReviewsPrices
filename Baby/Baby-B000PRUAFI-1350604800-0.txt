review/summary: Super Convenient!review/text: I ordered this gate because we currently have 3 dogs and 3 cats in the house--and the dogs kept getting into the litter box area. We were using a standard gate, so we had to take it down every time the dogs wanted to go outside, and we had to step over it to get to the laundry room.After having this gate for a few weeks, I will say it is brilliant! It was easy to install (my husband, of course, opted to not read the directions) and was ready to go in less than 15 minutes. I love that the gate swings both ways, and that it is so easy to open. The auto-close feature is also really great with the dogs, I can let it swing closed behind me to separate them if needed.The cats have no problem hopping over the gate to get to the litter box, and the gate stays open when pushed all the way out. Between the price and the function--this gate has been fantastic!
