review/summary: Big and awsome.review/text: I love this, but its big...real big. I love it, my son loves it and it keeps him and his stuff contained. I have told many people about this item. i would say it should be left up and not taken up and down all the time. I could see how other reviews had brake issues with the play yard, however I have not had any and i think its because I leave it up in one area.
