review/summary: Very disappointingreview/text: We were very excited and eagerly waiting for this once we had ordered it. We went by the wonderful reviews that it had received and thought it would be perfect for our 8 month old. But we were very disappointed with the product. It is so hard to close and open, that it's not practical at all. I'm surprised that it's got such good reviews. We definitely don't recommend this product - don't waste your time / money / energy. Thank God for returns. Now we're on the look out for a play yard that actually works.
