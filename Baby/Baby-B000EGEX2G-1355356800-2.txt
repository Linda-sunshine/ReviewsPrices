review/summary: Better than expectedreview/text: I bought this chair after much deliberation because of the mixed reviews and because I already had one. I live in duplex and spend most of my time downstairs during the day so I have been using the nursing chair I already bought downstairs in the living room and was trying to decide if I should move it upstairs into the baby room (or our room where our 2 month old currently sleeps) because it is so uncomfortable to nurse on our bed or buy another one for the upstairs because there wasn't anywhere comfortable to nurse downstairs either. I could not bare to spend a lot on another chair but seriously couldn't spend another night nursing on our bed because it's so high off the ground I was having trouble getting on and off the bed while holding the baby. It just wasn't feasible to buy two expensive chairs. So anyway, I got this on Monday and my husband put it together right away. I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it was. The cushions were much softer than I expected and the chair glided very smoothly. I am so happy I bought this chair and it has made my nighttime nursing a pleasure!
