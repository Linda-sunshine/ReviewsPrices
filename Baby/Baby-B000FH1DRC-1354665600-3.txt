review/summary: these are the best diapers on the marketreview/text: Pampers swaddlers are easily the best diapers on the market. They feel so soft as if they were a cloth diaper, but have the consistency to handle even the largest of messes. I've never had a leak on these and love the way they feel and fit on my son. We love these diapers, only wish they weren't so expensive.
