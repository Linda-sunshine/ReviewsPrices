review/summary: Go with a potty seat instead!review/text: My daughter is still only 18 months old, so perhaps I should wait a few more months before writing this review. However, I wish I'd bought a potty seat (BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Black) instead of a standalone potty for the following reasons:1. My daughter is terrified of this seat. I'm not sure why, but it is the only thing I've ever tried to sit her on that makes her cry and which she refuses to sit on. She hates it, and I'm not sure why.2. She definitely knows what it is. She comes into the bathroom to me and points at it and says, "Potty." every time we go in the bathroom. However, she stays clear of it. I think the hollow seat and restrictive sides may be traumatizing to her. She is much more interested in my potty.3. Now that I know all of this, I also see the benefits of a potty seat from a clean up perspective. If she'd prefer to use the adult potty, I won't have to clean up poops by hand like I would with this one.All in all, I thought this would be preferable to her than a potty seat, and I was totally wrong. I think I'll re-sell my unused potty, and buy a potty seat which will be easier for me in the first place!
