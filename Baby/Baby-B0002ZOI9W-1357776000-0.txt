review/summary: Such a life saver!review/text: I bought this for my son when he was 2.5 months old and he loved it....even more than his bouncer! He is now 4 months and still loves it and fits in it. It's such a life saver for me...i can put him in there and rock him or just leave him in there to play with the toys that hang while i do chores. One of the things I don't like is that the bars on the side feel a bit unsturdy. I can litterally bend the chair to the sides a bit...feels like its gonna come apart but it hasn't. So far so good & i love that he can use this as a rocking chair when he gets older. I was also very used to moving his bouncer with my feet while sitting down. Since this rocker doesn't have anything at the bottom to grip on the floor, it slides and its a bit harder to rock him w my feet. It keeps sliding away from me but I've learned how to keep it in place with time. Another complaint is the vibrator on this thing...it's way too loud. Its more than just a light buzzing sound. The compartment where the batteries go is kinda loose so it shakes a lot when the vibrator is on. I feel like its distracting if he's trying to put himself to sleep so i slip a small couch pillow under the vibrator to keep it from rattling and making noise. The complaints still aren't enough to give this less than 5 stars. Overall we love it!
