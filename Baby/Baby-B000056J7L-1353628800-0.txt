review/summary: No complaints herereview/text: When our first daughter started potty training, she immediately picked out this pink potty seat and we really have no complaints about it. It does not tip over, it is super easy to clean (which I'm sure is important to most parents!), light enough to be fairly portable, and as comfortable as a potty chair can be I suppose. In fact, my daughter does not mind sitting in it for long periods of time which definitely helped during the whole potty training process. And actually we liked it so much that we ordered a second one for my younger daughter even though she's not quite ready to be potty trained yet. We had previously ordered the little bjorn potty chair for my younger daughter, but that one doesn't have any back support and is almost too lightweight. If it seems weird to write a review about a potty chair it's only because this turned out to be so essential for my daughter throughout the training process. Seriously, the whole potty training thing is such an ordeal anyway, you don't want to have to deal with any subpar products along the way. This bjorn product is just what we needed to get the job done.
