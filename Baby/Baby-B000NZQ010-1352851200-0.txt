review/summary: Must have for all babiesreview/text: My daughter absolutly loves this toy. She started using it around six months without the weel part. Then, at eight months she started "walking" around by pushing her little "car" around. Now she's one and can walk but she still loves her car. She always dances to the songs and is learning shapes, numbers and colors with this toy too.
