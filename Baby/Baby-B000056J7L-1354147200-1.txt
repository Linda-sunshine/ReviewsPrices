review/summary: Easy and my kids love itreview/text: I have a 3 year old son and 2 year old daughter both potty training. Due to multiple moves, my son was interrupted in his potty training and we thought we would have an issue with resuming it. However, he loves this potty! He does use a regular toilet as well, but he loves that this one is low to the ground and not as shaky as his big potty. It can be pushed over if they lean up against the higher back area but it has not tipped over yet. It is still safer than the seats on the larger toilets. My daughter immediately showed interest in the potty as soon as she saw it. She likes to sit on it just for fun.It's easy to clean, lightweight and fairly stable. The green is much nicer in person. Looks more akin to the VW Beetle's green color. Very fresh looking. It's also small enough to not take up too much space in the bathroom. My husband and I are very happy that we purchased this product.
