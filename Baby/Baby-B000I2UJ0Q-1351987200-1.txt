review/summary: Best Decision!review/text: We had the Baby Einstein Activity Center that was given to us by a friend. He loved it so much but seemed to be getting a little bored. He was always trying to jump out of it. After asking my Facebook friends and looking through the Amazon Reviews - the decision was made - Fisher Price Rainforest Jumperoo. So glad we got this! He absolutely loves it!! We still use the activity center for post-feeding fun but he clearly only wants to be in the Jumperoo. He is not quite tall enough to reach the floor - we have hardwood so we put a couple of the play gym squares under it - he goes to town. We have so much fun watching him in it!I think it is making his legs stronger. He constantly wants to stand now!
