review/summary: Was worried about sizing due to other reviews...review/text: I was so worried about sizing bc there was so many bad reviews about the size being too small. I'm approx. 235lbs at 5'3&#34; and I ordered the large. I can snap it on the tightest setting and still have too much room. I should have gone for the medium but the reviews scared me. I just received this product and will update everyone with how much support the product gives.
