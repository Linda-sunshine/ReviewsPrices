review/summary: Son Loved It But The Light Stopped Workingreview/text: My son loved this. Unfortunately, after about 1.5 to 2 years, it stopped working. New batteries did not resolve the issue. Tried to take it apart to see what is wrong. It seems to be glued shut so that no maintenance is possible without breaking it open. Thumbs down for an unrepairable turtle that only works for about 1.5 years.
