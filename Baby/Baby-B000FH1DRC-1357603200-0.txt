review/summary: Only diapers that don't give diaper rashreview/text: For the first few months my baby had pretty bad diaper rash. I just thought that it was to be our lot in life. After trying a small box of the swaddlers we found that it was the other diapers that were the problem. They are amazingly thin diapers and wick the moisture right away from baby's skin.
