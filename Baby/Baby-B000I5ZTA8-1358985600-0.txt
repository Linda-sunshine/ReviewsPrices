review/summary: Just what I hoped forreview/text: I ordered this with high hopes and was so excited two days later when it arrived! I immediately put it on and noticed a difference right away. It's like a weight was lifted-pun intended:) I wore it for several hours the next day as I cleaned and organized my house(nesting hardcore, as I am at 32 weeks) and miraculously my back and stomach did not hurt one pit!! I noticed even more than my legs and feet hurt after several hours though..I did want to address the size issue though. I ordered a small because everyone in all the reviews I'd read said that this ran really small. I am almost 5'4" and am at about 140 now. When I got pregnant I weighed about 110. I ordinarily would have ordered the petite size but was worried it would be too small. I think the sizing chart they offer is pretty accurate. I have to put it on the tightest clasps for it to fit right and it is still not too tight at all.Over all, I am very pleased with this product!
