review/summary: Awesome Giftreview/text: Bought 2 of these for my cousin's. They are between the ages of 6-9, both girls. Great for the bedtime routine!!!Keeps the kids in their own room while allowing a fun 30-45 minute relaxing light show of stars. This is a good gift when one isn't sure what to purchase. Kids can be so tough. Delivery was spot on, packaging and description was as shown.
