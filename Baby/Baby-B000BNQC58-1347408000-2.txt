review/summary: Great Product at a Great Pricereview/text: My grandaughter wanted one of the dream lights she sees advertised on TV. I am so happy I did some research prior to buying one! This has a much longer automatic shutoff time (which after all isn't that what you want to help a 4 year old fall sleep). It works very well and is very sturdy. Although she wanted the Unicorn Dreamlight she is so excited with "Tommy Turtle" it goes with her regardless of which bedroom she is in after dark. Less expensive than the those advertised on TV as well. All around a great product. We are planning on buying several more for family and her friends for Christmas.
