review/summary: Love it. Noticed the seam but not that bad.review/text: Don't let the seam reviews stop you from buying this pillow. I bought this for my wife and she loves it! She had this to say about it. &#34;I'm 22 weeks pregnant and have had a hard time sleeping through the night for the last month. My husband bought this for my for Christmas but decided to give it to me early after a particularly long night. This pillow is great. It fits my body nearly perfect and has allowed me to get comfortable. Which has translated into more rest and sleeping through the night again! (for now).&#34;&#34;I noticed the seam at first but it has not bothered me at all. I sleep on my side with the open end of the pillow at my feet. I have just the basic cover on it and really have not had any problem with the seam.&#34;&#34;Don't let the seam reviews scare you away from buy it, if you need a good body pillow this is a good one!&#34;
