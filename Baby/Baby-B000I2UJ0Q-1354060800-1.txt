review/summary: My grandson loves the actionreview/text: I love this product. I bought one for my granddaughter when she was a baby (now 3) and she played with it until she outgrew it. My new grandson is very active and loves to jump on laps, so this was the logical choice for him. It changed a little in the last three years, the hanging bird doesn't have as big of a tail, but it provides the interaction that a busy little boy needs. I would recommend it to parents or grandparents once children get old enough to support themselves. Both my grandson and granddaughter were four months old when they started to use it.
