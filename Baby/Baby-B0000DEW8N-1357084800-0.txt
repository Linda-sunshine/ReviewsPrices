review/summary: Love, love, love this seatreview/text: I love this seat if you cant tell. My daughter got to the point she hated sitting in her high chair so I started researching other options and this was what I went with after purchasing a cheaper, both in price and design, one earlier. Whats nice about this one is the dual trays and the tray cover for when we travel with it. I also love the adjustable heights and how securely it attaches to a chair. We went on vacation earlier before we bought this and it was a nightmare trying to feed our child. I can not wait to take it with us on vacation this year.
