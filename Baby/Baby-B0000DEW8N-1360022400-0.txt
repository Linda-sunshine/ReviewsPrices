review/summary: Great high chair/booster seatreview/text: We have 3 of these now and will probably have 4 in the near future--2 for our house and 2 for the grandparents house. This is a perfect, economical chair that can be moved, cleaned, and transported easily. We use it with the tray for our baby and without the tray as a booster for our toddler.
