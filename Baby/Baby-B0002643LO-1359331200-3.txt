review/summary: oh pampers!review/text: use them everyday.. found them to be equal to the kirkland brand from costco.. also price comes out to the same almost.I would stick with pampers for size 2 and under just because they have that yellow line mark showing when you need to change it . but in older kids like size 3 you dont need it...anyways we use pampers or kirkland and we switch the size up when we see couple episodes of leaking from the sides... following the weights on the box was not very helpful. each kid is different.--------------------If you fine my reviews helpful please mark it as so.. Thank you.
