review/summary: Kids loved it!review/text: Bought this as a present for my niece (2 years old) and nephew (5 years old) and they BOTH loved it! I'm giving it a 5 star because its cute, very simple to use and came quickly! I would recommend this to anyone--kids and adults alike. I think i might get one for myself :)!
