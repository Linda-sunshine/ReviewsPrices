review/summary: Extremely happy with pampers baby dryreview/text: Received from amazon within few days of ordering the product, though it was standard free super saving shipping. I'm using pampers baby dry for my elder one till he was completly potty trained. And now I have started buying baby dry for my little one who is 1 month old. Its so comfortable and keep's my babies bottom dry.
