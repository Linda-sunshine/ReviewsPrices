review/summary: Fun Playmat With Multiple Sources of Entertainmentreview/text: This playmat is well constructed, durable, and has a very nice selection of rings, dangling toys, music, and flashing lights to entertain a baby. The mat itself is soft and comfortable.There are more elaborate mats on the market, but it's hard to imagine needing much more than this for its intended purpose.
