review/summary: Nice play mat.review/text: I bought this play mat for my daughter when she was 2 months old. I wish I would have bought it sooner, since my daughter really liked it, but she kind of "outgrew" it by the time she was 4 months old. This play mat is entertaining and easy to clean..just throw the mat in the the washing machine on the delicate cycle. I would definitely recommend this product!
