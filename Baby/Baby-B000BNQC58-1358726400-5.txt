review/summary: My son loves it...a little too much for sleepingreview/text: We gave this to my son when he was a little over a year old. He gets so excited when he sees it that it would never help him fall asleep. We tried it one night by putting it on the changing table in his room. He wouldn't stop standing in his crib and was whining for us to give him the turtle. I read a lot of reviews before buying this because I suspected that it wouldn't promote sleep for him. So maybe we just have an easily overstimulated boy. We mainly just use it for playing and looking at the stars now. I agree with other reviewers that the amber or orange setting is very dim. Ideally, you would have the turtle on an elevated surface in the middle of the room for there to be stars all over the ceiling, but it works okay just putting it on a dresser or changing table. I don't think it would be a great thing for a child to sleep with because of the hard shell. If you want that, then maybe a Dream Lite would work better for you.
