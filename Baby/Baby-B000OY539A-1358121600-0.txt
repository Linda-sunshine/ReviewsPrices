review/summary: Love itreview/text: You have to be committed to wanting to wear your baby though. It takes a little time and practice to get it down but soon it becomes second nature. A lot of people give up and return this item before they perfect the wrap. My daughter liked facing out before she could even hold her head up and the wrap allowed her to do that. There's a cool back hold for older kids too. Check you tube for lots of options and step by step directions.I plan on using this with baby #2 but I'm a little concerned I won't have the time or free hands to tie and re-tie it with my toddler running around. I may try a pre-tied sling for breastfeeding at least.
