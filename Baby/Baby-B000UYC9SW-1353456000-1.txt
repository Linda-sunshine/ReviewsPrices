review/summary: works with Pavlik harnessreview/text: This carrier holds my baby closer to me than the Dr. Sears sling (my babies seemed to get lost in those). It's at least as easy to use as the Baby Bjorn, and less bulky, too. It's easy to launder. And best of all, the "hug" position accommodates my baby's Pavlik harness. Her orthopedist gave us the ok to use it. I haven't tried the Moby or other wrap slings, but don't think they are likely to be much better than this. One thing I haven't figured out is how to nurse baby in this sling, but maybe that just isn't possible.
