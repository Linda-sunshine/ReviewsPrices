review/summary: Fisher Price Infant Rockerreview/text: Loved the colors and pattern on this rocker. Three month old baby was able to kick and wiggle and the rocker would rock and cause the toys on the bar to jingle. She was able to wiggle and kick enough to do this on her own. The only issue, which is why the four stars, is the bar has to be detached to easily lift her in and out. This, however, is easily accomplished as the bar is easily detached; just kind of a nuisance factor.
