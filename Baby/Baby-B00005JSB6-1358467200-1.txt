review/summary: Best diaper out there for my sonreview/text: I always read bad reviews to see if there is something informational there, but bad reviews for Huggies are just as strange as it could get. Diaper are designed to simplify parents life in comparison to regular cloth ones - from 20-30 years ago. But reading bad reviews I could not stop wondering why people are expecting these diapers to absorb unlimited quantity of pee? When you see &#34;crumbs&#34; this is actually a sign that you NEEDED to change this diaper ages ago. These are good diapers, but they need to be changed frequently like all other diapers. The older your kid the more often you need to change him - (s)he pees you know like a big boy or a big girl. These diapers are pretty absorbent, but it does not mean that you need to let your kid explore its capacity every time. In order to allow your kid to go through potty training successfully you still need to change him fairly often to give him a &#34;clean&#34; feeling. On another note accidents still might happen, this is why they are called accidents, and they will happen in any diapers, because kids are moving objects - mine 2-year old does not stop period even for food. Even my boy being so active I can assure that we did not have an accident for very long. Couple leak accidents we had in the beginning when diaper was not put properly or he needed to move up a size. I have a boy, so I can say these diapers are perfect for very active boys. Instructions are very simple - put diaper on, check how you did it, giggle with your kid when pushing his legs towards his tummy to allow better fit - done.If you like my review please mark it as helpful. Thanks :-)
