review/summary: Great Seatreview/text: I think this seat is great as it really feels like you have a complete high chair with you once you attach it to the chair. It attaches very securely and the tray is great. It is easy to keep in the trunk and you can carry it into a restaurant or someone's house no problem and have it hooked up in a few seconds. I like the fact that I don't have to worry about what type of tables the place has as you do with the clip-on seats. You can also position the seat next to you as you would a normal high chair instead of being restricted to something attached to the table.
