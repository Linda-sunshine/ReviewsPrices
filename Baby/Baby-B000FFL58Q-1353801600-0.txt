review/summary: Great playmatreview/text: My son loves this playmat. I really like the size of it and at 8 months, my son still enjoys it. It plays to all the senses - lots of colors, sounds (rattles, music, crinkly leaf noise), textures (different materials, tails & ribbons on the mat) and taste (haha my son likes to put the different toys in his mouth). He absolutely loves the mirror and will spend awhile staring at it. The best part is that you can take any of the hanging toys off for your child to play with it when they outgrow the gym. You can also rearrange the toys to change things up a bit.
