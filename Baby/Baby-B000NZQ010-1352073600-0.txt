review/summary: My son loves itreview/text: Got this as a gift and brought it out for my son at about 5 months. He wasn't able to play with it much before but I can see that he's getting more coordinated as he's able to do so much more in the 2 months he's had it. He prefers this toy over other toys he will only play with for a couple minutes. Would recommend.
