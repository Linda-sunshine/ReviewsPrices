review/summary: Pampers Baby Dry size 5, 172 countreview/text: I have this product on auto ship. I have 2 children, both in the same size diaper and I find that Pampers fits them the best and prevents the most leakage. The only complaint I have about the shipment I received today is that the shipping information was taped over the top of the box. Not a big deal, just made opening the box a little more difficult.
