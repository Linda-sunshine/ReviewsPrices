review/summary: I feel completely safe using our Moby Wrap!review/text: I looked in every local dept. store.. Checked out tons of different wraps here on Amazon and everyone had some reviews that left me lingering with doubt. After all, I'm carrying my daughter in it, I want to know its safe! I ordered the navy blue one for my wife and I and received it in about four days.The product is perfect! The fabric is soft as all get out while completely durable. It's in no way questionable as to stitching or anything. In fact there is no area a stitch can break. It's just one looooong strip. You can tie it as tight as you want. I'm 6'1&#34; and weigh 170lbs. My wife is 5'3&#34; and is 120lbs. Our daughter is 6weeks old and was born premie so is still itsy-bitsy; the medium one fits great for us! Totally worth it!Of course I hold her as often as I can with my arms and hugs... But it comes in hand when shopping or cleaning up the house... Especially when my son wants to play. :)
