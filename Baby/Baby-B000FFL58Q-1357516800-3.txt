review/summary: Wonderfulreview/text: I can't say enough about this play matt; it's great quality. We got ours already used three years ago, my son loved it, now my daughter; it's been through 3 or 4 kids and it still looks like new. The toys are engaging and moveable the lights and butterflys are what makes it so great for younger babies and I love that it has a low setting for volume and 'nature sounds' for when you cant take anymore toy music and the shake option to save battery life.
