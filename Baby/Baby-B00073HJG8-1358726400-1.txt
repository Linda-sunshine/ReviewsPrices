review/summary: Perfect for kid's play roomreview/text: We searched at local Babies R Us, but had to take back the toy hammock we bought there b/c it was very poorly constructed. This hammock was a sight for sore eyes. Incredibly easy installation and sturdy construction. Planning to buy another one soon.
