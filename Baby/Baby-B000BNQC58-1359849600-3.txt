review/summary: Great nightlightreview/text: My daughter's old Twilight Turtle stopped working after five years, and she nagged until we bought another. The stars are a little bigger, and it is easier to see the constellations. She has spent lots of time reading the small book that came with it, and that has sparked an interest in constellations and stars. I love that turtle fades off by itself, and there is an on/off switch on the bottom to prevent accidental turning on at other times.
