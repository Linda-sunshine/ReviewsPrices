review/summary: love the winkel-our grandson got one as a hand-me-down and he loves itreview/text: love this toy--it is very colorful. Our 7-month old grandson has played with it since he was 3 months old. I bought one for a new grandbaby and I think she will love it too.The only thing I didn't like was that the packaging was mashed pretty badly. It didn't affect the toy, but I think that if you pay for shipping, the packaging should be presentable to give as a gift. I will take the toy out of the package and wrap it in tissue paper.
