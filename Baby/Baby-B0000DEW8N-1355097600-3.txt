review/summary: Good option if you don't want a large highchairreview/text: Bought this for my nephew's visits and it works fine. He seems comfortable and I feel confident in the attachment to my dining chair. This may not be a long-term option because at 22-25 lbs he fits fine. The tray is adjustable laterally but not vertically so I suppose he may grow out of it shortly. Nice that it can be used as a regular booster at the table as well. Great for the price!
