review/summary: Easy to set up, weird smell.review/text: I received this product on time, and for the price, I love it! It's very easy to set up. The only issue I had with its assembly was finding where to put the metal poles for the bassinet... And all it took was a little bit of common sense to figure out. :)The smell of this, however, was awful. It was a mix between chemical-plastic, and as if the guy who packaged it was a heavy smoker. I wiped it down with Lysol wipes and have been letting it air out over the past three days. It's getting better. The mattress is thin, yes, but that's to be expected from something that comes folded.I will update my review when my baby arrives!
