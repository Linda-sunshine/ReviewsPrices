review/summary: A Must Have!review/text: I have degenerative disk and I'm pregnant. My back pain is about an 8 or 9 most of the time and makes sleep really hard. I got this pillow and starting laughing out loud because of the instant relief this pillow provided. It is like a big hug of support and love. I was amazed at how well this pillow actually works. It is extremely supportive, strong and comfortable. I felt like my back, hips, neck and shoulders were in alignment. The pillow is the perfect size to support my head as well. I'm so happy I got this pillow. My back pain went down to a 2. If you have back pain, wait no longer! Order this pillow now!! It is worth every penny!
