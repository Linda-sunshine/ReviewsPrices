review/summary: Great valuereview/text: We ordered this for our nursery. It came just as pictured, very little assembly, and it was easy. It glides well, and we have had no problems with it so far. It's gone through a few milk spills. The cloth has been durable, and easy to lean. I'll either use a baby wipe, or sometimes Resolve to clean it up. Definitely recommend this, very comfortable!
