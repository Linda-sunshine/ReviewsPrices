review/summary: Favorite toy for my 3 month old! Love it!review/text: A little smaller than I thought, but my 3 month old son LOVES this toy! Always able to grab and bite, so he loooooves it. He squeeled when he saw it the second time. And when he bops his head with it, it's light and won't hurt him (lol). Lots of colors and a nice soft rattle. I will buy this for any and all new parents I come across. One of the best! 5 star for sure. I'd say 2 months and up to fully enjoy, but will still like to hold it and great colors. My favorite toy purchase so far.
