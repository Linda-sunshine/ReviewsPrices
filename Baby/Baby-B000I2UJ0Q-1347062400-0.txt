review/summary: Love this item so far.review/text: We have only had this for about a week but so far my very wiggly 5 month old loves it and it keeps her entertained and content long enough for me to get a few things done. We had previously borrowed the Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper for my first child and comparing the two the little einstein seems to have more activities but overall i like the actual jumper part of this one better.
