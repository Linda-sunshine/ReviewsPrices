review/summary: Finally found a use for itreview/text: With a jaundiced new born, there was no need for this. We all got our sleep. He knew night from day. Just ended up being a nice night light for middle of the night feedings.Fast forward 2 months and he needed to be put on medication for a hemangioma. Problem was, it upset his stomach. The key was if he kept it down less than so many minutes, re dose. If he kept it down more than so many minutes, he is good. So this has been so useful timing his meds.Perfect to have on hand. Like I said, worst comes to worst you bought yourself a very useful portable night light!
