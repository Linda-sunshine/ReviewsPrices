review/summary: its okreview/text: It works well - does exactly what it is supposed to do. But honestly I found apps on my iphone that worked just as well and I always had my phone on me versus having to find this thing every time I fed or changed a diaper. If you don't have a phone with apps that can do this, this would be a great product.
