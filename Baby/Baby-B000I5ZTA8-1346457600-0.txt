review/summary: Mini Cradlereview/text: I'm 8 months pregnant and 135 lbs. I ordered the mini cradle size small because I am carrying very low and have a lot of pain in my pelvic area and lower back. I thought this might help give me some support, but unfortunately its too big. I use the very last setting to hook it on and it could definitely be tighter. I really couldn't tell much difference with it but I think it might be worth it if you get the right size.
