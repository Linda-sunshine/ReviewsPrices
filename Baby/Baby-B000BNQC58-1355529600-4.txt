review/summary: Not sure where the hype is coming from.review/text: I was SO excited to get this for my 2 year old's birthday. Then, when we actually tested it out, I felt horrible for giving it to him. The stars barely show up, especially the 'orange' one. Even in the darkest room, it is not impressive. Any bit of light and the stars are near impossible to see. My son has not showed interest in this and it has been almost a year now.
