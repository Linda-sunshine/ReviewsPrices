review/summary: Soothing AND educational!review/text: My kid is only four months old, so who cares what he thinks! I think this is AWESOME! I received this turtle as a shower gift and it quickly became of of my favorites. There are four different colors of projected light (green is my fav) and it projects ACTUAL constellations! I look forward to pointing them out to my boy one day to bore him to sleep.
