review/summary: Every new parent NEEDS one of these.review/text: This is probably one of the greatest inventions. Before my baby was born, I purchased this and figured it's a nice-to-have item.I didn't realize until the first day home from the hospital how I would be RELYING on this simple, but necessary timer. When you are sleep deprived and learning everything for the first time, you don't know which way is up or down sometimes. It can be extremely overwhelming, especially when breastfeeding every 2 hours. This timer is a life-saver. It literally never left my side for 3 months.When I forgot it in one room and started feeding my infant, I would desperately call out for someone to bring me my timer! lol.I used it to keep track of how long it's been from the last diaper change, the last nap, and also as a timer for how long my baby nursed on each side. Coupled with the Newborn Baby Tracker - Round the Clock Childcare Journal (which is also a necessity), I never really lost track (or my mind). It's also great for care-takers too, especially when they are picking up for an hour or two when you run out.Please get this for anyone you know who is expecting a baby and they will thank you! One of the most useful items yet.
