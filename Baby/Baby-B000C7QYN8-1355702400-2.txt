review/summary: Honest Co vs Seventh Generation (old and new)review/text: Well when I placed the order I did not realize that these were an older version of SG wipes... Ugh! These are horrible. They are dry, thin, not very absorbent and seem to have a rough texture. I have tried the new ones when I ran out of the Honest Co. wipes that are home delivered. The NEW SG wipes were good. These old SG wipes I ordered from Amazon were cheaper than Honest Co. for just wipes. Hence, why I bought these in bulk as my back up (remember, not knowing they were different than what I bought last week at my grocery store). Bad idea. I like the Honest Co. wipes better, and will just order more of them. These are so harsh, I may just donate these.
