review/summary: It actually worked!! ...review/text: I purchased this seat when my firstborn was a toddler. I'm guessing he was around 2.5 years old.It came with 2 pieces: a base and a cup.The base has a wide, stable bottom on it to prevent tipping and a nice back on it. There is rubber on the bottom to add stability and keep the potty from sliding across the floor. There are no sharp corners - just curves which are very easy to keep clean. There is a hole in the base; the cup is set into this hole, overlapping the edges. The edges all slope towards the cup so any liquid drains into the cup.The deflector is not removable; it is all one piece with the cup. I LOVE this design. It is smooth so that it will not scratch tender body parts and it cannot get lost.The cup is removed from the TOP of the base! With my other potty, I had to turn it around and remove the cup from underneath the seat. If my toddler ever tried to empty it himself, he ended up making a big mess. With this potty, it was a lot easier for him to empty it without spilling.Having the cup on top also means that he is sitting on the edges of the cup. There are no gaps or tight corners for pee to get into. The deflector could be a little higher in our experience, but it wasn't too bad. I think if it was taller, it might be annoying for a girl so I can understand why it is the height that it is.An added bonus is that this potty chair is not an eyesore. It's rounded corners and pleasing colours are easy to look at.
