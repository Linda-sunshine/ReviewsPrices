review/summary: Captivating to my Toddler!!!review/text: I can't rave about this night light enough. I have a 2 year old son that absolutely LOVES this thing. Its nice to have options with light color, although my son really likes the blue settings.Sometimes our son needs a little motivation to get him to WANT to put on his PJs and start winding down, and this little turtle is the perfect thing to do it. He gets so excited to turn it on every night, bedtime has become SO much easier!If you are looking for a nighlight, look no further. Definitely worth every penny!
