review/summary: Great support!review/text: We started elimination communication with our daughter when she was five months old so we needed a potty that would give her support since she couldnt sit up on her own. This potty was perfect with the high back . We would place a hand on her tummy so she could Not fall forward but with the high back she was able to lean back and be comfortable. This potty has a non-skid bottom which is perfect for counter tops or wood floors. Some may think it is a little bulky when traveling and we have found that if we go to camp we just take the insert with us and she just uses that. We are very happy with this product our daughter doesn't seem uncomfortable when using, it securely stays put when she is using it, and easy to rinse out reusable insert. We love :-)
