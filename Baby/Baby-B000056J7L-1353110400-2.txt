review/summary: Wonderfully simple and yet exactly what they need!review/text: I researched which potty chair to purchase for our 18-month old daughter. This one definitely came with high marks, and I can understand why. It's simple, yet comfortable. Not obtrusive looking or frightening. Comfortable for them to sit on and easy to empty and keep clean. We started out by introducing our daughter to it by unwrapping her new potty and letting her play with it (clearly before she ever used it for its intended purpose) in the living room. We found 4 excellent potty books for her to read. She carted the potty around and got used to using it as a chair first so she could learn how to back up to it with out a problem. Then we moved the potty into the bathroom and have now designated as solely a bathroom potty. We know the whole potty training process will take some time, but I'm very pleased that she's used it at least twice since we moved it to the bathroom for its intended purpose. We will buy the exact same brand for our next child if this one is too worn out. Excellent.
