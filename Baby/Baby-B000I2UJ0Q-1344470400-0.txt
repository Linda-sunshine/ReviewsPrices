review/summary: Not perfect, but very good.review/text: My sons loves bouncing around in this thing. It definitely entertains him and is nice to have around the house. It isn't perfect though. The toys on it are okay. The rainbow area and popup tiger are a little lame. The other toys are decent though. I could think of a better set up, but overall it is a good deal.How to make this perfect Fisher Price:1) Improve the height adjustment. Our kid is too tall for the 1st level, but the 2nd level is too high for him. We're trying to get some towels and adjust, but it'd be kind of nice if it had 4 levels of adjustment.2) Improve the toys a little bit. They aren't bad right now, but I feel they could be better for sure as the toys themselves don't do much to entertain my son. He loves the jumping part, but it could be improved for the toys.3) Make it easier to store. You can't really take the thing apart after you set it up. That is killer for storing from one kid to the next. There has to be a way to make it so the toys can come off easier.Anyway, good product and Amazon has a great price on it. Just needs some improvements to really be perfect.
