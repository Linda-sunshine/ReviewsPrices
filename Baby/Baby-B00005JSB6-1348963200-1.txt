review/summary: One of the best diapers for the pricereview/text: Apart from Huggies, I have used Pampers a lot, earth's best, Kirkland diapers. While Pampers Cruisers are really good in being leak-proof, they were not fitting well for my lean but tall baby. Then I went on to try others. Kirkland's are really soft and have nice fit for size 3 very much comparable to Huggies.Earth's best was so expensive with the "green" thing and wasn't working on my budget even though they are so leak-proof.Huggies through Amazon came out just fine with the fit, holding for 10-hr, soft and the design. With being Amazon-mom, I get the best price for these diapers as well.
