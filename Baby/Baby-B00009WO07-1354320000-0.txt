review/summary: Worked for us with the occasional diaper rashreview/text: Most of these diapers didn't leak, except for the occasional overnight change. Now our son, who does not have sensitive skin, did get occasional diaper rashes with these diapers so what my husband and I did was purchase another brand in addition and rotated every other change. This helped a lot. The reason why I still like these diapers in spite of the rashes is that Pampers has excellent customer service and responded quickly and very appropriately to our complaint about the rashes.
