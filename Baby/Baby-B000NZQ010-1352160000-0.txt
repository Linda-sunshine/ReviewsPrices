review/summary: Best investment for a baby toyreview/text: As a new parent, you buy a lot of stupid baby toys they hardly play with or like for very long. This was given as a christmas gift for my son at 9 months old, and now at 20 months this is still one of his favorite toys. It has been ran into walls, kicked over, survived two moves. Absolutely is durable.He loves the little keyboard on the front and all the little activities you can play with. It still does not bore him even now. I believe it did help him walk; he was so fascinated by the lights\sounds it made when you pushed it he was walking in no time.Take my advice-jumperoos are stupid, other walkers(the ones you place your child in with the wheels, where they are suspended?) are stupid and a waste of money. This was one the best investments I ever made.
