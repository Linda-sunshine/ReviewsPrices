review/summary: Perfect addition!review/text: I had my eye on this for quite some time before and after my baby was born. We managed to snag one when she was about 10 months old and I worried that she would 'outgrow' it quickly. Not so. During the day, she liked to push the different buttons and would sit in the hallway and 'ooh' over the bright stars. Even now at 18 months it is still a hit, she stares up at them while we rock and says "pretty stars!" and points to each one.
