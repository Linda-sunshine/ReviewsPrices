review/summary: Absolutely great for the moneyreview/text: After reading reviews I was really hesitant to buy this. I sat in a different Storkcraft model at Babies R Us and loved it, but the reviews made me worry that it would fall apart after very little use. However, with everything else we had to buy, it was this glider or nothing. I'm happy to say that my son is now 4 months old and I have no complaints. I used the glider for all of our overnight feedings the first two months, and now that he sleeps through the night we've been using the glider for reading stories throughout the day and the occasional pre-nap feeding. No squeaking, no rattling, totally sturdy. The cushion isn't the most comfortable, but I can easily sit on an extra pillow if I need to. The glider looks sleek as well. The material on the cushions is a little cheap, but again, for the price it completely meets my expectations. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this glider for the price. I'm glad we got it.
