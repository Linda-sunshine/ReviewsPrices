review/summary: As Describedreview/text: Love these diapers! I've tried the regular, non-Swaddlers before because there were more diapers for similar price and immediately regretted it. They were plastic-y and didn't seem as comfortable for my baby. I use these as night-time diapers because my son's cloth diaper leaks after 7+ hours of sleep. These absorbs a lot and I've never had it leak once.
