review/summary: Love this gate!review/text: I just set this up for my puppy in a doorway. It was very easy to set up if you follow the directions and tighten all sides equally, and is very sturdy. He was able to push over the smaller gate I had, but not this one. I think it will work out great! I really like the hold open feature for when I don't need it.
