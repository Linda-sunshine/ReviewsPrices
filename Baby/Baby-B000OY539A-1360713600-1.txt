review/summary: Way too confusingreview/text: This thing is so long and is not user friendly. It is frustrating when trying to get things in order out in public and trying to deal with this VERY long chunk of fabric. When the ground is wet and the fabric is draped all over it, it doesn't go well. Would NOT recommend to anyone!
