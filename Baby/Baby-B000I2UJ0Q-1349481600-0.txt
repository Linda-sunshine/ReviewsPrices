review/summary: love love love this!review/text: I love this product! It has so many different toys to entertain my son. He just a little too small so i put a small pillow underneath so he his feet will touch something. Other than that, everything is perfect! I will put him in there and he will jump and play for at least half an hour. I love the bright colors and I also like that you can make it smaller so it doesn't take up too much space. I definitely recommend this jumperoo to any parent interested in buying one. It's well worth it!
