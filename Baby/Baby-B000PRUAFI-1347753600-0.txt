review/summary: satisfied grandmareview/text: I ordered 2 gates because grandchildren were coming for an extended stay and I didn't want to have to lock rooms off limits. They were easy to install and easy to operate. The older 2 girls were able to open and shut the gates to keep little brother out of their room. Worked GREAT!! Good investment. Worked well two weeks later when the granddogs came over.
