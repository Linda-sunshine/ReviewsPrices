review/summary: Really great inexpensive push walkerreview/text: I did lots of research to find a helpful push walker for my 8 month old. This walker is inexpensive and a great option for starting out. Its plastic but still really sturdy. My son falls down and puts most of his body weight on the handle and it rarely flips over. When it does flip, it's light and safe keeping him from ever being hurt by it. But he rarely takes a tumble with it! The activity panel is fun and full of things to play with. I've read reviews about people who don't like that the phone isn't connected but it doesn't bother me. I'm sure having it connected with anything long would be dangerous. The wheels do move fast on anything other than carpet so be careful of that. We usually play on the carpet. Really easy assembly! I originally felt like only a nice wooden walker would be sturdy enough, but they are expensive and maybe more dangerous if the baby falls over. This is a great walker for the money and a great tool for learning to walk.
