review/summary: Toy Hammockreview/text: After a year of having 2 of these, they are really starting to sag. And I'm no atuffed animal hoarder. Seems like I have to find a way to stretch them out far, but I don't really know if that will help. My 3 year old son can reach it and pull it down now, because it's saggy :( Like a woman who ages. But for the price ,I shouldn't complain.
