review/summary: Best gate around!review/text: We went through several gates to keep our pups contained but they were ugly, flimsy or hard to use or mount.This North States model is amazing! Nice looking in bronze, very easy to use, easy to assemble and mount and sturdy as a brick wall!I've installed two of them and I'm getting ready to order another one to fit a larger opening. Highly recommended!
