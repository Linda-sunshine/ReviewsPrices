review/summary: Total lifesaver for new parents!review/text: I gave birth to my first child 5 days ago and had purchased one of these for my husband and I to use to track our baby's feeding, diapers and naps. Since we are breast feeding there is a lot to keep track of and it can seem overwhelming at times and its not always that easy to track down a pen and paper!This has been a *TOTAL LIFESAVER* . Every new parent should have this. It makes a crazy time in your life just a little bit easier. We took it to the hospital with us and multiple nurses and doctors commented on it and thought it was a very handy product. This should be on every new parent's "must have" list. It has not left my side since we have been home from the hospital.Also, the manufacturer is also wonderful and gets an A+ in my book. While putting the batteries into the unit, I managed to break the clip off the back of the unit. I emailed the manufacturer and received a reply in less than 24 hours stating they would send me a new unit at no cost. I received the replacement in less than a week. It is great to see a company stand behind its products like that. I'm a total loyal customer from this point forward.This is totally going to be my "go to" baby shower gift from now on!
