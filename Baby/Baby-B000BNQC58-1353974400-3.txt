review/summary: Great!review/text: I bought this for my seven year old son who has high functioning autism. He has had issues falling asleep his whole life and this product does wonders for him. It really calms him down and helps him fall asleep faster. It's easy to control and the automatic shutoff is extremely useful. The amber lights are not that bright, we usually stick to blue or green. Couldn't be happier with the purchase.
