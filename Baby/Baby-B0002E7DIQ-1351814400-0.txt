review/summary: Convenient, but HUGE!review/text: This pillow does everything I wanted it to to. It's very convenient because you can simply roll from side to side without having to take it with you. I'm pretty short (5'2") and for me, each side of the pillow is like a full length body pillow. I also use my own pillow... I slept with 2 pillows before anyway, so now I use the curved top portion of this Leachco pillow as my 2nd pillow underneath, and still have my pillow on top of that for my sleeping purposes. It works out great. The pillow is quite large, but in a queen-sized bed it fits fine with me and my hubby.Only warning... make sure you have patience (or someone who does) before you remove the pillowcase! It is nearly impossible to get back on and I always have my husband do it for me after I wash it. :)
