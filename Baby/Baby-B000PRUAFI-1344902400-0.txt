review/summary: Nice gatereview/text: I think this is a quality product and a great price. It was very easy to install. I don't know if I was doing something wrong but when I tightened it SUPER tight the gate wouldn't open. I thought the tighter the better but I loosened it a little and it closes perfectly. It's sturdy and no way a baby could pull it out. The opening mechanism isn't super super smooth but easy enough. I would highly recommend the product and I would buy the same one if I needed another gate.
