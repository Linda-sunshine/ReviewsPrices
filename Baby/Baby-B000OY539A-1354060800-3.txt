review/summary: a must have!!!review/text: I bought this product after reading how other baby carriers were bad for babies' hip development and spines. Let me just say it is wonderful. This is my first review ever, that's how good it is. I bought it for my four month old and she loves it too. I carry her around with me and still have my hands free to do everyday tasks. Babies are meant to be held, not left in carriers! I am "wearing" her right now as i write this ( she is snuggled against me napping ). Took about 3 practice runs of getting the wrap just right, but after that its like riding a bike.
