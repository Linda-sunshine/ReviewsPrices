review/summary: Love Moby Wrapreview/text: Very, very easy to use. My son loves being in it. Took me a few tries practice to learn putting it on but now I have it on and ready in no time (you tube has many useful videos that show you the different ways you can use it to put your child in it). Dont need anyone to help me put my son in or take him out like I did with the other baby carriers. Very convinient to use anywhere and you always have both hands free. I use at home while cleaning or shopping or to breastfeed. It also helps create a close bond with your child. GREAT PURCHASE!!!! RECOMMENDED!
