review/summary: Baby Bedreview/text: I just love my portable crib. I take it everywhere I go. I just love the fact it doesn't take up a lot of space and it's so easy to open, close and store away. The only improvement I wish it had was a thicker padding. I always have to put a heavy blanket or quilt under the pad so that when my baby falls inside of the pen, she doesn't get hurt. Overall its a great thing to have.
