review/summary: Pampers never let us down.review/text: We tried Huggies when our son was born, and they just didn't cut it. Pampers have been consistently good to us, and we'll continue using them as long as diapers are necessary. I do kind of wish that there was some kind of deodorizing feature because my son fills these things up and starts to smell like pee!
