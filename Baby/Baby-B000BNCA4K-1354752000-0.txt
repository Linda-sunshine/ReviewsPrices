review/summary: Great toy- best money on a toy we've spent so far!review/text: This is by far the best $11 we've spent on a toy so far. Most of the teething toys are too fat for our little one to comfortably fit in her mouth. This is great because the loops are small enough for her to chew on. I love that she can easily grab onto it and shake it. The rattle is a quiet enough that it's not obnoxious by any means. She started using it when she was about 4 months old- it was one of the first toys she was interested in! Now she's rolling around and this is a toy she consistently goes toward. Her hand to hand play has really developed since she started using this toy. She very easily moves this from hand to hand. Simply put, this is a must-have!
