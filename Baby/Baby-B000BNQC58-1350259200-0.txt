review/summary: Great for just a little whilereview/text: Was great while it worked. My 1yr old loved it, but it died on us really quick. Tried to change the batteries that I believe were included, but you first have get past the screw securing the batteries. That required using a scewdriver and needle nose pliers simultaneously. Once I had access to the batteries I found they were corroded in there pretty well. I tried to just wipe it down, but new batteries just didn't work. Then I tried to take the whole plastic compartment out in the hopes of giving it a better cleaning and seeing if there was something else wrong, only to find out the rest of the screws were basically just holding back the stuffing and there is no way of taking it apart. Just threw it away at that point.
