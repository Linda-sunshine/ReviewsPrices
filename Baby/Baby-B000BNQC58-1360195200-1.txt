review/summary: Fun for agesreview/text: My boys ADORE these guys. My oldest son is five and this was a shower gift for him. He has always had it in bed with him and he loves the different colors and watching the starts reflect on his walls and ceiling. He didn't want to share with his little brother so I bought one for him for his second Christmas. No money wasted there. They both have them on at night and love to &#34;match&#34;.
