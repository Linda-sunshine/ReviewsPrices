review/summary: Cheap, and you get what you pay for.review/text: I purchased 3 types/brands and this is by far the worst. It is not elastic and sags horrible no matter how you install it. So when packed full of animals, the others looks great while this one sags, streches and look horrible. It looks like it will fall down any minute, even though it wont. Buy the ones that dont have elastic!
