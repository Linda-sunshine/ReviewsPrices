review/summary: Heavy use and still greatreview/text: I agonized about which gate to buy because I am terrible about making online returns ;) It wasn't an issue with this one, we love this gate. Its sturdy enough for my eight year old to hang on, and smooth enough to open and close one handed while carry a screaming infant and blocking a 80 pound dog from walking through. In other words - its exactly what we needed. Don't bother with higher-end brands. It was a tad confusing to put together because ours didn't come with instructions, but once you get it in its great!
