review/summary: My grandson and granddaughter both love this!review/text: I sent this to my 9 month old grandson, and his big sister even likes this!!! I love the way you can adjust the brakes on the wheels so the young children don't go flying when they stand up on the toy! I know it will help my grandson walk even sooner!!!
