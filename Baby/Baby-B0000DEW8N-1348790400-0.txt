review/summary: Love itreview/text: Pros----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------* Nice, lightweight,easy to put together* Easy clean/washed it in dishwasher with no problem. unlike the big chair* Love the multiple trays/adjustable seat* straps for safety.* Baby can join us on dining table and he looks around and likes being the part of conversation* cost effective in terms of time/effort saved in cleaning, plus grows with the babyCon-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The straps are short and baby can put 'em in his mouth. That is the only downside we found so far.but actually that is really not big of a deal because we twirl it around so that no loose ends are hanging.Also--------You can also buy the replacement tray/parts/toy attachments from http://service.mattel.com/us/but do check the model number of seat you have. Certain parts only match with certain models. They have good customer service reps who answer your questions well.
