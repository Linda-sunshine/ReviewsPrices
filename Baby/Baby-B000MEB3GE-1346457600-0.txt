review/summary: Itzbeen timerreview/text: The shipping was fast, and the product arrived weeks before the baby did. Since he's been born, it has been very helpful for tracking feedings and diapers. The only thing wrong with the unit, in my opinion, is the clip broke off the first day. I would love to return it because the clip would be handy to have, but I no longer have the box. (lesson learned!)
