review/summary: From our bed to her own... Finally!review/text: We never intended on co-sleeping and ended up doing it for 17 mo. I tried many different techniques but finally I bought this Pack N Play because of the price and high reviews. I didn't need all the bells and whistles because she is a toddler. I did spend $30 on a matteress for it. Set it up in a few minutes and put it next to my side of the bed. Baby loved it and immediately took a nap in it. We have had it for two weeks now and she has slept in it every night since. No more kicks to the ribs in the middle of the night for me. Great product we are very satisfied.
