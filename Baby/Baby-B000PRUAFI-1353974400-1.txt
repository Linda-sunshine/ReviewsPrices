review/summary: great gate!review/text: This is a great gate. the mechanisms all work very well. it is quite sturdy and tough. My only complaint is that i should have bought a taller gate as at 5'3" i need to bend slightly to open and close the gate. But overall, I am happy with the quality and color and look. I bought it for my puppy and so far she can't get through, knock it over or mess with the finish.
