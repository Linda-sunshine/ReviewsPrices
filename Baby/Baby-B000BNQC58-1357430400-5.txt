review/summary: Better than Dream Lites!review/text: Both of my girls wanted Dream Lites for Christmas this year and I about choked seeing that I was going to pay $60 for them to each have one. Then who gets the unicorn and who gets the puppy? Cloud b had much better pricing and the girls LOVE them! We got the turtle and this ladybug and they each sleep with them nightly. They work GREAT and cover almost their entire ceiling and part of the walls with bright stars. The red setting on the ladybug isn't as bright as the purple or green, but my 4 year old loves it. I have a 7 year old as well who adores her turtle. WELL WORTH THE MONEY.
