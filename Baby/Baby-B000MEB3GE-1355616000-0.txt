review/summary: Not necessary with an app on my phonereview/text: I thought I would use this and just had to have it. It might be good if you don't have an iphone with an app because I found it was good to keep track of things in the early months. The app I found for free on my phone worked even better though because it kept a log of what had been happening from day one.
