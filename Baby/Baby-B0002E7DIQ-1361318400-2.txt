review/summary: too bulky, not soft and it got returned!review/text: I was excited about this product, however, it did not meet up to my expectations. The seam, as everyone else complained about, was very rough and noticeable. The pillow is HUGE and took up 1/2 of my king size bed. The pillow is very bulky, which would provide support, but too big for me to get my legs over and rest there comfortably. It was actually hurting my hips to lay on it the way you're supposed to. I gave up on it after a few hours and returned it the following day. I'll be looking for something softer and more compact.
