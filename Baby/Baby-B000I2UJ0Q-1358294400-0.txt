review/summary: Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperooreview/text: I bought the Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo for my 9-month-old granddaughter for Christmas. She is very active and loves to kick. This was a perfect item for her. You can set the music to stay on for awhile, or you can set it to come on as a result of movement. She likes the second setting. She jumps, giggles, and has a blast! I highly recommend this jumper.
