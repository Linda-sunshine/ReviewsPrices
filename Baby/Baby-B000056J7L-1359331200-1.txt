review/summary: Boy's best friendreview/text: This item probably doesn't need another review but I have to say this is really an excellent potty chair. When my son was about 16 months we got him an inexpensive safety 1st potty. At that time we just wanted to introduce him to the potty and see what happened. He had a few victories on the potty but they were few and far between. He wasn't really interested in using it and when he did he often peed out of it because the guard was not at all sufficient which really frustrated the both of us. He is now 23 months and seeing that he was becoming more interested in the potty I wanted to try another model. I ordered this one and I told my son he was going to have a new potty coming in the mail, on the day it came I got him excited and we opened the box together. He immediately loved it and used it 4 times successfully within the next few hours. It has been about a week now and I swear this potty is magic. He loves it and uses it all day everyday with ease and success. Definitely a very worthwhile purchase!
