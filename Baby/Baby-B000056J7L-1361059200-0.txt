review/summary: Terrible for boys!review/text: Isn't the first law of potty chair construction to contain pee? This splash guard isn't high enough for boys and I can't tell you how discouraging it is to have a child's best efforts be thwarted by pee splashing all over his legs and feet. Really bad. I wish I could give it no stars!
