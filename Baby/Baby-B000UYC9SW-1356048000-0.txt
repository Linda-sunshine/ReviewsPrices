review/summary: Pretty Goodreview/text: I had a meltdown at Disney World trying to figure out how to use this thing but then another mommy came up and helped me get my newborn fit in it correctly. Once she showed me, it was pretty ez but I wish I would have practiced a few times before I was stuck in the middle of a crowed trying to figure it out! Baby slept in it most of the time we walked around the theme park. We even put my 2 year old who is around 35 lbs in it and he fell asleep (my husband had to carry him in it). I would say it's great to have as long as you are patient and can have someone help you get baby situated into it.
