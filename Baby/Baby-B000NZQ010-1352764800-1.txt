review/summary: Great Quality & Value - Still a favorite after many monthsreview/text: This is a well-built toy, not your typical cheap plastic. The moving parts and buttons are durable, and its got a lot of replay value in that it can be used for many months. Our son got this around the 6-month mark, and at that time we could sit him in front of it and he took a swipe at it from time to time, to see what would light up. He then used it to help him walk a few months later - and now that he is better at shapes, sounds, and manual dexterity, he still uses it to make sounds, move the shapes, play with the phone, etc. Of all the (many) toys he has in his play room, he always goes back to this one because of the variety of things to do (shapes, food, colors, animals, music, piano, phone (which is also a rattle), spinning wheels, walker, turning gears, etc). As with all toys that talk or play music, it will be slightly annoying to parents, especially when they "DJ" (ie hit the same button over and over), but all-in-all, this toy was a great choice.Pros:- Variety of play- Durable Plastic- Long Battery Life (10 months and counting of daily use)- Works as a walker and activity center and CAN be separated.- Volume adjustment- Great for a variety of stagesCons (if any):- Phone is not attached, so it can get lost (but it's safer and more usable than if it had a short cord)- Piano keys automatically cycle thru colors/numbers/animals - would be nice to select one fixed mode at a time
