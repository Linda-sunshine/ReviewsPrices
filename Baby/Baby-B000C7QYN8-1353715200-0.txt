review/summary: Excellent Wipes.review/text: These are way better than Huggies or Pampers sensitive wipes. My son has sensitive skin and these wipes never agitate his skin. They are so mild that we even wipe his face and hands with these wipes and I don't worry about what I am cleaning him with. They don't smell pleasant or unpleasant they really just don't smell. Great product that I would recommend.
