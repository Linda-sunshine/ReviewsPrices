review/summary: Used throughout my pregnancyreview/text: I used this the entire time I was pregnant. It worked really well and gave me a lot of support on my back. One bad thing I didn't realize is that it doesn't come with a cover. So there was no way to wash it if it got dirty since it's too big for the washing machine. Also, it ripped at the end within the first month. I didn't bother to repair it and it didn't rip more.
