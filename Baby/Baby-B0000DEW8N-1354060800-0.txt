review/summary: Best Purchase Everreview/text: Best thing I have purchased for my son. I started to get a high chair at first that would have cost me a lot of money but this was definitely a money saver! I love the fact that it's compact and I can take it any where and use it any where I go. It's very easy to clean and the tray is very easy to get off! I read other reviews saying that it was difficult but it definitely wasn't for me. Once you snap one side off just lift it towards the other side and boom! It's off!
