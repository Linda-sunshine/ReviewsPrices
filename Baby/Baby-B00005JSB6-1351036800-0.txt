review/summary: Where was the leak guard on the back?review/text: I love Huggies because of the leak guard on the back. I was using Pampers but was having problems with explosions out the back of the diaper. Someone gave us Huggies size 2 diapers (Snug & Dry) and they had a leak guard on the back that stopped a lot of potentially dangerous explosions. I was so happy to have had those diapers on a flight and I was singing Huggies' praises to everyone I met.But I bought these size 3 Huggies Snug & Dry on Amazon and they do not have a leak guard in the back. They have the snug waistband, but not that extra guard, which was the ONLY reason I loved Huggies. Without that leak guard, I might as well get just about any other brand. I have had several leaks out the back now and only since opening this box.I checked on the Huggies website and they advertise that these diapers should also have the leak guard on the back...so where is it?
