review/summary: Nicereview/text: Its a cute pattern. After 2 kids I finally decided to purchase a pack and play. I found myself borrowing my sisters so my baby could sleep in it while away from home. She took such great naps in the borrowed pack and play I gave in and bought my own. Unfortunately the few times I set it up my child has refused the nap so haven't gotten much use out of it. But its well made, cute, and easily sets up and breaks down.
