review/summary: Watch out for the springs!review/text: While my daughter has gotten a lot of fun and happiness out of this Jumperoo, there is one part of it that we feel is very unsafe. The two parts on top that snap in and dangle can come flying out when tugged with enough force. My daughter easily rips out the parrot and can rip out the frog too. We've actually stopped putting them back in because we're worried that one day it'll snap out and hit her in the eye.
