review/summary: Love it!review/text: I am 19 weeks and have already been experiencing back pains and abdominal discomfort (when I'm laying down) from early on in my pregnancy. My husband bought this pillow for me and I really love it. It is comfortable and unlike others, the cover wasn't itchy to me. After I washed it I let it air dry just in case after seeing that some had an issue with putting it back on. It went on very easily for me. Of course it took longer than putting on a normal pillowcase. You had to bunch it up and keep pulling the case down but it went back on pretty smoothly. I've had it for about 10 weeks now and it still has it's fluff. I have a queen size bed and my husband and I still have plenty of room (although he always teases me about taking up the whole bed...even before the pregnancy and pillow :) ). I would recommend this.
