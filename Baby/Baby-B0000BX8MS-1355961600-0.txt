review/summary: Warm solutions to keeping baby warm in the winterreview/text: I have 2 other Halo sleep sacks that are cotton and I recently bought this one for the winter months here in Chicago and its a really nice alternative solution to blankets. My son is 6 months old so he moves a lot in his sleep and this stays on him and continues to keep him warm throughout the night. Be mindful of how warm this is when setting your heat, you don't want them to be too hot.
