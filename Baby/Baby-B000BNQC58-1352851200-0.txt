review/summary: Works great for 18 month old!review/text: my 18 month old boy loves this night light. We have the turtle, he loves to pack it around and turn the lights on and off before bed time. Before we got the turtle he would often stay awake crawling around in his crib, since getting the turtle, he is much better at laying down and going to sleep. It is peaceful to see the stars, I even enjoy it. I'd recommend these products for kids of any age, especially if they are scared of the dark, I think it really helps.
