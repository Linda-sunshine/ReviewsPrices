review/summary: BEST DIAPERSreview/text: I do believe that every baby has his perfect diaper. The Pampers Swaddlers is the fit for my baby.Pros:- These are the softest diapers that I've found- The yellow to blue wet line is awesome, more so when baby was very small, but I still like this feature.Cons:- The side closures sometimes stick and the diaper isn't as secure as I'd like, however, this is not every diaper I just find this happens occasionally.NOTES: Overall, I would (and do) spend the extra money for better diapers.
