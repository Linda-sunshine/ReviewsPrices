review/summary: Good Designreview/text: This is my second pack n play, for the second kid. This model is newer and it is lighter and does not have the arched head and foot sides like the old one - an improvement on the design. It is easier to move and shorter for bending over. One trick when assembling: snap the top bars into place first then pull the bottom flat.
