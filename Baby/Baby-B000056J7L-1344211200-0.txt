review/summary: Baby Bjorn makes the best pottyreview/text: This is the best potty on the market. Two seamless smooth pieces makes it easy to clean, and the splash guard is smooth unlike others which have rough edges. Compared to the Bjorn smart potty, my son prefers this one. We use the smart potty for traveling and grandmas house. This one is larger and easier for my son to get off.
