review/summary: Wonderful toy introducing color, shapes, sounds, rhythm, and much more.review/text: I purchased this educational toy for my 6 month old grandson. He is nearly crawling. His eager little fingers went right for the feature of inter-meshing gears. It is wonderful that the main toy face detaches for on the floor access of an infant that isn't quite sitting up. This toy is age appropriate for the crawler and toddler as well.The detachable main toy makes it a take along toy. The &#34;walker&#34; part of the toy is very sturdy and easy to assemble. 2 AA batteries required and were included.I debated getting a similar toy which was more of a table. I chose this walker style as my grandchild has a similar educational toy that is configured on a bouncy seat which he is outgrowing and he soon will be more independently mobile.I recall my children enjoyed moving wheeled toys about the house whether it was a truck or a doll stroller; so I believe he will have many hours of fun and exploration with this colorful toy with a variety of features to interest him.
