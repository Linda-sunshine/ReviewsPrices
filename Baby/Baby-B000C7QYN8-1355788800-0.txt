review/summary: Terrific wipesreview/text: Being an environmentally friendly mom, I know some people are still debating what chemicals are used as preservatives in these wipes. But personally after having researched many different wipes, and weighing all the pros and cons, when needing to use wipes on the go - these are what I use. My boy has never had diaper rash... and the price and value are a bonus.
