review/summary: Work well but they do smellreview/text: These work fine, but they have a sour smell to them. I can definitely smell it, my husband can't really....though I'm not sure if he chooses not to smell it (or acknowledge it) because these are better for the environment than others.The smell is on the wipes, but doesn't leave a smell on my baby girl, so I'm ok with them.
