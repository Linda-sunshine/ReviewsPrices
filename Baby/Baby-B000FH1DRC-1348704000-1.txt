review/summary: Thank Goodness Amazon Carries Size 3 Swaddlersreview/text: We have used Pampers Swaddlers for my son since he was born. We tried other brands and styles of diapers but none were as effective as the Swaddlers. My son has never had even a hint of diaper rash despite sleeping through the night since he was been 9 weeks old, and I credit these diapers. There is a mesh lining in the Swaddlers style that seperates baby's bottom from any peeps or poops. I don't know how it works, but these diapers suck all the moisture into them so even if the diaper is soaked your baby's bottom is still dry! My son was big at birth and has continued to grow rapidly. None of the stores near me carry size 3 Swaddlers. Thank goodness for Amazon! They have the size 3's and between Amazon Mom and subscribe and save they are cheaper than anywhere else even with coupons or sales.
