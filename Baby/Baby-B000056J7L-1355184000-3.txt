review/summary: Great Potty Chair!review/text: After attempting potty training with a different potty chair, this one is a dream. The first one we had was a chair that doubled as s tool. It had a very limited splash guard and the seat was completely flat. My daughter wouldn't have anything to do with it. When we finally got her to sit on it and use it the pee went everywhere! We bought this chair and she will sit on it and pee! Right out of the box she did! It is more ergonomic than most of the chairs out there and the splash guard is high which helps fight messes!
