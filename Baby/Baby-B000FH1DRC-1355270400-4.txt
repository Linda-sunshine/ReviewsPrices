review/summary: Did not expect it to be poorreview/text: I have been buying pampers for the past couple of months since my baby was born. It was wonderful.But this time, this one was little different experience.We see that the latest pampers package that we ordered, the diapers are not retaining much as the earlier ones.We felt that it was a duplicate product that the vendor sold (We usually get it from Amazon.com Prime) but this time it was a different LLC vendor. Next time on wards, we will try to purchase only from Amazon.com to avoid disappointments like this time.
