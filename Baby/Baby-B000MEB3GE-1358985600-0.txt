review/summary: loved both timers, blue and pinkreview/text: Just purchased both the blue and pink pocket nanny, we we are expecting twins soon. While opening the blue one and pulling it out of the packaging, the back clip broke off...I had read that happened to others in previous reviews. I was hoping they may have solved that issue by now, kinda disappointed about that. Otherwise, would've given them both a 5 star.
