review/summary: Our 2 year old daughter loves this!review/text: My daughter loves to use this while going to bed. We spend time talking about the stars and looking for the moon. I gave it 4 stars because the red is difficult to see on the ceiling and walls. The blue and green are pretty bright and we often use it to read books with all other lights off. It can be distracting at times when all she wants to do is play with her ladybug. I would recommend this to make a child's room more fun at bedtime. It has been helpful getting her used to sleeping in her own bed alone.
