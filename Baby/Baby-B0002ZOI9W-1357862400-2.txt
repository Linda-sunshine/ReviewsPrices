review/summary: Getting ready to be used for baby #3!review/text: We've had this rocker since the summer of 2002. That's over 10 years and it's still going strong! We used it with our first, then our second 2.5 years later, and now we will be using it with our 3rd, due in June. Not to mention all of the nephews we've used it with in between. This is a really great little chair. It rocks, it's sturdy, it's nice and tall so you're not hunched over, it has a simple design and comes apart easily to wash it. We use it for everything with the babies from feeding time to play time to nap time, and all the babies who have sat in it have loved it. The fabric is so durable too. We've washed it a million times, and it's not really even faded, and that's after over 10 years of use!I really cannot recommend this rocking chair enough. Your children will use it from 3 months to 3 years and beyond. It really is perfect. If you're going to register for one thing to keep in your living room, get this.
