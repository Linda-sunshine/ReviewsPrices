review/summary: Our newborn baby LOVES the Moby!review/text: I heard a lot of discouraging things from friends about the Moby - mostly about how it was difficult to put on, figure out or time consuming to put on. We actually got 2 Moby's donated from friends who never really used them. Our baby girl is a week old now and she spends a least half of her time in the Moby Wrap. She LOVES it and it makes life so much easier for us to get stuff done around the house. You can pretty much do everything with them strapped to you in the Moby. We also have been out to eat twice and just kept her in there. It keeps her very quiet and peaceful and she sleeps great in it. My husband actually fell asleep the other night in our rocker with her in it for 5 hours.I watched a video online of the way to wear it for a newborn and then I went to a local baby shop and they showed me a different way, which i much prefer. Basically, instead of folding all of the fabric in half, you keep it open. It's hard to explain but once you have the Moby it might make sense. I am not sure how good this is for when they get older but it's awesome for newborns.Also, my friends who had their baby in the summertime said it was just too hot to wear the Moby around when it's hot outside. ith our January baby its prefect, it keeps her nice and warm.
