review/summary: AWESOME product!!!review/text: My 7 month old got this for a Christmas present. It has been her favorite toy since Christmas and we are now in the second week of January. She gets excited when she sees it in the morning and there are endless things for her to press and interact with. The songs will get stuck in your head and you'll be walking around singing, &#34;welcome to our learning farm, we have lots to show you....&#34;, but it's totally worth it!
