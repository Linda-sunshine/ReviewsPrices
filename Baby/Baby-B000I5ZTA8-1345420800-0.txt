review/summary: Great but RUNS SMALLreview/text: I was so glad that I read all the reviews for this product and actually went for the bigger size! I got the size that ranges from 180 lb to about 220lb ... I tried it on as soon as I got it and right now I can put it on comfortably using the smallest hook locks (there are three in all to loosen as the belly grows)... Given that I'm currently barely showing at 5'4 and 150 lb. I don't expect to go beyond 180lb and yet this size looks like it will suit me perfectly until the end. Feels great and looks like great quality.
