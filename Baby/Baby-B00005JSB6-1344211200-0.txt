review/summary: Worst diapers of all timereview/text: My precious baby girl never had a diaper rash until I started using these diapers (once she turned 8 months old)! I usually buy Pampers and Luvs, but I decided to purchase these at a local warehouse store because of the great price. What a mistake! In a matter of days, her poor bottom went from perfect to bright red and blistered. I don't know what's in these diapers, but they have made my baby miserable! I have over 150 left from the box and am throwing them in the garbage. What a waste of money, and they're not even soft! They feel like plastic and are worse in quality than the ones at Walmart. I would put any other diaper in the world on my daughter before I'd put her in another Huggies diaper.
