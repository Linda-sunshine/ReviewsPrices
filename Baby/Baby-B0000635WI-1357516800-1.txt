review/summary: my wife loves itreview/text: I found this to be the top rated body pillow for pregnant women so I bought it for my wife since she is expecting. She loves it. I can't tell you how many nights prior she was tossing and turning trying to get comfortable... well now she is sleeping really well. The pillow supports her back and her belly. It comes with detailed instructions on the various ways to use it. And I especially like that it has a removable pillow case so I can keep it clean. Even as a man I had to try it out when we first put it on the bed... well I curled up with it in the early afternoon and I was so comfortable I fell right to sleep.. ha ha. I highly recommend this as a nice gift for anyone who is expecting in your life.
