review/summary: So simple yet so coolreview/text: Bought this when baby was 2 months old. Knew that he was too young to appreciate it then but we needed a night light and I loved the idea of a constellation lit room. Even though it's such a simple design, back lit cut outs, I really enjoyed rocking my baby to sleep in starlight and thought the turtle was well made and super cute.Now he's 11 months and he seems to love it just as much as his mom does. We have Turtle up on our 5 drawer chest and he'll point to it constantly to direct me to bring him to it. He'll squeal with delight as he randomly presses the buttons and the light changes colors. Or he'll crack up as he look up at mommy's face and there are colored stars on my face.I see a lot of cloud b knock offs out there now but they all look so cheap in comparison.We love our Turtle!
