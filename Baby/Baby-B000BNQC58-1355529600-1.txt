review/summary: Constellations reversed!review/text: This is pretty much just what I expected, except for one major flaw..The stars on the shell match the star guide as you're looking down on it, but that means when they're projected on the ceiling they are reversed! So good luck looking at the star guide and trying to identify constellations on the ceiling - very frustrating. Otherwise it's good quality and stars are projected over the whole room and the green and blue are particularly bright (amber is weak, but that's actually more restful). So the decorative aspect is great, the "science" not so much. Also have to say neither of my kids have sustained their excitement over this, and doesn't keep the little one in his bed, but that's our problem!
