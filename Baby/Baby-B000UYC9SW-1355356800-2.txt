review/summary: quick and easyreview/text: I wanted a baby carrier that would distribute the baby's weight over both shoulders (rules out slings) and be comfortable sitting down (rules out the Ergobaby, which I love for walking around, but the waist belt is uncomfortable while sitting down), but I didn't want to deal with wrapping a wrap-style carrier. The Baby K'tan "wrap without all the wrappings" is perfect! It isn't as comfortable as the Ergobaby for long periods of carrying, but it's great for holding our baby if she's fussy while I'm eating dinner and for shorter walks (i.e. down the street to the store and back, not enough to warrant using the Ergobaby, which just feels kind of ridiculous on short walks). I got it when she was about 11 pounds and had partial head control, so I can't vouch for it with a newborn. I'm a size 4 and 5'2" or 5'3", and the extra-small is definitely the right size. I think extremely small women wouldn't be able to use this, because the extra-small wouldn't be snug enough on them. Depending on how she settles in, it isn't completely hands-free, but it's much closer to being hands-free than most slings would be at this point (3 months)... At least hands free long enough to grab something with two hands off the shelf at the grocery store. It's true that it isn't one-size-fits-all, and that most couples would need one for each parent since the parents probably aren't the same size, but for me the convenience outweighs that, and my husband doesn't want to use this style of carrier anyway (he just uses the Ergobaby).
