review/summary: Great product; strange packagingreview/text: I received the Pampers Swaddlers diapers a little slower than anticipaged, but the diapers themselves are as described and they work really well with our little one. The packaging was a little strange; based on the product image I was expecting two boxes of 140 diapers. Instead I received 14 plastic packages of 20 diapers each in the boxes shipped. I don't mind that much, but I would rather have had less packaging to be more eco-friendly.
