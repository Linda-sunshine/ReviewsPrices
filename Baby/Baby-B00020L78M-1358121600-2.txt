review/summary: Wonderful additionreview/text: This playyard is a wonderful addition to my home. I have it set up in my family room as a play area. MY 18 month old son calls it the &#34;Wow&#34; area because he loves it so much. I am able to enclose him in there when I need to switch laundry or get a few things done with out the extra 'help'. I am looking fowrad to when I can use it outside in the summer time.
