review/summary: Great gate!review/text: I own a small dog grooming shop and needed a gate for one of my doors. Bigger dogs can jump over so I just have to be careful who I let stay in the room. Only problem is the bar on the floor, people keep tripping over it. Be sure to put bright tape on it to stop accidents.
