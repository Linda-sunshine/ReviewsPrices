review/summary: Easier than the Moby wrap to usereview/text: My sister-in-law gave me the Moby wrap but it was difficult to put on and I'm lazy. Too much effort for the Moby wrap. The K'tan I still need instructions to get the it on but it is easier. The K'tan is comfortable and the baby enjoys the outward facing option. Started using the k-tan at 4 months and baby is now 7 months.
