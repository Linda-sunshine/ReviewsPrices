review/summary: No leakingreview/text: Used these diapers for our 1-4 month old boy. After our first child, we learned to use a lager size diaper to prevent leaking. They have been pretty leak proof andnhave that nice baby smell to them. The wet indicator is not important, seems like it turns blue almost instantly, but that's a baby for ya. What's great is that we can go awhile between changes if we have too.
