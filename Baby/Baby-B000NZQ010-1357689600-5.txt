review/summary: Great for teaching my 8 month old to sit and now standreview/text: My 8 month old loves this! It has 2 sound settings (songs, sounds), and two volume settings. There is a lock on the back wheels, more for when the child is pushing from behind rather than in front where the buttons are. When I place my baby in front of the toy to play, I place something behind it so when my baby stands, it doesn't move. She takes the phone off, likes to open & close the barn door, and climb up the front to a standing position. I have noticed a big difference in her confidence when climbing to a standing position. It was easy to put together upon receiving, and the front comes off easily to play with it flat.
