review/summary: Very comfortable to wear.review/text: I really like this carrier. I think it's comfortable for me to wear, and my baby (5 weeks old) fell asleep immediately the first time I put her in it. I think it's really comfortable for her too. The baby feels very secure, I know she won't fall out or twist her neck.
