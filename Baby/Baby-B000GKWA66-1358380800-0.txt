review/summary: Boy, did I get fooledreview/text: I bought this sleep sheep hoping it would help my special needs grandson. There was no soothing for him or me. When it arrives in the box, you can test the sounds and volume before you actually remove it from the box...which I did and it worked just fine. BUT where the timer is located is covered with plastic and cannot be tested before removing the sheep and sound devise. It is a tight squeeze getting the sound device into the back of the sheep. I'm thinking all is well and I would use it at his nap time. I set the timer for 45 minutes. It stopped in 23 minutes. I tried many times to get this soother to play the ocean sound for 45 minutes. I tried different sounds and volume and it always played for only 23 minutes on the 45 minute setting. That was not going to work for the baby or me. As you might have guessed, I had torn down the box for recycling. I put all the pieces of the box and the sheep and a post it note and shipped it back to Amazon. I give Amazon 5 stars. They issued me a complete refund for the defective sleep sheep. I appreciate Amazon for doing the right thing. Amazon is my place to shop and will continue to be so. Just stay away from the sheep in wolves clothing.
