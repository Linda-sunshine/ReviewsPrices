review/summary: Love the Babybjorn!!review/text: I recently received the original black babybjorn carrier as a gift for the birth of our third child. With our first 2 sons we had a Snugli baby carrier that rarely got used due to the difficult to use design. The Babybjorn is so easy to use!! It's "backpack" design makes it simple and intuitive to use. The clips fit snug with no worry of baby falling out or difficulty getting her in. I have not experienced any back pain, however, my daughter is less than 3 months old. I would reccommend this product to anyone looking for a safe, comfortable carrier.
