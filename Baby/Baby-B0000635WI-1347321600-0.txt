review/summary: so disappointed!review/text: i was so excited about ordering this pillow around my 20th week of pregnancy as i was having back pain while sleeping and everyone raves about these pillows. the pillow feels like it is stuffed with polyfill (filling for craft projects) and after using it for 2 months it was flat where my head lays and where my legs cross over the pillow and there is no way to fluff up polyfill. at that point, the pillow became completely useless to me.the "pillow case" that it comes with feels like it is 25 thread count and it is very rough feeling, but since i didn't want to pay $30 extra for the nicer pillow case, i toughed it out and eventually got used to it.my other major complaint was when i would wake up in the middle of the night and my hip and shoulder would be sore and i would need to switch sides, it was very cumbersome trying to do so due to the curves in the pillow.i stopped using this pillow around week 28 and started using a regular pillow under my head, in between my legs and one to hug. this cost me nothing since i owned extra pillows, was more supportive as the pillows were thicker and i could fluff them up when needed and it wasn't as difficult to switch sides in the middle of the night.my recommendation is to just use regular pillows and don't waste your money.
