review/summary: Loved this!!review/text: I'm so glad that I read the reviews and got the bigger size. I'm normally only about 125pounds and 140ish when pregnant. I do carry my babies almost entirely in the belly, but this totally saved me. With my 3rd pregnancy this saved my hips and back. I wore it all day for about 4 months, I will use it again!!
