review/summary: Great Pet Gatereview/text: I got this gate for my 1 year old beagle mix and it works great. I use it in the doorway so when I leave him during the day I can leave the door open for air. He definitely can not get over it and it's really sturdy even just using the tension instead of putting holes in the door frame.
