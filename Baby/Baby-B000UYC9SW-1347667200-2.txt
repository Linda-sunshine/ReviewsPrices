review/summary: wanted it to work but nopereview/text: I was really excited about this carrier but my little guy (3 months) hated it. He'd be crying and fussing within 5 minutes everytime I put him in it, in the hug position. The problem I think is we would both get too warm quickly...in New England in September. He would also slide down too low all the time. I gave it 3 stars because the material is nice and its easy to put on. My son also hated the Bjorn so maybe its just him. I'm trying a mei tie next... thank God for Amazons generous return policy!
