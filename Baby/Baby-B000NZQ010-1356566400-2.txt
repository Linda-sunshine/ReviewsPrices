review/summary: A Christmas Hitreview/text: We bought this for our 10 mo. old granddaughter who is starting to pull herself up to standing. Our other grandson had one, and before he could walk on his own, he would race around and around the house behind it. Also, the tray with the toys is removable, so they can sit down and play with it. And, the wheels lock so you feel safe with them pulling up on it, and then you can unlock them when they are ready to push it along.
