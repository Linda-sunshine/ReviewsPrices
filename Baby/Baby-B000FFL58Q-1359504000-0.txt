review/summary: Love it, I got for the lights.review/text: Second time purchase for a new baby. I love it, My first baby loved it, and now my newborn loves it. He can stare at the lights for a long time and smile. I replaced Tiny Love Gym with this one because it has the lights and music is right above the head, This gym is also interactive for an older baby, there is an option to play music when baby moves and toches the toys. Another option is to play continuous music, I would recommend Fisher Price Gym over Tiny Love.
