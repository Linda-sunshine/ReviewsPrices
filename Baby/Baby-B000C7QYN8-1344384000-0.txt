review/summary: good wipesreview/text: these wipes are not super thick but are very gentle on my child's skin. my child has eczema and skin allergies to almost everything and these wipes don't cause a reaction like a lot of other brands do. overall pretty good wipes, even though they are not super thick, they still get the job done.
