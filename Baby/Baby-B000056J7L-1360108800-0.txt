review/summary: Son loves it!review/text: My son loves this potty chair, so much so that we've bought three of them in different colors, one for each of our bathrooms. The high back is nice and the seat seems comfortable enough. My son is potty training at 2.5 years old and we've been using the potty chair for several months. The high back helps guide him onto the chair correctly. We've never had a problem with him spraying over the top of the splash guard. It's nice and high! Additionally, the seat is easy to remove for cleaning, and we haven't had any issues with other areas of the chair getting dirty and requiring cleaning. The mess is contained nicely within the seat. My son can even pour the contents into the &#34;big toilet&#34; on his own without any spilling. Lastly, the base is wide and sturdy, and the rubber bottom keeps it from sliding when he sits and stands. We've tried several of the seats that fit on top of a regular toilet seat, but both of them wobbled and fit incorrectly, and my son is too nervous to use them. This seat makes him feel secure and confident while he's learning this new skill! Overall, we are very pleased and have recommended this potty chair to several friends already!
