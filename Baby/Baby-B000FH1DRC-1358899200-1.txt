review/summary: LOVE the Pampers Swaddlers diaperreview/text: We have been using Pampers Swaddlers diapers on our twins since they were newborn (and the N size was actually too big!), and still are now that they are 1 and in size 3. I love the indicators on the diaper that let you know when the diaper is wet and ready to be changed (that means less trips to the changing table with a squirmy baby &#34;just to check&#34;). We have had NO leaking issues with these diapers - ever - they hold up all night during a 12 hour night, and I know this is not the case with all brand-name diapers (we have used other types while traveling and couldn't find Swaddlers). Do yourself a favor - get these on Amazon Mom auto-delivery. We have 2 (yes 2!) boxes delivered every month and have never run into the problem of having to run out to get more diapers.
