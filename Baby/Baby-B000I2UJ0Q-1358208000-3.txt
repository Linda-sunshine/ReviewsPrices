review/summary: My granddaughter loves it - me too!review/text: This Jumperoo is much more sophisticated and complicated than the one our children had 30 years ago, but our granddaughter loves it and that is all that matters! She began jumping immediately (she was 5 months old when we purchased the Jumperoo) and she is fascinated by all the colors, sounds and lights. Assembly was not difficult and it is well-designed for safety and durability. My only complaint is that even when it is &#34;collapsed&#34; for storage it still takes up a lot of room. However, that is a small price to pay for the happiness and exercise it brings our granddaughter.
