review/summary: Worth the money.review/text: I ordered this for my son who has an inordinate amount of stuffed animals for a 16 month old. As of right now it has about 5-7 large, 10-15 medium and 10+ small stuffed animals in it with room to spare. It works extremely well for us since we live in an apartment (i.e. small space). We were having a lot of difficulty storing them out of the way, but now they are up and easily visible for when he decides to play with one.
