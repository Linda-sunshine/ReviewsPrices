review/summary: Wonderful multi-purpose educational toy!review/text: We purchased this "Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker" for our 1 year old granddaughter after thoroughly researching several seemingly similar models by different manufacturers. Several features put the V-Tech version well-above the rest: (1) this is wonderfully versitile: it converts from a "sitting" toy that also rolls to a "standing" walker that also is a fun educational toy; (2) the educational component [front "box" with activities] can be completely separated (safely by an adult) from the orange frame for child's use in the car, or anywhere when traveling; (3) the frame and educational component are heavier than several other models, so this "sit-to-stand" walker really allows a toddler to walk without the walker tipping over; and (4) the educational component has numerous brightly colored activities that attract and keep a child's interest while developing her/his fine motor skills. Our granddaughter loves her V-Tech "Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker" and we highly recommend it!
