review/summary: Super cute and very functional...but...review/text: My 6 yr old is having her very own room for the first time and she is already having anxiety issues about what will happen if she wakes up and is afraid. I saw this and decided to buy her a new fuzzy friend to sleep with and thought the sounds might soothe her to sleep when she is having anxiety. SHE LOVES IT! I let her have it before the move, so that she can get attached to it and feel ok with her new room. The only caveat I have for you is that the sounds can be rather, well, weird. The rain is soothing but makes ya have to GO, if you know what I mean...but it's soothing. The heartbeat sounds like Darth Vader on an intercom and the whale sounds reminded me of the neighbors who lived next door to us years ago, when we had an apt and paper-thin walls. Think about it. The ocean sounds a bit like a highway instead of an ocean, but it's nice as long as you can picture that ocean in your head and not the sound of cars and trucks hitting roadkill. I gave this product 5 stars because it is so adorable and because it's super soft and she loves it. It does have velcro to fit on the side of a crib and it is washable, as the squawk box comes out. It also has a timer, which is awesome. It's worth the money. Your little one will love it and it is money well-spent. You can always remove the box if your child doesn't like it and make Lambie a super-soft, quiet toy.
