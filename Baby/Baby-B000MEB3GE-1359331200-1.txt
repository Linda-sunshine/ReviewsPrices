review/summary: So Simple, Yet So Useful!!!review/text: My wife and I use our timer every day! This is actually our second Itzbeen Timer. We misplaced our first one and decided to just buy another one! When you're a new parent just trying to get into the routine, it's crucial that you pay attention to the last time your baby was fed or changed! Your mind will be so scrambled from other things, combined with lack of sleep, that you'll need a little help keeping up with baby maintenance. That is exactly what this tool is used for! My wife and I both work full-time jobs, and the timer helps us stay on the same page! After using it for a while you'll start to notice a routine, and things begin to get easier!UPDATE: We found our first timer and continued using it shortly after I purchased the second. We've used this a total of about 10 months. Yesterday I dropped the timer and the plastic clip broke off of the back. I'm shocked that it took this long to break considering it has been dropped numerous times on hard surfaces! Also, the plastic clip that holds the battery cover on has worn down too. I had to tape the battery cover on to keep it from falling off with normal use. I still highly recommend this product!
