review/summary: Great glider for the recent parents.review/text: I've had this glider previously for over 3 years and no problems with squeaks. I purchased another for my sister who is due soon. This review is for all the other people who left feedback about the squeaking. As soon as received my first glider, i oiled ALL the bushings and movinvg parts. And kept oiling them throughout the years. I'm being proactive and taking apart my sister's and applying grease to the metal and bushings. If you research the $400+ gliders, they're made of the same material and bushings and squeak as well. So the way i see it, $100 glider or $400 glider, you make the choice. Oh, and don't forget, OIL YOUR CHAIR!!!
