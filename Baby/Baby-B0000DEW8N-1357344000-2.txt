review/summary: This seat saved my sanityreview/text: My daughter has a very sensitive gag reflex. About once a week or so she will get a piece of food stuck on the back of her tongue and throw up the contents of her stomach. I had a traditional chicco high chair that I was very happy with, but it was such a pain to clean every time my daughter threw up. It had to be disassembled and all the little nooks and crannies scrubbed with a toothbrush. My mother bought this booster seat to use when we visited her. I was so impressed with it's simplicity, I bought one for our house too. Now when my daughter throws up, it's just a quick wipe with a sponge and everything is clean. It makes our lives so much easier.It is also super easy to take with us when we are visiting friends and family. It connects to any chair, or it can sit on the floor in a corner, and my daughter can have a safe, secure place to eat.Other things I love about it include the fact that the dishwasher safe tray actually fits in my dishwasher (unlike the larger Chicco tray, which is also dishwasher safe, but only if you have an enormous dishwasher to put it in) and the cup holder is extra deep, which means it holds a cup a little more securely.
