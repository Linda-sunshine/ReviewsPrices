review/summary: Looks greatreview/text: So far I am really happy with this product- however our little one is not here yet so we haven't used it much at all. The chair was easy to assemble, and looks beautiful in the nursery. Also, very comfortable to sit in. I don't think you can do much better for the price. If it lasts me two years I will be very happy.
