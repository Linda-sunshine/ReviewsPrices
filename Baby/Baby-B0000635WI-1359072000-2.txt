review/summary: Snooglicious! Love this pillow!review/text: In our prenatal class, everyone was raving about this pillow. I wasn't convinced at first because at that time, I wasn't having any trouble sleeping. That all changed a couple months ago. I got this pillow for Christmas and it's seriously been a game changer. Super comfy and has really helped me knock out some extra sleep hours. I am not waking up from tossing and turning anymore, now regulated to just the numerous bathroom breaks that are typical with pregnancy.My favorite part is that I get up earlier than my husband and in the last few weeks, what do I find? He's scooted over to my side of the bed and is snoogling away!Highly recommend getting this pillow. Also recommend getting a cover. I got this one.Snoogle Chic Jersey Cover in Gray
