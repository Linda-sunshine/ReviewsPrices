review/summary: A great gate for my dog.review/text: This gate has brought a little bit of sanity back into my life, as we have an 8m old black lab/border collie mix who was driving me crazy stealing from my bedroom. I needed a solution other than just closing the door as our cats sleep in there, and I was tired of stepping over or de-installing/re-installing the cheap wooden gate that we originally got. After reading a lot of reviews, I decided against a cheaper gate and chose this one, which is still very reasonably priced. I have been very happy with it. We installed it in the hallway just outside our bedroom door so used the extensions on both sides. It installed pretty easily and it is easy to open and close. So far, my ultra-smart pup hasn't figured out how to open it. :-) The gate is a little bit on the narrow side for me, as I am no skinny-minny, to say the least, but I have had no problems with it and I am soooooo happy to have it. I am thinking about getting another one or two so that I can create an indoor "play-pen" in connecting hallways for the pup that allows me to move around the house without relative ease and still keep destructo-pup contained when he is in the house. Definitely would buy again and recommend. A very good value.
