review/summary: Best baby purchase so far!!!!!review/text: This thing is amazing! I wasn't that impressed when it came...I didn't really think we needed one more baby item taking up space in our house...I was wrong.We NEEDED this jumperoo. Starting at about 4.5 months, my son would sit in the seat and check out the toys. He was still a little short to jump. However, when he hit 5 months, there was no stopping him. Now at 6 months, he jumps like a crazy man and giggles the whole time. Friends and family love watching him and have even commented that they with FP made them for adults....I don't know if I'd go that far though!The toys are...well, 50/50. There's a spinning one with little animals in it that makes noise that is great. There's a bee like thing that my son loves to suck on. The elepant, parrot, and monkey in the front are pretty useless. The color wheel seems like a waste of space. But, the baby loves it all!Now the music...well, it's stuck in my head most of the day. I can sing the entire song series. The other day we were at the doctor and he was getting fussy (baby, not the doctor) and I started humming the song for him and he started laughing and kicking. So, who knows. It does have a softer and louder setting, as well as a setting where it only makes noise when the baby jumps or hits something.This thing gets me at LEAST 20 minutes, twice a day, to be able to accomplish chores around the house without my 6 month old whining or on my arms...well worth the money!
