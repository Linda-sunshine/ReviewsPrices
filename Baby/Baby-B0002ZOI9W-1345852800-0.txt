review/summary: Love this chairreview/text: I received the Mouse Princess chair as a shower gift and I love it! My daughter has been sitting in it since the day she came home. It reclines, so it really can be used for infants. I didn't use the toys on it until recently, she's almost 3 months old now and is just now showing interest in them. The only thing that I would like better is if the toys music played a little longer. It only plays for about 30 seconds. My daughter loves it though, so I can't complain. I believe it is a good purchase, I would recommend to friends.
