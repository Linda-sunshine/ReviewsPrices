review/summary: Best diapers we've triedreview/text: These are pricy, but so far, we've never lost containment on these. I've also been impressed with some of the improvements Pampers has made to diaper technology in the last five years since we last bought these diapers. The interior mesh seems to improve air circulation and helps keep down diaper rash. At first, I thought that the little blue &#34;moisture sensing strip&#34; on the front was silly, but when my son was sick and our doctor said to monitor whether he was peeing even a little bit, this was actually a really helpful feature. Too bad they don't keep making this diaper, or one with the same features, in the larger sizes.
