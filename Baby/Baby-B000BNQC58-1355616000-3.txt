review/summary: Good... not great...review/text: Let me start by saying this product does what it advertises and was up to my satisfaction in every way possible. The kids love it and use it almost every night.However the makers whiffed big time by not adding a music/sounds function to this product. Something other than just the lights would have been nice.My only other complaint would be if its bright outside or the lights are on you cant see the lights at all.Overall it is very much enjoyed, just wish people could think outside the box to make a great toy.
