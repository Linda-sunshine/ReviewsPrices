review/summary: Great gliderreview/text: Bought this glider for my bride. We are raising a great grandson and didn't have a rocker that was comfortable for rocking the little guy. No longer a problem...great granny and baby find this chair to be wonderful for sending him off to sleep. Assembly was easy and took just a short time. Fit and quality are super!
