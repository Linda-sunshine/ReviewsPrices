review/summary: Most useful and unique toy for months to comereview/text: This is my item of choice for any baby gift. I've been told by parents that this gift is their child's favorite toy because it has so manyunique features of interest for a young [6 months and up] and inquisitive mind. Plus, as they begin to be able to stand, they canhold on to the handle and push the walker around. This toy is useful for months to come.
