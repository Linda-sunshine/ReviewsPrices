review/summary: They changed the smell: yuck!review/text: Well, I don't see why people can't just leave a good product alone! This WAS a good product but this box of diapers has a bad smell. It's like Pampers has added a perfume or fragrance and now the diapers smell really bad! My son had bad diaper rash & I feel the perfume/fragrance delayed the healing of and maybe even inhibited the healing process.Not good! Will be looking for a new brand of diapers! Will never buy Pampers baby dry again and am very disappointed!
