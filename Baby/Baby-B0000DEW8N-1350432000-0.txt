review/summary: Best decision everreview/text: Everyone else has Bumbos. Why didn't we get a Bumbo? They are so cute! - Fast forward a few months, everyone outgrew the Bumbo and are buying this. I LOVE this. We use a highchair at home most times but this is so perfect for any other situation, would be great for home too. It's so portable, it's ridiculous. It sits on the floor, on a chair. It straps onto the chair in the back and bottom so it is secure. You can use it with the tray or without and scoot them right up to the table. It fits in large booths at restaurants. It is just the best. Anyone who has used it with my child (grandparents mostly) love it as well. Easy clean up. 3 adjustments for how close to put the tray to your child. 3 height adjustments which are not needed if you are using it with the tray but if you are sliding them up to a table, I've found it to be helpful. LOVE this.
