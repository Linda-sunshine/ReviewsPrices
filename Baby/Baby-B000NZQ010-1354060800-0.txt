review/summary: Good toyreview/text: This walker is great. I was drawn to it by the colors and the detachable toy on the front. My son has no interest in walking with the toy. He loves playing with the toy that detaches and will spend a while just opening and closing the barn door. He plays with the spinning feature on the bottom of the toy and will stand while trying to make the square,circle and diamond go around the lighted buttons. It does have a lot of sounds to it, which is great. It keeps his attention and he comes back to it when it makes noises again. I can also leave it on and it will shut off on it's own until he goes back to it. I've had this toy for almost 3 months and have had no problems with any of the electronics like some of the other comments. Maybe need to change the batteries?
