review/summary: Overall Pretty Good Diaperreview/text: We have been using these with our daughter for several months and overall we are happy with them, she is a long baby and Huggies had a tendency to leak and she would wriggle out of them. We have very few urine leaks and they hold up well overnight, it is a little disturbing how much liquid they will hold! We have had issues with poop leakage going up her back, I probably have to change 2-3 outfits a week, another reviewer had the same issue. I do highly recommend them for overnight use though.
