review/summary: Worst DIaperreview/text: I have always used huggies, but the price was great on these pampers and hospitals use them so I figured they must be great. First, they leak and separate when wet. I put them on my baby at night and he wakes up with wet clothes. When walking around the gell is saggy and it separates into sagging pockets. These diapers are of the same quality as a noname brand of diaper...they really suck and I can't wait to get rid of them but its going slow since I ordered 192 of them!!!!!!!
