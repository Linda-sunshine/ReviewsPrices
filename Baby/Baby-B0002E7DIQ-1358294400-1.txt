review/summary: A Must!review/text: I got this when I was 3 months pregnant and used it through out my pregnancy. I've always been a back sleeper because I have scoliosis and that's the only way I can get comfortable. This helps with the comport of having to sleep on your side and I chose this one because I toss and turn throughout the night, and you can easily go from side to side without having to turn the whole pillow with you!
