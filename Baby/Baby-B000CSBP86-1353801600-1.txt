review/summary: Saved us.review/text: This was the only carrier our daughter would let us put her in, so we absolutely swore by the Bjorn! My husband and I both used it until we just couldn't carry her in it any more, but we did get many, many months of use out of it. I remember the straps and clips being slightly confusing the first time I put it on, but it became second nature very quickly -- so don't be put off if the straps and things look a bit inscrutable. Long live the Bjorn!
