review/summary: Rugged, easy to install, a dream to usereview/text: I always look at the one-star reviews to see what the worst features of the product are. The one-star reviews for this item are hilarious. Why? The manufacturer tells you that the unit is slightly splayed when you get it, and the installation process torques it straight (really easily, too).So my grandson installed it for me, and it took him about two minutes. The unit straightened up perfectly, as they said it would, and it works perfectly. If I swing it wide, it stays open, Swing it just a little towards the closed position, and it quietly swings shut, and locks. To open, just lift the gate a little, and swing it open either way, in or outwards.It feels very sturdy, and was worth every penny.So what is it keeping out of my sitting room? Three pit bulls and a rottweiler. the are sweet dogs, but they are very strong, and they don't sense any weakness in the gate that might encourage them to push a bit harder. I am sure if they put their mind to it they could break the whole damn thing down, because they are very strong. But as a gentle reminder to them that this is grandma's space, and they only come in when invited, it is plenty sturdy enough to keep them out, and not encourage them to push the limit.
