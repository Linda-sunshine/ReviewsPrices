review/summary: Best diapers everreview/text: I love pampers. They have been so far for me the best quality diapers i've tried in the last 5 years. Used them with my son throughout his 3 years of life and now with my 7 month old baby. They never get diaper rashes and I could coin with one hand the number of times I've use cream for their bottoms. I will stick with these diapers forever as I have more kids!
