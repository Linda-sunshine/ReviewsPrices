review/summary: Cute, but it's usefulness is limited.review/text: I got this at a great price, and I was happy with it, to a point. It was very cute and soft. It was fantastic for helping our 7 month old fall asleep, but it has a 45 minute timer, which is actually about the worst amount of time since infant sleep cycles are about 45 minutes. When he's napping I tiptoe in and turn it back on, so he'll sleep 90 minutes to 2 hours, rather than before we got it when he was sleeping 30-45 minutes. So for that, worth every penny. It's pretty useless overnight though. When she wakes up it is off and he's unable to soothe himself back to sleep. For that I might need to buy something else that doesn't shut off at all, in which case I've wasted money on the sheep. I intend to give it a week or two before I get something else. So recommended, with reservations.ProsHelps Baby Fall AlseepConsNot Stay Asleep
