review/summary: Simple Cheap and Works!review/text: Bought this for our 1 year old and it works great! It only took showing my hubby two times for him to remember how to set up. I leave the baby bassinet and mobile stuff at home and we have traveled everywhere in it! Not to mention the price is so cheaper than any other out there!
