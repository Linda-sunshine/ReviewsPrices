review/summary: Love it!review/text: This sling has been great! My 1 month old baby doesn't like to be put down during the day. When he gets fussy I put him in the sling and he will calm down and go to sleep and I can get things done around the house. He loves it. He'll be in the sling for a few hours at a time. This has been a lifesaver when my baby gets cranky. Initially I had to get my friend to help me put my baby in it in the kangaroo position but now I'm a pro at doing it myself. I had also watched the how to video online which helped a lot.I am 5'6 and 140 pounds right now and the small fits great.I would definitely recommend this sling, especially for fussy babies that just want to be held.
