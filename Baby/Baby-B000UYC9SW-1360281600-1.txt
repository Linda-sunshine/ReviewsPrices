review/summary: Perfect!review/text: I got this because it was too difficult for me to put on my Chicco front carrier and strap in my son by myself. The Baby K'tan took reading the directions for the first few times of putting it on, but then I could do it in 3 seconds. My son absolutely loves it. He will stay in it for hours while I'm doing stuff around the house and cooking dinner. He is now nearing 20 pounds and I find that my shoulders get a bit sore. BUT when he was 2-4.5 months, I had NO pain in my shoulders or back whatsoever. Very worth the money!
