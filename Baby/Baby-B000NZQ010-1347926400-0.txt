review/summary: Great toyreview/text: My in-laws bought this for my son when he was about 9 1/2 months. He loved to just press the buttons at first but now he loves to stand on it and cruises with it while he plays. He still sits and plays with it too (he's 10 1/2 months now). You do have to be a little careful. He did accidentally bring the hold unit down on his face a couple times when he's fallen. It's the same with everything, you just have to keep a close eye on them. All in all, it's a great toy.
