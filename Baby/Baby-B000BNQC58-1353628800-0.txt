review/summary: Thought we had a winnerreview/text: Bought this for my daughter last year, she loved(s) it. But about 2 months ago the blue light went so faint you can't use it. A few weeks later, the green light faded. Now we can only uses the red, which she doesn't like. I took it apart looking for a way to change the bulb, completely enclosed. Checked the reviews online, found out there is no way to change the bulbs. Went and bought the brand name this time for Christmas.
