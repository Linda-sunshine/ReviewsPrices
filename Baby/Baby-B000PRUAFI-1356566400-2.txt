review/summary: Gate is very goodreview/text: This gate is one of the best gate on the market today. It can be a little tricky setting it up but one you have figured that out it works great. The gate is to keep the dogs upstairs and it works great for that. We also love the fact that you can keep it open and the fact that you can open it either way. I would tell anyone looking for a baby gate or a animal gate to try this one, you would be very happy with it.
