review/summary: Good value for the moneyreview/text: This is a good quality set that is nice looking and doesn't look cheap at all. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the seat cushion. It's not the softest thing in the world, but it's not bad. The back cushion is very soft. In addition, assembly was very easy, 10-15 minutes tops. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product.
