review/summary: Love it!review/text: Couldn't use it from birth as my newborn hated the kangaroo position... Or maybe i was just too nervous that I would break her! LOL!! but now that shes 6 weeks, I am carrying her in the hug position and she loves it and falls off to sleep every time! :-) P.S - I'm 5 feet and rather petite so got the XS...fits perfect
