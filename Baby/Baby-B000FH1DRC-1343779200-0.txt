review/summary: wrong sizereview/text: first time buying diapers online but the price was so good i couldnt pass it up. but got the diapers and they were the wrong size. amazon was great w/ the return process and now i have, hopefully, the right size coming to me. they even upgraded shipping to next day due for free due to their error. fingers crossed its right this next time :)
