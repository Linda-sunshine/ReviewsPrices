review/summary: Child will smack face on floor if child is able to sit up when chair is not in stationary positionreview/text: Why has this item not been recalled?! Any child able to sit up will fall face froward if this chair is not in the stationary position, even buckled in! This is incredibly dangerous! Who is giving this item 4-5 stars and why?! This cannot be unique to my rocker. These people must have reviewed the item prematurely ... before noticing this and they did not bother to update. Omg!
