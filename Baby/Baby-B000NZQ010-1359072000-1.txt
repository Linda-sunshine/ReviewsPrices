review/summary: Love this toy - great to help new walkers!review/text: My son basically learned how to walk with this toy at about 9 1/2 months old. He pushed this thing everywhere and loved playing with the items on the front. We still break this bad boy out sometimes and our son is two-years-old! Great product.
