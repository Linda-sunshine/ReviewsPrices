review/summary: The Poop Stops Herereview/text: I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5 because They are a bit stiffer than Luvs and Pampers. Also they are more expensive than Luvs.I had to switch to Huggies from Luvs because my baby girl started to have her poop migrate up her back! The Luvs were great until that started to happen. Huggies is the only name brand diaper that I've seen with the elasticy back or the Snug Fit Waistband as they call it. I just got the diapers in today and they couldn't have come quick enough. They solved the problem. The poop stopped at the 'elastic' and I didn't have to change another poopy outfit.
