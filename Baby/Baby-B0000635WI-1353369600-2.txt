review/summary: Do you believe in magic?review/text: I bought one of these for my 6 month pregnant wife since she's been getting increasingly uncomfortable sleeping at night.The first night she had this, she slept through the whole night without moving AT ALL. She looked so peaceful, I couldn't wait to ask her how she slept. Sure enough, she said it was the best night's sleep she's had in months.Well worth the $50.00!
