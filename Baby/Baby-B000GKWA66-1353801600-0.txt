review/summary: One of the best unexpected baby gifts we got!review/text: We were given this as a baby gift, and we love it! We use it for every nap and bedtime. Our baby always falls asleep within the time settings and doesn't awake when the timer ends.I know some have said the sounds are a bit creepy. I don't think so at all. I keep the volume down low. Our favorites of the 4 are the ocean waves and rainfall. (The other two are mother's heartbeat and whales.)The velcro strap is sturdy and holds the weight of the sheep high up on the crib (away from baby) securely.The battery pack, sound unit is easily removed if you want to travel with it and not have to take the sheep itself. It is just a bit bigger than a deck of cards so you could easily take it with you anywhere you need some white noise for baby to sleep.This would be an excellent baby gift!
