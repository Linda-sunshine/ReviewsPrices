review/summary: Makes Sleeping Comfortable for Pregnant Womenreview/text: I have horrible back pain even when I'm not pregnant. The chiropracter recommeded sleeping with a pillow between my legs, but it always felt awkward. When I was pregnant the first time my back pain was 10x's worse. I didn't really think these maternity pillows would work and I didn't want to spend the money on a bum product.Now that I'm pregnant again I don't want to suffer through the back pain. There were times when it would take me 15 minutes to get out of bed, the first time I was pregnant. I decided to get a maternity pillow this time because the back pain was already starting in the first trimester.After seeing how highly rated this product was I decided that it would be the best one to get. I also got a 20% Amazon Mom coupon that this item qualified for. This really does help align my back so that the pain isn't as bad.It comes with a sheet that shows additional ways to use it during pregnancy and after. I like my head to be propped up and I usually use three pillows to achieve that when I'm sleeping. I don't have to use that anymore. Plus that always gave me a crick in my neck and this way doesn't anymore.It's not that bukly in bed. What I do is I put it on the outside so that I can either face it or have my back to it. It doesn't push my husband out of the bed so that works out for him. He never has to deal with it.The bonus of this pillow is that my 2 1/2 year old son loves it. You can do a swirl position with it (the card you get with it shows you) and I put my son in the middle. It's like a pillow bean bag chair for him. He likes it so much he falls asleep in it. I wouldn't recommend a smaller child and there is a warning label that says not for younger children.I wish I had this pillow with my first pregnancy, but I'm glad I have it for my 2nd.
