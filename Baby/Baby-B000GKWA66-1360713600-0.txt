review/summary: sounds are patheticreview/text: The animal is great, the shape is nice - his head 'hangs' over a childs shoulder but the sounds that come with this thing are simply scary for young kids. I can't imagine how any child would be soothed to sleep with this one. Has a nice song on there but every few beats a loud roar or noise is made! really?
