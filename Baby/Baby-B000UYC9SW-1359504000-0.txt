review/summary: Had to return - bought a Moby.review/text: After much research, I decided to buy the Baby K'Tan instead of the Moby wrap. However, I ordered a small (I'm 5'10&#34; 155 lbs; size 8-10) and when I got it it was very tight. I put it on and the material was thicker than jersey knit and didn't seem to give all that much. I debated whether or not I was getting the correct fit, and ultimately decided that it may be safer for baby to go with the Moby since that's a one-size-fit-all item. I didn't want to deal with sending the small back, ordering a medium, and that feeling too big. I think this is a great item, if you are confident you have the right size...but since I wasn't, I just made it easier and went with the Moby.
