review/summary: huge disappointmentreview/text: Even though they don't leak, I hate the fact that the baby smells poop all the time. The diaper gets wet and then the baby and all his clothes smell terrible. Also I don't like them because they do not seem as natural on the baby's skin as the Huggies. Huggies are for sure a better option! I will never buy them again!
