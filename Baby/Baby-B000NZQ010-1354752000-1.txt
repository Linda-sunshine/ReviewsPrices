review/summary: Two in One and lots of funreview/text: I gave this to my son when he was around 9 months old, he loved all the lights and sounds and his favorite part is the barn door that says "peekaboo" when you open it. It doesn't move to fast when you give it a push (only on carpet)..the only thing is that when you press a sound they all play! so i can see it getting overwhelming for a younger child.It keeps him occupied and entertained while I'm busy doing home stuff. Some researches say that walkers are not good for babies to start walking because babies need to see their feet and watch where they going, but this walker is desined that way so babies CAN both see their feet and look ahead of them.This toy is exactly as it says a sit to stand learning walker. It has lots of interactive features. The front "face" comes off so he can sit on the floor with it and play....when he is feeling adventurous hhe pushes it around. It does not have any resistance feature on the wheels (like some other walkers) so he is still learning to push it and control it without falling but I would recommend it and buy it again over other walkers (I have 2 others that don't interest him as much)
