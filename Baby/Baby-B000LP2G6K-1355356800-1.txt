review/summary: Great product for the value!review/text: I am almost due with my second child and I didn't want to purchase a bulky crib, which takes up a lot of room and is not very easy to move around. I saw this same item at target for a little over $100 dollars. Instead of buying it there, I decided to do some online price comparison. After looking at many sites which were almost the same price as Targets, and on top of that there was an additional charge for shipping, which was not cheap, I was shocked when I saw the same exact same model on Amazon for a little under $70.00 plus free shipping. I am very happy with the quality and the price of the item the whole shopping experience. I definitely recommend it!
