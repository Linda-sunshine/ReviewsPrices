review/summary: Sit to stand is greatreview/text: daughter got this at 10 months. She loves it. The music is very catchy and makes her pay more attention. She bounces and dances on it. It has two level for breaks so be careful. At 1 it does not move and at 2 it moves alot when pushed. I walk behind my daughter at 2 so she does not fall forward.Overall great product.
