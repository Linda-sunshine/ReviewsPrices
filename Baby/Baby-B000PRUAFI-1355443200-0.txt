review/summary: Best gate I have ever ownedreview/text: We have been through 3 different gates. Some would not hold and would be easily knocked down by my 1 year old and my Lab, others were just cheap.This gate is awesome and secure. Great holding power and it does not make marks on the wall! I have 2, one at the top and one at the bottom of the stairwell. They have a great lock function and are easily opened one handed with your baby in hand.
