review/summary: Great product! Huggies Snug and Dry Diapers, Size 6review/text: Great quality. Our big boy has an over 100% weight, and we start to use Huggies Snug and Dry size 6 when he is 1 year old. That is way much better than the pampers (pampers'' waistband is too sharp and often hurts my son's legs). Never had a leak. long lasting. Great for winter.
