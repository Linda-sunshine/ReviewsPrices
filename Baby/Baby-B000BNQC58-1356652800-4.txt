review/summary: Cool little Turltereview/text: This cool little turtle helps my one year old boy get off to sleep when he is having trouble. It illuminates his room very well and is very dreamy. The turtle is soft with a reasonably hard shell, but not too hard for the young ones to hurt themselves. 3 colors to choose from, red, blue and green.
