review/summary: Good Productreview/text: We replaced the Pampers sesitive with these and you can tell the difference in both diapers. these a thiner and not as soft. But work just as great and they are cheaper. We have used Pampers since our first kid and after trying different brands this is by far the best; softer, no leaks, good price (amazon subscribe and save).
