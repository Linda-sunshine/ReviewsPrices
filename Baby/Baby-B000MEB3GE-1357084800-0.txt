review/summary: Get an app for your phone insteadreview/text: This is just a timer, which is fine if that's all you need. The problem is you can't start and stop it (or maybe I just didn't figure out how to do it). You can only start it over. So when your baby wakes up, you can't stop it until the next nap, you can only restart the timer. I bought an app for $5 that can start and stop and even keeps track of daily totals of diapers, average feeding etc.
