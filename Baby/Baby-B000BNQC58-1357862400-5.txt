review/summary: My little girl LOVES this! It's a keeper!review/text: Bought this for our 10 year old daughter for CHRISTmas. It is awesome! Educational as well. She uses it every night as a nightlight and the stars illuminate her entire bedroom. WELL WORTH THE MONEY! Also, enjoy the fact it will help her learn the constellations, the stars light up in different colors, it is very peaceful and relaxing to use! And it cuts off after 45 minutes, so not waste of batteries :)
