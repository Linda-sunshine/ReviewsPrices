review/summary: Very fun!review/text: Our 5 month old loves it! We bought the excersaucer first which he did not like much as it does not bounce enough. This he absolutely loves and will stay in for a long time. Also the toys are much simpler for him to play with, although I am a little weary of the elephant that looks like it could hurt his little fingers like a guillotine.... I turn his seat away from that side and will probably take the elephant off once he can turn on his own.Great toy, and even if he cannot quite touch the floor yet, we just put a pillow under his feet and he is ready to go!
