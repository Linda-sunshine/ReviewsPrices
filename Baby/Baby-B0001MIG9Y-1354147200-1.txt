review/summary: not so dry....review/text: Diaper didn't last through the night. My 2 year old woke up multiple times needing to be changed (totally unusual for him). The gel beads inside the diaper became really cold when wet and the diper completely ripped open, allowing the wet, cold gel beads to spill all over the place. I'm going back to my normal pampers and just getting the next size up--hopefully that works.
