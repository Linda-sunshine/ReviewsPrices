review/summary: Worst diapers- Ever.review/text: I ordered these before our son was born. At the time, I didn't know the difference between the swaddlers and the baby dry. Well, I learned the hard way as these leak like CRAZY. I cannot convey how truly awful these are. Please spare yourself the pain and don't get these diapers. Baby dry is awful.
