review/summary: love it!!review/text: This is one of my favorite things I have purchased with the birth of my daughter. It worked great when I was super tired when she was first born in May and I still use it to keep track of feedings, diaper changes & sleeping. I also used the little "*" for taking my meds after delivery to make sure I didn't lapse. I like that not only does it help you keep track of when something last took place, but it also has alarms you can set. I don't use the alarms anymore, but it worked great with feeding mydaughter every 2 hours when she was little and I was nursing her (and still am...just she is my alarm now). And the pink is super cute!! I take it with me when I am out and about with her too.
