review/summary: Good to look at, that's about itreview/text: We research things a lot before we buy. The ratings for this chair are pretty skewed: 80%+ of the reviewers who have had this chair less than 2 weeks gave it a great review, whereas 80%+ of the reviewers who have had this chair more than a few months gave it poor marks. I wish I would have found this out sooner as now I understand why. We got the chair, put it together in a snap, sat in it. It was great! Comfy, quiet, pretty to look at. It's not until you start using it for hours a day when you realize a few things:1: The seat cushion starts off a little flat, but it was bearable. However after a few weeks it really flattens down and you're left feeling like you're sitting on a row of springs.2: Lumbar support is nonexistant. The cushioning on the back is stuffed just as cheaply as on the seat. It's not ergonomic at all. A chair shouldn't give you a back ache after nursing for an hour.3: Only three weeks in, the back is starting to squeak. The points where you attach the bolts are stressed every time you rock, and I fear we'll be tightening the bolts pretty regularly.The one *ONE* saving grace of this chair is the price. If you're on a hair-thin budget... I guess it's better than sitting on a cardboard box. That said, you definitely get what you pay for and in the future I'll be investing in a better chair, especially now that I know my wife will use it every day.
