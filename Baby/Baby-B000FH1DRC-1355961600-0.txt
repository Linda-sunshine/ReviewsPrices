review/summary: Fabulous!review/text: Pampers swaddlers are the best newborn diapers on the market! The indicator strip makes it easy to know when a baby needs to be changed. Our daughter has very skinny legs and the swaddlers were the only diapers that did not leak in the early days. Before she was born I purchased four different kinds of diapers. We are first time parents and did not know what to expect from each brand. Pampers has the best absorbtion and leak protection. I would highly recommend this product to any new parent.
