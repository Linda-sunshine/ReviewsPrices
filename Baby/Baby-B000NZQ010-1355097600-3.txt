review/summary: Very Nicereview/text: I gave this toy a 4 star becasue my baby loves it but i think it might need a the brakes to be a little bit stronger,my baby can actually run holding on to it even with the brakes on!The interactive game is a lot of fun and the Peek a Boo barn door is just adorable!!!
