review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: This wrap looks great but I unfortunately can't get the hang of it. I have a difficult time getting it on tight enough so that my baby girl is in securely. I get it on and when she is in it feels good but she ends up slanting to the side hanging diagonaly. I still have to use my hands to support her bottom just for my peace of mind. Therefore, I regret purchasing it. I feel I should have gone with a sling or other carrier. I would love any suggestions...
