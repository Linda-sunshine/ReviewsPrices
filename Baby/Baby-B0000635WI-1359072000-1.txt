review/summary: Best sleep in a monthreview/text: Imagine my surprise when the easy sleep of first trimester ended and uncomfortable tossing and turning of second trimester began. I tried a wedge pillow and another polyfill pillow and I wasn't able to get comfortable. I was skeptical of the Snoogle but after a night of amazing sleep with it, my skepticism melted away (along with my chest congestion).Don't wait, get the snoogle and sleep better immediately!
