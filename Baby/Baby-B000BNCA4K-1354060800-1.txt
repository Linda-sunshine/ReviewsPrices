review/summary: Baby was interested immediately...only negative is the rattlereview/text: I ordered this for my almost 3 month old...and he has been very interested in it. He has just started grabbing things in the past couple weeks, and this is the first toy he has actively reached out to grab on sight alone without me putting it in his hands first. So, I would give it 5 stars...however, the little ball in the center rattle portion keeps getting stuck and not rattling. I have to bang it on something to dislodge it so it rattles again. I am debating sending it for a replacement...but I'm not sure how important the rattle part is to my baby...it just seems like he is interested in it's shape regardless so I may just keep it. Since mine was a bit defective...I can't give it a perfect 5 stars. But as far as my baby's interest in it goes...it got a 5 star response.
