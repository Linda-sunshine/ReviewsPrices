review/summary: great diapers with no licks!review/text: I have been using Huggies Snug and Dry diapers for my baby for over 1yr now. For me, they have never licked. They are very comfy and easy to put on. My baby does not get any rashes or any other issues with them. Do not stick to the baby's bottom like the pampers do. Initially, I used pampers. But a friend suggested that I give huggies a try. I used one packet of huggies and I liked them so much that I have been using them ever since.I have taken off one star from the rating for two reasons. 1. Huggies diapers do not have wet indicator like the pampers diapers. It's very useful thing to have. 2. They are packed very tightly in the plastic bags. Sometimes, it's extremely for me to pull them out when a I open a new packet.
