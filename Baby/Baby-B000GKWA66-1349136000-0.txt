review/summary: I really wanted to love this.review/text: I really wanted to love the Cloud B Giraffe, but so far I think it's just ok. Here's my thoughts:Pros:-It cute and soft-The sounds are relaxing-There is a variety of sounds to choose from-Volume control-Convenient handle to attach it to a crib, stroller, etc.Cons:-The "fur" seems to come off easily, I'm not sure how long this product to stay looking nice-The buttons are very sensitive and turn on too easily-The automatic shut off is too short, my son wakes up when it shuts off...the company should have a choice to just leave it onSo far, it's not the answer to my babies sleep problems...but it is cute!
