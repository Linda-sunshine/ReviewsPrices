review/summary: Only high chair I neededreview/text: My kid is two now and has had this seat from the beginning. He didn't start solids until he could sit up on his own so I really didn't see the need for any seat other than this one. I love that it fits right on one of our dining room chairs so no extra space is needed and I just push the whole chair under the table and no one would even know we have a kid (well, if they ignored the living room that exploded with toys).It's easy to clean off, the trays just go in the dishwasher and the seat gets wiped down. I've been known to take it out back and spray it down with the hose on occasion too (smash cake, anyone?).It's also portable so it can go to grandma and grandpa's house, no need to buy a second one unless you really dislike having to unsnap two straps from a chair.Now it's working perfectly fine as a booster chair so kiddo can sit at the table like a big boy. This is one of the best baby buys we made as far as the cost to longevity of use ratio goes.
