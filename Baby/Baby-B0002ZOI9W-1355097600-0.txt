review/summary: Nice Rockerreview/text: My son is 4 months now and he's had it since he was a little less than a month old, and he likes it. The vibration is nice on it, and the middle toy makes noise, which most babies love. Plus you can make it stationary and lay it back for sleepy babies. And when they get older, they can use it for a rocking chair, without the toys. The only complaint i have with it is the vibration box has vibrated it loose, so it makes an annoying noise when you turn it on. But my little man loves it :)
