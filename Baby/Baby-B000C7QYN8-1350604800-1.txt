review/summary: Eco-friendly, but packaging needs workreview/text: We keep these on hand at our arts studio for little hands. When 20 kids are lined up to wash hands, wipes are a quicker alternative. We use green, eco-friendly products for the health of the little ones who come to our studio. We also love that when we order large quantities of Seventh Generation baby wipes, they are shipped in a eco-friendly packaging.However, when the children (and teachers, at times) try to reach in to grab a wipe, it can be like one of those Chinese finger traps. The tub has a terrible design. The next wipe rarely pops out after the one removed, and when children reach in to get the next one, their little hands not only get stuck, but it is painful! Not a great design.We would love to see a tub designed that is similar to the ones that Huggies uses. The Huggies baby wipes have a flexible, soft top which is very effective and easy on the hands. While that is not incentive enough to stop using a green alternative, we would love to see Seventh Generation wipes change their design. As far as we are concerned, that's the only thing lacking, but it's fairly significant in relation to our use of the product.
