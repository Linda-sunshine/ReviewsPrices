review/summary: the best thing we've bought so farreview/text: We bought this product to make a playroom in the living room for our 7month old. Within a few weeks she was pulling herself up on the walls and walking around the perimeter. It's sturdy, well built, easy to assemble, and looks cute in the living room with the foam alphabet floor (sold separately). We weren't quite ready to baby proof the whole house - this was the perfect solution for a safe, fun place for her to play, plus it's big enough for us to play in there with her.
