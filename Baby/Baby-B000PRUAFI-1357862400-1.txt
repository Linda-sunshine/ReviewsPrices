review/summary: Easy to install and usereview/text: I bought two of these gates, one for myself and one for my daughter to be used at the bottom of our stairs to protect the safety of a very active baby! It was easy to install, it is extremely sturdy, and it opens with a touch so that you can hold the baby in one arm and use the other hand to unlatch the gate to get up, or down, the stairs. Great product.
