review/summary: Great diapers - no complaintsreview/text: These do the job and do it well. Occasionally a leak or two of a soiled nappy but I think that is more the velocity and directional angle of my little one and her pooping than anything to do with the diaper. Wetness indicator always works. The economy pack is super nice too - we go through A LOT!She always seems comfortable. Used the newborn version as well. She is 12lbs and Size 1 still fits. Going to order Size 2 for next lot though.
