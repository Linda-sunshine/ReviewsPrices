review/summary: Great pack n playreview/text: Bought this pack n play to arrive at our destination for my 10 month old for whilst we were on holiday, so was worried it wouldnt suit but we'd be stuck with it. Needn't have worried. Great product for what we wanted. Easy to put up, sturdy but lightweight and reasonably priced. I did buy a padded fitted sheet to make it more comfortable to sleep on but overall a great buy.
