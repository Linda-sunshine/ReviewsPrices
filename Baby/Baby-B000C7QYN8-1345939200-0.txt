review/summary: They're OK, do the job but I don't care for the smellreview/text: The wipes work, they are wet enough, they could be a little thicker. I don't know how to describe it they are kind of like a dryer sheet that is thicker and has more elasticity. They smell a little wierd. No too strong but I wouldn't want my body to smell like that. I won't be purchasing them again but if they were on sale I would buy them.
