review/summary: Easy for baby to grab and chew on!review/text: We bought this toy for my daughter when she was 3.5 months old. She loves it and so do we. The loops make it really easy for her to hold on to and they are also nice and soft so she can chomp on them as she begins the teething process. I would highly recommend.
