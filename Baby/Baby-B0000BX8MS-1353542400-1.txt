review/summary: Great Way to Keep a Warm Safe Babyreview/text: The Halo SleepSack is a great way to keep my 11 month old son warm in the winter, without worrying about him getting tangled in a blanket. Some key notes about the SleepSack is that it zippers from the top which is a little harder than the typical zip at bottom (especially with a squirmy infant). My son is 25" tall and has a lot of legroom which is really nice actually because it prevents him from standing up in his crib. I usually use a regular cotton or sometimes fleece sleeper with this to make sure he is warm because it has no sleeves. Been using this for two months and love it, would definitely recommend!
