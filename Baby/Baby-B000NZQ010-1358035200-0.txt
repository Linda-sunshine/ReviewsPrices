review/summary: Grandaughter loved it!review/text: At 7 months old, she really loves playing with all the different things and interacting with the toy. The walker goes a bit fast, since my grandaughter leans into it, so we have to walk with her, but it is sturdy. I think as she grows older and is more steady on her feet, the walker will be a great asset.
