review/summary: bad smell, not very greenreview/text: I have a 6-month old baby and during my pregnancy I did a lot of research into green and eco-friendly, organic products. I ruled out 7th Gen for a variety of reasons (mostly the concealed chemical ingredients in them) but then I decided to give these wipes a try once the baby arrived. Needless to say, I won't be buying them again. They are drier than other wet wipes, so they tend to rub the baby's skin too hard w/o removing the impurities, they have a horrible smell (allegedly all natural but come on, we all know that doesn't mean it is pleasant) and that smell remains on baby's skin.. I am much happier with jackson Reese and will be going back to those wipes. Sorry 7th Gen.
