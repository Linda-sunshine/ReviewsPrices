review/summary: Pregnancy must have!review/text: In my first month i had no problem sleeping but once i hit the 20 weeks and my belly started growing i really needed an extra support for a better night sleep.! I got the Snoogle following my friend suggestions and i loved it!!! The pillow promotes the side sleeping and supports very well belly and back.. the only inconvenient for me is that turning is a bit difficult but other than that is a great great product for mommies to be!!!
