review/summary: What I receivedreview/text: So I was a little uncertain about what I was ordering with the "blankie soft" logo on the box, but the picture of the green packaging, and swaddlers at size 2 are supposed to still have the color changing strip...but it wasn't listedWe've been using Swaddlers with the color strip since the hospital. We've had no issue with them, we like them, and so we stick with them. I ordered this product, we received a box with the green packaging diapers as seen in the pictures. I opened the packaging and we do indeed have the diapers with the color changing strip; Pampers size 2 with the little baby ernie on them. I got what I was hoping for. Hopefully this will clear up the confusion of what you are ordering, for someone else.I ordered the 248 ct at size 2. These do have Drymax in them (so says the label).
