review/summary: Best wipes ever!review/text: We bought these wipes becuase allergies prevented us from using other brands and were very happy to discover how well they worked. These wipes clean up all diaper messes easily and are gentle on baby's skin. I would highly recommend Seventh Generation Baby wipes, but would suggest leaving them in their green package instead of refilling the larger container. The resealable green packaging keeps the wipes much more moist and is the right size for both next to a changing pad or inside a diaper bag.
