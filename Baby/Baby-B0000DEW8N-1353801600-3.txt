review/summary: Excellent choicereview/text: I started with a regular high chair and found it tedious to keep clean and also had too large of a footprint. Bought this shortly after and loved it! My son used it as a booster to help him reach the table (left it attached to chair, just removed tray, pushed him up to regular table) until just recently and he's 4. (He's a shorty). So I got years of use from it and it was always easy to clean. I bought one for my cousin's daughter, who's starting on solid foods, and she loves it too. Great product!
