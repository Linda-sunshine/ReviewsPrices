review/summary: Great booster seat, with a notable exceptionreview/text: My wife and I really like this booster seat, and our daughter Allison likes it, too. It's compact enough to fit almost any chair. I like that we can strap Allison in with the seatbelt, and that the seat can be secured to a chair in a couple of ways. It's comfortable enough for her, and it's light enough to make it easily usable. Its reasonable price also makes it a good purchase.I'd give it five stars if only for the awkward way the tray fits onto the seat base. The tray has plastic flaps that hang down and hook onto plastic buttons on the seat base. The three buttons mean you can put the tray a little closer or a little further away from your child as you wish. Unfortunately, this system is very awkward to use, and I think Fisher-Price needs to redesign it. I always have to take a moment to make sure I line up the holes on the tray with the right button, and then guide it into place without pinching any fingers -- not fun to do when I have a squirming daughter. And my wife has been frustrated with how much force it has required to pull and remove the tray from the base. This has been an annoyance to both of us, but it's gotten easier to remove as the seat has been broken in. On the plus side, the tray is always held securely and level, so while it's awkward to use, it still works as it should. I just hope Fisher-Price can figure out a way to make the tray latch on and remove quicker and easier. That's really the only drawback to this otherwise excellent booster seat.
