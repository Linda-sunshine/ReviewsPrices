review/summary: Fun and Durable; Great Buy!review/text: This was given to my oldest as a gift when he was first learning to walk. He would push it everywhere, or just sit and play with the music and play board on the front. It has now gone through both my sons, my niece, and will be used by my daughter when she is old enough. It is still in perfect condition. The front part with the toys detaches so kids can play with it during tummy time, or sit by it. The wheel design is very sturdy, so as your little one learns to walk they take very few accidents. My very solid boys were able to pull themselves up by the handle without it tipping over. The only thing you have to watch out for is your little one walking too fast and the walker getting too far ahead of them. Really great toy. If ours broke, I would buy another one just for our daughter.
