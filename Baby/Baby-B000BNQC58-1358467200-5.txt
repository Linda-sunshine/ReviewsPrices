review/summary: My kids love it.review/text: I bought this for my six year old for Christmas. He along with my other kids who are younger really like looking at the stars as they fall asleep at night. The stars are bright and clear - in a variety of colors you can choose between. The body is soft and the shell hard, but it doesn't keep him from cuddling with it at night. My little girl now wants one for her room.
