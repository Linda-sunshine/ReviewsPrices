review/summary: Great Diapersreview/text: Being first time parents and on a tight budget we tried every kind of "inexpensive" diaper we could find but it seemed like we were having blow outs and changing our son ALL the time! With these diapers we have only had a few blow outs and those were ones that no diaper could have held. A little expensive but with Amazon Prime and Subscribe and Save its a little cheaper and is totally worth it!
