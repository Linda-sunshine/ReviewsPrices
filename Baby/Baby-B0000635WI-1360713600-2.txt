review/summary: no more morning low back ache!review/text: I am sleeping so much better now and no longer wake up with a low back ache. I have tried other remedies for low back ache in the morning, including getting a new mattress, but nothing worked until I started using this pillow. Although the pillow is awkward to move if you toss and turn at night, I have adapted by leaving the pillow in position and just moving myself. It still works great. The only negative is that I won't be able to take it with me when I travel.
