review/summary: The baby loves it!review/text: I bought this toy for my grandson. I was looking for a toy that is easy to grasp with one or two hands, that will not hurt him if he hits himself with it, that has stimulating colors, and which can be chewed on to his heart's content. This toy hit the mark on all paramaters.
