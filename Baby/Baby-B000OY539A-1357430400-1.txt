review/summary: Must have!!review/text: I asked my husband to buy this for me to assist with breast feeding. I am so happy that he bought it for me. The mobs wrap distributes weight more evenly then other baby carriers and is even more comfortable to wear. It is a little time consuming to put on the first couple of times, but as you get a little practice with putting it on, it gets easier and easier. I still used the baby bjorn as well. I just prefer the moby wrap.
