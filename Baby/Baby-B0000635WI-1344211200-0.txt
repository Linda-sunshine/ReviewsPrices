review/summary: Must-Have Item!review/text: LOVE THIS PILLOW!!! Pre-pregnancy, I was a stomach-sleeper. At about 13 weeks, it became impossible to sleep on my stomach, and therefore impossible to get comfortable enough to sleep. After reading reviews on numerous pregnancy pillows, I decided on the Snoogle because it looked to be the best item in the price range I was looking at. After 2 months of use now, I could not live without this pillow! It makes it easy and comfortable to sleep on my side; no more tossing and turning all night. It is a big pillow; however, I am able to fit the pillow, myself and my husband easily in our queen-sized bed. I use it not only for sleep, but I also fold it up and use it as back support when laying up in bed, which is an added bonus (it comes with instructions on multiple ways to fold and use)! I can also see it being useful for feeding when the baby comes. I do have two small complaints, the first being that after too much use in one position, it gets kind of flat. However, it's nothing that a little 'fluffing up' can't fix. The other is the cover it comes with; its white (easy to stain with any little trace of makeup) and a little on the rough side. However, those complaints aren't enough to make me take away a star.Overall, I would highly recommend this pillow. It has been a life saver for me so far. I will be purchasing this for all pregnant friends/family in the future.UPDATE: I had to have an episiotomy when delivering my son, and the Snoogle pillow was such a blessing to have when it came to recovery. It was very painful sitting, so I folded up the pillow and sat on it. Because it is big, the height it provided over using a Boppy or other pillow to sit on was great. Yet another use for an already extremely useful product!
