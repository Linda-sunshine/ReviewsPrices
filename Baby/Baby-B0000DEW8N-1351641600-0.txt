review/summary: Sturdy, adjustable and easy to clean!review/text: We are very pleased with the Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat. It's sturdy, compact, adjustable, easy to clean and much more versatile than a bulky high chair. We use it as both a high chair and a booster seat when our grandchildren visit. When not in use, it stores easily in a guest room closet. One caveat--it doesn't attach well to plush dining chairs with heavily padded seats or backs. We attach it to a sturdy, metal folding chair, but any sturdy chair that's not too padded should work well. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the snap on tray lid is too easy for our 1-year old grandaughter to pry loose and we don't use it. Other than that, it's perfect.
