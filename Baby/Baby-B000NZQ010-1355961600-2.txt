review/summary: Wonderful Giftreview/text: I have a toddler and a 5mo old lil' girl. David absolutely loves the toy and dances to it whenever the music plays. He's a very musical boy. I'm sure our daughter will love the toy as well, since she and David are very much alike. Thanks to my brother Peter, who was so generous to get this toy for Christmas!
