review/summary: Great for night timereview/text: We have used these diapers on our 1 year old for the past 6 months, and I can only remember one time that the diaper leaked in the middle of the night. The diaper will be very full in the morning, but no more middle of the night changes! We will continue to use these diapers at night.
