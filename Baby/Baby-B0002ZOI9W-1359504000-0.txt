review/summary: Super cute rocker/baby seatreview/text: The Dark Safari rocker is a very cute alternative to the floor swing or reclining baby napper. With a toy bar and vibration setting, this rocker may seem standard, but it also has the ability to change from a stationary napper to a rocker! The toy bar plays music from the elephant, which plays a very short "Skip to my Lou."It is a bright and colorful toy for your baby. The pad is not very thick, but it can do the job. You can easily remove it for cleaning in a washing machine. The frame is a sturdy metal and hard plastic combination, but it requires complete assembly. The assembly is relatively easy, with just a Philips screwdriver necessary to attach the 6 screws. I would like to point out that the toy bar snaps into place. Most other models feature a swivel bar to conveniently and quietly move toys and baby without waking her up.A "D" battery is required for the vibration to work and it is NOT included. Button cell batteries, 3 "LR44" or equivalent, are required for the elephant to play music, but those are included. Both battery cases require a screw driver to open and change. The instructions are in English and Spanish.Overall the bright colors and rocking feature make this a very nice toy. The versatility with the kick stand and ability to make it a rocking chair for a toddler is a big bonus. The toy bar is nothing special and it is a simple design and construction. Given the myriad of baby toys, sleepers, and swings it depends on what you are looking for to determine if this is for you. I think it is a great toy, especially for its ability to transition with your baby. If it lasts, that makes it a worthy buy: recommended.
