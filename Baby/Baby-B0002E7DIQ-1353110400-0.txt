review/summary: Saved my sleep!review/text: This pillow has been the best material investment I've made during my pregnancy and I don't regret the money spent at all! I have 4 more weeks to go and have slept great every night since buying this pillow. I am so glad I decided to go with the full wrap-around pillow because I like the option to switch sides without having to roll the whole pillow over to the other side with me. If I want to feel like I am sleeping on my back, the other side keeps me tilted up a bit so as not to be flat on my back. I tend to get claustrophobic easily, so I was worried this pillow would just be too much for me, but it has been great all around! Highly recommended!
