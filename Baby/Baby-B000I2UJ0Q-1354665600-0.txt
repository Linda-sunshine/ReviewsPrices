review/summary: Happy Babyreview/text: I bought this for my son because I thought he would like it. He didn't like the baby swing we got him after a few minutes on the swing he would get fussy and cry. The swing is very entertaining for him and he loves the toys on it. He is four months old and at first he didn't really get how to use the jumper but only took him a day before he was jumping away... the music on it also isn't too annoying. It has a few settings that will play a song continuously when he jumps or you can have it just play animal noises when he jumps. It was easy to put together and seems durable enough to make it for our next baby.
