review/summary: Love it!!review/text: I am in my 6th month, 2nd pregnancy. Before I started using this maternity belt I used to get so tired in 2-3 hours of outing. I had to always keep one hand on my lower belly for support. Mother to a toddler, this belt is a blessing. Keeps me running through the day. Sometimes even making me forget that I am pregnant. Love it!! It is uncomfortable only when I lie down. But maybe its not meant to be put on while resting. Highly recommend this product
