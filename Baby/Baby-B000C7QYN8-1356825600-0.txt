review/summary: Don't love the &#34;scent&#34;review/text: They are unscented, but they do have a kind of stale, strange smell to them. We keep ours in a warmer, and they just seem to leave a strange smell on your hands when you are finished. If you want a more natural fiber, this is not your wipe (go with costco tencel wipes). The cloth here is a blend of rayon and polyester. It's woven, so it doesn't tear or break down.
