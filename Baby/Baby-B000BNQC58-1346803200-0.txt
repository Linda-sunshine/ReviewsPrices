review/summary: Thought my son would like it betterreview/text: Have a 3 year old that is scared to sleep alone in the dark. Thought he would LOVE this. He LIKES it, but can't say that he loves it. I do think it's pretty neat and he does use it every night. Was hoping for more...maybe if it included sound as well?
