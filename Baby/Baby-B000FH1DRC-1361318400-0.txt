review/summary: great diapersreview/text: New parent with a 1 year old now. The hospital used pampers and thats what we use still to the day. We tried different brands but they all leaked or caused a rash on our baby.Here is a few things I have learned:Any regular Pampers Swaddlers diapers have Dry-Max no matter what the packaging says. The only versions that don't are the Pampers sensative. The hospital versions are just plain white diapers with no design on them. So buy them if they are cheaper(usually they are). Sizing on our child runs a little larger, but that might just be her shape?Overall we are very happy with this brand and will continue to use it now and in the future as long as they don't change anything in them or the design of them.
