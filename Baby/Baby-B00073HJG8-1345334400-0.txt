review/summary: Stuffed animal overflowreview/text: My daughter has a ridiculous amount of stuffed animals and a tiny bedroom. This hammock works perfectly to contain them all while saving floor space. We've had it for about a year now and it's good as new! The only thing I don't like about it is that my daughter can't get the animals down by herself. But that is because we chose to hang it up close to the ceiling above her bed. It would work hanging lower too but we don't have the space. Overall a really great purchase!
