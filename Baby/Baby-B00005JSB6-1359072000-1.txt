review/summary: Not incredibly soft, but worth the money!review/text: They aren't incredibly soft like the pampers swaddlers that I was using, but my baby doesn't seem to care. They are very reasonably priced and I haven't had any leaking problems! I will continue to buy these unless they change the pricing on me.
