review/summary: Lady Bug Lites up my granddaughters eyesreview/text: My granddaughter is coming to spend Christmas with us and loves lady bugs. She asked her grandpa (cause he always says yes) for 'one of those things that puts lights on the ceiling .... so we got the Lady Bug one and we couldn't be more pleased... She'll love it and will love switching the lights from green to blue to red. We got it for a great price and it was sent within 2 days! (that was probably LADY LUCK)
