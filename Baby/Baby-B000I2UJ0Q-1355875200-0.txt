review/summary: My little jumper loved this thing!review/text: My son used this every day from when he was about 5 months old until he couldn't fit in it anymore (probably well beyond the weight guidelines, woops!). We were able to cook dinner or just relax for a moment while he bounced away for about 20 minutes at a time. It's sturdy and entertaining and easy to adjust as baby grows. Also quite easy to disassemble when you're ready to put it in storage. If you have an active child who is always trying to bounce or jump or move, he/she will probably love this. I know our *very* energetic son sure did!
