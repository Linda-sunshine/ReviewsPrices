review/summary: Thank GOD!!!review/text: With my second pregnancy, I have been experiencing so much pressure because this baby is riding so much lower. I would be in so much pain that it would be difficult to walk, especially when standing up after sitting for a bit of time. My husband talked me into finding something to help. I honestly didn't think this simple belt would do very much, but I felt immediate relief as soon as I put it on. It has really helped relieve a lot of the pressure I was feeling, and I am no longer as swollen as I was. YAY!!!
