review/summary: Awesome for over nights!review/text: My LO is 3 1/2 months old and is primarily breastfed with 1 bottle of formula a day. I started using the baby dry diapers a few weeks ago ONLY during the night time. And they are awesome! Now my little one rarely poos during the night time now so these baby dry diapers are awesome for me! Most nights they last the whole night and his clothes are still dry.
