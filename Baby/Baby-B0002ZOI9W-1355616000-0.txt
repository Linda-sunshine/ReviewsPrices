review/summary: love this thing!review/text: When I had my son a lot moms recommended the rock n play... I couldn't justify the price for how little use I would get out of it! I actually found of these at a thrift store for a buck... and its been great! So I am here to buy another (full price, of course). My son is 4 months and spends a lot of time hanging out in and playing. When he was a new born he slept in it when we went to g-mas house. Its been great for sleep AND play! Love this thing!!!Ill be buying for other expecting moms too!
