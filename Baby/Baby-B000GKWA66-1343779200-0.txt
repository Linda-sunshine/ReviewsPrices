review/summary: soft, cuddly and cute!review/text: I got this for my 6 week old son to help him calm down and go to sleep at night. I'm not sure that it does much at this point, but I like listening to the "rain" setting. The one thing I am disappointed about is that I bought it for the mother's heartbeat sound, as he likes to lie on my chest and listen to my heartbeat. But it really doesn't sound anything like a heartbeat, so I haven't used that sound much.
