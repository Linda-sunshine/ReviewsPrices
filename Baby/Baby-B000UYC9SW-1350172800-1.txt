review/summary: Life saver!review/text: It took my baby a couple tries before she began to like being in the wrap but once she began to like it Mommy had her life back! I was finally able to get dishes done and some chores as I carried her with me around the house. I chose this over other wraps because it is so much easier to put on (less fabric to mess with). I only gave it 4 stars because after 30 minutes my back does start to ache and my baby is only 12 lbs. But if your on the market for a wrap you should defiantly consider this one!
