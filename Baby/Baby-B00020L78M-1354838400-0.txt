review/summary: Serves its Purposereview/text: Does a good jobs limited dogs or children from accessing certain areas. It is sturdy to an extent. If your child or dogs (weighing more than 60 lbs) pull or jump on it, it will wobble. Was well worth the price but advise buying the additional section for a larger enclosed area.
