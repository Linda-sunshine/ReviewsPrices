review/summary: So far so good, bt box doesnt say Deluxe..review/text: Though box doesnt say deluxe, I still believe this is the deluxe as it is the same chair as the &#34;deluxe&#34; model boxed. I think this may just be an older color combo and hasn't had Deluxe written on box. Has the three tray pieces (2 trays, 1 cover). Fixes pretty sturdy to chair. Easy in and out, and easy tray off.
