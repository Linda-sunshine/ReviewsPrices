review/summary: Good buy!review/text: We're very pleased with this purchase. I was able to get it for $60 on amazon, $10 cheaper than store, plus with amazon prime got free shipping, which it would cost me $10 in gas, at least, to drive to the store to get it so it was a good buy. Easy to put up and take down. A regular size crib wont fit in the room, and a mini one is too expensive, so we use this as her crib, it fits perfectly. The colors and toy bar fit the baby decor, it a giraffe and two green leaves. The lil pad does not sit/stay as flat as it seems it should but I've found it not to make any difference when baby is laying on it. Also plan on using it as a play pen when baby gets a bit bigger. Next I have to find a fitted sheet to fit it. Granimals playyard fitted sheets dont, fyi :)
