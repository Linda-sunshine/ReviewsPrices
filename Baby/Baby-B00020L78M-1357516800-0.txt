review/summary: Great ex-pen for rabbitreview/text: I bought the 6-panel gate to make a pen for my mini rex rabbit (3 pounds, very active). It's been great. She can't chew through it (she can through the similarly-designed Surround gates by Summer and all wood and mesh gates) and she can't fit through the gaps in the panels or get her nose or paws stuck in the spaces within each panel.I've tried it in several configurations and the one that is best for my bunny uses 5 of the panels to create three walls of her pen and uses my room's wall as the last wall of her pen. This way, there's room for her large litter box, a bunch of toys, her food plate and water bowls (she won't drink from a bottle!), and a Cottontail Cottage (best rabbit purchase ever -- [...]). She also still has room to hop about. I can leave her securely in the pen when I go to work and I can easily let her out when I come home. She has almost 48 sq. ft. of space to play. I use a shower board (from Home Depot) for the floor of her pen to protect the carpet underneath.)The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that one of the panels should be an adult-easily-operated door. It takes more effort than I'd like to open the pen to let my bunny out -- or to get inside to clean up her litter and hay.I definitely recommend this for rabbits, not just babies and dogs. My sister uses it to keep her toddler away from the TV/stereo/Christmas tree and she's been happy with it, too.
