review/summary: Fisher-Price Booster Seatreview/text: I bought this for my granddaughter. I have a small house and really don't have room for a high chair. This one is a perfect size and the tray isn't too high. It also folds up for travel. I expect Fisher-Price to make good quality at a reasonable price and they live up to their reputation.
