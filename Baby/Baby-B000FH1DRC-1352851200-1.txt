review/summary: For all you new parents out there....review/text: My baby girl didnt have any problems with them. But I wouldnt get too many of them. She was 6 pounds 2 oz when she was born and Id say that we only went through about 400 or so diapers before they were just too small. Its better to have a slightly larger diaper then a slightly smaller one... Good luck!! AND dont forget to have patience with the little babies :)
