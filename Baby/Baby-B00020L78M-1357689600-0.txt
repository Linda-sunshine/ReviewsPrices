review/summary: Welcome to the Cagereview/text: I purchased this so my nephew 2 years ago could start preparing for MMA fighting while he was still young. Welcome the Hexagon.Oh, wait this was safety device to keep him from going places he shouldn't go. Ever time my sisters family traveled and stayed in hotels or at my place they had this with them. Looked to be a good purchase and would do it again.This did have a cheapy plastic feel to it, but it has held up.
