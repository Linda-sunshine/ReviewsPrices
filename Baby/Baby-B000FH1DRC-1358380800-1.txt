review/summary: Unanimous approvalreview/text: My daughters and granddaughter all agree that this is the best disposable diaper around. On boys....no odd angle outside of the diaper accidents....on the girls more comfortable and form fitting! On either one, best coverage and protection. With no blow outs, and the design coloring does not bleed onto their outer clothes as in Huggies! All had sensitive skin, and outside of food acidity caused diaper rash,....there was no diaper rash for my grandchildren nor my great granddaughter!
