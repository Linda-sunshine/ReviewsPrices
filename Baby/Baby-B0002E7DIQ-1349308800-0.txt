review/summary: Worth every centreview/text: After reading many reviews I was excited but a little skeptical to purchase this pillow, especially when people complained about the seam. When I received the pillow I was amazed by the thickness and quality of the pillow. Some of the other brands I had looked at were very flimsy and thin. I've had this pillow for three nights now and so far I am very pleased. I probably use it a little differently then most people. I prop it up on a euro pillow to keep my head elevated because I am 7 months pregnant and I get heartburn if I am not elevated. When I lay on my back propped up I am so comfortable. The pillow sort of cocoons me and I feel very supported. Since I flip from my left to right side several times during the night, the U-shape has been really convenient in keeping my back supported and I can wrap my legs around the other side of the pillow so my hips don't hurt and my belly is supported. As for the seam, the only time I saw that it would be a problem is when I laid the pillow flat on my bed, laid on my side, and tried to sleep with one arm up under the top portion of the pillow. Only then did the seam sort of dig in to my shoulder. But I found using the pillow propped up to be way more comfortable anyway. So I say, try it out! You really can't put a price on a good night of sleep when you are pregnant.
