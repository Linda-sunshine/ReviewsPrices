review/summary: Use it all the time!review/text: I love using my Moby Wrap and have been using it since my son was an infant. I had to watch a vide on youtube to learn how to put it on...the instructions that come with it are great but I don't think I would be able to figure it out unless I had watched the video! I love how you can hold the baby laying down, facing you, facing away from you and on your hip. I've tried every position except the hip and since my son is almost 1 he likes facing out the best. I love how it wraps around your back so I don't get tired easily when holding my son. I will def use this product again on future kids!
