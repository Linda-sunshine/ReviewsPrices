review/summary: Must have!review/text: My mother got me this when my little girl started moving about. We have it (not connected at the ends) surrounding the living room and it keeps her securely in her safe space while I cook clean or do other house chores. Wish it did come with a gate though, stepping over it gets a little hard at the end of the night when she is still going but I am ready to fall over...lol...very colorful, takes away the doggie-pen appearance. Sturdy and easily adjusted, folded and carried around.
