review/summary: Great for those first few weeksreview/text: My son is breastfed and this was great to have in the hospital when the nurses keep bugging you about when you last fed your baby! It does not record how long the baby ate though so that was one thing I kept track of. I used this for the first month, but no longer use it. It did it's job when I needed it.
