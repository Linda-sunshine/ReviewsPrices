review/summary: Works great!review/text: We got two of these for my two children ages 5 and 2. I read the reviews about them breaking easily if dropped and with a 2 year old both of mine have been dropped and thrown and are both still working great. My 5 year old son loves his, it has helped a lot with his fear of the dark, my 2 year old daughter also loves hers, but doesn't use it at night because she would rather play with it than go to sleep. I like these much better than the pillow pets. These are a little bit bigger than the pillow pets, don't break easily, and my kids love turtles. Overall I would definitely recommend to a friend.
