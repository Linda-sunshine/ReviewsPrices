review/summary: Best carrier I usedreview/text: Originally bought the moby.. Was not confident in my wrapping ability, so I returned and bought this instead.Baby and I love it. He is almost 5 months now and we've been using since he was 4 weeks.It is comfortable, I can wear for long periods of time.Baby likes it more thank bjorn, bjorn seems impersonal, you and the baby are separated by this plastic foam thing..The only disadvantage to the ktan is it is difficult to bf in.Also- sizing.. I originally bought a small bit the baby was too low.. He wasn't forehead kissable.I agree, if u r between sizes, go smaller.
