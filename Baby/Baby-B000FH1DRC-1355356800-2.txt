review/summary: Buy a size up for overnightsreview/text: I was having trouble with my daughter leaking through diapers at night. I am not a big fan of waking her up and changing her all the time if I don't have to so I got the advice to size up and try that. I still get the occasional leak if she has been nursing a lot, but this has saved both my daughter and I a lot of sleep and that is priceless in these early months. I like the holes so that some of the poo can go through and not stay against her skin as much. Great quality diapers until baby starts solids.
