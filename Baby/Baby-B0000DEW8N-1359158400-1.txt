review/summary: Keep an extra one in the car trunkreview/text: We have one for our toddler to use instead of a high chair at home and we keep an extra one in the car for whenever we eat out. It makes it so we don't have to worry about his food getting everywhere, and he eats right off his tray so we don't worry about whether the table is sanitary or not. For some reason our hyper-active toddler ( usually wont sit in our laps or on a seat next to us for longer than a couple minutes) when sitting in this seat will miraculously calm down and is satisfied the whole extent of our meal. We don't ever feel rushed, which is truly a miracle. We even set it out when on a picnic or camping. Love this chair!!!
