review/summary: Basic travel bedreview/text: I really like the colors of this piece. It's definitely gender neutral and not baby pastel, which I've always hated. It feels very sturdy and safe. However this one does not have the handy reach through hole that allows you to collapse it without removing the bassinet layer. If you are going to be moving it from room to room when your LO is really little, I'd suggest finding one that has this feature. The toy bar on this is a joke. The little stars Velcro on and are not engaging at all. In fact if you look at them from the baby's angle they're even worse. The worst part of them is that there isn't even a loop so you can hang other toys; it is just a strip of fabric with Velcro on it. Overall, effective as a travel bed, good colors, but no frills.
