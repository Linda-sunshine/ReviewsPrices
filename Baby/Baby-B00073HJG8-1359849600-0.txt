review/summary: Did not end up usingreview/text: We did not end up using this hammock and just hung a shelf to hold his stuffed animals instead. It's not that he has too many stuffed animals as it is that this hammock really sags. I see now that the picture shows this, but our ceilings aren't high enough to prevent my 2 yr old from hanging from it. This may work in an older child's room.
