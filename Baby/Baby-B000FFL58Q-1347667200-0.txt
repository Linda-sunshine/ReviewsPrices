review/summary: My Son Loves Itreview/text: I wanted to have images from nature that would stimulate him, and he started using itat about 3 months. He really enjoys it, and it's been fascinating seeing how he has progressedfrom just staring at objects, to playing with them.I thought that the butterflies would rotate, and they do not. Also, there are more 'hooks' to put additional toys on, which I liked - although it comes with a number of them. took me a bit to figure out where the batteries went for the lights/sounds part - it's in the giraffe. (My Husband had taken it out of the box before I could read directions) Anyway, it's in the giraffe.The lights, when I lay under it, gave me a headache, but he likes them. I tend to not put themon that much, however I do put on the 'rain forrest' noises, and I think they are great. I like them more than the songs.The baby is very happy under it - I had another one that had farm animals and was a bit 'softer', and that one he could have cared less about.
