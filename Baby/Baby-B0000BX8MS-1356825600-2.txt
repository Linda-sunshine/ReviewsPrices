review/summary: Great for almost 1 year oldreview/text: We have been using the Halo sleepsacks since our daughter was about 5 weeks old. She no longer wanted to be swaddled but didnt but was too little to have a blanket just laid on her. When I ordered these sleepsacks they were a God Send. Both our children have always been great sleepers and with the sleep sack i know I can rest easy knowing she is safe and unlikely to smother herself at night and yet remains warm. We usually put a long sleeve onsie on her or a longsleeve shirt. She doesnt like to wear anything on her legs or feet i think because she likes how the inside is soft to the touch. We then just zip her up and she lays down and if she needs to stand up she rarely has a problem doing that even zipped up like a potato sack. She does so well with this sack i am afraid we will have to use it until she leaves home. When it is nap time just the act of putting it on her lets her know it is time to go to sleep. Highly recommend this to any parents looking for a safe way to keep babies warm or even in their sleep training.
