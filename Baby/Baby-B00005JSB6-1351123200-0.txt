review/summary: Better than Pampers, no more diaper blowoutsreview/text: I was using Pampers exclusively for the first 6 months and my baby started having blowouts 2 to 3 times a day. I decided to try something else. I'm so glad I gave this a try, now we deal with blowouts 2 to 3 times a week. Makes me happy.
