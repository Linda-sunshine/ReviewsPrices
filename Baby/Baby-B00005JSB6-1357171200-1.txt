review/summary: Huggies Snug and Dry Diapersreview/text: My daugther just turned two and still wears the size 3 diapers. I have bought other brands but Huggies seem to hold up the best. I either buy them online with subscribe and save to save a few bucks or go down to costco when they are on sale. Some of the cheaper brands have ripped when I was putting the diaper straps on. I don't think I've ever had leaking problems with Huggies or breaking of the little straps.CJB
