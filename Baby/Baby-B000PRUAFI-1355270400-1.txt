review/summary: The perfect gate!review/text: I got this gate in white for my small dog. I wanted vertical bars that he couldn't climb. The gate has worked out perfectly. It is easy to install (I did not use the screws) and so simple to open and close. I like that it will close automatically or stay open if opened all the way. Plus, it has a nice clean look. I am so pleased with this purchase, I bought another for a different doorway.
