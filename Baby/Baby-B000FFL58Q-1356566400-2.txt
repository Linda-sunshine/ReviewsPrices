review/summary: This thing ROCKS!review/text: We put this on our registry because it looked fun and got a lot of good reviews, and I am so grateful that we did. This play mat/gym is fantastic! My daughter loves all of the things dangling from it (the monkey is currently her favorite), the rain forest sounds don't drive me bonkers like the music on a lot of other infant toys, its soft and comfy AND the mat, itself, is machine washable.I'd recommend this to any momma (or papa) out there. Its so much fun for baby!
