review/summary: By far my favorite diapersreview/text: As a mom & pediatric nurse, the pampers baby dry are by far my go to diaper. They are able to be worn overnight for 12-14 hours with no leaks. My child has never had a diaper rash from these either. There have been times when I've tried other brands & always come back to the baby dry. In addition, I use the amazon mom which makes things very easy with quick delivery.
