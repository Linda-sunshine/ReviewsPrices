review/summary: Back saver!review/text: This one is a back saver! I loved that I had support for my back on both sides. Pre-pregnancy I slept on my back and so needed some support for my back when I needed to start sleeping on my side once pregnant. Now (I am 8 months preg), I sleep on my left or right side and it is super helpful to have support on both sides and easily flip in the night. Also early on, I was afraid what if I accidently went to my stomach or back in my sleep and did not realize it? This product helps you with that as it completely snugs you around. BTW - I am 5-2 and sleep with my head on a normal pillow and the closed (contured end) near my feet. I snug the sides around me. The closed end was a bit too high for my neck (so giving one star less). Also the cover is painful to remove and put back on when you have to wash it (thankfully DH dutifully does that :-) )
