review/summary: pet gate is the BESTreview/text: I am so glad I chose this model. I love everything about it.It was easy to install.The gate will automatically close if you want it to( or stay open.)I can open it with one hand.With the 2 extensions supplied you have a lot of latitude in width adjustment. For my doorway I had to leave one of the screw adjusters completely off.I am going to buy another one for another doorway.
