review/summary: Fun but annoying!review/text: We were graciously given this as a Christmas present. My daughter is almost 11 months and has been pulling up to stand and cruising for a while now. The walker feature is fun, especially for us to see, but it slides very quickly on our time floor making it unsafe. When she wanted to use it to stand it moved so fast she fell down and that was on our rug. So that's a con. The colors and types of toys are good for learning- like the door opening and the crank wheels. However I want to smack this toy because if she doesn't play with it, it still plays the annoying welcome sing over and over as well as some other sounds. I found my way to this review because I was looking to see if it was a malfunction, but apparently it's a "feature" of the toy. Someone else mentioned the volume, it's only too loud because it doesn't stay quiet when not in use. I have to turn it off so then when she wants to go back to it, inevitably it's off. So yeah, that's annoying! Knowing what I know I would not purchase this for someone, however my daughter does like it.
