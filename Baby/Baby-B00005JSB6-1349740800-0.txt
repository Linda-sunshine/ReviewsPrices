review/summary: these diapers are not a great fitreview/text: I didn't really like these diapers compared to others. I'm not sure what the difference really is but I feel that these diapers are not a great fit for my son. These diapers were given to us by a family friend who said they tried them on their daughter who is also 4 months old and they leaked on them.
