review/summary: Love this, watch the pricereview/text: I bought this while I was pregnant for only $37 here on Amazon! So happy we got such a great deal. You gotta watch the prices, they can change at any moment so if you see it for a decent price, don't wait. This playmat is very cute and has so much for them to look at and play with. I love it and my little girl is just starting to become interested in grabbing/swatting things at 2 1/2 months.
