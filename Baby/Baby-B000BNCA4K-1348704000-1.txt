review/summary: My Baby Boy's Favorite Toy!review/text: I bought this for my son when he was 3 1/2 months old based on the wonderful reviews on Amazon. Wow! This is the perfect toy for my son. He absolutely adores it and he plays with it all the time. It keeps his attention for so long because he can easily grab it and manipulate it from any angle. There are so many different places to grab this that no matter where it falls in his car seat he can easily get it. He brings it to his mouth and loves to bite the rings. There is a very gentle rattle inside of it that chimes along with his play. His adorable little face just lights up as soon as I give him his Winkel! Also, I love that I can wash it very easily in warm soapy water and there are no little places for water to hide or get icky.
