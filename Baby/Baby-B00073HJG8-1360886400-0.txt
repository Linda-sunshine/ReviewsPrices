review/summary: Perfectreview/text: There is a jumbo toy hammock and a smaller toy hammock by the same maker. I read the reviews and bought the jumbo toy hammock. If you are looking for a hammock that will hold a HUGE amount of stuffed animals up off the bed, this is perfect. This is indeed a jumbo toy hammock.This came with the mounting screws and was very easy to install. It seems to hold up quite well to being piled high with stuffed animals. The sides that go flush with the wall are both a little bit elastic so they stretch and give as you load this hammock up with animals.Well worth the money.Enjoy.
