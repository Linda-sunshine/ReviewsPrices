review/summary: the bigger they get, the less quality I see...review/text: I will say up front, I totally stand by these diapers. They have 'swaddled' my daughter for the past 7 months, and more or less done a great job. But, my main complaint is simply quality. When we were buying newborn, or size 1 diapers, we maybe had 1 diaper out of hundreds that had some kind of defect, one every few boxes. A missing tab, or velcro strap, etc. As we moved into size 2 diapers, we started seeing it more... sometimes 3-4 per box of 200. Then we started seeing issues with the length of the straps or tabs, and some diapers that would have no straps at all in the size 3's. These are simply unusable, and I have to throw them away, further polluting our environment for no real reason. I'm not sure if there's something at the manufacturing level that has changed, or if there is simply a higher incidence of defective diapers in a certain few batches that got shipped to Amazon. But I certainly hope it gets resolved. I can't imagine somehow continuing this trend and ending up with a few dozen or more defective diapers in a single box when I get up to the size 4's. I guess we'll see when the time comes.
