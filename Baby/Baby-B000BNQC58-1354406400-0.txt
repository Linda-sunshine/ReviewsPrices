review/summary: Be prepared to change the batteries every two days!review/text: We bought this turtle for my three-year-old, and he LOVES it! In fact, he loves it so much that he uses it night after night...which means I end up replacing the three AAA batteries, literally, every two to three days. I tried using rechargeable batteries as a means to save money, but, of course, they didn't last as long as Energizer or Duracell batteries. We then bought a DreamLite doggy, and it lasted several months before needing new batteries. So, yes, this turtle is great, but only if you don't mind the cost and inconvenience of replacing batteries multiple times a week (and, if you have a young child, you know how obnoxious it is to fuss with something like batteries right at bedtime).
