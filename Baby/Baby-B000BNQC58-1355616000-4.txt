review/summary: Highly Recommended, just wish you could toggle the automatic shut off...review/text: I really love this turtle, and so does my daughter, who is now 3. I bought this turtle when I was pregnant with her, and she has used it nearly every night since birth. I like that there are choices for the color of the lights. The green and blue are brighter, and the amber provides a more subtle glow. I love that this is a no fuss device; no sounds, not too bright. What I don't like is having to get up in the middle of the night to turn it back on when my daughter falls asleep and it shuts off. I get that the company intended for it to conserve power, and the batteries always last a while when I put new ones in, but I wish there was an option to keep it on all night and just plug it into a wall. That would have made this product absolutely perfect, but as it is, I am looking for a new item to replace Mr. Turtle because I am tired of waking up at 3 AM to a toddler screaming bloody murder. Cloud B, if you released a new version of this item with the option I suggested, I would snatch it up in a heartbeat.
