review/summary: Daughter Loves It!review/text: Bought this for my daughter's new &#34;Beach Themed&#34; bedroom and she absolutely loves it! Contrary to some of the reviews I read it fills the entire room with clearly visible stars in even a semi-dark room. Since this is to be used at night it's just fine.
