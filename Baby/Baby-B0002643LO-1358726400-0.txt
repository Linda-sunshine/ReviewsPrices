review/summary: Good depending how fast your baby growsreview/text: Pampers has always been the best for our family with no leaks, no diaper rash, and happy babies. But my babies seem to be in size 3 seems for only a short time as they grow very fast. So 222 count was too much for only a few weeks in the size by the time it arrived.
