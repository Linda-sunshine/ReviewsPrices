review/summary: We love Twilight Turtle!review/text: We first bought this turtle four our 1-year-old son as a gift, and he loved it immediately! The stars show beautifully and cover most of the ceiling without being so bright it interferes with sleeping. It is extremely soothing and creates a haven-like feel in the room. I wish I'd had one of these when I was a kid, I would have slept a lot better! Five years and two more kids later, I can say that all three of my children adore Twilight Turtle and he is an essential nighttime companion. After five years with three small kiddos, he has taken a lot of unintentional abuse and held up very well considering. I will be getting one for each of our kiddos now. I cannot recommend this product enough!
