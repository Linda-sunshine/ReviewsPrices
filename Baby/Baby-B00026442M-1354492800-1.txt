review/summary: Avoid these diapers unless your baby does not movereview/text: Terrible diapers. We normally buy the cruisers and I accidentally purchased the baby dry diapers. The diapers continually leak! Even when they have been worn for short periods of time, they really can only hold a small amount of urine if your child is at all mobile.
