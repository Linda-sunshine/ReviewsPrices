review/summary: Perfectreview/text: The wrap came just as described. It is very long and intimidating when first unwrapped. I read the instructions and found it very easy to set up. I can wrap it up in a few seconds after the first time. Its real easy. If I did it too tight or loose I just start over. Its great for around the house. I would suggest something else for trips but this is amazing for the home and I love having my baby so close.
