review/summary: Vtech Learning Walkerreview/text: The Vtech Walker made a great birthday present for my one year old. At first he had a difficult time with the wheels moving to fast but within a week he had learned to control the speed. I would not recommend this product for children younger than one who are just learning how to stand. For a one year old or a child who can stand and take a few steps it is a great toy.
