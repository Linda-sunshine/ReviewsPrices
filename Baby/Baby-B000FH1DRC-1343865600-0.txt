review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I really liked swaddles size 1 but now I am using size 3 and they leak every-time my son poops and many times when he pees. This was the last time I used Pampers brand. The back of the diapers lacks padding. It thin like a sheet of paper. When my baby poops, it is all over his back and sometimes shoulders. I do not recommend these diapers.
