review/summary: Great Fitreview/text: My almost 3 year old is daytime potty trained but still wears a diaper at night. These have held up great for her and I have not noticed any leaks. She is 33lbs and on the tall side and these fit great. She also has not had any issues with rashes and anything from these. I prefer huggies to other brands, especially prefer that there isn't a heavy scent with these. I am pregnant again and will continue to use these with the next baby.
