review/summary: So great, I ordered a second one!review/text: GREAT product. Strong, sturdy, easy to install! My one year old hangs on it, tugs on it, tries to break through it and it doesn't budge. We have one in her nursery door (so I can keep her door open but keep her contained) and one separating the kitchen and living room. We have wide doorways but I only had to use one side of one extension so far. Great gates! Highly recommend!
