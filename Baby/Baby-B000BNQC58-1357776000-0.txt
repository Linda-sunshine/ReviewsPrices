review/summary: love love love thisreview/text: I got this for my kids for Christmas. They are ages 6,4,2,and 6 months. They love it! I have even tried it in my room and the stars are just the right dimness. As an adult night lights are too bright for me, but these had the perfect amount of dimness. I also like how it turns off after a while. This was a very good buy.
