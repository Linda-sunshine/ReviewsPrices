review/summary: Good price and they came right to my doorreview/text: These were a good price and came right to my door. I like using Pampers the best because my infant son seems to have fewer accidents that stain his clothes with this brand (to put it less delicately-- the liquid poop stays where it should!).It's nice to have these bulky items come right to the house. When the shipping is free, why bother lugging this stuff from the store?
