review/summary: Best new babysitterreview/text: The look on our baby's face when we first put him in this jumper and turned on the sounds/lights was a moment we will never forget. We had put him in a couple jumpers at friends' homes and we knew he was ready for his own. He has used it nearly every day this past month and he still loves it as much as he did the first day. Now that he's growing he is better able to rotate by himself to the different "stations". He has a very short attention span normally but when in this jumper he stays entertained for 30-45 minutes normally. On a flat playmat or with other toys he generally only stays content for 5-15 minutes. It also gets the added bonus of being a sort of baby leash. Now that he can roll around and shift around the room I can't leave him unattended in certain spaces (think sewing room), but it's relatively easy and light to transport to a room and then he has fun AND stays in place. Perfect!Check out my other baby item reviews to see what items we love and hate. And be sure to let me know if my reviews help you in your decisions to buy!
