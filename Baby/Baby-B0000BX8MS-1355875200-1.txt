review/summary: No chemical flame retardantsreview/text: I was relieved to find the Halo wearable blanket was not treated with chemical flame retardant, as are most fleece PJs for infants and toddlers. I confirmed this with the company (which kindly replied to my query). My son can wear regular cotton PJs under this sleepsack and stay warm for the winter. And I can rest easier knowing it's not treated with harmful chemicals. The XL fits just right for him at 20 months.
