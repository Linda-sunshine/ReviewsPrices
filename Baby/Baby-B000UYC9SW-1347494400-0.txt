review/summary: Life saver.review/text: My newborn had a difficult time transitioning to life outside the womb. I was happy to carry her around the house and out and about in a one-shoulder style sling, but my back loudly protested. Enter the Baby K'tan. It distributes baby's weight over both shoulders and my back, and keeps her very secure. She loves it, too, and happily spends hours lounging or napping snuggled next to my heart!Pros:Simple to wear and put baby in with one handStylish: I receive compliments daily and parents and grandparents always ask the brandCons:100% cotton makes it a little tight after a trip through the dryer, but it stretches out after a few wearings.
