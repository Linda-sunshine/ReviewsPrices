review/summary: Wonderful nighttime accessoryreview/text: We have a 2 and a half year old.My daughter loves this turtle we bought it along with the book that goes with it. I talked it up for 2 days while waiting on it and she was squealing with delight when the package came to the door. It just happened to be nap time. We took her into her room and read her the story as I figured out how to pull the turtle out of the packaging. She has darkening curtains in her room or it would have been really hard to see the lights. You can't see the stars during the daytime in our brighter living room. She loves to carry him around and tells us how you have to be careful with him. She kisses his head and turns his light to the different colors. So far while I was concerned that this purchase would be more gimmick than actual usefulness this was the perfect purchase for our child. She is now going to bed without crying about having to go since she gets to spend time with her turtle. She is already used to sleeping in her own bedroom and bed, but this would have been a great accessory for making that transition.
