review/summary: Wonderful and Versatile and I'm NOT pregnant !review/text: I admit I was hesitant because of some of the reviews mentioning that seam. I almost bought the candy cane shaped pillow instead, but really glad I chose this one ! I cannot sleep with a head pillow period and was planning on using the open end for my head and neck. This pillow is so versatile ! I can sleep in the middle and turn side to side, or sleep on either side . I can put my feet on the closed side so my ankles are raised. I especially love that more than one person can use it at the same time. Great for watching tv with the family. The middle section is great if you have an older child that is super squirmy and all over the bed when they sleep. I have six kids and never had a body pillow when I was pregnant then, so I'm making up for lost pillow love. If I think of any more uses I'll come back and write more.
