review/summary: Because a new parent can't remember everythingreview/text: When was the last time ...? Itzbeen will tell you. Loved this when my kids were newborn, and am still using it now when they need to take medications at set intervalls, or fever reducers at least x hours apart. Being able to track 4 items separately, and having an alarm really helps to make sure things like feedings, diaper changes or medications happen on time. Love it. I am giving it to all my friends who are having babies.
