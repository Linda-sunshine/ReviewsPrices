review/summary: Love it, but....review/text: I own a graco pack n play myself and I love it! It is so convenient to have, you can store your diapers in it, use it as a bassinet and a changing table! I bought this kind for my friend who said she didn't need the changing table. She said it is wonderful and she loves it, HOWEVER, she told me to tell consumers when I review the product that the DIRECTIONS ARE TERRIBLE. She said that the directions do not apply to all pack and plays and some parts are made for certain pack and plays and she said it did not explain which ones. She said the Graco Pack N Play makers need to learn how to right specific directions for the CORRECT product.OTher than that it is wonderful and I recommend and she does to to anyone wanting to purchase it.:)
