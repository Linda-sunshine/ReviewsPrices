review/summary: Averagereview/text: This chair is certainly comfortable and price wise it's great! The only thing that bothers me is that when you glide and you are leaning with your back on it too, it makes a clicking sound with every glide. From experience most gliders do that , I was hoping this one didn't. Otherwise it's a good glider.
