review/summary: The perfect giftreview/text: I gave this to some friends who just had a baby. Their experiences with it have all been good. Babies, apparently, like it when you hold them. Holding them usually takes hands, but this baby carrier does the whole holding part and suddenly dishes and other basic tasks become possible. Apart from free hands, my friends mentioned that adjusting and fitting the carrier straps was easy. The only downside is that if the baby does not want in he can make it difficult to use, but this does not sound like a defect which can be held against the product designer as much as it can be held against the baby.My friends' baby is still more interested in looking at his parents, but when he really starts checking out the world they like the idea that he can be turned around to look at what they are doing.A perfect baby shower gift, but for very young or small babies note that there is a minimum weight of 8 lbs.
