review/summary: Infant to Toddler Rockerreview/text: My oldest is now 4 1/2, but we got all of his "extra furniture"(highchair, bouncer, jumperoo, swing, and mobile) from the Fisher-Price "Precious Planet" line. We were mostly satisfied with all of them. (We hated the swing...seemed like our little one was always about to fall out). The bouncer was well used by my first two, so it needed to be replaced with our third one on the way. That is mostly due to the fact that I tripped over that old one...while holding my newborn! Thankfully, my baby wasn't hurt, but it bruised me horribly. It hurt worse than one would imagine! It bent it to the point that it was a pain to use anymore. It was a HUGE tripping hazard, and I don't recommend it. THIS one(although a rocker and not a bouncer) is not the same tripping hazard, and I love it!It seems like bouncers are one of those things that are extremely useful, but not for long. Little ones seem to outgrow them so quickly. I adore the fact that this one converts to a toddler rocker, so we get longer use out of it. This is especially appealing since we are not having anymore. I think most of us will feel like we're getting our money's worth when our little one can use it longer! My 1 year old(almost 2) has already been sitting in it, and loves it. I'm trying not to let him use it too much, though, because it is "baby brother's".Another feature I like is the "kickstand" It helps the rocker to lay flat. My first son slept in his bouncer for the first year and a half of his life(he was extremely premature and small). I like this kickstand feature, just in case our newest little one ends up sleeping any in this rocker. (I like having options when it comes to getting a bit of sleep).Overall, I have no reason to not recommend this rocker. We love it so far!
