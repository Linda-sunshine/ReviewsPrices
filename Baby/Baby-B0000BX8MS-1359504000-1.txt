review/summary: Great transition from a swaddlereview/text: I transitioned my son to the HALO sleep sack when he was 4 months old and he did great! We were swaddling him before and found it to be an easy transition. The sleep sack has a v-neck top so that it is not to close to baby's face. My baby does check on the bottom sometimes when he is rolling around his bed. The material has become a little frayed from washing it a lot but overall it's a great product!
