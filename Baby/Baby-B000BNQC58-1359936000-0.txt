review/summary: Really fantastic....review/text: we have two of these and even as an adult, I love lying next to my kids and looking up at the stars. It's pretty bright, plus it's good incentive for your kids to accept a darker room. They sleep better once the stars go out after 30 minutes. In honesty, I strapped this to our ceiling fan in our living room, turned it on low and had a makeshift disco ball for an after-dinner dance party. It was really sweet. Of course, if you try this, use some common sense. You could damage your ceiling fan, and the centrifugal force will likely send the turtle flying off and injuring someone...so one second thought, I don't recommend trying that. It was a pretty stupid/awesome thing to do.Anyway, my kids love it. Anyone that complains that the stars aren't bright enough, probably have too much ambient light in the room. After your eyes adjust, this little thing puts out more than enough light to see around the room. Highly recommended.
