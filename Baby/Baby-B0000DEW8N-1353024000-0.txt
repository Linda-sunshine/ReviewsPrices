review/summary: perfect and easyreview/text: We ordered this as an emergency back-up once we realized that the wooden high chair we had was way too big for our son. This was the perfect choice - we didn't want a big high chair (we already have one, and just needed to bridge the time span until he can use it) and this little chair is ideal. It fits perfectly onto our kitchen chair, it's simple to clean, it's adjustable, and for being plastic isn't bad looking either. We definitely recommend this, on all counts - the perfect high chair!
