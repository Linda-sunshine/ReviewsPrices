review/summary: Great Gate!review/text: This gate has worked great for us! When our little guy started crawling we determined that we needed a gate for the bathroom, because the litter box for the the cat is there. Every time I turned around that's where the little guy was headed. So we did some research and found this gate. It is easy to open with one hand, it swings closed or locks open, it doesn't pinch little fingers and is strong enough to withstand pushing from the little guy. We are so glad to have it!
