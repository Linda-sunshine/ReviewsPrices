review/summary: Good deal!review/text: What can I say, these are Pampers, the best brand out there in a disposable diaper. Every now and then I surprise my daughter with one of these giant boxes, and needless to say, she's happy. And they are a great deal through Amazon. I try to buy them through Warehouse Deals whenenever I can - the box might be a little beat up, but diapers are separately packaged inside, so they are just fine.
