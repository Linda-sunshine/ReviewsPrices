review/summary: The single best toy we have for our 7-month old - by farreview/text: Our baby has spent at least an hour in her jumperoo EVERY DAY for the last two months. That's an hour of fully-occupied, squealing-with-delight, happily-exercising baby. If she hasn't been in it in a while, she holds out her little arms towards it asking to go in. It's safe, good for her, and she loves it. What's not to like??A tip - she used to be too short to reach the floor, so we put a big pillow down under it.
