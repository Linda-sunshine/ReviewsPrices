review/summary: Need to put a picture to show the gate is like BENT before installationreview/text: This gate is good design and valuable. But I really hate that they didn't put some instruction in the book and just put the caution in a sticker so most people will miss it ( because you will think that's some bullshit just like " don't leave your kid unattended" and don't read it)When I open the package I am so surprised the gate is bent. I try my best to see if I could "fix" but I just give up because the bent is too much. While I packing it up I suddenly saw that caution on the sticker. Then I Need to reopen everything again. I guess some people have the same experience as me. This is why I just give 4 stars. For the design I will give 6 stars.
