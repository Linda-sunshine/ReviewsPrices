review/summary: Love Love Love the Moby Wrap.review/text: I recently gave birth to my second child, and Ive been looking for something to carry my son in that will leave me hands free, but also feel sturdy and safe. I had a baby bjorn when my daughter was a baby but I didnt like it. It was to stiff and it killed my back. After some research I decided to give the Moby Wrap a try, and Im SO glad I did. The material is very soft, and the booklet that comes with give step by step instructions for all the ways it can be worn. I personally like the Kangaroo hold the best, because its the easiest one for me to get into without help from anyone else. The wrap is very long and can seem kind of overwhelming when you first open it up, but just take a deep breath and try all the different wrap styles to find the one that easiest for you and most comfy for your baby :)
