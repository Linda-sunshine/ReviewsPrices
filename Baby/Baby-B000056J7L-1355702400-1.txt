review/summary: Favorite for potty trainingreview/text: We have been through a few different potty chairs, and this particular model from Baby Bjorn is our favorite! It is big enough and sturdy enough so that it doesn't get knocked around by toddlers, but also not too big or obnoxious to look at. It doesn't have the lights and sounds some of the others do, but we had those and a) they broke and b) our kids lost interest in them after a few weeks anyway.
