review/summary: we love it...the pups, not so muchreview/text: I'm no mechanical engineer and yet it took me 10 minutes to install the first one, with both extensions, and even less to install the second. My wife said...wow, that was fast. It's completely intuitive. You don't even need directions.The gates are perfect for containing our two Havanese puppies while allowing us complete freedom to travel back and forth. There really is no actual assembly required and getting these gates up and going is a piece of cake.You lift the gate to open and it swings closed on its own via the power of gravity. We love 'em. The pups, not so much. :)There are already many reviews describing the details of this gate and I found them very useful in helping to determine which gate to purchase.
