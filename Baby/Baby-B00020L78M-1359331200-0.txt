review/summary: Buy one for upstairs, another for downstairsreview/text: That's right, I have two. I might could use a third one. I also bought one as a gift for someone. I would only use the product in the hexagon configuration pictured, but other ways are also possible. The price seems high, for what is essentially six pieces of plastic, molded into a basic shape, but a secure area for your child to safely and independently play is priceless. The hinges are also very basic. It feels like you're forcing it when you unfold it from the box. They don't function in the way I would expect pressured hinges to, but so far, no breakage. Colorful and portable, a quality purchase.
