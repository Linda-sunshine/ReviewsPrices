review/summary: Great for a play yardreview/text: I bought this item for my grandson.. I use it when I babysit. I would not recommend it if you use it for his primary sleeping place. It needs a much thicker mattress which a purchased. It seems to be sturdy enough. My grandson is two months old so I have not used it for a play yard yet.
