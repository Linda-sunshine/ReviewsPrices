review/summary: Great Buy!review/text: I got this for my daughter last year for Christmas. She's now 18 months and is still playing with it. It's great for a little one not walking, learning to walk or already walking. She played with it before we added the legs for several months. She's running now and we've removed the legs again and she still loves it.
