review/summary: Great Offer, not so great for Babyreview/text: I bought this for my new niece and thought it was a great offer. The diaper didn't do a great job of contain all of her mess and there was quite a bit of seepage. I recommend going with the Swaddlers, they are a tad bit more expensive but worth every penny
