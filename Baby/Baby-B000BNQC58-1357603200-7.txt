review/summary: My son loves this, best sleeping aid everreview/text: What a great idea and he loves the fact that he can choose different colors. What is really great is the fact that the light automatically goes out after 45 minutes. This is very light and feels quite fragile buts its already been dropped several times and is working just fine.
