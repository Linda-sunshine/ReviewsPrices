review/summary: Not so pliable but it does the job. . ...review/text: This is a brightly colored, inviting play-yard. It does what it needs to do by corraling little ones into a designated play area. However, it's hard plastic and not very pliable. It only folds ONE way but that's not really clear, since either way you try to fold it is met with resistance and just feels wrong. Thus, I used it once and the plastic snapped when I attempted to put it away. When it breaks, it's dangerous because the plastic is so hard and creates jagged edges. Thus, the extension gates I bought to make it bigger, actually served as replacement parts. I will leave it set-up all the time now and let it do the job for which it was intended!
