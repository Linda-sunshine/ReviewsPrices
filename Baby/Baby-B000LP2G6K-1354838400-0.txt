review/summary: dangerous & poor qualityreview/text: i bought this pack n play for travel & to leave at my in laws house when they baby sit my 6 month old baby. we first noticed that the mattress does not lay flat, it slopes to one side, it is not very firm & overall seems very flimsy.most alarming to us was that my son got hurt rubbing his foot a little while on the extremely rough fabric mesh on the side causing a considerable amount of bleeding. we will no longer use this pack n play for fear of him getting hurt. when i spoke to a representative from graco they said the best they could do is refund the cost of the pack n play once they have it back in their possession. unfortunately, i do not live in the united states & they will not pay for the shipping to get it back to them.we have in our home another graco pack n play that is made better, stronger, the mesh is much softer & my son has never hurt himself in it.
