review/summary: helps keep track of contractionsreview/text: Nice gadget for first time parents for the first two (stressful) weeks. It helped us keep track of contractions prior to birth. After that...mm. Soon you will trust your intuition and common sense: when the baby needs to be fed she will let you know. When a diaper change is due: you'll know too (diaper is wet/ heavy or full). Good luck with birth and caring fo your babies..hope all goes well.
