review/summary: Leaks a lot! Keeps baby really messy, not dry and clean!!review/text: I hate these diapers! Always leaks even at day time! Poop would always come out, as in every time my son poops! Whenever we go out i make sure my son has 2-3 sets of xtra clothes coz he is always messed up! Im sooo disappointed in pampers! I eould rather use cheap brands or rather switch back to my trusted huggies diapers.
