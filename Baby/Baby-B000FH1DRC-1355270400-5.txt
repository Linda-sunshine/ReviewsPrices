review/summary: Monthly subscriberreview/text: Those looking for great gifts for a new baby, I have done this twice..monthly diapers for a year for grandchildren. It is the gift that keeps on giving and parents have one less thing to stress about! Amazon subscribe and save lets you know monthly, and this was enough diapers for the whole month. Notify you by e-mail, when the shipment is being sent in case size change is needed. Bothe times the parents were very greatful and we got them a baby gift that was greatly appreciated.
