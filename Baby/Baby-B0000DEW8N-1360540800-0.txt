review/summary: Wonderful booster!review/text: If this was made in the USA instead of Mexico, I would have given it 5 stars.Didn't want to spend a lot of money since we only watch our grandson once a week, however, we wanted something functional and nice and this is it. We didn't want a large bulky highchair that would take up a lot of room mostly sitting in the corner of our kitchen. This booster with tray is exactly right for our needs. We can use the tray or take the tray off and push him up to our table. It is portable, which is great when we are on the go since we don't like using public highchairs and boosters due to all the germs!
