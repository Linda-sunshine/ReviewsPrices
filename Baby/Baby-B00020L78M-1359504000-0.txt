review/summary: Exactly what I wanted and excellent customer servicereview/text: This is perfect.It arrived with minor damage from shipping. There was a hole punched in the box and there was minor damage to one of the panels. I contacted customer service and they shipped me a new panel no questions asked.Love it. Love the customer service. I would not hesitate to order from this company again.Oh and the playpen works great too. I can fold it up and move it around the house really easily and my daughter stays safely in the area without any fuss.
