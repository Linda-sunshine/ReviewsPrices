review/summary: Love Pampers!review/text: My son is almost five months and I have been using Pampers since day 1. They fit great and have good absorbancy. Someone had given me some Huggies as a shower gift and he kept leaking through them. It was very helpful to have the wetness indicator when he was really little.
