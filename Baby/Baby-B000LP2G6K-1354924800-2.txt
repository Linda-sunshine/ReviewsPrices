review/summary: THIS IS WORTH BUYING!!!!!review/text: Seriously this is a great buy! it's very solid my 5 months old baby still sleep in it. I found my 2 year old son standing in the bassinet twice and it did'nt break. Besides all that it's beautiful, love the color and the size. I would recommend this product to anyone.
