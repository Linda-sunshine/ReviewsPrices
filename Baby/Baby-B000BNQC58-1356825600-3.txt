review/summary: My son's nightlightreview/text: I bought this product before my son was born. I loved the way it looked and the idea of the stars/ cresent moon on the ceiling. My son didn't really give notice to it till after he was one. He's now 21 months old and can say stars and points to them before he goes to bed. We lay him down in his toddler bed with some milk and turn it on. Ours has four buttons on the edge of the shell. One for green, blue, and amber color lights. The fourth button makes all the colors rotate through. It will stay on for 15-20 minutes then turns off on its own. Overall my son loves it and I enjoy it too.
