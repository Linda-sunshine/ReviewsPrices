review/summary: Lovely product, just not as versatile as I'd like.review/text: This thing is great. Very comfy once it's on, and it holds the baby really well. However, it wasn't exactly intuitive to put together, and it was too small for my son when I bought it. (Compared to the ErgoBaby which, with the infant insert, held him from birth to 18 months.)Lovely product, just not as versatile as I'd like.
