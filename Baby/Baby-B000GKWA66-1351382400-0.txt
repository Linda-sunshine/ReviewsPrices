review/summary: Thanks for waking my kid up...review/text: I love the concept and look of the Sleep Sheep, but there are a couple of features that I don't care for. Firstly, the sheep is on a 25 or 45 minute timer (which may work for some kids) but I really need something that runs all night. My baby wakes up as soon as it goes off. Plus, the only sound that is continuous (like a whooshing, and the only I can stand listening to since he sleeps in our room) is the rain setting. (Mother's heartbeat is just creepy... not conceptually, just this particular version) The other sounds are obnoxious and distracting- especially the whales, though my husband likes them. I guess I should have just used my current alarm clock on rain setting all night. Lastly, it needs to be much louder! All that said, I do use it- and could see other families having no problems. At $30 or whatever, it is worth the "gamble."
