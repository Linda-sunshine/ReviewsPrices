review/summary: Must havereview/text: I can't say enough about this product. I got it for my daughter when she was just 2 and a half months. At first she did not seem to enjoy much, probably she was too small.She fall to sleep whenever i put her in there. When she was three months she start to enjoy it so much. I guess baby didnt want to lay down or be hold all the time.This Jumperoo support her body in standing position so she learn how to jump and balance herself very well. While she is enjoying her jumperoo, I able to do some small cleaning around the house.
