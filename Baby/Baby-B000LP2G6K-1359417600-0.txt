review/summary: Super easy to put togetherreview/text: This pack in play is simple which is exactly what I wanted. It is easy to clip the bassinet (upper level) in. You can also remove it easily. I will only use the pad that came with the pack n play because the Graco instruction manual specifically says not to use a separately purchased mattress. Graco doesn't make a 3 in. mattress for pack n play. I realize that many people choose to purchase the 3 in. mattress separately to place on top of the standard pad for added comfort. I will instead use a quilted pack n play pad under a jersey or flannel sheet on the pad that came with the pack play. You'll want to use a flannel or jersey knit fitted pack n play sheet because these type of sheets are soft. Other cotton pack n play sheets are scratchy and only 200 thread count. The pack n play pad measures approximately 26.5 x 36.5 x 1.
