review/summary: Good purchasereview/text: I purchased this baby carrier after I purchased the Ergo Baby Organic baby carrier and the Baby Bjorn performs much better. The Baby Bjorn carrier can pull on your neck & lower back if worn too long or while walking uphill so be careful to take breaks or rest periodically.
