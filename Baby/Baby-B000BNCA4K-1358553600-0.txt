review/summary: Must have toy.review/text: I am picky about what toys I buy my baby because I don't want to just buy toys and then her not use - thats a waste of money. This winket is worth the money -- she loved this as young as 2 months because its pretty light and easy to hold. She's 4 months and still is into the winket. Colors are fun. and the square in the middle rattles.
