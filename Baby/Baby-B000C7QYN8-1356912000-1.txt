review/summary: Thinreview/text: I love Seventh Generation products and this one certainly does the job you need it to however I had to use more wipes than I would with a thicker product and therefore ran out sooner. This is a fall back option for me if the thicker brand I buy is not on sale. I buy cruelty free in case you're curious about my brand loyalty and preference.
