review/summary: Comfy but lackingreview/text: I've had this pillow for about 3 months. It does what it is marketed to do and is quite comfortable in almost all positions.Cons:*Not thick enough. It flattens too quickly.*It should come with an additional pillow case or come in a different color. The casing is difficult to remove and replace after cleaning.
