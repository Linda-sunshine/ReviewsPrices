review/summary: Newer design not as goodreview/text: I used to love these diapers. They fit our son great (he is 50th percentile height, 20th percentile weight). They actually fit him better than the little movers since he was so thin, they are a little more snug around the legs than littler movers or pampers (we get leaks with pampers, I think due to his body shape). However, the most recent shipment was a slightly different design (tabs were square edges not rounded, material felt a little different, more papery) and we had several diapers rip, and several where the tabs just came off when we were trying to put the diaper on. (It wasn't a ton, but 15 or so out of the 156 count box is more than I am okay with). I'm not sure if it is a permanent change to the diaper design or if we just received a bad batch.
