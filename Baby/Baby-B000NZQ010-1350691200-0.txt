review/summary: Great toy for toddlersreview/text: This is my sons favortite toy. He has had this toy for about two years and still plays with it. His little brother had started playing with it also. They love all of the activities on the front and then my youngest uses the walker to get around the house. The only con I can think of is that I wish the phone was attached to the toy since we are also looking for it.
