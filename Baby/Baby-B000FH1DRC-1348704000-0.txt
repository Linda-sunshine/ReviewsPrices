review/summary: Favorite Diapersreview/text: The hospital where we delivered our daughter used Pampers diapers and we liked them so much that we have continued to purchase them for our daughter who will be 3 months old next week. The Pampers Swaddlers have a strip on the diaper that tells you when the baby has wet the diaper so you don't have to open the diaper or stick your finger in to see if it is wet. Our daughter HATES to have a wet diaper, so if she starts crying we can easily check to see if she needs a change. We have only had of issues with her leaking twice at night, and she's been sleeping 6-8 hours so I think that's pretty good! My only issue with these diapers is that I have a really good sense of smell, and I can sometimes smell the chlorine in the diapers and sometimes when she has used the diaper there is a sweet smell that comes from the diaper, but my husband can't smell either of these smells, so it is probably just me!
