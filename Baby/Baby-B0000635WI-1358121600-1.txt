review/summary: Not worth the moneyreview/text: I bought this item because I knew a few friends that had used it. They gave me mixed reviews, but I needed to buy something since I'm almost in my third trimester and starting to feel uncomfortable at night. This pillow is stiff and the fabric was rough. I tried using it one night and ended up throwing it out of the bed at 3 AM. I wish I would have bought something more simple that doesn't come up to my head. I prefer my regular pillow under my head. I would not recommend buying this pillow.
