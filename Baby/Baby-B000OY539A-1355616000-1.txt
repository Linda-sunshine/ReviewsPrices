review/summary: Great for babyreview/text: Very long and hard to wrap around at first, but it is more comfortable than the baby bjorn carrier. My son cries every time I put him in the baby bjorn. Takes some time to learn how to wrap, but once you get the hang of it, it's great to have my son close to me.
