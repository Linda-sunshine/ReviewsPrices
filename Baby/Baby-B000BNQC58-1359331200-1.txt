review/summary: Love it!!review/text: We got this for Christmas for my 2 year old son and even the teenage salesclerk raved about hers. It did not disappoint. The blue, green or orange stars fill the room with wonder. We spend every night finding the moon. The buttons are easy for him to use and it goes off by itself to save on batteries. I highly recommend this product. Only drawback is that it takes AAA's.
