review/summary: Great for the price!review/text: I bought this rocker for my 3 month old daughter. She loves it! She starts to kick and rocks this all by herself making the little 'bugs' move back and forth. She is completely entertained. I gave this a 4 star rating because the vibration mechanism is a bit loud. This could however be an issue with how I put it together. The instructions and illustrations were not very clear.
