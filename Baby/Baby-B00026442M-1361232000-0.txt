review/summary: Quality of Pampers Dry has decreased dramaticallyreview/text: I was a huge fan of Pampers Baby Dry. With my first child, I faithfully used the Pampers Baby Dry diapers for over two and half years with no complaints at all. I recommended them to friends and family members with babies. With my second child, who is now one year old, I returned to Baby Dry since they worked so well with my first. I don't know what they changed about the diapers, but the diapers continuously explode. I don't leave them on for longer than two hours at a time. Sometimes, the diaper feels completely dry and it still has exploded. The inside of the diaper is also irritating to my son's skin. I am tired of vacuuming up clumps of diapers. This happens to at least one diaper a day. I'm done. I am cancelling my subscription tonight and returning the last box which I haven't opened.
