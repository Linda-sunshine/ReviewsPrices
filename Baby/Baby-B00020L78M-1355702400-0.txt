review/summary: I like this...review/text: When I read the reviews on this product before buying this I was worried. People said that the multicoloring didn't go with their living room decor and it was hard to open and close and take apart. But, I took their opinions into consideration and bought it anyway. First off, the coloring isn't meant to go with anything, it is supposed to be fun for kids. Besides, when you have kids around who has a clean and decorated house where everything matches perfect. Nobody I know. Secondly, one person said it was hard to open and close and boo there was no door. I have never had it completely closed around my child to really need a door. It usually is butted up next to the sofa so that she doesn't feel too clausterphobic. Also, it is easier for me to just climb over the gate if I need to. Like everyone does when it is in a doorway. Anyway, I also learned that it is super easy to take apart. You just hold one end down and pull the other up and out. I don't know why people were unscrewing things to get it apart. Anyway, I don't know about anyone else but I LIKE THE PLAY YARD and I would recommend it to friends and family. Hope this helps.
