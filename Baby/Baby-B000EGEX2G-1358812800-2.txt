review/summary: Very happyreview/text: I was a little skeptical at first ordering furniture online having not seen it before. But, the chair came very well packed and was easy assembled. The chair itself is very comfortable. The one thing that I would look for if I had it all over to do again was a locking mechanism in order to stop the rocking. This glider does not have one. However, I am very happy with it.
