review/summary: Annoying for parents, but my baby LOVES this toyreview/text: Parent's warning- this toy keeps singing/talking after you stop playing with it- my husband and I find it annoying, but I push through my dislike because my 12 month old absolutely loves this toy. He loves pulling off the string attached shapes, I put them back on, and he pulls them off again- he loves doing it now, and he loved it at about 5 months old. It sings, it lights up, it sings, and it sings... I highly recommend this toy to any grandparent looking for something to leave at their grandchild's house :-)
