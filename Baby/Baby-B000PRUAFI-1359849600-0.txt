review/summary: Great gate, great price, nice featuresreview/text: We have only been using this gate for a week to keep our 1 year old twins out of our kitchen. The gate is hard to install, but I think all pressure mounted door gates are. I love that it has a setting to keep it open and a lock for when you want to make sure no one gets past it.A note about installation - if your opening is 35.5 inches, that is the dividing line between using one and using both extensions. Our opening is 35.5 inches, and we decided to use both extensions so as not to only use one and risk it being wobbly. It was a tight fit but it works with both extensions. There seems to be a tiny bit of "give" when the extensions meet but the gate hasn't budged even with our girl who likes to pull up on it and shake back and forth (only been a week though).The gate also hasn't needed any realigning in the week we've had an heavily used it, it still automatically swings shut and latches, unlike our old gate that constantly misaligned. Love it so far and hope it lasts.
