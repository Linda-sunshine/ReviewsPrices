review/summary: Perfect for little baby hands!review/text: We were given this toy as a present for our one month old and at three months old this is now her favorite toy to play with when sitting in her bouncy seat. She is just learning how to use her hands so this toy is perfect for beginners. It also rattles when you shake it which she really enjoys.
