review/summary: Product is good - Packing is bad - Box was completely squishedreview/text: Product is good.The packaging and the shipping was bad. The packaging was squished and one of the 3 plastic packs was opened by the force. So technically received 150 odd diapers only for the prices of 234. I don't have time to give it back. But rather I will cancel my subscription and buy it is some local store to save myself from such Hassle!
