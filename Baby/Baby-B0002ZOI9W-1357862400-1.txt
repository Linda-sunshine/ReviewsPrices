review/summary: Just vibrate by itself and cannot rock the baby automaticallyreview/text: yep, if it is on the product specs i did not read it. So... please be advise that it does not rock the baby automatically.I think the vibration does not calm down my baby, otherwise it make it cry. I use it with Summer Infant Snuzzler to make it more comfortable to my 1 month old baby and she sleeps well on it with this configuration.The product is well done and has good quality. As my baby get older it is certain that she will like the toys on it.
