review/summary: My 9 month old loves it!review/text: He can't stand yet or walk with it but so far he loves sitting in front of it and playing with it. This is by far his favorite toy. I'm so glad I purchased this. All the different activities keep him interested. The only negative is that even after he stops playing with it the toy continues to make noise until we turn it off. But I still love it and so does he!
