review/summary: Only disposable that's ever worked for us!review/text: I mostly use cloth diapers during the day, but for overnight and going out, I go with disposables. We're on our 3rd baby now, and over the years Pampers has been the ONLY disposable diaper that we can rely on! Have tried cheaper brands sometimes - they're cheaper for a reason! Pampers has consistently given us a diaper that we can count on not leaking. Store brands, Luvs, Huggies have all failed us multiple times, just leak really bad or tear easily. I am rarely brand-loyal, but Pampers is now the only brand of disposable I'll buy. Pampers is a good quality disposable for the times that you need it (I still recommend using mostly cloth and more natural products though!)
