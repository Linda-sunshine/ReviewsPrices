review/summary: Does not keep your baby dryreview/text: So I bought these diapers because I have used the Swaddlers before with success. My daughter is 9 weeks old, 10 pounds and uses size 1. For anyone that has not used Swaddlers, the difference between the two is clearly the quality as the diaper is much thinner, almost paper thin. Upon the first use of this diaper, I noticed that after a 2 hour nap, my daughter's onesie was was wet. I gave the diaper another chance, and had exactly the same issue. I would not recommend this diaper as I believe the whole purpose of a diaper is to keep the baby dry.
