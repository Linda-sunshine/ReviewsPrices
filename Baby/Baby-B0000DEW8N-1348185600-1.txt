review/summary: Awesome!review/text: We just received this booster and love it! We were originally looking at other chairs with fabric covers and other options but this chair has just what we need for our little girl. The color options are wonderful as well - the brown/tan option fits wonderfully into our dining room color scheme which is awesome since in our town home you see the dining room immediately when you enter our house.
