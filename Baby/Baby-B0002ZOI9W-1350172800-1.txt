review/summary: Cheap infant seat, wouldn't trust for my toddler.review/text: My mother purchased this chair for my son and when it came, I was disappointed on the quality of the parts. It's cheap metal and plastic. My son has issues with gas and reflux so he is in the chair a lot when sleeping as I am afraid to lay him down, the chair is ok as he is only 5 weeks old. My daughter wants to sit in it and when she gets in, it sways. She is 23 months and only 24lbs, it shouldn't be that flimsy! The screws are as tight as they can be, but the plastic is just cheap. I will be buying another chair as soon as we can. I just do not trust this chair to hold my children.We had purchased a Jeep brand travel bouncer for my daughter from a tag sale and it is sturdy! 2 years later it is still intact and usable.
