review/summary: Excellent Playard for all agesreview/text: We started using this Playard with our newborn with the basinet feature. He slept well there for a couple of months, however extra tight fitting sheets ended up causing the green basinet sleeping surface to become lumpy and uncomfortable. We purchased a playard mattress from our local baby store, and that restored the comfort to our playard. Once we passed the weight limit for the basinet add-on, we simply removed that portion and had him sleep on the lower section. We had our little one sleeping in it every night until 5 months old at which time we transitioned him to a regular crib, and then at this point the playard actually became a playard for him, which he still enjoys to this day at 11 months old.The design and construction is very good with this playard, which is larger and sturdier than your average playard. This definitely can be a slight squeeze to fit through doorways if trying to be moved in between rooms, however it will clear the door frame with the changing table attachment removed without having to collapse the entire playard.It also is extremely durable, with ours having endured 3 moves and daily use without any visible wear or damage. This product will definitely last for some time to come, and was definitely a worthwhile investment.
