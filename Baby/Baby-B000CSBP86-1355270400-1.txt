review/summary: Everyone should have one!review/text: I absolutely love my Baby Bjorn! It was my husbands idea to list this on our baby registry, and I'm so glad he did! It makes doing everyday tasks so much easier! Your hands are free and yet you are right there to interact with your baby instead of letting him/her just sit in a carrier or bouncer. Great for multi-tasking moms and dads!
