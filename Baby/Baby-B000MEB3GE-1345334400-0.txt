review/summary: The best baby item ever invented!review/text: There is nothing better for a nursing mother, especially when you have a helping partner or a busy schedule. It makes it so easy to keep track of not only your feeding schedule, but diaper changes, and anything else you need to keep up with. It worked great for me so that I could use the countdown feature to know when to wake the baby without having to watch the clock. I also used it for the first few days to keep up with my medications so I could keep the schedule straight. My husband loved being able to check when I had done things so he didn't have to wake me up to ask or the baby to see if she needed anything. I wish I had had one of these with my older kids, but I now know that it is the best baby gift and I always make sure the new mom has one!
