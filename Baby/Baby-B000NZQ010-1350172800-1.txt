review/summary: Loves it!review/text: My son loves this toy. We first saw it at a friend's house. He played with it so much there that I had to buy one for him. He was 10 months old. He is now 13 months and is fully walking independently but still loves to walk around the house with the walker. Definitely durable as he slams it around on the hardwoods all of the time.
