review/summary: A good play yardreview/text: I bought this play yard for my grandson who is 9 months old, he loves the different colors. He is pulling himself up to stand and has no problem doing it now. I am afraid though as he gets bigger that the panels will not be strong enough, they kinda wobble now when he pulls up. Otherwise it serves it's purpose in keeping my grandson in one place in case I need to do something. Some reviews said it was hard to manipulate and put together, but this grandma had no problem unfolding it and getting it in place where I wanted it. I would recommend it to my friends or anyone who is looking for a good play yard for the price.
