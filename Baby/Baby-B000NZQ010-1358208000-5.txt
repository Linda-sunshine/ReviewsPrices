review/summary: Best toy EVERreview/text: I have a 2yr old and 7mo old and they both like to play with it. 7mo old can sit and 'attack' it. The wheels lock so it won't go backwards when he pushes it and my 2yr old likes to push it all over the house and sing with the music and talking on its phone.
