review/summary: Not too impressedreview/text: I got this wrap for my newborn. After using an Ergo for two years, I thought I'd try something different with baby #2. I wasn't impressed with all the material, and it was confusing on hoe to use. The function was the same as my Ergo; my Ergo was just easier to use. I ended up returning this item and bought an infant insert for my other carrier instead.
