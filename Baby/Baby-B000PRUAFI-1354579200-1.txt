review/summary: Ok gatereview/text: My husband got this to keep out kids out of our bathroom. I read the reviews on the other 10,000 gates available for purchase and I'm glad that I chose this one. Even though it doesn't need to be screwed into the wall, it still holds up while my two toddlers run full force into it while trying to knock it down. My older son is trying to figure out how to open it, he still hasn't figured it out!
