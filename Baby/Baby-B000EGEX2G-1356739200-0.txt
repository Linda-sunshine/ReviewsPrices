review/summary: perfect!review/text: My daughter is now 16 months old and we've had this chair since we brought her home from the hospital. I use it everyday at least twice. It is so comfortable. It's also easy to clean. I like the finish of the wood and the cushions are very durable. it matched her nursery furniture perfectly too.
