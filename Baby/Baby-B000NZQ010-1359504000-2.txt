review/summary: Great for walking support, and more!review/text: Our daughter used this for balance when beginning to walk, and now that she walks independently, she still pushes it around! She loves the telephone feature, and will sit quietly pushing the buttons and using the other features. The lights, sounds and music are cheerful and hold her attention. The activity portion also detaches from the walker, so your child can play with it flat on the floor.
