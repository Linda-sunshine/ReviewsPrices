review/summary: My go-to baby shower giftreview/text: I've order many of these from Amazon.com as baby shower gifts. I received it before my 4 yr old daughter was born from a friend and it was something that I didn't even think to register for. However, I'm so glad I got it because it's a great baby/kid item. Easy to strap on a standard dining room chair, simple to clean and wipe off after use and it packs together nicely for travel. If I would have known better, I would have just skipped the high chair altogether and just gone straight to the booster seat. Highly recommended.
