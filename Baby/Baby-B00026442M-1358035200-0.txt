review/summary: Because washing the bed everyday sucksreview/text: Hate washing the bed when Juniors diaper leaks? Yeah so do I. So you know what, Ill spend a few bucks more and go with proven protection. No more leaks, a dry bed everyday, and money saved on water detergent and time, and even though my time might not be highly valued by most, it is by my kids... so less time at the washer means more time on the floor playing with them!
