review/summary: Perfect toy for our 8 month oldreview/text: At this point, our young man is pulling himself up on everything. We have to be careful that he uses the activity side to pull up. (To make sure it is stable enough to support him.) This is an issue with everything he plays with, there is no flaw in the product. Toy is designed well enough for us to supervise playtime and it keeps him entertained... For a few minutes anyway... Hope he will use it as a walker in a few months?
