review/summary: Fun for babyreview/text: My 7 month old really enjoys this toy. I however have a few complaints. The telephone is not attached and therefore is just tossed into the toy box. The toy has two modes, one is supposed to be songs and the other &#34;talking.&#34; The talking mode play songs and just interrupts itself to talk then goes right back to the song. It's pretty annoying.Overall, it's a fun interactive toy and I would probably buy it again.
