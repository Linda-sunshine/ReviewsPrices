review/summary: We loved size 1-2, but at 3rd one we got a problemsreview/text: Size 1 was best diapers ever, so we went further on with a brand. Especially since the price is very close. As we got to a size 2, 3. I'm not sure there is possibility that we had little problems here and there but not as much. Summer came and we got on #3, heat rashes came up, we always used Vaseline and other products to avoid it, nothing helped. All kinds of other rashes came up. There was even this huge pimple that was or a private spot. It's not because we didn't change it enough, but I came to find out that Pampers uses chloride for a smell purpose, and that was a reason she was getting bad rashes. As soon we switched it to different ones that don't have as much stuff in it, it all went away. We are going with Huggies now, even though they leak time to time. I prefer dealing with a leak rather than a terrifying rashes. I never leave bad reviews usually, but I had to worn you in case it happens to your baby!
