review/summary: our favoritereview/text: My baby is four month now. So far we used pampers swaddler, pampers swaddler sensitive, huggies, and target brand. and this pampers swaddlers is the best for our baby. It has the best cutting to prevent and leakage (we had a couple of real deal poop explore and it handled very well). We used a small bag of pampers sensitive at the beginning and after switching to this one we didn't see any difference. Maybe for babies with more sensitive skin you want to stick to the other one. But design wise I think these two are identical and equally good. Huggies definitely run small and our baby is not so big for her age (she is heavy but also tall so kind of lean).
