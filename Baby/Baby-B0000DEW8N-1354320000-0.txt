review/summary: Wonderful Boosterreview/text: I bought this booster because of all the rave reviews. My 7 month old cannot sit up yet, so I was a bit worried that it wouldn't support him well enough, but he sat in it fine. Sometimes I will put a little towel/blanket on each side of him to keep him from leaning. It secures to a chair nicely, so I do not feel he is in any danger. I can put him in the booster very easily and the tray is very easy to put on. There are not any parts that can hurt him. I do have to be careful while putting on the tray, however, because my son likes to press the buttons on the side where the tray attaches. Chair is very light-weight, so I will be taking it to grandma's and any other place we go to eat. I Recommend this booster highly.
