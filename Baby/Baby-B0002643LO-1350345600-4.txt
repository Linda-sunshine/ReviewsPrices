review/summary: Terrible rash! Going back to Hughiesreview/text: We switch to pampers for the savings but my son developed a terrible rash. After a week (treating him in the meantime with lotions, skin barriers and other topical creams), we got back to Hughies and his rask got clearly better in a couple of days. We used pampers swadllers before wihtout any problems. I found in the internet other people with similar issues:[...]If your kid has allergies or delicate skin, I will say to do not use this diapers.
