review/summary: To tall for my baby!review/text: I'm suprised that no one mentions how tall this jumper is. My 4 month old is in the 75% for height and he is nowhere near touching his feet to the floor in this jumper. I have it on the lowest setting and I have to put a box under his feet so that he can jump. The toys and lights are awesome..I'm sure it will be one of his favorite toys in a few months.
