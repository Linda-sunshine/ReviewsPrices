review/summary: Horrible thin diaper leaving my 14 month SOAKED THROUGHreview/text: We have been purchasing Pampers Baby Dry through Amazon Prime Subscribe and Save. This last shipment of diapers were horrible. Pampers has lost our business. The diapers were paper thin and my 14 month old boy kept waking up soaked through. Leaving the bed soaking wet. Something is horribly wrong with these diapers. We will be changing to another brand ASAP.
