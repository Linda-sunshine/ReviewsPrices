review/summary: Love this pillow!review/text: Yes, I was skeptical at first, but decided to purchase this pillow at 21 weeks pregnant to ease back and hip pain. I love it! Soft but still very supportive. My belly isnt big enough yet to need supporting, but being thin I needed support under my side when side-sleeping. I agree with other reviews that the seam at the connected end can be uncomfortable on your neck, but I wouldnt say it's &#34;excrutiating&#34; and isnt a reason for me to return it. I prefer to put my head on the divided end anyway, that way my hip can sink down into the hole at the connected end while my side is supported by the middle. YES it is worth the price!!
