review/summary: New Version does not have Corn, Apple and Pumpkin!review/text: Haven't used this as a walker yet but so far it's great for tummy time. The music and lights keep my little one interested, but most of all the gears are what captivates him when I want him to finish up those last few seconds of tummy time. Educationally, it's great with the numbers, colors and shapes. The music is loud and obnoxious to adults but that's what gets the attention of babies and it works! Make sure to turn it OFF, otherwise it has a mind of it's own. The one I got must be the newest version because it does not have the corn, pumpkin and apple that everyone is complaining about. My version has the numbers 1, 2 and 3 instead - thank goodness! Overall, I think it is a good toy and a great value! They sell pianos alone for $20 and this toy gives you a lot for 28 bucks!
