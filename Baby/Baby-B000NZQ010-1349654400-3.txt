review/summary: Excellent Toy, But Be Cautious!review/text: This toy is excellent for babies at least 9 or 10 months or older, Even my son who has been picking himself up to stand for over a month now I thought this would be an excellent toy to try and start him in the right direction for learning to take first few steps alone, It is a great toy, educational and fun, but you really need to watch your babies while trying out this toy. My son started pushing, only on the first setting. The wheels have two settings, one for babies just learning to take their first steps and another speed for babies who are already learned how to walk, if you aren't careful when my son went to let go and sit down, it fell on top of him, babies can get hurt this way. I would just say its fine if your baby just wants to sit and play with the front side with the toys, but trying to walk, just be careful and keep a close eye on them. either baby could fall forward if they cant keep up, or if their going to try and stop and sit down the walker could fall on top of them.
