review/summary: Great Itemreview/text: Bought pack n play to replace an older model. It is super cute, love the colors and the toy bar, and LOVE that is has wheels so it can easily be moved around. I wish that 2 or 3 sides had the option to be covered instead of see-through mesh...that way if there are other kids in the room, baby isn't so easily distracted.
