review/summary: two mommies love this, full size pocket nanny is worth the pricereview/text: This is the second time I have bought this pocket nanny, for two different moms. They both have told me that it was the best gift they got and found it terribly useful, esp because others help with the baby's care. It clarifies communication and helps new moms figure their babies out. The full size pocket nanny is worth the price. This one works fine, but is very small and with fewer functions.
