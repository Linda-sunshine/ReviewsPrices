review/summary: Easy to assemble and our son LOVES it!!review/text: Thank you fellow Amazon reviewers - you led us to a great product!At 3 months old, our son was getting to the point where he just wanted to stand and kick - very wiggly and active, so we started looking at this type of product. The great reviews steered us to the Rainforest Jumperoo, and we ordered it. Once it arrived, my wife had it assembled in just a few minutes, very easy. It is sturdy, adjustable, and filled with fun interactive features. Our son was too short for it, so we put several large books beneath it and off he went! He has a blast, and depending on his mood will stay in the Jumperoo for up to 45 minutes.
