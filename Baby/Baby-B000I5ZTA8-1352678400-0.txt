review/summary: good valuereview/text: I got this on my 21 week, 139bl. With other people's review, I bought the one size up, and it is totally correct. I am using the smallest setting right now, and this belt will give me plenty growing room. One thing I do not like (I guess it is related to my job)is it is not comfortable if you like me, sitting all the day. But it does lighter my back stress. Would recommend it. It is made in US.
