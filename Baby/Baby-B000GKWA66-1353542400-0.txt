review/summary: Great White Noise Machinereview/text: We love the Cloud b Sound Machine Sleep Sheep. My 6 year old and 10 month old share a room, so we bought this when baby was born so she would be able to sleep through his snoring, talking in his sleep and late night bathroom trips. It works like a charm. She loves to play with the sheep during the day, and has figured out how to push the buttons to change the sound. It has 4 different sounds: heartbeat, rain, ocean, and whales. She loves them all. The whales are the most soothing, in my opinion, though. We keep the volume on the sheep up all the way, but even still it isn't overly loud. It has a nice Velcro strap so you can hang it off the side of the crib if you wanted to. It has an auto-off timer which you can set for 15 or 45 minutes. The batteries last for a really long time. We use it every night, set on the 45 minute shut off, with the volume at full blast and we've only had to change the batteries once in the almost 10 months we've had it. The fleece of the sheep has a slightly odd texture, but baby doesn't seem to mind, and I'm willing to get past that if it helps her sleep through the night.
