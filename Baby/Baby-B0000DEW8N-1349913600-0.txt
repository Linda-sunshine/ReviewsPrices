review/summary: Love it!review/text: The majority of the time, this stays buckled into one of our dining room chairs and our daughter sits at the table with us and her food while we eat ours. After dinner, the chairs are pushed in and you'd never know there was a high chair at the table. When we go out to eat, the chair comes with us and it is so much better than the restaurant high chairs. Our daughter is small and trying to get her up to the table in the restaurant high chairs is challenging and frequently awkward for her to try and eat. This buckles onto most chairs and makes meal time more familiar for her. It's easy to carry and the straps are easy to work, which is important for being able to take it places. My in laws have a different brand and the straps are impossible to adjust. Definitely recommend to anyone wanting an easy, functional seat.
