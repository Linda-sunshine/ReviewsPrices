review/summary: Very nice gatereview/text: We replaced a baby gate that we didn't like with this one, and I'm so glad we did. This one has a "stay open" feature that I LOVE, doesn't wreck your walls with nails, and is much easier to open than the previous gate we had. I also like the look of this one better than other gates, as it is more curved and therefore looks less like a "prison". Very pleased.
