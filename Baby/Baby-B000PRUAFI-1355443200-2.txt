review/summary: Great gate!review/text: After an insane amount of searching for gates, I decided on this one. It's sturdy and looks great, especially in the bronze color. The latch feature is tricky enough that kids can't figure out how to get it open, but easy enough for an adult to do quickly, and best of all it is secure. I love that it swings closed by itself, and also stays open if you want it to. I'll be ordering another soon.
