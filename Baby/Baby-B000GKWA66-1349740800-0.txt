review/summary: This review made possible by sleep sheep...review/text: I thought I wouldn't need a white noise generator, but after watching my little one zonk out in 10 seconds when held near a fountain on an outing I changed my mind. This makes nap time a cinch. I have to admit the mother's heartbeat sound is creepy though. Very industrial. Oh, well. Still a great product.
