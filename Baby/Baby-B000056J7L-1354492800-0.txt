review/summary: Awesome little potty for a tiny 2yr old (23 1/2lbs!)review/text: We have been loosely potty training, at my daughter's discretion (self-lead...working beautifully) for a little over 6mos, and recently she has become very independent about it all -- she literally holds up her hand to stop us from following her to the bathroom to use the potty sometimes! We have always just had a cushioned training seat on the big potty, and had recently gotten a potty seat with an attached "step ladder", but she had trouble getting her pants down safely once she was up there, so she couldn't REALLY go and do it by herself. I thought I would give the floor-potty a chance, and got this one. She immediately said "I want to go pee pee!" and so I showed her that she couljd stand on the floor, take off her own pants/pull-up and go...she did, and the potty is super sturdy, it's the perfect size for her tiny little hiney (she's only 23.6lbs at a little over 2yrs!), and she had no trouble at all getting on or getting up...the "arm rests" were a great way to help herself get back up - might want to consider that if you are considering the smaller Bjorn potty chair. It emptied easy as pie, and was ridiculously easy to clean and sanitize...but once I did that, she grabbed it and put it back in the shipping box...she just prefers the seats on the "big girl potty". Otherwise, great little chair, for sure.I would mention, the "lip" that is there to prevent issues for little boys or "forward spillage" during a pee, might prove a little tough to maneuver or might get a little boy caught on it...I'm sure they have to be high enough to actually prevent the spill/splash, but this one took my daughter a moment to get over the little hump, and being a girl she doesn't even have the "extra accessories".
