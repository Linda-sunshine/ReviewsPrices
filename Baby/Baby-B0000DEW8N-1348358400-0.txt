review/summary: Grandma Greview/text: I do not personally use this product. My daughter loves it. They don't have a very big apartment so not having to have a whole separate place for a high chair is nice. My grandson is only 7 months old so the edge around it makes it easier for him to get a grip on things. From what my daughter says I would recommend this to anyone looking for a high chair.
