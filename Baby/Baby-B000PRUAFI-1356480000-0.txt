review/summary: Perfect for our needs!review/text: We bought this to block off an area for our 7 month old Corgi puppy while we were gone during the day because I hated leaving him in his crate or small confined area. It fits the opening to our hallway perfectly, has a tight secure fit and doesn't damage the wall. The swinging door is the best part of this! It can open both ways and stay in an open position! It was super easy to install and seems pretty durable. We have used it for 2 months now and are very pleased with it. I waited to buy it when it was on sale too and that made it an even better purchase! Since we will be starting a family pretty soon, I am sure this will be great as a baby safety gate! I've had my friend's kids over and it's been kid-tested and approved!
