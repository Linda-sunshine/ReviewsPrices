review/summary: Panels arrived warpedreview/text: I ordered two sets and the panels arrived somewhat warped - I didn't think it was an issue until I tried connecting the panels, and the warping really caused the structure to be very unsturdy. Just one kick from my 6-month old baby made the panels wobble a lot. I'm not risking keeping it to see what she can do with it when she pulls herself up!The panels were also really difficult to disconnect and connect - I got really annoyed doing that, but stepping over with a baby isn't very easy either when you're 5ft 4in and the panels are 26in high!
