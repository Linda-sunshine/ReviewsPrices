review/summary: Helpful & Nice little productreview/text: My husband and I love gadgets so instantly we liked this product.Our son is now 2 weeks 2 days old. When we first brought him home, this was helpful until we got into a routine and for the need of tracking soiled/wet diapers and feedings. I was nursing so this helped remind us and helped keep track.I also keep a paper log because I want to keep everything recorded and have a history, so I don't use it as often as I did in the first week... but I still keep it around and use it from time to time.It will come in handy for when I need to give medications or something.On another note... Amazon's customer service is excellent. This item initially arrived with the clip broken and they sent me a replacement immediately the next day!! Because of their outstanding customer service (and great prices and shipping) I now turn to Amazon more and more!
