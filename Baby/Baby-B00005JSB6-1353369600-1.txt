review/summary: Just great!review/text: My son is a big boy, one years old and wears 2t and weighs 28 lbs. he's tall and solid. Finding the right clothes and diapers have been a challenge. These fit him better than any of the others that come in size six. I've tried them all and they are either too narrow or rub against his skin too high on the belly.
