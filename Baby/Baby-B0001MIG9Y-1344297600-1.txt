review/summary: Stick with Swaddlersreview/text: OK, this is the first review I have ever written for Amazon and I order most of my baby's things through the site. I just got back back from walking around the grocery store with baby poop smeared on my shirt because of these silly diapers. We've been using Swaddlers since birth but for some reason, between size 3 and 4, we switched to Baby Dry... He's never had many issues peeing through diapers during the night or #2 blow-outs but we've had something happen everyday with these diapers. Today's blow-out on the way home from work was the final straw. They do not fit as snugly around his thighs, and I think that may be causing the leaking issues. During the night, the pee soaks through the top on the front. He's a pretty thick baby so I'm blaming the diapers!I am switching back to Swaddlers Sensitive today.
