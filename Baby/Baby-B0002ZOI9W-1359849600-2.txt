review/summary: Needs some modification to earn more stars...review/text: A very sweet adjunct to the wealth of baby items. Would think this a pleasant addition to grandparents' homes in particular.While the unit is colorful, stable, and can be used as a seat or rocker, there is one issue that could consistently present a problem...Removing baby...the snap off bar, with a catch on each side that must be disengaged, is not easily removed. Mechanism is somewhat awkward. It certainly could disrupt a sleepy baby with the jostling needed, and also requires extra care in manuevering it off while keeping baby stable and happy.A bit of modification could definitely earn this unit another star.
