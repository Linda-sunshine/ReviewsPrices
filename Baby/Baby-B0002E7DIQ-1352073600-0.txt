review/summary: Better than the U- shaped one of you are trying to decide!review/text: I am 6 months pregnant and have been suffering from HORRIBLE hip pain since 14 weeks. I am a back sleeper usually so by 20 weeks when it came time for side sleeping I would sometimes wake up in tears in so much pain in my hips. I heard about the big horeshoe shaped pillow that other's have used for pregnancy side sleeping, and went on Amazon to find it. I found the horseshoe shaped one as well as this Leachco one, so I went through a lot of the reviews for both. I read a lot of people with hip issues were seeing relief from the Leachco so I went with this one. I cannot sleep without it! It is so comfortable and gives me support in all the right places with the contoured edges. It is a little on the big side, but to wrap around you, it is to be expected. My husband calls it the "fortress" on my side, but he says it's not big enough to get in his way in our queen size bed, so that's good. One thing I do wish it had was a nice super soft slip cover, it does have a basic slipcover that you can take off and wash but it's not super soft, it's a very basic cover. All in all, this was a fantastic purchase and I am very happy with my pillow. Hope this helps others out there!!
