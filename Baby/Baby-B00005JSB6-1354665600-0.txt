review/summary: Can't beat Huggiesreview/text: Huggies is the best brand of diaper out there. If your looking to save money, perhaps this one isn't for you, as it is one of the spendier varieties. However, I will mention, I tried a less expensive brand and I was so disappointed. My son leaked through every single night even though I changed him right before bed. I have never had this issue with Huggies. It is the best. Also, I love that you can use subscribe and save and have it automatically shipped to your front door with no shipping charges.
