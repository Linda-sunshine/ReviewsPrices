review/summary: One of the best toy purchasesreview/text: Got this for my son when he was just a little over 12 months. He just marveled at the stars and the moon while making some attempts to catch them in his hand. It has sustained his interest for over 8 months nowAs the manufacturers have clearly stated, the toy should not be given to a child below 3 years. I'm around to supervise each time my toddler plays with this one because he could hurt himself with the thick turtle shell.
