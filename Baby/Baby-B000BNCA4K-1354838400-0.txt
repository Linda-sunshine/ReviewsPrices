review/summary: Great toy for learning to grasp and liftreview/text: Our baby loves this toy! She is now 4 months old and has been fascinated with this toy since we received it. She has been grasping and lifting the toy from the day we first gave it to her. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I have read contradicting information regarding what it's made of. My concern is BPA, which the packaging says nothing about. Up 'til now, my baby hadn't been putting this toy in her mouth because she always had a pacifier in her mouth while she played with it. Lately though, she's into putting her fingers up between the paci and her face and she takes the paci out, and then the Winkel goes right in. I've ordered a different, similarly shaped toy from a company that I know for a fact makes safe toys for kids, and am just waiting for it to arrive. We now have to have a toy that she can put in her mouth and chew on since teething could start at any time. I would recommend this to anyone whose baby uses a paci when playing.
