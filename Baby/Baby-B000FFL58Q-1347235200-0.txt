review/summary: Must have for new baby!review/text: My infant got use out of this from about 4 weeks old until 5 months old. He loved all of the toys that hung down, loved the music, and it would entertain him for a good 15 minutes. The material is easy to wipe off if your little one spits up. Definitely recommend.
