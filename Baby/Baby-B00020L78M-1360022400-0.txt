review/summary: Play Yard....review/text: This is a MUST have for any parent. We've used them since birth and even now, and she's almost 3. We used them as an ocotogan, a long zig-zag room divider, and now as individual doorway gates to keep her out of the kitchen, etc. Probably the best thing I bought as a parent. Each wall can be broken apart, which is great. They're good for indoors, outdoors, and are easy to clean. This is not one of those things you buy and will never use, it's the thing you buy and wonder how you'd ever live without it.
