review/summary: Expensive but very comfortable and cozyreview/text: I'm an average sized person and 5 months pregnant. I've always been a side sleeper for the most part. A few weeks ago, I woke up with a terrible back pain, which triggered my search for a pregnancy pillow.I was apprehensive to spend a lot of money on a "pillow". So, I first tried the smaller version of this product, Leachco Snoogle Mini Compact Side Sleeper. Turns out, it was too "mini" for me. So, I ordered this product and as much as I hate spending so much for a pillow, I absolutely love it!!! It supports my full body, especially my growing belly and ever-aching back!There are some minor things that I would have appreciated. The pillow has a tendency to become very flat around the neck (not enough cushioning?), which sometimes causes a stiff neck. Moreover, I cover the pillow with another blanket to avoid washing the cover that comes with it. I, personally, have not tried washing the cover because of some reviews that describe the difficulty of putting it back on.Having said that, I totally recommend this product to all those suffering from pregnancy aches and pains at the end of a busy day.
