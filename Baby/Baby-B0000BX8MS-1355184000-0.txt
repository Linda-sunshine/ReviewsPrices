review/summary: So Warm and Cute!review/text: I bought this to fit my son who is 6 months old, but a super chunk a dunk. He's over 20 pounds. He literally squealed with delight when he saw this sleep sack and was so excited to put it on. It's soft, gives him plenty of room to kick and move, and has been keeping him toasty for these cold Winter nights.
