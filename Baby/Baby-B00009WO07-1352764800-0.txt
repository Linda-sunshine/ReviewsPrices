review/summary: Leaks, doesn't absorb odors either. Go with Swaddlers!review/text: Going from Swaddlers to these was a HUGE mistake. The name "baby dry" should be a joke, because the diaper gets damp very fast, and ALWAYS smells like pee. It's not my baby either, I have to change out the diaper about twice more than normal and most of the diapers are barely heavy. Seems like such a waste... should've bought the smaller amount to test first. It's odd how the same brand could have one type vastly superior to the other. Again, go with Swaddlers, we had ZERO issues with them. "Baby dry" is a lie.
