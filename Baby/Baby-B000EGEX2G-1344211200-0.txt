review/summary: Ok not greatreview/text: This chair is of average quality. We liked the design and the assembly was fairly simple, but after about 4 months, the chair started squeaking. We initially tried some silicone lubricant spray on some of the parts, which stopped the squeaking for a couple of weeks. After that the screws had to be tightened again to stop the noise. Fortunately, my baby sleeps on her own now, so the squeaky noise is not an issue anymore. but it does get loud enough at times.
