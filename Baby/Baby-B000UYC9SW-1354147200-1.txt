review/summary: Not What I Had Hopedreview/text: I read the glowing positive reviews of this carrier and decided this was what I was looking for: a flexible carrier without buckles and straps or long yardages of fabric at a reasonable price. It took me a while to decide on ordering the small (I am 5'5"). I did have some misgivings about the sizing of this item as it didn't seem like it would fit my husband and I really didn't want to get a separate carrier for him. But we figured since I would be the main person using it, we would try my size first.I read the enclosed instructions carefully and managed to get the K'tan on, albeit with some difficulty. I do realize that this is something that would likely get easier with practice. My stumbling block really came when I tried to put my baby in this carrier. It was very difficult, very awkward and I suspect very uncomfortable for her because she cried every time I attempted to use this. When I finally was able to situate her in this sling her face was mashed up against my chest; when I repositioned her to free up her face, her shoulder ended up being cramped instead. I probably tried to use this carrier about five or six times - not once did my baby like it and not once did I feel comfortable with it. She also got very sweaty every time she was in it so I'd probably opt for the mesh version if it is something you are bent on getting. I ended up returning this.
