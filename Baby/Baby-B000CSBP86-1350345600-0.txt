review/summary: Great Productreview/text: This is a great carrier. I received a different carrier as a gift and returned it because I didn't feel comfortable with the design and the safety of my infant son. The Baby Bjorn carrier however is lightweight, comfortable for my son and myself, easy to assemble, and I have every confidence that my 11 lb infant is safe. I will definetely continue use now and in the future and will recommend this carrier to other parents.
