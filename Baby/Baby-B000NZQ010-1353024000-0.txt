review/summary: Learning walker has lasted 2 kids, & still going strongreview/text: Both my baby boy and baby girl loved this toy. We used it as early as 1 month when we started short spurts of tummy time, on throughout learning to sit and stand and then, finally, walk. It's cute and not too annoying :) Fairly educational, but for babies they aren't really learning ABC's yet anyhow. I like that it has 2 settings for stories/songs--adds variety. Sometimes the purple phone rattle falls off easily but it annoys me more than my baby. Buy when it's on sale, it's a great gift!
