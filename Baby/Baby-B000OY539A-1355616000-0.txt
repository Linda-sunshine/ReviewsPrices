review/summary: It does the job.review/text: It is convenient, particularly if your child is not wanting to go down without you. One does need to adjust your baby periodically or one can get a bit uncomfortable. I would recommend this to other folks although I have not compared it to the baby bjorn or the Ergo, etc. I suspect one needs to compare the different competitors until one finds one that works. My friend seemed to like the Bjorn better.
