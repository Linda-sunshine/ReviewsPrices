review/summary: Thank God for the "off" button!review/text: So, my 9 month old daughter is intermittently interested in this toy. She loves opening and closing the barn door and pulling all the "shape" off. The phone is also fun to take of, shake a few times and then chuck as far as her little arm can throw.mommy on the other hand, needs a vicodin.omg this thing is annoying! Sometimes the music freezes and plays the same phrase over and over and won't progress through the song. By mid morning, early afternoon, this toy gets shut off. I just cant handle any more tinny music and fake barn animal noises.The wheels work just fine on carpet but on hardwood they take off for the races. I think I'm going to heat up my glue gun and put a rubber band or two around the wheels to slow it down a bit now that DD is truly using it for a walker.
