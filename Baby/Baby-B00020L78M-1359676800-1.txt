review/summary: Multi-purpose fencereview/text: We bought two of these play yards intending to make one big play yard for our son in the house to keep him out of the breakables. We ended up using it to box in our breakables rather than our 2 year old :) We connected the two yards into a zig zag - sturdier that way - and ran it along one side of the livingroom in front of the tv and curio cabinets so that he couldn't reach them. It worked great and it allowed him to explore without breaking things or hurting himself.This is a very sturdy fence. The sections can be pulled apart to adjust the length of the fencing. About waist height, easy for an adult to step over, but a child cannot step over or push it over if set up correctly.
