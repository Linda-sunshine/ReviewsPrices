review/summary: Kids love thisreview/text: After I saw how my two nieces loved their &#34;dream lights&#34;, I purchased this one as a birthday gift tor a 3-year-old. His mom called me a week or so later to tell me that this gift was his favorite among all that he received. The boy loved it as soon as he opened the gift - he'd seen one on tv and had been asking for one. But his parents were even more happy, because the dream light allowed him to begin sleeping in his &#34;big-boy bed&#34;.
