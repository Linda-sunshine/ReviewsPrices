review/summary: Functional, economical and cute - what more can we ask for?review/text: The hospital let my LO wear these after she was born, and I was hooked by its clever feature - the "time to change" indicator. I went to get a big box of these Swaddlers and they were really soft and blanket-like as advertised. My LO is now 3 months and never experienced any discomfort or leakage wearing these. They cushion and fit her perfectly. The big boxes are economical and Amazon has a monthly delivery service that makes it super convenient for my family. There's no running out of diapers, and no need to run to the stores to get them. As a bonus, these diapers have really cute Sesame Street characters on the front. I wish they'd print those characters all over the diapers, then my LO won't even need to wear diaper covers!
