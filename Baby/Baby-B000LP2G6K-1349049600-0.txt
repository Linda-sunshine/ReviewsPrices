review/summary: Passed our expectations for playpens!review/text: Just received our Graco playard yesterday (I am an overseas buyer). I saw the same items here in our country but it is absurdly charged (3x its usual price). Here are my reasons for buying it:1) Price - I think it's rightly priced, I can even say I got more than I paid for.2) Quality - Looks durable, everything seems perfectly sewn or formed.3) Safety - Every possible warning is in the manual. Only a very stupid person would make mistakes assembling it or misusing it.Grace is a really trusted name on playards. I always make sure to buy items with a trusted name. My husband and I are proud owners of this item.
