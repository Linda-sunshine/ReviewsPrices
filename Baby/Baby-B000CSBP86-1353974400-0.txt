review/summary: Super helpfulreview/text: I'd give 4.5 stars if I could. I bought this so that I could finally have some hands free while baby and I are together. It was perfect for traveling. We used it to fly. There are no metal parts so I could walk right through the metal detector with baby sound asleep in the carrier. He can't sit on his own yet, and his car seat was taking up a ton of room in grocery carts, so using the baby bjorn to go grocery shopping has been a life saver. It does cause some back strain after a while, but for an hour or two it is ideal!
