review/summary: Defective product - had to call Pampersreview/text: I have used Pampers Swaddlers since we brought my daughter home from the hospital 16 months ago. NB, stage 1, stage 2, and now stage 3. They are awesome!!! We recently moved to California, and the Stage 3 Swaddlers are scarcely found. When I can find them, they are only in very small packaged quantities, which is more expensive overall. I decided to purchase them from Amazon, so I could get economy sizing and therefore a better price.The diapers arrived quickly in true Amazon style. Unfortunately, the right tab of all of the diapers ripped off with very little force applied during diaper application. I have never experienced this with Pampers before, so I called Pampers customer care directly. They assured me that nothing had changed in production and that a package purchased from Amazon should be the same quality I had always received. They sent a pre-paid envelop to me to have me send them 2 diapers from the pack, so they could get the batch numbers for quality improvement. She also gave me $50 in Pampers gift certificates to use on diapers in the future.I am very impressed with Pampers customer service and have always loved using Pampers. This one faulty box does make me hesitant to purchase them from Amazon again, but as I still have limited access to Swaddlers in California, I am going to give it another try. If I get another bad batch, I will contact both Pampers and Amazon. Hopefully, this next box will be the typical outstanding Pampers that we have known all along.I recommend Pampers Swaddlers to everyone. The 1-star rating is specifically for the defective product that I received. I give Pampers Swaddlers that I have used for 16 months a 5-star rating.
