review/summary: Too bigreview/text: I was never a pampers fan, but I started using them with subscribe and save a few months ago, and I have become a fan. My fault, I ordered a size larger this last time cuz the size 2 were getting a little snug, but these size 3 were way too big so I have switched back to size 2 in the LUVs brand. I would recommend using the Pampers, only if you do subscribe and save or don't mind spending the money. I Have always used Huggies, but I do like the pampers, but don't know if they are worth the huge extra price tag. That is the biggest downfall to me.
