review/summary: A life saver ... !review/text: I just moved to the middle-east since my husband lives here and so, when my baby turned four I was very worried of not being able to find anything age-appropriate for her. But a big THANKS to amazon and all those who reviewed this product, I was glad to find the jumperoo in a babies r us here and although it was most high priced item among similar products I insisted to buy this one because of the amazing number of positive reviews, and I'm glad I did. Because, my baby just loves it and can't get enough of it. Thanks amazon !!!
