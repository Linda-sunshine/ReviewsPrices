review/summary: best diapers hands downreview/text: love that it still has the line to tell you when its wet, cuz tho i can tell my hubby cant lol, he needs the line. they are blanket soft, smell like a baby, and do not leak even over night when my son sleeps 12 hours. better than any other diapers out there, better than huggies premium and with subscibe and save i save tons and get these that are not avail in stores in bulk amount at fraction of the cost. plus i live in a small town and saves me a 2 hour round trip to get the good diapers .
