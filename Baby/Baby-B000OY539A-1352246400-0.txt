review/summary: Not a Fanreview/text: We wanted to be moby lovers/users, but our daughter does not like being carried in it (she is now two months and has not liked being carried it in since the beginning). We are holding on to our moby wraps in the hope that she may change her mind as she gets bigger, but we find we get no use out of our moby and A LOT of use out of our slings. Also, the thing is SO LONG. We are each 5'9&#34; and the thing drags on the floor as you try to put it on. I know it works for some people, so if you decide to go this route best of luck, it just wasn't for our little girl.
