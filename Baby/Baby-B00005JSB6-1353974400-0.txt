review/summary: Half of diapers in box were missing tab to hold up diaperreview/text: What a disappointment! We thought this was good deal as we have ordered various Huggie products from Amazon before. Not this time! Over half of the diapers only had on of the connector tabs to hold up the diaper. Took this box from a 140 count to about a 60 count.
