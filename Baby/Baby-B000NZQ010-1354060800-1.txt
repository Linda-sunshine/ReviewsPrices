review/summary: Nice.. while it lasts!review/text: I bought this toy in Sept 2012 for my twins 1st birthday. My kids (my son in particular) absolutely LOVED it. They love pushing the buttons and zooming up and down the hallway with it.. Unfortunately, here we are in Nov 2012 and it's already malfunctioning. The sounds come out sounding like static and the rooster sound plays constantly no matter what other button my kids press. This would be a great toy, if I hadn't spent $35 for a mere 2-3 months of use.
