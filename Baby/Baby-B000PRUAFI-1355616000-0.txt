review/summary: best gate ever!!!!!!!review/text: We have tried soooo many different pressure mounted gates, but this one is the BEST hands down!!!! We bought to keep our 2 bulldogs secure from accessing different areas of the house. These gates are super easy to open by simply pulling back on a small lever and slightly lifting up and out. The BEST part is that the gate will auto-swing close so long as it's not opened 90 degrees in which it will remain open. Nice feature if you don't want your kid/dog to follow you through the gate if your hands are full with laundry or groceries, etc. Reasonably priced on Amazon and love that they are pressure mounted so that you don't have to ruin any walls/door frames!
