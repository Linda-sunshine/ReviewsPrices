review/summary: Love, Love, Love - You need this.review/text: This product is so fantastic I have bought three of them, one for each room my daughter may fall asleep in. We have the pink ladybug, the red ladybug and the twilight turtle. The stars are so sweet to look at and provide a nice nightlight for the little ones. it's really cool that the stars actually show constellations and the story book that comes with the package is fun.The auto turn off feature is great and seems to be the perfect amount of time for my daughter to fall asleep. It's small enough to be portable (we schlep it to grandma's house regularly) but a good size for kids to cuddle with too. Some of our friends came over with their kids, who are a couple years older than ours, and flipped when they found the ladybug. This is great for infants all the way to pre-teens. Heck, even my husband and I will put one in our room some nights because it's so fun to look at.I highly recommend this. You need it.
