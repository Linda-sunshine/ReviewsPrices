review/summary: These are great!review/text: I just got done redoing my little girls room for part of her Christmas.She walked in last night and glanced around at the $1000 of new furniture, bedding, etc. - and her eyes went straight up to the corners of her room where I had 2 of these nets hanging with all of her stuffed animals in them. She squealed and said &#34;I always wanted these in my room!&#34;SO I guess I could have saved a lot of money and she would have been just as happy with a few stuffed animal hammocks.Anyway ... these are great!
