review/summary: Mixed feelingsreview/text: I had high hopes for the Snoogle, but it felt cumbersome in my bed. Every time I got up or tried to roll over, I felt like I was wrestling with it. The cover it comes with is stiff and not soft. I wish it came with a jersey cover instead of having to pay an extra $20+ to get one. I haven't given up on the pillow as it might come in handy later in pregnancy, but currently, it's been moved off the bed.
