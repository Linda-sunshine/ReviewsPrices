review/summary: Mine melted!review/text: My daughter had her turtle for about a year and one day I went in her room and smelled something hot. To my surpirse, it was her turtle which was laying under another stuffed toy (not that heavy) that must have been holding her button down. She had heated up enough to melt herself to other stuffed animal and I had to throw them both away. Not as safe as I thought it was to begin with. Yes, I know a toy should not be laying on it, but my daughter is three and doesnt understand that. Would not buy another turtle for safety issues.
