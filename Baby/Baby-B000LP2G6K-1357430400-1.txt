review/summary: Works Well, Great Pricereview/text: We needed a crib and later play pen for a grand child. We were give a used crib without a mattress. We gave the crib back and got this. It is easy to assemble and pack up (read the directions first). It is easier to move from room to room and pack up when not needed. Last but not least, It cost just a little more that the mattress for the crib we were given for free.They also have great resale value. People look for them, but they are hard to come by.
