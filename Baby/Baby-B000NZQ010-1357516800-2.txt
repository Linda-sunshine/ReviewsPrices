review/summary: Great toy!review/text: Love this! My 8.5 month old refused to use his legs to attempt standing until he got this toy for Christmas. Now, he loves standing and holding on or sitting and playing with all the features & standing was 100% thanks to this learner toy. Great toy & already hours of great fun!
