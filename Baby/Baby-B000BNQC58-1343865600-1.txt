review/summary: Good purchasereview/text: Nice cheap alternative for stars...(you can not see stars in city...:()I also enjoyed this with my baby...Some of the lights are not as bright as others...but still works.Also have moon in there :)Don't really give baby to play with it...Looking directly into hole is little painful as light is bright inside :D So we keep it away from baby.
