review/summary: Surprisingly Awesomereview/text: When my husband bought me the Snoogle, I thought, "What in the world IS this?!" However, it has been surprisingly awesome. I have slept much better and have been flipping from side to side less often. It has especially helped by hip flexors, which would ache in the night. Now, I sleep much better. Although it does take up a bit of space, I find that I move around more, so my husband still at least has his share of the bed. I (pathetically) even travel with it now, because I sleep so much more comfortably.
