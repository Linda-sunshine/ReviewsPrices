review/summary: Not good as Pampers Swaddlersreview/text: By the time when I wanted the size 3 diapers for my baby, Pampers swaddlers were not available and I had to buy these after reading the reviews . The problem with these are they don't have the wet indicator and the baby dry don't absorb the runny poop and it tends to just go right up the back side of the diaper onto her outfit and usually whatever or whoever she is lying on.It's just not worth the money saved! I will only buy the Swaddlers from now on. Hope this helps someone wondering which to buy Swaddlers or Baby Dry, DEFINITELY go with the SWADDLERS!!This is almost the one of the existing reviews.
