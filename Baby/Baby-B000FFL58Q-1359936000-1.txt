review/summary: My kid loves it.review/text: Our little girl is 6 weeks at the moment.She seems to love this gym. Just like in the video from the other Amazon user she floor dances and is entranced by the lights and music.Other reviewers have stated they have an issue with the mirror hanging from the giraffes mouth.Umm.... Move it.All the toys are made so that you can move them to any of the 10 or so loops.Like other folks, It took me a few minutes to figure out that the butterflies do not spin on their own. It really looks like it should.Bottom line is that my little girl likes it - so I like it too.
