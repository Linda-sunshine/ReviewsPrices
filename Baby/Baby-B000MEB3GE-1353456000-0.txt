review/summary: &#128118;For My Sister in Law&#128118;review/text: I read all the reviews. I didn't know what to get my sister in law and husband for them for thier first baby. I'm so glad I bought this, they said out of everything they got, they used the itzbeen the most, they said it was so much help and LOVE IT!! A couple years later I got my nephew one, they loved it too!!! You can't go wrong especially first time moms and dads when everything is hectic, this keeps everything in order clips right to your waist..And can't beat the price! So if your looking to get someone about to have a baby, but they seem to have everything, or even if they dont have everything, get this, you won't regret it and they will be thanking you for it! &#128118;
