review/summary: Good buyreview/text: Amazon has the best price for this jumperoo. I paid under 70 and people are selling their used ones for the same price as I got mine new on here. My daughter didn't use it to much but that was more because I didn't put her in it enough. When she did use it she enjoyed her time in it. She loves the bird and frog hanging from the leaves and even when she wasn't in it she would stand around the jumper playing with the toys. The sounds aren't overly annoying either.
