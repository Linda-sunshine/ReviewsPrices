review/summary: Love it!review/text: As a first time mom, I was very excited to purchase this product so I can carry my baby close to me and not keep him in a carseat while shopping, going for a walk, etc.. of course I was a little nervous about making the purchase and wondered if this would hold my baby securely and comfortably.. after reading the instructions (i also checked out a few how-to videos on YouTube) I immediately felt comfortable putting my child in this. The stretchy material holds my baby close to me and the fabric is very comfortable on my shoulders. I absolutely love this product!Make sure to order your product in your pre-pregnancy size!
