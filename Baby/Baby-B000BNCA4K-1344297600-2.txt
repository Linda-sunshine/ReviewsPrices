review/summary: Worked great for mereview/text: I can't explain the poor reviews so I just wanted to share my experience. The colors did not bleed, there was not plastic tory smell, both my baby and toddle like it.Both kids like the colors and my baby likes to bat at it and grab it. He can also wave it around without me worrying about him hitting himself.
