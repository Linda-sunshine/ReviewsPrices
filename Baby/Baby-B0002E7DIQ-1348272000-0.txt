review/summary: Never thought I'd be devoted to a pillowreview/text: I was skeptical about buying this after reading some of the negative reviews and I'm usually pretty frugal but I was desperate for relief from aching hips and tossing and turning. I'm 22 weeks and was tired of fighting with 5 different pillows every night so I decided to try this. I'm so glad I did! I started sleeping with it upside down and using my own pillows for my head like someone suggested because I'm tall but I didn't get much relief (it felt like my hips were too elevated) and my neck was a little uncomfortable at a different level. So I switched to using it the right way and I love it. I can curl around it and it is firm enough to support me while still being soft and cozy. It is firm but not so firm that it bothers my neck. I do use a regular pillow between my feet to keep them at the same level as my hips because my legs are longer than the pillow. I love that I can turn over and get comfy again right away on the other side too.To address some of the criticisms, I could see how the seam around the neck area could be uncomfortable on bare skin (though I haven't tried it). I just wear a sleeveless tank or a t-shirt that covers the top of my shoulders and I'm fine. It doesn't dig in at all. I also don't think it's super hot like other people said. It is warm because you're in a little pillow cocoon but for a good night's sleep, I'll turn on the fan and get a lighter blanket! It will be nice in the winter too. It fits fine in our queen size bed though my husband and I are pretty small people. We affectionately call it "the donut" and it's a little hilarious when I get up to pee in the middle of the night and "lift the gate" to get out of the pillow. I'm so happy I bought this!!
