review/summary: Affordable & attractive.review/text: I love our glider. I have been using it every day for just under four months and have had no issues with it. No weird sounds, no screws loosening, all the pads stay put and the side flaps stay snapped with no problem. The bottom pad is a tad thin, but not enough to where it bothers me. I don't sit in it for hours on end, I rock my son and feed him in it before naps & bed time. Have no issues with discomfort. My husband, who is larger than I, says it's not comfortable to him though. Obviously this will vary from person to person.Looks very nice. Was easy to put together. Have no issues so far!
