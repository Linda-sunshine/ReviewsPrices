review/summary: Excellent Product!review/text: I bought this for my daughter's room. I am surprised at how much it holds. We put it in a small corner and did not stretch it out as large as it could go, and it still holds about 10 Build-a-Bear sized stuffies, along with several more medium and small ones. If it were stretched out all of the way, the capacity would be huge. My only complaint is with the wall anchors. They came right out. I had some of my own that I ended up using, so it worked out.
