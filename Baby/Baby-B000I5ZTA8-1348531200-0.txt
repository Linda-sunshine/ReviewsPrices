review/summary: No Back Pain Relief from this Belt!review/text: I am 35 weeks and started getting mid to lower back pain on one side only a couple of weeks ago. When I went for a prenatal massage and evaluation - its just a knot in my back that's formed from the baby's weight and its pressing down on part of a sciatic nerve. I researched and thought I'd buy this belt because I saw the good reviews - I'm 5'5, started at 118 and am now 145 so the medium was the right choice but the belt doesn't help anything.I took it on vacation with us when I knew I'd be walking alot, wear it at my desk at work, wear it in the car, etc. but it doesn't help the pain at all and its not really supporting anything. I think something with a broader back brace and possible straps would work better so I'm going to buy the Soft Form and see if that works - sadly I threw away the packaging on this piece of crap so I can't return it - $ down the drain...sigh and no back pain relief. =(
