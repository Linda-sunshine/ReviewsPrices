review/summary: Potty time!review/text: I got this for my 11 month old because she was starting to tell us when she was wet and needed a change by pointing to her changing table or upstairs. Sometimes she would even tell us ahead of time. We are not planning to put any pressure to train at this age but we thought it would be good to have it on hand and get her familiar with it.To our surprise she figured out what it was for without a lot of fanfare and will go and stand on it or near it when she wants to use it. She doesn't use it every time, but has a handful of times and for sure is on the path to diaper freedom.Pros:Comfortable for the little one (she is about 20lbs)The inside comes out for cleaning and there are not any seams to gather gunk.Looks like a real toilet.Cons:Won't work as a seat on a real toilet.The back is smooth, slippery and tapered with no handle which makes it hard to grasp.Pro tip: If you are going to wear the inner liner like a top hat to make your child laugh, be aware she may try it on herself at some point. D'oh.
