review/summary: my niece absolutely loves this toyreview/text: i have to say that when we first bought the vtech walker for my niece she was not too sure as to what it was. but my husband and i bought this toy for her because my sister told me that she was having issues trying to get her to stand and walk.well after 3 weeks ryleigh is starting to figure out that the toy is not only to play with but it is meant to help her walk. my sister said that she was grateful that we were able to get this toy for her.she was so happy with it that she has also bought one for our child that is due in december. i really love the products from vtech because even after my niece masters walking she can still play with the piano and the other toys on the walker.
