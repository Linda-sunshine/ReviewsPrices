review/summary: Best walker toy for my 9 month oldreview/text: I bought this for my 9 month old daughter for Christmas. She loved it the minute we put it together, which was so easy. Right away she was trying to pull herself up to stand to play with it. Then we let her try to walk with it and she walked right away. She just started crawling two weeks before, so I couldn't believe she could walk with the toy. This is a great toy!
