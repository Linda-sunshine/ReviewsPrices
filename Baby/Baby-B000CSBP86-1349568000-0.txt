review/summary: Great for our newbornreview/text: We already had an Ergo but it's too big for our newborn so we decided to get a baby carrier from BabyBjorn. Our baby loves it. We started using it when she was about a month. (She's two months now.) she falls asleep almost instantly as soon as we put her in it and generally sleeps throughout the time she's in it. The carrier is easy to lock in and the straps are easy to adjust so my wife and I can take turns. We have tried to limit the amount of baby stuff we've been buying (we are New Yorkers living in a small apartment but the BabyBjorn is a definite essential. I'm glad we got it.
