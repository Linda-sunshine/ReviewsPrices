review/summary: They're fine.review/text: No little reward number codes, like the ones from the store. [[[EDIT 12/21/2012: I was incorrect! There are reward numbers on the inside of the individual packages!]]]Although size 1 diapers were getting small for my daughter, these seem quite large. She'll grow into them, I guess. We haven't had any leaks as a result of the odd sizing.These still have the yellow/blue stripe, and we like that.They have sesame street characters, a little older than the characters on the size 1 diapers.
