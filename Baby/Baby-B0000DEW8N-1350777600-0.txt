review/summary: Space saver and perfect for restaurants!review/text: Love this seat! We actually do not own a regular high chair. This little contraption attaches to any sturdy chair with a back. It is super easy to wipe down since it has no fabric except on the nylon straps, which are not too difficult to wipe if needed. It does come with a removable tray, but my son likes to lift it off, so we do not use it. It works just fine without. The food can go right on the tray without a plate. Even without the top tray which is smaller and can be put in the dishwasher (bonus if your child will use it, which they might!) the bottom part is still easy to clean.I love that the whole thing folds down and can be easily brought to a restaurant. Ever see most of the restaurant high chairs out there? Gummed up food all over the place. Most places seem to barely wipe them down, and as much as you may try, it is still pretty germy. Chances are, your baby will also chew on the sides of them. Also, you have to push them up to the table where they can knock over food, grab their plates, or pull at the tablecloth. With the built in tray of this booster, no special accommodations need to be made. Most restaurants have tables with regular chairs. The tray adjusts to your growing baby, and the seat can even be used without the tray as a regular booster seat. I love this thing!
