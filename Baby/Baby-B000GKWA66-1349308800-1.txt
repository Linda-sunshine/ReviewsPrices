review/summary: Wonderful sleep-helper - wish the timer wasn't mandatoryreview/text: We love the Sleep Sheep! White noise helped my older child fall asleep, but it was annoying lugging around a fan or air purifier with us. When my second was born, someone gave us the Sleep Sheep and it was the perfect solution - soft, portable, loud enough, with lots of soothing sounds. I also like how it attached to a carseat or crib or bouncy seat.My one complaint is that it has a timer for automatic shut off at 25 or 45 minutes, but there;s no option for it to just stay on - my daughter still sometimes wakes up when sleep sheep turns off and we have to sneak into her room to turn it back on again so she'll go back to sleep. I would give this product 1,000 stars if it would stay on all night!
