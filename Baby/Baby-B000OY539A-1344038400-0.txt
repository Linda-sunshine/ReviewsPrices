review/summary: OK (though warm and not always comfortable)review/text: I was using it as a last resort with my colicky baby. He didn't always seem comfortable in it, would kick and wiggle quite a lot, but after some bouncing and shushing, he would eventually go to sleep.It wasn't however too comfortable for me. It can get very warm. And my back hurt.I am now using the Ergo carrier instead. The baby is older, obviously. And I got the most breathable Ergo carrier out there. I have not been using the Moby Wrap for a lot time now.But really, this is a matter of personal preferrence. Don't expect the reviews to tell you whether it will work for you. Use you parent intuition.
