review/summary: Beware of 3 Day Window Shipping Policyreview/text: I ordered this Graco Pack N Play Playard to use as a gift. The Graco Playard is a wonderful product, but I found out FOUR (4) days after ordering that the recipient already had one. When I checked to see about returning the product, there was a notice that there was a return window of THREE (3) days from when the order was PLACED to return it and get full credit. I received the playard after 6 pm on day TWO (2). This is vastly different from the stated return policy for baby items in the help section.
