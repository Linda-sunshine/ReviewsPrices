review/summary: Space savers your wishes have been grantedreview/text: Are you tight on space at home? Are you looking for a chair for you little one to eat in? This is the booster chair for you. I think high chairs are a thing of the past since my home is limited on space. We have a high table and high chairs that we basically could convert one chair into her "high" chair using this deluxe booster seat. It is so easy to install, maintain and is easy to take on the road.I would still advise you don't leave your child unattended, but that's with any chair, high chair or any elevated seating arrangement.
