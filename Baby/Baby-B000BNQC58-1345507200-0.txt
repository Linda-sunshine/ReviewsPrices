review/summary: Absolutely adorable, bright and fun!review/text: We bought the adorable pink lady bug for our two little girls ages 4 1/2 and 2. This lady bug is super cute! The colors are so girly and fun and she has a sweet little face. Our girls absolutely love this night light and they look forward to going to bed each night to watch the moon and stars. The projection is bright and when we placed the lady bug on their dresser it lit up the entire ceiling. I like that the light shuts off automatically after 45 minutes. The girls take turns choosing a color each night. You can choose from blue, green or red. This really is a neat little night light. I am 33 years old and I was excited opening it for my girls. We are very happy with our purchase :-)
