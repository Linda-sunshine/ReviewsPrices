review/summary: Fun and cutereview/text: Three days before my 4 year old son's birthday I realized I hadn't bought him any presents. He told me he wanted a stuffed animal that glows. I thought about a glow bug. He explained that his friend has a puppy that has lights. I did a search on Amazon to see what they had and my son got all excited about the lady bug. It is cute. But it is even more fun in the dark! It projects stars and a moon on the ceiling. It has 3 colored lights and you can choose either of the three colors. Best thing is that it turns off after 45 minutes or so so the batteries don't die when he finally falls asleep.
