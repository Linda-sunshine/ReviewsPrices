review/summary: exceeded expectationsreview/text: I am always surprised at the earlier than expected delivery time on the diapers I order. I found out from my sister-in-law about Amazons program which allows you to set up automatic delivery. I love it! I am a first time mom and leaving the house to go buy diapers...usually at the last minute, saves me so much pain. Thanks Amazon!! I also love that I can skip an order or change my delivery date if I need another box sooner. Oh yeah, and if my little one grows I can change the size too, of course:)
