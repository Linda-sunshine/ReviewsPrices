review/summary: Good for the moneyreview/text: I needed a rocker to help transition from cosleeping. I put this together and was disappointed in the quality. It seems flimsy and creaked at first which would wake my 3 month old while she was dozing off. It doesnt recline as much as iI hoped, and its annoying when the kick stand is up and i need to move it because the rubber makes it impossible. I don't see us keeping this til toddler years though. You get ehat you pay for. I have the owl version and its really cute.
