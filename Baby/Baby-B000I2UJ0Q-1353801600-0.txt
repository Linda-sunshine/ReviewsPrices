review/summary: Can I give it 10 stars?review/text: I would be lost without our Jumperoo. My babies LOVE it. Hopping is their favorite activity. It's good exercise and fun for them, and the toys seem to interest them at different developmental levels. We got it when the babies were about 5 months old, and they couldn't touch the ground very well, but they still thought it was fun for a few minutes. Once they could bounce better, they became instant jumping addicts! It's pretty bulky and not easy to move from room to room, but it's colorful and fun and entertains the kiddos. Yes, the music is a little annoying. Welcome to parenthood.
