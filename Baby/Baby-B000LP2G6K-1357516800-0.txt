review/summary: Absolutely love this!! Have been recommending it to all my pregnant friends/ family members!review/text: I've been shopping around for one of these for a while. Best price and product!! :) There are support bars that help hold up the bassinet part, the toys are velcro to the toy bar, which has me worried on how long those will stay on, but my older kids have tugged on them a bit and haven't pulled one off yet. Otherwise I love how simple and big this is.
