review/summary: Love itreview/text: This is the most helpful item I bought! All the nurses at the hospital thought this was the best thing they had ever seen. It was so helpful in those first crazy days at the hospital and now keeps me on schedule with my feedings. I can't live without it. Everyone that sees it is amazed with it too. I can set the timer at night and it wakes me for my daughters next feeding. From now on this is what everyone will get from me for a shower gift.
