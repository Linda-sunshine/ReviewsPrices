review/summary: Junk...don't waste yoour moneyreview/text: This garbage came out of the box completely misaligned. There was no way to &#34;bend&#34; it back in place. It had a 4&#34; gap that could not be tightend. The steel is very flimsy. My advice to North States - take a look at your final product before shipping it!
