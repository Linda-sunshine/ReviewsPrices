review/summary: Could not have lived without!!!review/text: I reviewed every excersaucer and jumparoo out there, and this by far has the best reviews. I wish I would have purchased this earlier. If only it had higher baby weight limit, because we would still be using it.My son loved this jumparoo and it is as close to Disneyland as you can get for a 5 month plus baby.This allowed me to cook dinner while watching him have the time of his life. Anytime you need to make sure your baby is safe, contained and happy look no further.We have had 2 total because my son was bouncing so much that one of the springs broke. The springs are encased in fabric so thankfully there were no injurys. I called Fisherprice and made them aware of this issue and they sent me a refund.I purchased another and have kept avery close eye on it and it has been fine.Best baby purchase so far!
