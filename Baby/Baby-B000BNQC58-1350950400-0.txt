review/summary: A great nightlight, but could be improved...review/text: This is great for what it is, but there are 2 improvements I would have been willing to pay a little extra for.1) Selectable duration - this stays on for approximately 45 minutes. Given that it runs on batteries, it would be nice to have the ability to have it shut off after 15 and 30 minutes, in addition to 45. My daughter is asleep after about 10 minutes so a shorter duration would certainly lead to improved battery life.2) Ability to plug in to the wall - We've been through 2 sets of batteries so far, and she's had it for about 2 weeks. I ended up buying a decent battery charger and rechargeable AAA batteries.Overall it's great for what it is, and now my son wants one as well!
