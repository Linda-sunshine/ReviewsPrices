review/summary: Terrible, Leaky, Useless Diapersreview/text: We couldn't be more disappointed with these diapers. We bought them for our 20-month old daughter to wear at nighttime and not once have they kept her dry. They leak through the front, the legs, the back, you name it. Really poor quality and they've put us off Pampers for life. Stay away.
