review/summary: Pregnant? Probably want to consider thisreview/text: My wife was having a very hard time sleeping after she got past the ~18th week. This has helped her sleep more comfortably. It does take up a bit of room, but we have a queen size bed and I still fit easily (though I am fairly thin).
