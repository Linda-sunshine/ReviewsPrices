review/summary: Don't discount this pillow just because you think it's too bigreview/text: I will be the first to admit that I was on the fence with the necessity of a pregnancy pillow in the first place. I am not really too big yet considering I am 20w and I haven't been overly uncomfortable to this point. I also am pretty attached to the expensive and comfy Tempurpedic pillow I bought last year. With all the reviews I read for the Snoogle that implied it was huge and that you need to give up the pillow you use under your head, I had been eying the Compact Snoogle instead.However, I am happy to report that I love the full-size Snoogle AND I still can use my Tempurpedic pillow. I have the curly end pointing towards my feet hooking around me and have the L-shaped end wrap around my Tempurpedic pillow (between the pillow and the headboard) and down along the side of the bed. I have found that sleeping on my side either way is immensely comfortable. I am 5'11" and we have a Queen size bed and this pillow really isn't too large. Plus, because of how I have the pillow positioned (with it running along the outside of the bed) it isn't like I have a barrier between my husband and I.Don't discount the full-size Snoogle just because you think you need to give up the pillow you use under your head (if you're attached to it like I am). This is a really wonderful pillow.
