review/summary: Good until your child is 8 or 9 months - then totally scaryreview/text: At 8 or 9 months old, my son was strapped into this chair and threw his body forward with enough force to face plant onto a hard wooden floor with the chair on top of him. I was able to watch it on the monitor that has replay and it was totally scarry. Avoid.
