review/summary: Size 2 diapers are much thinner and clearly an inferior product. I am extremely disappointed.review/text: They do not look and feel the same as size 1 diapers I got through subscription via amazon. I had this problem with size N that I bought through amazon. They were different from size N I got at the hospital and didn't fit too well but I gave these another try since its such a good deal price wise! Size 1 pack turned out alright but size 2 which I received recently is definitely of much inferior quality. The perfume is stronger, the diapers are thinner, the mesh often comes off and white particles stick to my baby's bottom too. I suspect either they are poor quality seconds stock or they are old stock which is why the deal is so good. I am planning on cancelling this subscription if I find that store bought pampers of the same size are of superior quality.
