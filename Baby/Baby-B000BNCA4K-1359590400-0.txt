review/summary: Great for teething!review/text: This is my daughter&#8217;s go to toy. We bought two because one got stolen (Err borrowed extensively) by her bestie. Soft, flexible, and will not hurt anything if thrown, that&#8217;s been tested on me. =)Best part? Put it in the fridge or freezer for instant teether pain relief. Little square rattle in the middle keeps attention. The bright colors and whimsical nature just captivated our little one. I truly trust Manhattan Toys; I have never had a bad product from this company.Would strongly recommend
