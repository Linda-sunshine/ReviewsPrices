review/summary: Back to the best brandreview/text: Was away for the summer, and instead of shipping to another address, had been using another brand. When I got back home and my box of Pampers was waiting for me, I noticed the difference the first time I changed by baby. Was so happy to go back to the best brand. I have four kids under six, and have always had at least a couple kids in diapers at a time (even three at a time once!) and have been using Pampers Baby Dry for each one. Pampers have that yummy baby-fresh scent. Also the other brand that I was using (A store brand that people love and I don't know why) would immediately droop down the instant my baby made once. It made it look like her diaper was ALWAYS loaded instead of just a little wet. The Pampers are much more stable.
