review/summary: Booooo sleep sheep!review/text: There is no way that whoever made sleep sheep is a mother. With no continuous play mode, as others have complained, you are begging for your child to wake up in 45 minutes at best when it's soothing sounds suddenly cease to be. It's cute and all but cute does not equal sleep. I got a free white noise app on my iphone instead. If cute is all you're after, then sleep sheep's for you.
