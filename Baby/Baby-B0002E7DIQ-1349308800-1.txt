review/summary: Not meant for mereview/text: The concept is fabulous, but the pillow didn't fit my body. The biggest problem was my neck. The top portion for resting the head is not shaped well. It forced my head to be at an odd angle and strained my neck. Also, the curves for forming the body are not a one size fits all. Also, it's a big production to get in and out of this big nest.In the end, I returned this pillow and recreated the concept myself by buying two body pillows at Target, one for each side of my body. This way I get to use my own preferred pillow for my head. And I can get out of bed easier by moving just the one pillow out of the way to get out. Very important since we pregnant women get up several times per night.
