review/summary: Might Be Causing Diaper Rashreview/text: My baby is almost 4 months old and I just tried these 2 weeks ago. Still not 100% positive if it is a coincidence or not but my baby never had diaper rash before using these diapers. They fit well and hold a lot of fluid but having my baby cry because of diaper rash is not worth it.Other diapers we have used without diaper rash:Pampers SwaddlersHonest Brand Diapers.*** I gave it 3 stars because I am not 100% positive but I don't plan on using these again.
