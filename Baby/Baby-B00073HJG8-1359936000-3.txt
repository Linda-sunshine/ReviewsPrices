review/summary: Holds lotsreview/text: A lot of reviews on here say this hammock doesn't hold that many toys, but I have about 40-50 medium/regular sized stuffed animals hanging in this thing and it has done great. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because of the way they give you to hang it up. It is one of those screw hooks and they leave huge holes in your wall when you take it out.
