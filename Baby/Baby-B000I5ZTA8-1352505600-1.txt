review/summary: Love the product!review/text: I am so glad i got it now!Im 24 weeks along, and just started to show a few weeks ago.My belly grew drastically over the last month.I love the feel of the belt, and the support it provides to my back.I opted for size S - (I was size 4 pre pregnancy) - it fits me perfectly, and have plenty of room for expansion.
