review/summary: Thought it would be great, but not so muchreview/text: I bought this since other Mom's I know raved about it. First I paid $50 for what is basicly a HUGE piece of heavy fabric. You then have to practive wrapping this thing around you. It takes time to learn how to wrap it properly. If you want to go any where in public with this thing on you better put it on before you leave the house since you will never figure it out once you are away from a mirror. My daughter cried EVERY time I put her in this. She didn't like it at all. The two times I did get her to calm down and stay in it she got over heated quickly even though she was just wearing a onesie. This material is so thick and having that on the baby plus your body heat and your baby will be cooking! I gave up and returned it and so did some of the ladies I know after they had the same issue. Great idea, but huge fail. Not to mention if you really want to try this buy some fabric and wrap it around yourself for less then half the cost.
