review/summary: Been great!review/text: Very absorbent, my daughter has never had a diaper rash with these, they are flexible and we never have leaks! I would not recommend them for infants who are still only nursing or bottle fed. I stuck with the swaddlers until my daughter was eating more solid foods and things were a little more &#34;firm&#34; on the exit, if you know what I mean.
