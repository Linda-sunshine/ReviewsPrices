review/summary: Perfect for sensitive skinreview/text: After a nasty diaper rash, we switched to these on the pediatricians recommendation. They aren't as wet as other wipes but, they are gentle for tiny bums and chapped parental hands! No diaper rash problems since the switch (and nothing else was changed)!
