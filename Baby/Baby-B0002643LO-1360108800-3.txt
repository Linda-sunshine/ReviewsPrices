review/summary: Tried these after switching from Swaddlers. Going back to Swaddlers after I use up all the Baby Dry diapers.review/text: I decided to try these after only using Pampers Swaddlers because Baby Dry was a little bit cheaper. I'm going back to Swaddlers after I use up all the remaining Baby Dry diapers. The reason is because I can smell pee anytime my daughter pees in her diaper. She gets changed often during the day so its not a matter of the diaper being too full. I never had that issue with Swaddlers.Baby Dry diapers seem to hold up pretty well. I never had a leakage problem. In the mornings my daughter's diaper is very full since she sleeps through the night and so no changing the diaper all night long. Baby Dry diapers sure does hold all the pee and fortunately no diaper blow outs either.If I couldn't smell the pee, I would stick with these diapers. My co-worker used Baby Dry diapers and she said she never had a problem with smelling pee. So my recommendation would be to get a small package of these and see if they work for you before buying a bigger box. I bought the 246 count box so I have to stick with them for a while until I run out of these diapers.
