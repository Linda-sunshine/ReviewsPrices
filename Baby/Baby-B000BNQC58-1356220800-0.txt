review/summary: 1 Year old loves itreview/text: Thought my year old was a little too young for this but he LOVES it. He pushes all the buttons to turn on/off and changes the colors. He looks at the stars on the ceiling and oohs and aahs. The brown/yellow is a little too dim for the ceiling but if he has it in his crib this is perfect when he goes to bed since it's not too bright. Great price too - cheaper than in the stores!
