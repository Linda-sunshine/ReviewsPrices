review/summary: Raffie saved usreview/text: My son has always needed sound to fall asleep and before we got "Raffie" we would use the music on the swing or pack n play or aquarium, but you can only hadle the same songs for so long. The first time we used the giraffe we went to sleep imediately and slept great. The sound is low enough that you can sit on the couch and comfortably tune it out. We purchased the combo pack with the full size and travel size and I think for an infant I would only purchase the travel one. We take Raffie shopping evenwhere and he is always with us when we sleep. The full size one sits in the crib and does not recieve much love currently, but maybe when he is older it will get more use. I am probably going to purchase a second take along sized one for daycare.
