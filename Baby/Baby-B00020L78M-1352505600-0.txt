review/summary: Lifesaver - literallyreview/text: I shopped around and read reviews, and honestly this is the best thing I own for keeping my (now) 7 month old grandbaby. I purchased one locally, then found a much better deal online. I ended up with both sets and an extension. I kept the one purchased locally, but intended to return it. After baby began crawling, I opened it up quickly and set it up in another room. She LOVES it. She can crawl over a large area without being grabbed up and told NO. She can explore the area safely and if I need to attend to something, I put her in there with her toys and she doesn't seem to notice I have left the room. I don't have any trouble setting it up or taking it down. I thought they were difficult to adjust at first, because I thought I would break them. I discovered they are quite easy to adjust now that I am comfortable changing the configuration to fit my needs. I am actually looking for another set for outdoor use and for my 2 small dogs (baby really doesn't like being sniffed by the dogs). I can't say how it will hold up as she begins walking or pushing the fence, but it does come with anti-skid pads (that I haven't had to use). She pulls up on the fence and it wiggles, but doesn't move out of place. They may not add to the decor, but my baby's safety is much more important to me than 'looks'. I know that the Christmas tree will be protected with a fence this December, and I am already thinking of ways to safely decorate the fence. If any of those people who didn't like theirs want to sell it cheap, I am in the market.......
