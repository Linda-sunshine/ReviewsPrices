review/summary: Pregnancy Must Havereview/text: This pillow is an absolute must. I held off for a long time buying a pregnancy pillow. I thought I would be able to get through without one. But when I started having hip pains and all over discomfort to the point where I wasn't sleeping for more than 3 hours at a time, I caved in. I wish I would have bought this sooner.
