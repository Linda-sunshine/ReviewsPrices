review/summary: Great Carrierreview/text: I purchased this carrier for my husband to use with our baby. He wasn't comfortable with the sling and wanted to have something he could strap to his chest comfortably. He loves to tuck her in to snuggle and spend time together even when he needs his hands for other tasks.
