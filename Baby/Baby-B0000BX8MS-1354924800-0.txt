review/summary: Keeps baby warm and safereview/text: I'm one of those moms that followings the sleeping safety recommendations. So we don't have any cute bummers or stuff animals in the crib. When it started turning cold, I wanted to keep Baby warm but putting a loose blanket wasn't safe or effective since Baby would just kick it off and move to the opposite end of the crib. This blanket keeps her warm and safe. Its easy to put on as well. I already recommended it to all my friends.Baby is 9mo old and she can still stand up in her crib with this on. We will probably be moving to the one with the foot holes sometime soon.
