review/summary: Cute, but smallreview/text: This chair is very cute, sturdy, and well made. The only thing is it is a bit too tight I'm 5'5&#34; and 160 lbs during pregnancy it felt a bit tight on the sides. After baby was born its comfy, but would go for a bigger size or different chair. Other wise great chair for the price. Would recommend.
