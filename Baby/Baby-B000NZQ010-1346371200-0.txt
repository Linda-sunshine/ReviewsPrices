review/summary: Great toy for difference age rangesreview/text: I first got this for my daughter when she was 9 months old. She was not able to walk with it then, she would hang on to the handle and then fall forward as the walker would move too fast out in front of her since she wasn't moving her feet. She wasn't ready yet, but absolutely loved playing with the detachable toy panel part and still does. Her favorite part is the little door that opens and says peekaboo! Now that she is 10 months we tried again walking and she is getting the hang out with but is still pretty wobbly and can't steer but she has so much fun that she gets mad when it's time to stop. We have to help guide her and control how fast it goes and now she wants to walk all the time! Check out her face in my picture, it is priceless. Good toy, but you just have to use you own judgement on when your baby is ready for it.
