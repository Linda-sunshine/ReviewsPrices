review/summary: Baby loves this thingreview/text: OK I'll admit it. I thought my baby would be interested in this thing but only just enough to hold her attention for a few minutes on a few occasions. She loves it. Like loves it alot. The music will play for 20 minutes straight through and she'd probably sit through it twice. It's just a couple of flashing lights and some music (and the occasional nature sounds which she doesn't really care for) but it captivates her attention. She's 4 months now and is big on reaching for the toys and interacting and the toy is growing with her because it has these features (toys to pull on and play with). It's also good for tummy time because there are interactive features sown into the bottom of the mat for her to find and play with. Totally worth the money.
