review/summary: bad fit, many &#34;blow outs&#34;review/text: I don't know if this a &#34;2nds&#34; product. When the same product was bought at Target, the fit was great, no leaking, no blowouts. When bought through Amazon....nothing but problems. The only reason delivery continued is because I forgot to terminate it, then my baby was on to a different size.
