review/summary: As promised..review/text: We are very happy with the booster seat. It performs as promised and travels well. The straps around the back and underneath fasten securely, but are easily latched and unlatched. The adjustment in the height is a nice feature, as well, that a lot of other booster seats we looked at did not have. Overall, very pleased with the seat (Adelaide loves it, too).
