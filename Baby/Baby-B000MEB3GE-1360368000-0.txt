review/summary: Poor qualityreview/text: The clip that you would use to attach this to your pants, shirt, etc broke on us after being dropped onto our carpeted floor (from about 4 feet high). Disappointed in the quality. Does the job ok, but we found using pen & paper worked better for us as you could see the whole day, not just when the last feeding, diaper change, etc was.
