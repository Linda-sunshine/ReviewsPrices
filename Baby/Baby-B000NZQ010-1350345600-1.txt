review/summary: Activities enjoyable but not very safe in walker formreview/text: The activity panel is varied in activities and is detachable which is nice.However, safety-wise, the overall walker is lightweight so it's very easy for baby to topple it onto themselves. The back wheels are designed to lock but they still turn, just a little sluggishly. Also, the wheels are so slippery that the unit will slide around on carpet anyways. We haven't tried it on any other flooring. As a walker, it's more suitable for babies who have mastered walking, not those learning how to.The activities are varied and fun so this maybe would have been better as an easel set up or just the detached panel on its own.
