review/summary: Very entertainingreview/text: Gave this to my 8 month old grandson at Chirstmas. As expected he was more interested in the bows and paper - until this was opened and the batteries (provided) were put in. He loved it, immediately started playing with it. After a short while his dad put it away so more presents could be opened - my grandson showed his displeasure and it was brought back out. He isn't walking yet so is just using the activity center part. We liked that it made many different sounds depending on how it was used. Think this will hold his attention for a long time. May have to buy another one to keep at our house!
