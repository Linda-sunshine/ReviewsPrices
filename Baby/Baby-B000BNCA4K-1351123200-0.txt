review/summary: Loved this Winkel!!!review/text: We bought this product because a friend of ours had sold us on the idea that it was easy to grasp and made a little rattling sound whenever shook. We gave it to our 3 month old son and he loved it. It was very easy to grasp and shake and helped him grasp the idea of grabbing, shaking, "theres something in my hand" type of skills. I would recommend this product to anyone.
