review/summary: Excellent gatereview/text: We purchased 4 of the gates for our stairwells. A breeze to install. Very sturdy, our 2 year old has already given them a work out! Comes with 2 extensions which is a nice bonus, especially for the price! The bronze color is almost black, so blends well with our railings. Best of all, compatible with the Kidco Y Spindle for attaching to wrought iron railings!
