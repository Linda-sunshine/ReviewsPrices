review/summary: Very comfortablereview/text: I am now 27 weeks pregnant. Before getting pregnant I was a back sleeper and when I got pregnant I knew that I would have to sleep on my side eventually so I started practicing very early on so that I would be reasonable comfortable. I tried everything to get comfortable: a pillow behind my back, one between my legs, a body pillow, etc. At first I was okay, although I woke up several times per night on my back and would have to roll over. Once I got to about 5 1/2 months though I was more and more uncomfortbale and in more pain. This pillow has been a lifesaver. I still wake up occasionally throughout the night but am in less pain, am able to fall back asleep quicker, and am more comfortable. I sleep with the long part behind my back to provide support and so I don't have to worry about rolling completely over on my back. The pillow is a little pricey but worth it!
