review/summary: Best pregnancy purchase...buy one now!!!review/text: I thought this pillow was a little overpriced when I ordered it, but it has been worth EVERY penny. I ordered it around my 5th month of pregnancy and have slept with it every night since. It is so comfortable and fits just fine in in our queen size bed. I was sleeping on my side with it, but with increasing heartburn over the past few weeks I have started wrapping the snoogle behind my back to sleep with my head elevated. This thing is a lifesaver. Also, I didn't realize this when I ordered it, but it actually comes with a removable pillowcase so unless you want it a specific color or pattern, don't waste your money on the pillowcases!
