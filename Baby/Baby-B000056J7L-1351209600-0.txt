review/summary: Great starter potty!review/text: This is a great first potty. Our son can practically jump into it and it doesn't wobble or tip, even on carpet. He likes to be able to lean on the back and uses the sides of the back to help sit down. I was so glad we got the red version - the first thing he said was "Elmo's potty!" when we opened the box! It is so easy to pop the bottom out and clean the bowl, since it doesn't have any edges it wipes down in seconds. Also, this was the potty that had the tallest middle piece for little boys, tall enough to catch the pee without being so tall that it gets in the way. However, sometimes little boy pee has a way of going over the top, anyway. I would definitely recommend this potty to start, and also the Bjorn seat insert for later. They make very dependable and easily cleanable products for little ones.
