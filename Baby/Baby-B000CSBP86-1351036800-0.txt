review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I love my Baby Bjorn! It was exactly as described and I love that it can easily be adjusted to fit me or my husband. The fabric is very durable and easy to wipe off. I also love that you can just throw it in the washer when it gets dirty. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a way to keep baby close and still have your hands free!
