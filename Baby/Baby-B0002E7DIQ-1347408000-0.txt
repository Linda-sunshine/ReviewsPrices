review/summary: LOVE! Great pregnancy sleep aid!review/text: I have had back trouble since I was a teenager and being pregnant made it worse. My lower back has hurt for weeks and using a body pillow didn't help when I needed to change sides. I'm 16 weeks pregnant and haven't gained a pound, but sleep was horrible. I got this pillow and expected it to take a while to get used to since its a lot fluffier than what I normaly sleep with, but the first night I slept like a baby for the first time in weeks! My back and neck feel great! LOVE! This pillow is big, but definitely worth it for good sleep!
