review/summary: Quality Productreview/text: We purchased this play yard for our Border Terrier puppy. We wanted him to have some room to roam and play during the day while we couldn't be home to watch him and yet not have him always confined to his crate. We placed a piece of linoleum under the bottom and can easily move it from room to room so he can also be in it while we can't watch him 100%. He can see through it and doesn't complain about being in it. Our daughters can get in and play with him in the play yard as well. The construction is solid and seems like it will last. We have had it two months so far and no complaints. It comes with pads you can place on the bottom so it won't damage your floors either.
