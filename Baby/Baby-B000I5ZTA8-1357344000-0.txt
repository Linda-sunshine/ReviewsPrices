review/summary: True to sizereview/text: After reading several other reviews about this running small, I ordered the Large (I'm 5'5, 180-ish lbs normally, plus 30+ for pregnancy...) but wish I would have ordered one size smaller. This one fits me on the tightest hooks, and not knowing how much larger I'd get during pregnancy, I wanted to be more safe than sorry. In hindsight, I'd recommend ordering whatever size you are around your 7th month and hold on to the packaging so you can exchange it for a different size if needed. It really does relieve some of the weight on your back though!
