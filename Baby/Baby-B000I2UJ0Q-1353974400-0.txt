review/summary: OMGoodness! Love this!review/text: I purchased this for my four month old grandson for Christmas, but gave it to him early, as he loves to stand and jump. Once he realized he could bounce (with the help of a pillow under his feet), the fun was on!! The music and lights are great. The colors are bright. After almost 45 minutes of fun, his mother removed him from the jumparoo. Upon removal, he made his objection loud and clear. I am very glad I purchased this.
