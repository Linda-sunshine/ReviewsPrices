review/summary: Versatile Walkerreview/text: The walker has settings on the wheels to restrict extremely fast movement, which helps kids from flying across the room. The setting can be adjusted to allow them to &#34;fly across the room&#34; when they get better at using it. The activities on the front can be removed to play with on the floor, which is a nice feature. Good walker.
