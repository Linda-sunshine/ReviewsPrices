review/summary: Great for newborns & infants but...review/text: I bought the ktan for my newborn who was 7-9 @ birth. She really snuggled up & slept well in the kangaroo position until about one month, then she started wanting to stretch her legs out. I haven't tried the hug position yet because I'm not sure how it will work since she doesn't have head & neck control yet. I will update again later.
