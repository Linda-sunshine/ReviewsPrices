review/summary: Easy to clean and transportreview/text: My 12 month old has been using this booster seat for a couple of months. I keep it in the car to use when we're out and about. It's super portable-(even has s shoulder strap), and is easy to clean. He seems pretty comfortable in it too. In hindsight I wish I hadn't bothered with a traditional high-chair and used this instead.
