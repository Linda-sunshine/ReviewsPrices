review/summary: Great Teething and Motor Skill Toyreview/text: ~BACKGROUND~I bought this toy for my 3 month-old son after reading so many positive reviews.~PROS~- Bright colors.- Refrigerate for cooling teething.- Soft, pliable, flexible bands.- Gentle rattle.- Claims to be PVC and phaelate free.- The bands are thin enough for younger infants to grasp vs typical teethers/toys that are bigger and more difficult for them.- The numerous bands make this a "multi-directional" teether unlike typical teethers that can only be used one direction.~CONS~- Slightly concerned about the lack of information regarding the PVC and phaelate subject as brought up by many reviewers on here. Hence the 4 star rating instead of 5.~TIPS~- As with anything your baby puts in his/her mouth, use non-toxic products like:Babyganics Toy Cleaner - 17 oz- Use withBaby Buddy Secure-A-Toy Strap - 4 count (BOY)to secure to the carseat/highchair.~CONCLUSION~This is my son's favorite toy. It's easy for him to grasp and hold with either or both hands and he can put any part of it into his mouth without much difficulty. I highly recommend this toy to every parent!
