review/summary: good maskreview/text: I have had this mask for several years, and I really like it. It blocks light well and is comfortable (soft, gentle on eyes, doesn't have to be too tight to work). The only drawbacks are that the elastic stretches out after awhile, and it can slip around. For me this isn't too big of an issue because once I am able to get to sleep I do pretty well, but if someone is very light sensitive this may bug them.Overall a good mask.
