review/summary: Disgusting and lastsreview/text: My boyfriend got this for me because he's so sick of always seeing my picking at and biting my nails. My parents, at this point, have given up all hope. I've never tried anything like this but it's only respectful to at least try a product that is given to you.Simply... disgusting. Wretched. Dear God why... My boyfriend told me about some of the reviews so the first day I was REAL good about not biting them, which incidentally makes me not want to pick at them either because of the temptation that brings to bite them. First thing this morning, without even thinking about it, I went to bite of the smallest little piece of nail. I didn't even realize I was doing it but that God-awful taste sent a shocking inexplicable surge. My immediate reaction was to spit into a cup but I didn't have one so I spit down onto my feet, which I'm pretty sure scared my passenger-boyfriend. It certainly makes me a lot more conscious of how often I bite them.I'm not sure how to describe the taste, but I would say more like a chemical taste. It kind of burns for about 30 seconds, but not like an acid burn. The only down side is that since my habit was so bad, I kept doing it by accident and my sense of taste was altered for most of the first couple of days because I had basically embedded it into my lips and tongue. But I can honestly say, after about 20 years of nail biting it actually is becoming rapidly less appealing to me. I'm not getting the same enjoyment at all, and quickly becoming conditioned to equate nail biting with BAD.It goes on real shiny and clear and really does last for two days as advertised, but it does start losing a little of its potency so I've been applying it daily.Sorry for the long review. This product has already helped me a lot in the last few days, and is more jarring than when my mom and boyfriend smack me for doing it. I can only imagine how it is for little kids that suck their thumbs.
