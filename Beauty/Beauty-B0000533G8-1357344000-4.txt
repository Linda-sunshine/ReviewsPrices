review/summary: Leaves a film in your hairreview/text: If you use this a a shampoo I would recommend using this then following up with a normal shampoo. If not, this leaves a film in your hair that you'll notice in your comb after a few uses. It's also really hard to comb your hair after using it.Tea tree oil is supposed to stimulate the scalp/hair follicles and help fight dandruff, so it is good for that. My hair is long and thinner and when I use this with a regular shampoo it gives it the perfect amount of weight to it and actually makes it feel thicker. It's a good price for a tea tree oil shampoo too since they can be quite expensive.
