review/summary: Best soap on the market!review/text: I've been reading some reviews claiming that Dr. Bronner's is now diluted and not as strong as it used to be. I haven't noticed a difference, but even if it is true, I still think it is an amazing value! I use this soap for everything, even on my face. Of course you want to DILUTE! DILUTE! especially if you want to use it on your face or other sensitive areas. I use only one drop, then fill the palm of my hand with water to dilute and make a bubbly foam. My face feels clean, tight, cool and fresh thanks to that peppermint oil! A couple of drops with some baking soda make a great scrub for sinks and tubs, and super diluted (5 parts water to 1 part soap) is great for dishes.
