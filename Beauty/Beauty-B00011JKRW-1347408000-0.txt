review/summary: Beautiful Colorreview/text: This is absolutely a beautiful color. I wear this often, and it may be my all time favorite China Glaze color. I get compliments from strangers in a store on this color because it changes colors depending on the lighting. The color is great on long or short nails, and does not show wear. Try it you will fall in love with it.
