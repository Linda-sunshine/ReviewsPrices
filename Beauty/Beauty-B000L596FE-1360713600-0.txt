review/summary: Works well; rubbery smellreview/text: Does wonders for detangling my 7 year old daughter's hair, even when dry. She used to avoid brushing her hair but this brush does the trick - she even snuck it into her room and brushed on her own. Very nice!One star ding for the annoying smell. It's only been a few days so hopefully the smell goes away, but out of the package it was like new car tires... Today was better.
