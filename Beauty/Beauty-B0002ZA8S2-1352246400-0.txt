review/summary: Hot Tools Curling Ironreview/text: AWFUL EXPERIENCE! Used curling iron for the first time on low heat and FRIED my hair right off! The second time I tried to turn it on, it no longer heated up. Must have been a short in the curling iron or it was defective. I'm out the money I paid since it was opened from the package & still don't have a working curling iron...Will never purchase Hot Tools again!!!!!
