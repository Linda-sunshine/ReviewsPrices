review/summary: Easiest way to achieve really great curls or waves!review/text: As someone with very stubborn straight hair I always admired curled and waved hair from afar but never attempted it myself. Recently, I've been watching more beauty videos on Youtube and noticed many girls with hair like mine using this product to achieve very effortless looking curls and waves. After much hesitation I decided to treat myself for my birthday and was really impressed with this product. It looks very expensive with it's gold finish and even has heat settings. The highest heat setting worked best for my hair and I was shocked by the ease of this product. There are many different looks that you can get with the 1 1/4&#34; iron which is the one I got. You can get soft curls or bouncy waves. I would recommend this product to anyone.
