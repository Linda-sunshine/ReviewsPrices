review/summary: Affordable and Functionalreview/text: I have owned the 1- inch version of this Flat Iron for a few years. When my daughter began straightening her hair in the mornings, I purchased this 2-inch model for her.FEATURES:-Heats up quickly. Ready to go in a mere 30 seconds.-Can use on damp hair. Even though it's named &#34;Wet 2 Straight&#34;, I wouldn't recommend using it on sopping wet hair. That would take a very, very long time. I blow dry my hair until it's at 75% dry before using this flat iron.-Automatic shut off, but only after an hour. My daughter keeps her flat iron on a heat-proof surface, just in case.-2-inch wide plates allow my daughter to dry and straighten her hair more quickly.-Great value for the price. My Wet 2 Straight has lasted for four years and is still going strong. The cord is perpetually twisted now, but that's my only complaint.-Effective. I have straight hair and my daughter's hair is slightly wavy. The flat iron works great for both of us. Neither of us have curly hair, so I'm not sure how well it would work in that case. It does tame those wiry gray hairs that like to stick up on the top of my head.-Adjustable temperature range of 300 to 425 degrees.This flat iron may not be top of the line, but it gets the job done and will hold up to daily use over time. Best of all, the price is right. I'm pleased with this purchase.
