review/summary: Get a good night sleep!review/text: I have trouble sleeping at night where I keep tossing and turning and then I wake up early in the morning because the light from the sun is just too bright. I&#8217;m sure many of you have that problem also. So, I decided to buy the Dream Zone-Earth Therapeutics sleep mask and give it a try. First of all, it is much cheaper than many of the other sleep masks I saw on Amazon which made me skeptical but I have to say...it really works. It was very comforting over my eyes and in the morning it blocked out the sun. There is a slight smell of lavender but it goes away after a few uses. I bought some lavender spray that I use on the mask and it makes it even more relaxing. I would definitely recommend this for people who have a hard time sleeping. It really is relaxing and I got it for the cheap price of $6.35. So how can you go wrong? Go ahead and give it a try!
