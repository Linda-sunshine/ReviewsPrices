review/summary: Old product designreview/text: In the last year or so, Bare Minerals came up with a new container design, and the item shipped to me was in the old container. This can only mean that the product is at least a year old, if not more. I'm sure it is just fine, but that's the reason it's cheaper than what you find at Ulta or Sephora.
