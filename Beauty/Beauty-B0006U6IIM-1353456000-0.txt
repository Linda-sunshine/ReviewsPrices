review/summary: Really versatile productreview/text: I recently read something in a beauty magazine about using almond oil as a deep conditioning hair mask, so I decided to try out this NOW version since NOW products have always impressed me, and I was intrigued by the high reviews of this, which also praised its versatility. For the last few years, I've used coconut oil as my go-to natural beauty product, but this one will easily be going neck and neck with it!As a hair mask, apply a generous amount of this to your hair, leave on for twenty minutes, and then shampoo out. The result is soft, moisturized hair. I've also been applying a few drops of this to the ends of my hair to add shine and softness.A few drops on the face after washing also leaves a lovely glow to your skin. While I've tried it as an eye makeup remover, I've found that it tends to get in my sensitive eyes and irritate them.It also works well as a body moisturizer, and leaves your skin with that same glow.Unlike some other brands, the NOW version is also 100% pure almond oil.A little goes a long way, so the 16-ounce bottle will definitely last quite some time!
