review/summary: My favorite straightener!review/text: Everyone pretty much raves about CHI products, and I agree. I love this straightener. I had the exact same one before and it works so well. I have really curly hair and it straightens beautifully, without a lot of friz. It isn't recommended for wet hair, but I've used it when my hair was not completely dry when I was in a hurry, and it worked well. I had this for about a year and a half (used 2+ times a day shared around) and it's just now showing wearing of the hot plates. I'm ordering a new one since I gave mine to my brother.There aren't buttons for temperature of settings, so there's no fuss yet it is still a pretty hot straighter, just what I need. It glides like butter, promise.
