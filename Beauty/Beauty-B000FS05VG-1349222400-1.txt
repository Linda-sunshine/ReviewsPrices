review/summary: Mediocre-to-poor blowing speedreview/text: The heat level is fine, but the highest wind or blowing speed feels like medium/light. As a male with medium-length hair, I don't see how someone could recommend this particular product (compared to the 10 other options out there at c. $20) to anyone with longer-than-short hair.
