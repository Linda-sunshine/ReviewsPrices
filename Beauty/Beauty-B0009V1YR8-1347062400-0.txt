review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I have been wanting a Chi flat iron for so long but never bought one because of its price. When i found this one for about $65 I was ecstatic. That didnt last long.It arrived within a week and i couldnt wait to use it. I plugged it in and a few minutes later i smell something burning. I pick up the flat iron and both plates are slowly falling off and the black plastic holding it together melts away. Almost like goo!I have many friends and know stylist who use Chi flatirons or brands with no issues. Im not sure i would blame chi or the seller. Its possible the iron was broken before and cheaply fixed. Not sure but overall it was a disappointment. The only good thing was how fast i recieved my refund.Lesson learned: Sometimes paying more is worth the time and money.
