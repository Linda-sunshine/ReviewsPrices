review/summary: Still the same old Dr. Bronner'sreview/text: I have been using this since I was a young boy. It seems like the same peppermint soap that I have been using since then. If you are using this for the first time you may feel like you are burning sensitive areas of your body due to the peppermint. I would suggest putting soap on washcloth and adding some water to prevent that. This soap will have you smelling good when you step out of the shower. I highly recommend this soap.
