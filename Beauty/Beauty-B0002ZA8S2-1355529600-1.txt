review/summary: Worth the moneyreview/text: This is a great product..I don't know why I didn't purchase this item sooner. I've always thought my hair was the type that just could't keep a curl but realized that it was actually the hair tool I was using. My hair dresser suggested this tool as this is the one that she uses on her clients. I took her suggestion and purchased it and I have no regrets. The curls last all day and even till the next morning! I would definitely suggest this to friends or any one in the market for a curling iron...also, I love that you can adjust the temperature on the curling iron.
