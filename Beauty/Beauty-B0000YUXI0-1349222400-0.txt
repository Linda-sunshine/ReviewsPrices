review/summary: Doesn't Workreview/text: My 5th grade daughter bites her nails. She wanted to try this product in hopes it would help her stop biting her nails. However, she says that it doesn't taste that bad, and she continues to bite her nails anyway. (I personally think it tastes awful, but I'm not the one with a nail biting problem.)
