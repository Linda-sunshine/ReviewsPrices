review/summary: Best Make-Up Sponge Everreview/text: This sponge is so soft - I use it to apply eye cream, concealer and foundation. I love it because it blends the make-up into my face perfectly so it looks more natural! Because the material is so dense (but super soft!), it is a little difficult to clean. (I would not waste my money on the cleaner that you can buy specifically for the Beauty Blender - I tried that but really, a little soap and hot water works just as well!) Love this product so much I bought it for my teen girls - so they wouldn't take mine! :)
