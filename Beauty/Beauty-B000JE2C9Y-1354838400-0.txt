review/summary: Second one purchasedreview/text: I had bought this originally at a Bed Bath and Beyond store. I had left it in my mom's car when we went on a road trip and I was so bummed and had to find it online. I was lucky enough to find the same one here on Amazon.com. I loved and still love it! it is perfect! I work nights a lot and it really helps me get a better sleep when I cant see any light. The band around the head is not too tight and the little pockets under the eyes really help to block out the light. I recommend this to all of my friends who ask me about my sleep mask!
