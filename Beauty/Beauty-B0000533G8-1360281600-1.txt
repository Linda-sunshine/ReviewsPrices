review/summary: Dr. Bronner's Castile Liquid Soap Organic - Citrusreview/text: I've been using Dr. Bronner's Liquid Castile Soaps for over 40 years. (I can no longer read all the fine print on the label). All of them clean gently and thoroughly. Use it on your face or body without worry. It's safe on kids; I've used it on mine and now the grandkids use it. This Organic Citrus is a new scent and I think it's the best so far. It's fairly expensive but worth it.
