review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: This cologne I gave to a present for my father for Christmas. He loves it and so do I because he lets me use it sometimes. The smell is amazing, unlike most colognes that are over powering, this is just the right hint and lasts long! Most colognes will where off in a few hours but this one stays for the entire day, and it smells awesome. It's awesome, and I am usually all over the Giorgio Armani, this is definitely a good tie with Acqua di Gio. They do not smell the same, but they both smell amazing.
