review/summary: Works as good as ever!review/text: I used to buy these all the time, and was very impressed with how they worked. I switched over to other exfoliants and sort of forgot about these strips for a while. Well, I am once again a loyal customer, because the proof is immediate on how great these little strips work. My skin is no where near as oily as it used to be, so I won't need to use them quite so often. However, they are absolutely effective in improving the appearance of your skin, and I will definitely make Biore Pore Perfect strips a regular purchase!Whenever you feel the need for a deep cleansing, Biore will definitely work for you.
