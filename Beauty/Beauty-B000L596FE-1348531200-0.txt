review/summary: Kinky hair.review/text: First let me say my child has had a ton of hair ever since she was born. Now that she is two it is so much longer and thicker. I always feel bad for my child because she has so much hair and it is hard to comb through. I tried a lot of products to detangle her hair and everything I have tried did not work until now. This brush should be called the miracle brush because it performs miracles by detangling my child's hair. I still use the comb afterwards but the comb goes right through. Thanks to whoever made this product. It is wonderful!
