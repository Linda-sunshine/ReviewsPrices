review/summary: Mintyreview/text: Been using this for years. A little goes a long way, and it gets you clean and minty. Makes your eyelids and, um, some other parts, tingle like mad, to the point of being nearly annoying, but it is a transient sensation. Don't get this stuff in your eyes while wearing contacts, burns like hell. But that is true of many soaps. I use this stuff for both soap and shampoo, it is gentle enough for that, at least for a (non-metro) guy.
