review/summary: Good sponge but....review/text: I have been a make up artist for 20+ years and this is one of the better sponges that I've used because of the shape. However, I do not feel it is anywhere near worth what they are charging for it - downright ridiculous in my book. I will try the Monster bundle next time - much better value and I am guessing on-par quality.
