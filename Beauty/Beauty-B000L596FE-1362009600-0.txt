review/summary: Do you have long girly hair?review/text: I do. I love my luscious locks. You wanna know how I take care of such a beautiful yet manly head of hair? With this brush. That's right. I said manly. Because even though I use a bright neon colored brush, I am still a man. With a manly beard nonetheless. But enough about me; let's talk about the brush. I'm Mexican so I can say this. I have Mexican hair. Sometimes my hair stands in front of the home depot looking for work...but not for very long because it's beautiful, and beautiful things always get picked up and aren't out of work very long. Thanks to this brush. No tangles, no ouchies, just long gorgeous hair. Get some.
