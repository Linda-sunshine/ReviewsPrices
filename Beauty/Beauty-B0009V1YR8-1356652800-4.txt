review/summary: Warranty denied for being &#34;Not a genuine Farouk Systems, Inc. item&#34;review/text: My girlfriend liked the item just fine the four months it worked. Once it broke (after no abuse), my warranty claim was denied for it not being a genuine product. Her previous CHI, while being quite a bit more expensive, lasted years and only broke when it bounced across a tile floor. I'm all about getting a good deal but where's the savings when you're replacing it all the time?In short, this &#34;might&#34; be a good gift for a lady friend you're not planning on staying with but, if you're in it for the long haul, step up your game and get the real deal. It will save you the headache and embarrassment of a warranty denial letter because your cheap ass opted for the knock-off. Ladies investing in yourselves, steer clear.
