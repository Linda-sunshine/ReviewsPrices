review/summary: The RIGHT Way to Use Pore Stripsreview/text: I love this product. While most imitation brands are basically the same (i.e. Walgreens), Biore is the way to go because I find it to be the most effective. This is the best way to prepare your face for pore strips and the results are great:1) Take a hot, steamy shower. Make sure to remove all of your makeup before or during your shower. Use a warm bar of soap on your face so that it is completely clean and makeup free.2) (Skip this step if you have extremely sensitive or damaged skin.) After the shower, combine a small amount of baking soda with water. It should have that "wet sand" feel. Use this to exfoliate your skin and clean your pores. Do NOT scrub it on your skin. Gently rub this on your face in circular motions for about 30 seconds. Be sure to fully rinse the baking soda off of your face with cold water. I usually stand over the sink and gently rub it off while I splash the cold water onto my face.3) When you have completely rinsed off the baking soda, make sure your face is still fairly wet from the cold water and place the pore strips on. Keep them on until they are stiff.(It should take about 10-15 minutes. If it is not working for you for some reason, DON'T panic. Simply wet your entire face until it slides right off. Do NOT rip it off or you will damage your skin.)These three steps work for me every time. It's pretty amazing how much the pore strips pick up. I do this about once every week or two. I'd love to hear if it helps for you, so please let me know!
