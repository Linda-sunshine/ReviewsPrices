review/summary: Quick, Easy, Inexpensive and Effectivereview/text: A blackhead is an enlarged pore clogged with keratin and sebum (an oily secretion of the sebaceous gland). The black color is not dirt but is oxidation. It's unsightly and should be removed. Bior&eacute; Deep Cleansing Pore Strips do the job quickly, easily and inexpensively.Alternatives? Duct tape might perform as well, but isn't sanitary. Facials are certainly more luxurious, but where can you get a facial for $8.20? Clearly, the Bior&eacute; Strips are the best choice.Then, there's the convenience of Bior&eacute; Deep Cleansing Pore Strips. A facial takes an hour or more at a salon, plus the commute. With Bior&eacute;, you just slap on the strips and go about your business. No one's the wiser! Ten to 15 minutes later, you're finished, and your skin is clear and clean.The results of these cleansing strips are both amazing and appalling. After peeling off the dry strip (yes, this is a bit painful), the blackheads appear on the strip. When viewed through magnification, those specks on the strips are clearly blackheads. These cleansing strips really work and leave you with the instant satisfaction of removing and discarding these facial imperfections.
