review/summary: Knock offreview/text: I read lots of reviews saying that this was a knock off but given the number of things I purchase from Amazon I had a hard time believing Amazon would be selling a knock off Chi. I had the &#34;real&#34; version prior to this of the exact same model so I was able to compare. They do look a LOT alike....but this one did not heat up hot enough so it obviously didn't do a good job AND my hair kept getting stuck in it WHICH has never happened with any real Chi that I've ever used. Also, my REAL one said made in USA whereas the fake one was made in Canada....there was actually French writing on the box which was my first tip off that something was off with it. There are also several other more subtle differences...but this is clearly a phony. I really hope Amazon stops selling this.
