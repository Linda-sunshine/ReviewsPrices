review/summary: Best diffuser attachment ever for curly hairreview/text: This blowdryer has the best diffuser attachment I've ever purchased. It really diffuses so all you get is heat, no blowing around of the hair, so the curls keep their shape better. Also, for some reason it's hotter than my old 1875 watt dryer, so my hair dries more quickly. Unlike other reviewers, I have the same amount of frizz as I did with my old dryer-- the ion part just doesn't do anything for me. But the curls are better shaped because the diffuser prevents them from being blown around. The one negative is that the on-off switch is on the handle right where you hold the blowdryer, so it pokes your hand and you end up occasionally turning it off by accident. To avoid this you can hold it lower down on the handle but that's awkward. Nonetheless, I would completely recommend this dryer, especially if you have curly hair.
