review/summary: Instructions, please?review/text: Just received this today. It seems fine diluted 4/1 as a hand soap, but that is the only way I have used it so far.I am totally stymied by all the ridiculous religous crap that is written all over the label IN PLACE OF directions for uses of and dilutions of this soap.Some might find this humorous or even inspiring (??); I find it annoying. I had to go online to get ideas about how to use this and how it should be diluted.It remains to be seen, after I have recovered from my initial crankiness, if I will be a real fan. So far, Dr. Bronner himself really turns me off!
