review/summary: Beware, diligent flossers!! Flossing will be gross.review/text: I've been a nail bitter since I was young, and I've always wanted to stop so I bought this product. I put it on and it went on nice and clear. However, when it came time to floss, the nasty taste got in my mouth. I thought that because the nail polish was on my nails, I would still be able to floss as long as I didn't put the floss around my nails. Unfortunately, somehow the nasty taste got onto my floss! I can't do without flossing at least before I go to bed, and so I had to remove the nail polish with nail polish remover and then floss. I put the Mavala Stop on my nails the next day but I had the same issue when I tried to floss. I couldn't deal with it so I stopped using it. My mom wanted to try Mavala too. I didn't tell her about my flossing problem and I allowed her to try it. She also complained about the flossing problem and stopped using it after one try! And she also said that finger foods tasted terrible because the taste go onto them as well. Since most young children do not floss, they will probably not have the flossing complaint I have. I am glad that this product has worked for so many children and adults, but I couldn't deal with it. I'll have to look for another solution. Right now I am trying willpower because I know that Mavala Stop will be too much of a problem when it comes to flossing. I bought this product for $11 and I am disappointed that I paid so much and now have this nail polish that didn't solve my problem. If anyone has any recommendations for me, please share.
