review/summary: Wonderful Productreview/text: I bought this for its natural ingredients. Product smells great-leaves me cheerful when i shower in the early AM. I used it to clean all of my makeup brushes and it worked great. People say one should use baby shampoo since it is the most sensitive, however, they are mistaken since most mainstream products contain harmful agents such as parabens and phalates. (YES EVEN BABY SHAMPOO!) Dr. Bronner's Soaps do not, hence the reason to use it instead. Plus it has multiple purposes; who can beat that?! I wouldn't recommend it as a shampoo unless you dilute it and have semi greasy hair. I have combination and it dried mine out a bit.
