review/summary: Helps clear up acnereview/text: Aside from the obvious pluses of being environmentally friendly, smelling good, and being extremely versatile, the Dr. Bronner's Tea Tree has actually helped clear my skin. After about a month of use, Dr. Bronner's quelled the breakouts that I've had for 10 years or so. Tea Tree oil might have done this on its own, but incorporating it into soap, which you use everyday as a matter of course, was a bright idea. Highly recommended.
