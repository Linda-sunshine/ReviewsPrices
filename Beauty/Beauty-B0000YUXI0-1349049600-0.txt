review/summary: This stuff works!review/text: My ten year old had developed a nervous habit of biting his nails. But from the first application I knew this stuff was the ticket. He really dislikes the taste and stopped biting. And it seems to last. I only applied it for a week (before the bottle was mysteriously misplaced? - Hidden??) Anyway, he has stopped and if we have the problem again, I will purchase more.
