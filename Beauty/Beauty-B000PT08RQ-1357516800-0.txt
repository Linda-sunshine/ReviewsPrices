review/summary: Too wide for you maybe?review/text: I gave my mother (a professional hair stylist) this for christmas due to the high ratings. I'm still sure its a great product, but I marked it 3 stars because she said that it was &#34;too wide&#34; on top. Just make sure you take this into consideration when buying. She then proceeded to take it and return it to walmart and got 6 dollars more store credit than what i paid for it, so win-win i think.
