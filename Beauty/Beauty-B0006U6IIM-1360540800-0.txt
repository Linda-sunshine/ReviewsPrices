review/summary: Like a charm!review/text: SO! I originally purchased this oil because of a few reviews I've seen talk about how good it is for hair growth. Anyway, soon after I got it I remembered my mother using this oil on my EXTREMELY dry skin. I just so happen to have pass my super ashiness to two of my daughters :( one of them has such a thick skin that it doesn't matter what you put on her, she lives ashy. so I've decided to put some on her skin only one time and VOILA! her ash went away for the rest of the day. I recommend this brand in particular because comparing it with the one at my local pharmacy (yes I actually went to the store and opened a bottle to compare) is a lot thicker, and it doesn't have a strong and fake scent like many of the products found at local stores. Use just a few drops on the body it goes along ways.
