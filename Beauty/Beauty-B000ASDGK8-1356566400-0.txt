review/summary: Good Hairdryer but has its Downsidereview/text: This hairdryer is very good at drying my hair. I feel it's a little heavy and the buttons are hard to use (to turn on and off). They are flat and when you have slippery fingers it's impossible to get it to turn on and off. Also some of the coating is starting to flake off (after about 6 months of use) and I have black flakes all over my bathroom. But as far as drying, it's a great hairdryer and I'll probably just live with the downsides until I need a new one.
