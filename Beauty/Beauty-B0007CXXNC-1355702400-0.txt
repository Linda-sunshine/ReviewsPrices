review/summary: This is the best conditioner I've ever used.review/text: As an African-American with chemically processed hair, I have tried a lot of conditioners over the years. This is hands down the best conditioner I have ever used. It makes my hair soft, silky and moisturized. I use it once a week, and once a month I will sit under a dryer for a deep conditioning. It's not greasy, doesn't weight my hair down and smells great. It's definitely worth the price.
