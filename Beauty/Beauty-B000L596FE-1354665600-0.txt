review/summary: It REALLY glides through tangles!review/text: I bought this brush in hopes of easing the morning hair brushing battles between me and my 6 year old daughter. It worked! This brush is amazing. My daughter can brush her own hair and get all the tangles out in less than a minute. (Her hair is nearly to her behind). It also works in wet hair. I can't say enough nice things about this brush. I think I'm going to be giving it as a gift it's that good.
