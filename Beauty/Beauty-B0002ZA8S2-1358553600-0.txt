review/summary: Great Heatreview/text: My beautician told me this iron was like the professional ones they use. As iome types of hair fine shaft like mine was hard to hold a curl. It gets very HOT. So you must test the right heat to use on your hair. It works great and I bought two sizes.I will buy from this company again. The shipping was great and the packaging very protective.
