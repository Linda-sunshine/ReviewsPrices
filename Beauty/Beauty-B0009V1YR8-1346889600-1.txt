review/summary: Not like it should bereview/text: Okay, I'm not saying this is a knock-off, as others have said because of the lower price. But It simply doesn't work the way a seemingly identical iron that I've used does. It seems a bit cheesier, and doesn't have proper heat control to make a little flip at hair ends (I have straight, dry hair just straight cut above the shoulders). Anyway, I'm thankful I have Prime membership and I could return this thing without penalty. What a relief.
