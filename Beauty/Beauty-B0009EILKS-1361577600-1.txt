review/summary: works well if nose pores are VERY cloggedreview/text: Biore strips work well if your nose pores are really clogged. Like if you haven't used strips or mask or exfoliant in a long time. You can actually see the dirt and gunk from inside your pores get stuck on the strip when you remove it. It's kind of gross but also satisfying to know that all of that is not in your pores anymore.However, I feel like they aren't as satisfying if you use them regularly, or if you regularly use another pore-cleansing product (like a clay mask). If your pores aren't really clogged up, the strips don't do very much.They also leave my nose a tad sensitive, and leave a residue on my nose that I have to wash off afterwards.Definitely worth trying once... but I don't use them as part of my regular routine.
