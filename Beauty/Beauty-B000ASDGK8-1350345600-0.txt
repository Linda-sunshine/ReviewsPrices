review/summary: I Love This Dryer!!!review/text: Highly recommend this dryer! The rubber casing is great! Feels good, easy to keep a good grip on, and offers added protection that is well worth it, since plastic dryers inevitably eventually crack and break when dropped. This one weighs a little more, however, being sturdy and protected to last longer makes up for that. It has six temperature/speeds - I use all and mostly need the warm setting for my fine hair.
