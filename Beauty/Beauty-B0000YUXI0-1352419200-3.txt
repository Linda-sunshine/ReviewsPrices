review/summary: Yes it worked!!!review/text: Yay, I bought this for my 4 yr old son, who sucked his thumb ALL the time. Yes it worked great. Though here is the warning...the first two nights were miserable!!! He woke up several times because he put his thumb in his mouth and it tasted awful, therefore, he kept needing a drink of water. After several days, he was cured! No thumb at all!!! He tells everyone that he is a big boy now and doesn't suck his thumb. He is very proud of himself.It has been over one month, and I do have to say we are still adjusting. Before, when he threw a tantrum, he would cry for a couple of minutes, and then soothe himself by sucking his thumb. Now that he doesn't suck his thumb his tantrums seem to be bigger, and last a lot longer. :( But over all, I bought Mavala to help him stop sucking his thumb, and it definitely worked, so I will give this product 5 stars. Good Luck to you. :)
