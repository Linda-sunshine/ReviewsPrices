review/summary: Great for sensitive skin.review/text: I had been eyeing this product for a while, and I'm glad I finally took the chance of spending $9. It's worth it because it'll last a long time.The smell is pleasant, a bit strong but it fades away after it dries. This Winter weather is really harsh on my skin and this product has helped my skin to be more moisturized even with makeup on.
