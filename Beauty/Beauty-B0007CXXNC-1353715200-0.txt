review/summary: My favorite hair mask ever!review/text: I am in love with this stuff! To start, it smells heavenly, and the scent actually lasts in your hair after you rinse it out, which I love! But the main reason I am in love with it is because of how soft it makes my hair! I use this once a week, and there is such a difference in my hair the days I use this, and the days I use my normal conditioner. I am a bit sad because I have bought a different deep conditioner to try, just because I love trying out different beauty products, and it does not compare! I am definitely going straight back to this as soon as possible!
