review/summary: Pricey but its works!review/text: I know this sponges are on the pricey side but it does apply the foundation very nicely with out looking cakey. I apply my foundation thin layers at a time until I found my desired coverage. then I blend my concealer with this too and use it to set with a powder. I will not be needing to pack many makeup brushes on our up coming trip to Canada in a few days.I use baby shampoo to clean this and it works very well instead of paying extra for the cleanser.
