review/summary: This is not the flat iron that you will receive. You will pay for a Chi, but, get a plain flat iron that does not heat up.review/text: This product is not a Chi flat iron, which is what I purchased. I waited too late to open the box and when I did it was beyond the 90 days. The box was a Farouk Chi box, but the flat iron was not the one in the picture. I could not get my $83.99 back. The flat iron does not heat up, let alone work on your hair. The surprising thing is that I am not the only Amazon customer that purchased this product and had the same problem. I am disappointed that Amazon allows this company to sell bootleg products. I am going to contact Farouk and let them know how their product is being marketed on Amazon. I am unhappy with Amazon's customer service. I am very busy and did not take the time to open the box when I received it. My family and friends have been purchasing from Amazon for years? This has been the worst experience that I have had. It should not matter that it was beyond 90 days when I opened the box. The product should have been what I ordered and not a knockoff that does not operate. I am going to put in a complaint to the Better Business Bureau. I will never purchase from this seller. Buyer beware.
