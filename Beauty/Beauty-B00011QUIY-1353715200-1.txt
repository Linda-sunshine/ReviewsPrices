review/summary: My final curling ironreview/text: Love this curling iron. It heats very quickly, the tip is big enough I don't get burned, it does what it's supposed to. It has a heat control....be sure to watch it. Too hot might burn your hair and if you drop it it will burn you. My only wish is that it were smaller because it won't leave home without it but it's quite large (long) to pack.
