review/summary: Love this oil for face and hairreview/text: I've been using this oil on my face and hair for about a month now and absolutely love it! Like other reviews stated, a little goes a long way. I use a drop or two for my face (which tends to be on the dry side in the winter) and a drop on my hair, which is about 4&#34; past my shoulders. It leaves my hair shiny and healthy feeling. I've used silicone smoothing products in the past but don't care for the fragrance or the synthetic feel. If you want a natural replacement to the silicone serums, this is a great choice. My only complaint and reason for giving only 4 stars is the lid. It doesn't dispense very well and ends up building up on the lid and running down the sides of the bottle, which makes a greasy mess and I have to clean grease rings off of my bathroom counter everyday. I make my own oil cleanser for my face and store it in an old plastic saline solution bottle (the kind for your nose) and that works great, so I think I'm going to try transferring this oil to a similar bottle.
