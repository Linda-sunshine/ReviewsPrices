review/summary: Works Good. Keep your fingers out of your face and month area thoughreview/text: Ive been biting my nails for my entire life. I'm 25 yrs old. I bought this and i have not been chewing my nails for the past 10 days, which is certainly a record for me.I can say that this stuff tastes aweful. If you use this product and continue to bite your nails with it on, you have my respect because you are truely dedicated to your habit. I suppose the only issue would be remembering to re-apply it every two days like it asksBe careful when eating. If your finger goes in your month with this stuff on you will regret it. Trust me, this will be a major disturbance. But like i said, it has been working for me so far. Good luck everyone
