review/summary: The best thing ever!review/text: We didn't think it was possible to stop our daughter to suck her thumbs. We decide to give this a try. My daughter loves to put the &#34;nail polish&#34; on her finger and ask to put them on every other night. At beginning, she still put her thumb in her mouth while she was sleeping. But then she should pull them out right away and cry. We asked her what happened? She told us &#34;yucky&#34;. With in a week, she stop sucking her thumb, but still wanted her nail painted. Another week later, she stopped sucking her thumbs. Once awhile, she still asks to her nails painted. We put pretty pink nail polish (speed dry) on her toe nails.Yes, I would recommend friends and family to buy it. In fact, I even recommend other mother to try them too when saw the kid suck their thumbs in the mall.
