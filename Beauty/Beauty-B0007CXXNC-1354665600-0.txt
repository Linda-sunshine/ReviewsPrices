review/summary: I use this every time I wash my hair nowreview/text: I know it's a masque that you don't need to use every day but I don't wash my hair every day because I have naturally very dry and frizzy hair. I only need a small amount and I have very thick naturally curly hair that gets frizzy. This takes lot of the frizz away and smells good. It is really heavy at first, but as you continue to use it, the smell gets less potent. This has lasted me months and my hair reaches down the middle of my back so I think it's a terrific value.
