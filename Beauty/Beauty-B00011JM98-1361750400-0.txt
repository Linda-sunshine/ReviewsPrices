review/summary: 2 coats and streak freereview/text: This is my first white polish I've owned (White on White). I've had others that were just for tips, but they tend to chip.I love China Glaze because it doesn't chip much depending on the top coat used. I love that most of their colors dry super fast.BUT, I purchased this here on Amazon and it doesn't seem very full. Even dipping my entire brush down inside the polish I have a hard time getting anything, and I've only used it a couple times.
