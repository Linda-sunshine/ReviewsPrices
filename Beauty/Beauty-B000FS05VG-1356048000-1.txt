review/summary: A solid, quality blowdryer for a good pricereview/text: What do you say about a blowdryer? It dries my hair. It's lightweight. It's not enormous. And my hair doesn't smell like burning. That's a definite plus. I used to walk around with my hair smelling slightly burnt from my old blowdryers. If my boyfriend hugged me and inevitably took a whiff of my hair, he was always looking puzzled. And now he doesn't!I didn't notice a huge difference in the time it takes to dry my hair- meaning, it's not a noticeably shorter duration of time, but it's a great blowdryer and a great price!
