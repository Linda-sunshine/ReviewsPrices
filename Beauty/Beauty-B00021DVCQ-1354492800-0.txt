review/summary: 3.7 starsreview/text: I used to us BareMinerals Medium Beige for a long time and it did help lessen break outs and keep my skin looking clear. I then tried the new matte version of B.M. and disliked it. It made my face look chalky and rested in my fine lines. I then switched to Silk Naturals brand and I used it the past 2 years. I recently bought B.M. at Sephora to try again and I was dissatisfied.Pros: I like the packaging, ease of washing off makeup, hardly any residue, keeps my skin clear & blemish free, light airy feel, natural ingredientsCons: I makes my face look oily on T-zone after 5 hours, does nothing for redness on my noseOverall: Silk Naturals is better, I can customize my shade, covers better & reduces redness, is all natural and doesn't make my face look oily even after I wear it 10 hours! It is slightly harder to wash off but that is ok since it has everything else I'm looking for.
