review/summary: recommended by our pediatric dentistreview/text: Our son is almost 4 years old and mainly sucked his thumb at bedtime or for comfort when he was upset. We tried discouraging the thumb sucking since he was about 2.5 years old with very little success (that was when he went from sucking his thumb all the time to only at night and when upset). At his last dentist appt, his dentist recommended Mavala. It was amazing to see how quickly this product worked without any frustration or heartache for us and our son! We talked to him about it before using it and he was resistant but within the first week he stopped sucking his thumb! We applied as directed every 2 days for about a week and a half. It's been 3 weeks now without any thumb sucking. I thought for sure we would need one of those horrible (and expensive) thumb guards, but nope! this did the trick! Highly recommend!
