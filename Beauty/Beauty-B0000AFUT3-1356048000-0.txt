review/summary: okreview/text: This broke with very little use. I found a way to work around it, and still use this mirror. The amount of light is great and I use the magnifying side to pluck my lovely mostache hairs (menopause sucks) and when I pluck my eyebrows. I even use it when my husband is in the shower and I need to put my make-up on.
