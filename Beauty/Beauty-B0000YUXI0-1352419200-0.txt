review/summary: AMAZING!!!! Works for finger biters too!review/text: I have an 11 year old son who is way beyond just nail biting and bites his fingers as well. He's been doing this a couple of years and really wants to stop, but has had a hard time and hasn't been able to. His fingers have been red from him biting the skin off. He's been complaining about it and saying he wants to stop because it hurts and it bugs him, but he can't. He would bite his fingers not just the tips around the nails, but down the sides as well. I was hoping this would not only help him to stop, but also not hurt him when I put it on!IT WAS GREAT! There wasn't any stinging when I applied it (obviously there weren't any open wounds!) and he did NOT like it! By the end of the day he was saying how horrible it was because it kept making everything taste awful. :) At dinner there was an added bonus of him not eating anything with his fingers (something we're always getting on him for! :)). 2-3 days later he still had a bit on him. I haven't reapplied it yet because he's set on not biting them so he doesn't have to have this on. I LOVE it and it was worth every cent!! :)
