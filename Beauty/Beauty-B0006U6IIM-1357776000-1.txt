review/summary: Will not buy NOW Foods products again!!review/text: I was hasty in my purchase of this so-called sweet almond oil by "NOW Foods". There are so many deceitful sellers in natural products today that one has to be very diligent in researching and selecting products. There is nothing that indicates that this so-called `Sweet Almond Oil' is even in-part "Prunus dulcis", which is its botanical name, NOR ARE THERE ANY INGREDIENTS LISTED ON THE BOTTLE (quite odd, don't you think?)! Especially, that indicates what is actually in this product. It lists ONLY that it is "100% Pure Moisturizing Oil", which is NOT SAYING ANYTHING, REALLY. When buying natural products, as I have researched, the listed ingredients should ALWAYS be listed with its BOTANICAL NAME. Needless to say, I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING ANYTHING FROM NOW Foods again. I DO NOT LIKE BEING DUPED. Although, I do take responsibility for not being more thorough in this purchase, but never again!! So don't be misled to believe you're buying something or of a certain quality that you are not. It will likely cost you more, but you'll know what you're getting if you research.I have found s supplier on-line that sells Sweet Almond Oil ("Prunus dulcis"), but is currently out of stock (for body care products, which is the type I'm looking for). They do also have (Prunus dulcis): Method of extraction: Expeller Pressed/Unrefined, certified organic. Suitable for food use, and is deeper in flavor, color and odor, which is sold for $12 for 8.5 oz. or $17.75 for 16 oz.
