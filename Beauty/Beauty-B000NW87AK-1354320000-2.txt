review/summary: DISGUSTING Scent!!!!review/text: I chose to get the Egyptian Goddess since it seemed to have good reviews but I must have an extremely different idea of what good smells like. I opened it and without smelling it first just rolled a little bit on my arm, I smelled like an old lady all day (no offense intended). Right after I put it on this really sexy guy I work with walks in and says it smells weird in here what is that!? I showed him the scent and the disgust on his face said it all lol. Then of course I figured it'll fade soon enough but no I could smell it for hours so I said screw this I need to wash my wrists. Even then I could kind of smell it and I don't have smelling like a dog it was just that bad. When I got home that night I had my grandma and mom see of they liked it and the look on their face was priceless haha, I need to send this crap back. Otherwise its one of those gifts you give out for xmas to someone you don't exactly like.
