review/summary: Like butter!review/text: I have waist length, straight, thick hair that will sometimes get tangled. This is the first brush that doesn't hurt to use! No harsh pulling or tugging, it just does what a brush is supposed to do: BRUSH.However, it doesn't work for me in the shower or on dripping wet hair.. but I think this is perfectly ok. I'd rather brush my hair when it's dry or semi-dry to avoid damage.I have tried it on damp hair, and it works amazingly. I'm impressed.
