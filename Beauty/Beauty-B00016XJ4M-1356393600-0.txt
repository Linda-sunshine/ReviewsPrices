review/summary: Love love lovereview/text: amazing product great price can be used as a toner or setting spray smells great doesn't over dry or get irritated makes my skin look healthy will be buying more as long as they make it only issue my top was cracked when it arrived but no product leaked and I just poured some in a bottle of my own and put Suran wrap over the original to keep fresh
