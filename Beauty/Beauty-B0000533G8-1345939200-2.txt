review/summary: A great deal for my favorite soap!review/text: I love this soap! I've been using it for about two years now and I wish I had discovered it sooner. No other soap has ever left me feeling so clean and refreshed- especially the peppermint fragrance! Peppermint soap took a little getting used to but it's really wonderful, I've tried other scents but this is definitely my first choice. The only other thing I would add is that I received two 32 ounce bottles rather than the large container pictured on this product page. I prefer the smaller bottles but if you're looking for the larger one with the handle- this isn't it. This is an amazing deal and I'm really glad that I came across it.
