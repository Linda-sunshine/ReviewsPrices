review/summary: Works for skin but not for hairreview/text: Although I first bought this product for hair use, I end up using it on my skin. I add some onto my shampoo and conditioner since my hairs are a little dry and thin, but I notice it make my scalp and hairs too greasy. Then I started to use it as hand and foot lotion and it works much better than most of the lotions.
