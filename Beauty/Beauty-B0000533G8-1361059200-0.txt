review/summary: Great Soapreview/text: As always I am very impressed with Dr. Bronner Soap. I believe I have tried every kind and every single one is good. This product is a 100% organic and natural. I recommend everyone try it. The soap goes a really long ways. I use a sponge (a few drops works good) and thats all you need. A bottle this size will last about 6 months at least if you use it just for bathing. Well good luck to all of you who try this product.
