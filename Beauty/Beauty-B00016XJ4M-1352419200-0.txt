review/summary: Very nice for sensitive skinreview/text: First of all, I have a sensitive skin. Most toners are too harsh for me and seemed to break me out a lot. Therefore I was very pleased to discover that this was as gentle as claimed. I am able to use this to soothe my skin after a peel with no problems. My skin feels moisturized. I have even used it as a cleanser since it seemed to clean my face and yet maintain the moisture...........I will surely purchase this product again. Thanks for making it available on time.
