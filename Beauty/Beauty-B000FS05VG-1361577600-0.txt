review/summary: Great productreview/text: I bought this a month ago, and I love that it is relatively quiet and dries my hair quickly (shoulder length, thick hair - usually about 20minutes or so). I usually use it on the warm and low setting (high if I need my hair to dry more quickly) and it doesn't feel too hot at all. I think it is a great deal, it's relatively inexpensive ($19.99) and fulfills its main function.
