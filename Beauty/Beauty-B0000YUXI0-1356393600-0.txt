review/summary: Great product, no doubt!review/text: I purchased this product because I have never been able to shake biting my nails--32 years old but cannot stop it! Upon applying I noticed it had a smell quite similar to nail polish remover, but an even more unpleasant taste. The flavor is comparable to a cross between rotten grapefruit and the numbing gel the dentist puts on your gum before he injects it with novocaine. I have noticed that it each application lasts about 3-4 days.The only drawback is if you are eating something like chips or a donut and go to lick your fingers, you will quickly remember that Mavala Stop has been applied! This is good and bad since it is a constant reminder you are breaking your habit.I would recommend to anyone as I have not tried biting my nails since I got this a week ago!
