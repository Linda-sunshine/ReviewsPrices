review/summary: good stuffreview/text: For those with sensitive skin, the soap is ideal. I dilute it by 1/3 ...... I use it as a shower soap AND shampoo, excellent. I've even used it to give the dog a shower when needed. Its a thin liquid soap, that may be a turn off for some. &#34;We&#34; are so use to heavy thick soaps (??) I originally bought the peppermint - it was STRONG SCENT in the shower, never any lingering effects of peppermint after rinse. These soaps DO rinse very easily. I feel better scrubbing my body with natural soap instead of chemicals.
