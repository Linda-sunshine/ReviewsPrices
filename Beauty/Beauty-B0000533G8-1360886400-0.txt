review/summary: Love this soap!review/text: reading the reviews of this product, I was fascinated, and now after using it, I too love it. Mixed half and half with water for the shower, and it lathers great, makes my skin feel nice, and I love how it smells. Today for the first time I used it for my hair, and although washing hair was one of the things that there are mixed reviews for, at least for my hair, I really liked it - it felt kind of hard to rinse out, and I had read about using vinegar for the rinse, but I didn't have any, so just used my regular conditioner I already had in the shower. And for some reason this made my hair appear so much fuller and healthier than usual. So I guess I'll keep on using it and see if it continues to have that effect. And after a bath the other night, I used it full strenght to clean the bathtub - worked great!! So then I ordered peppermint because I thought I might like that smell better for cleaning. But used that this morning in the shower after getting off the treadmill - so refreshing! These big bottles should last a long, long time, so I'm feeling very good about using these natural products and getting away from chemicals. We camp a lot too, so they are perfect for using while camping.
