review/summary: It's okayreview/text: I like that this mirror has three panels. I also like that one side of the middle mirror is magnified. The lighting settings are basically just a color shield over the actual light. I personally wish it were just one light setting. The lighting is not a natural light so in my opinion I don't get a realistic view of my face and makeup application. I would, however, recommend this product to maybe a teenager who is new to makeup.
