review/summary: Magic Soap? Almost.... Almost....review/text: The late Dr. Bronner's masterpiece, millions of people use this cult soap for basically everything but beverage purposes. The packaging is as inspirationally baffling as ever, but the product is as good as ever as well. Just awesome, delightful, uncannily good, and available in a nice variety of scents too. Only downside: it can dry your skin out a bit if overused.
