review/summary: Poor light and mirror!review/text: Listen to the negative reviews and don't purchase this mirror. I want to replace a very old and beaten-up Remington mirror that is terrible looking but still works like a champ (but isn't made anymore, sadly), so I ordered this mirror hoping I would side with the positive reviews. I only had to plug it in once to see that it doesn't emit half the light of the one I am replacing, and the magnifying mirror is unclear and distorted compared to the Remington. I am over 50 and my vision is getting a lot worse, and this mirror does nothing to help me see my face more clearly; there are only disadvantages to its use. It appears cheaply made and there's no way to hang it on the wall, either. Terribly disappointed, and frustrated too. This mirror is being returned! It was manufactured to resemble my old one, but is nothing but a cheap imitation.
