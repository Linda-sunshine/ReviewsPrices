review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: Having owned a Chi straightener for years, I decided to get another one to have as a spare. I love the first Chi I have. This one is not the same quality. It takes me forever to straighten my hair, and it doesn't really grab the hair. I will be looking for another product to replace the Chi that I just purchased. So disappointed.
