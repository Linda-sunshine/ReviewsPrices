review/summary: No temperature dial, Fake, Poor Qualityreview/text: Buyer beware: there is NO temperature dial (I didn't know! Why wouldn't a flat iron originally worth $190 have a temperature dial?? there's only one temperature setting. it's terrible.) In addition, the product is not polished/varnished like a real Chi, cord is different, shape is off; this product is not a Chi, and it's not even anywhere NEAR the same quality of your basic $15 Conair hair straightener. I hate being ripped off. I can't believe it's even listed as a Chi product and that the description fails to mention all these things... I'm returning it.
