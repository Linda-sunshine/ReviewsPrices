review/summary: Auric Blends Patchouli Oilreview/text: I bought this for my wife. We both really liked the Patchouli scent we remembered from years ago. Unfortunately this did not measure up. It had a sharp industrial smell to it like oil used on machining tools like lathes and milling machines. Maybe if you were Tim Taylor from Tool Time you might like it. I wonder if it is just defective becuase I cannot imagine anyone really liking it.We were very disappointed.
