review/summary: I LOVE LOVE LOVE this hairdryer!review/text: Just like my title says, I love, love, love this hairdryer. I have had one before, this is my second. The first one I had seemed to have a wiring issue in the end. Towards the end of it's &#34;life&#34; whenever I would move the hairdryer, it would somehow stop working and then go back on. Seemed a bit dangerous so I threw it out and ordered another one. The first one lasted a year and a half. But, being that I spent only twenty bucks on the first one and now only sixteen bucks on the second, the price is hard to beat.What I love about this hairdryer is that when it dries it seems to separate the locks of hair making my layers look shiny and pretty. Yes, I said SHINY with pretty layers. While I was waiting for the second hair dryer, I used an old one I had and the old one took a very long time to dry my hair and my hair looked like a rats nest and very dry when I was done.For sixteen bucks you will definately see a difference in your hair.
