review/summary: best brush everreview/text: My hair has always been thick, long and straight. As I have gotten toward my late twenties I have begun to loose a lot of hair every time I brush or wash it!!! The wet brush is gentle and since I have started using it I have less hair loss AND less split ends and fly-aways. My boyfriend brushed his hair out in the shower with it also and loves it. After about 8 months of using this brush I have found my favorite brush and hope it is never discontinued.
