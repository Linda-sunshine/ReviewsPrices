review/summary: BEST straightener I have ever had - A++++review/text: After all of the rave reviews, I was still a little unsure about this product because of the reasonable price. Worry not - It is truly amazing and the best straightener I have ever used after 15+ years of many different brands. I rarely blow dry my hair anymore which is a huge time saver. I have also noticed that when I let it air dry - my hair appears straighter than usual (usually very wavy/curly when air dried). FYI - if used frequently, the steam function may be a bit tougher on your hair - esp. if you do not fully dry it so I would suggest using a styling product a few times a week. Could not recommend this product enough - I bought another one to have back pocket.
