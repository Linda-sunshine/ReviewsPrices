review/summary: Great pain free brushreview/text: My daughter has a tender scalp and tangly hair. She loves this brush. We have tried so many 'ouchless' brushes over the years, and this is the first one that is truly ouchless. She loves brushing her hair now. It is also very light weight so she can carry it in her backpack without being concerned about extra weight.
