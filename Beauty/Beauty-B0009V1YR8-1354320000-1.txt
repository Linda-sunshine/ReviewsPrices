review/summary: Beware of losing money on thisreview/text: After 4 months of using the CHI Ceramic Flat-Iron I bought from THINK BEAUTY through AMAZON.COM the smell of electrical wiring/hot plastic became intolerable. The ceramic plates also began to make a crackling sound. I stopped using it and made contact with Amazon who responded that my return window of 30 days for a refund had expired and THINK BEAUTY never responded to my email. I called FAROUK and after I gave them the CHI iron information found on the inside part of one of the plates, they told me it was a counterfeit; therefore, it had no warranty! Amazon should know and they should warn buyers that some of their SELLERS pass on counterfeit product's with invalid warranties. Were it not for the smell and the crackling sound, I liked the way the iron left my hair!
