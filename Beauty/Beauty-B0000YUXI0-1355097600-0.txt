review/summary: Can't even eat finger foods anymore...review/text: I have really mixed feelings about this product. So far it has really helped me not bite my nails because of the terrible taste. However, I can't even eat finger foods anymore because I can taste it even after not using it for a couple days. Chips and Guac Gone...Cereal Gone..I hope once my nails grow out the taste will eventually go away because I can't take much more of this. My brother used this too to stop biting his nails and the same thing happened to him. He won't use it anymore.
