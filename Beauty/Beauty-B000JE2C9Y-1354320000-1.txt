review/summary: Its alrightreview/text: Its not perfect, but for the price its what i needed and its a decent first mask for a newcomer. The nose area does leak a lil light, but it doesnt matter since its still pitch black when u close ur eyes. The mask is nice and soft and ppl complained about having pressure on ur eyelids, but its not bad at all. Its like sleeping with a pillow on ur head or something. The only downside is the strap, can really dig into ur inside ear area if it slips down ur face, i solved this problem by wearing a hoodie or a beanie and putting the mask over that
