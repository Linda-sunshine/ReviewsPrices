review/summary: BEST BRUSH EVERreview/text: I have thin curly and extremely tangled hair. It is horrible brushing my hair because one, it hurts! and two, I always end up pulling out chucks of my hair due to the excessive knotting. BUT WITH THIS BRUSH I FINALLY can brush with ease, and Little to NO hair gets pulled out, This is such an amazing product, I only purchased one, but I have to get the mini for on the go and possibly a few more just because I want to share this with all my friends! Even my husband loves it (he has extremely long hair) this is such a great product, I couldn't be happier!
