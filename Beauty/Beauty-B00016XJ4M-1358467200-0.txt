review/summary: Pretty good so far!review/text: I purchased this product only about 2 weeks ago and really like it so far. I had a Thayers: Witch Hazel and I noticed that it was 14% alcohol and recently I have been trying to purchase more natural facial products. I searched for witch hazel toners with no alcohol and I decided on this one. I have been using it 1-2 times daily after cleansing and it is doing a great job picking up things my cleanser leaves behind! The product is a great value (you get so much for so little!) and I am sure it will last for months and months. It has a nice natural rose scent as well. Witch Hazel is supposed to be a great acne remedy and I think the rose is suppose to help sooth the skin. So far, so good! I have seen a reduction in my acne and I do believe continued use of this will clear up my skin. A wonderful, natural product to use. I would highly recommend.
