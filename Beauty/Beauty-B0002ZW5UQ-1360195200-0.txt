review/summary: 2.5?**/***];rather ALLERGIC (wool) after a few hrs.(5 stars if not allergic)review/text: No mess, cleans up very easy , does not stain hands or anything, no smell detected (i need to use only a very small amt.), works great / & looks great.The only problem is that after a few hours, i started ithing, after several hours, I was itching A LOT, and had to take an allergy pill. I read it has wool in it, unlike the other 2 brands (Caboki cannot be found anymore except in silver white, at least on here, but it and Xfusion, I read, contain cotton fibers of kerartin vs. wool, like there is in this Toppik-- so that explains it). Don't get this if u r allergic to wool (get Xfusion instead).For thos of us with woool allergies, we will need to use Xfusion instead (or Caboki if u r silver/grey), even though that cotton-based Xfusion is messier i read (this was not messy at all) and looks a bit worse (this dust looked great).A couple shakes was all it took to turn me into an wool-itching machine a few hours later. If you must try, or don't know if u r allergic to wool, please order a small/ (travel) size initially & do yourself a favor.
