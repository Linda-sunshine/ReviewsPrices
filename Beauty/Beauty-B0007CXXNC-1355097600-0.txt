review/summary: leaves hair soft and silkyreview/text: This mask leaves my hair very soft and silky. I use it on my ends for 15 minutes, not the recommended 5 or so minutes. My hair isn't dry, damaged or overworked, but I do use heat styling tools. I bought this to help my ends feel soft and it works! Smells fabulous, too.
