review/summary: Lemon Castile soap terrific buyreview/text: This is wonderful liquid Castile soap! So glad to buy the gallon size and save money! I bought this to use in my homemade cleaning products that call for Castile liquid soap. I like that the ingredients are healthy and safe and the lemon oil makes my laundry soap gel smell lovely! The investment in the gallon size is worth it. You pay so much less per cup, and with the free shipping it's a bargain. Shipping from this vendor is fast. This should supply my cleaning product needs for well over a year. I can't find this in any of the stores in my area.
