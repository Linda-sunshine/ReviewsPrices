review/summary: Works better on dry hairreview/text: While this flat iron does dry your hair while straightening, it works better on damp or slightly dried hair, as opposed to wet hair. When used just out of the shower it took longer to dry, required more applications and made my hair more straw-like, then when I waited to use it on drier hair. I love that there are tempurature settings and the large paddles cut down on flattening time for thick hair.
