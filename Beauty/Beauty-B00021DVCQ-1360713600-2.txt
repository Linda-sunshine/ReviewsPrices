review/summary: bareMineralsreview/text: I've been using this foundation since 2001, I Love it. The foundation goes on light yet because of its great coverage it doesn't take too long to apply which is what I need when gettting ready to go to work... don't have a lot of time. I've always liked the bareminerals product line, particularly in their foundatiions, warmth, blushes and eye shadows. I've seen and tried me-too-youers but I still come back to bareminerals. I highly recommend it.
