review/summary: Great Oil - Quickly Absorbs into yoru skin making it very softreview/text: I've been using various oils for years now and I have to say that jojoba is one of the great go to oils. It aborbs into the skin very quickly despite it going on relatively heavy when comparing it to other carrier oils. Add a few drops of your favorite essential oil and you have a nice after shower or bath skin softner. it easily absorbs into the body without staining your clothes or sheets.
