review/summary: Did not buy from Amazon, but I agree that it is a great straightening ironreview/text: I didn't buy this from Amazon, I saw it at my local superstore and decided to buy it as a last min item. I forgot how much I paid for it, but it was probably more than Amazon's price. I have to agree with all the reviewers. This is a great iron. It is not expensive but you could tell it's built to last. I've had it for a year and it still works great. I like the digital setting that allows you to select the heat/temp...and the fact that it works on wet hair is a bonus. I have never used it when my hair is soaking wet - more like semi-wet, but it's fast and I don't notice as much damage to my hair as I would with previous irons. Would def recommend.
