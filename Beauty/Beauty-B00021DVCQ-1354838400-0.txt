review/summary: Not like I have purchased in the pastreview/text: For some reason, this makeup is very different than the exact same product I have used before. Maybe it's a bad batch? But it doesn't seem to cover at all, which is what I have always loved about Bare Minerals Foundation in the past. The right amount of coverage without looking heavy. So I'll buy again, but maybe directly from BareMinerals or Sephora.
