review/summary: Uh..my mother liked this one too...review/text: Which is why im giving it 3 stars. I personally think it smells like old lady perfume. Once my mother reminded me, I remembered that she used to wear this perfume when I was younger ( her and a few other women). It even made her reminisce about the days she used to wear this before she had children. This is the second Auric blends roll on ive tried that I do not like ( the first was the vanilla) and have given to my mother(she seems to like them a lot and they even smell different on her).
