review/summary: Great for dogs :-)review/text: I first purchased this for my kids.Two of my children bite their nails and cuticles and I remember my parents putting this stuff on my fingers (it did not really work for me), so I thought I'd give it a try.In a show of support, I put it on both my son's fingernails/cuticles and my own.After 2 days, I have doubts I will be using it again. The taste transfers to any food item we touch.And my son quickly discovered that it does not really affect his nail biting because when he does so, his tongue does not touch the nail, so the only effect is that it makes his lips taste bad after the fact. Plus much of their destruction occurs with finger to finger peeling, which bitters have no effect on.There is no discouragement at the moment the absent minded nail/cuticle biting actually takes place.However it is working wonderfully for our dog whose paw is currently bandaged for two weeks while his surgery heals. We both hate dealing with that huge flea collar and slathering this stuff on his paw has kept him from bothering it while he is hanging with the family.
