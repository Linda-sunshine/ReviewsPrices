review/summary: this product has been a blessing to us.review/text: I hired a speech therapist for my 2 1/2 year old son. He has tubes in his ears as he suffers from recurrent ear infections. He was a thumb sucker as well. During her speech evaluation, she recommended Mavala Stop to me as her son was a thumb sucker and had many orthodontic problems and facial asymmetry as a result of it. I tried it and it worked after the first application. He attempted to suck his thumb but could not bare the taste. He has not sucked his thumb in 3 weeks. He likes getting his thumb nails polished. He thinks its something special. I am grateful for this product. My son's thumb sucking was a big problem for me. I am so happy. I'm glad I found a solution early on. Thank you so much.
