review/summary: worked despite my son dumping most of it down the drainreview/text: I have a sonogram of my son sucking his thumb in my womb. By the time his third birthday arrived, I had already researched and purchased Mavala Stop for fear of having a 9 year old thumb-sucker (I've seen plenty). I applied one coat on his thumb since I didn't want him to be overwhelmed by the taste. He gagged and salivated all day, so I gave him a washcloth to help him get the taste out and to absorb the crazy amount of saliva he was producing. I got a taste of how awful this stuff is when I kissed him. The taste lingered all day and I had no desire to eat, but his appetite was not affected. He did, however, manage to push a chair across the room, snipe the bottle of mavala, and dump it down the drain after out second application. I used what was left in the bottle (about 2 ml) and by the end of the week, he completely stopped thumb-sucking. It has been 6 months and he has not gone back to sucking his thumb!
