review/summary: Cleansing and smells refreshingreview/text: I use this in a foaming dispenser as a body wash and it soaps up and cleans well. No residual suds left on my skin. I probably use 1/4 cup of soap with 3/4 cup of water and it seems to be a good ratio for not being too &#34;thin&#34; of soap and not overly watery. I usually mix this peppermint scent with Dr. Bronner's lavender -- as it seems to be rejuvenating and calming.I have tried this on my hair but I prefer a thicker soap -- however, it would probably would be fine if you used it straight instead of diluting it.
