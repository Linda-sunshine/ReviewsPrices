review/summary: shiny!review/text: China glaze is amazing. It goes on smoothly and stays on for a long time. You do have to put at least 2 coats of polish on, just like any other brand to make your nails shine. The rainbow is so pretty you can combine it with any other bright color and it will the color will pop!
