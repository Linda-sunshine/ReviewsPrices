review/summary: IN LOVE BUT SOME SMALL FLAWSreview/text: LOVE THIS PRODUCT!IF YOU HAVE DAMAGED, DRY, OR STRINGY HAIR FROM COLORING AND SUCH, THIS IS THE PERFECT MASK FOR YOU!LEAVES MY HAIR SILKY SMOOTH AND SOFT! i DO NOT RECOMMEND USING THIS TWICE A WEEK TRY TO DO IT EVERY 6 DAYS OR SO. I HAVE DRY AND FRIZZY HAIR AND IT CAN BE VERY MOISTURIZING.. A LITTLE TOO MOISTURIZING. VERY CHEAP ON HERE BUT AFTER SHIPPING I GUESS YOU CAN GET IT AT YOUR LOCAL STORE FOR ABOUT THE SAME PRICE.
