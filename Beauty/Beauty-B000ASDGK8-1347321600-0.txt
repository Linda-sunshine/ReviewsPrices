review/summary: worth the price but...review/text: reading the reviews I had high expectations but as with most products I guess its a matter of preference sometimes. On the plus side this dryer is definately powerful and drys my hair very quickly. I also like that it has the multiple speeds and temperatures settings for the price. For reference, I have a lot of hair. It is wavy/curly and fine not thick in texture. While this babyliss drys my hair very quickly is does not leave the shine on my hair that the ionic kind does. I will use this one until I can find an ionic to replace it with. For me personally, shine and smoothing being more important than shaving off 4 min of hair drying time. Hopefully I will find one that has both features. Hope this review helps! good luck!
