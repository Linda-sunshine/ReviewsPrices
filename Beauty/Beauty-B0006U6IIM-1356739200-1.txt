review/summary: GREAT for DAMAGED AND THINNING HAIRreview/text: This was recommended to me by a YouTube friend for damaged and thinning hair and great for the skin. I love it. My hair shined like I had never colored it but you have to do it at least twice a month. You put the almond oil on with warm water and spread it through your hair and then cover with cap for the day or night. Wash and hair is SHINY and BEAUTIFUL.
