review/summary: Nice All Natural Productreview/text: I was happy to see all of the ingredients used are all natural. There are more ingredients in it than I expected but they are all that I was looking for in a wash product.Using as a shampoo - I bought this for that reason but I don't think this product is good for it. Maybe use the spearmint over lavender. It gave an excellent scalp and oil treatment but I ultimately had to wash with regular shampoo to get all of the oil out. Would only use this once a week or month for hair treatment.Using as a body wash - Loved it all the way around. Using as a face wash was best b/c it toned out my combination skin on my face. I didn't think I would like using it on my face but that's now my favorite. Using on the body is also good. It's not over drying so you can skip the lotion afterwards. And it doesn't leave oily skin feeling oily or dirty.It doesn't feel like it washes clean away but I know there are all natural ingredients in this product so all of it on your skin or even counters for cleaning are very good. I was hoping for a stronger lavender scent but that scent lingers on your skin after the shower.I would recommend this product as well as the other scents available.** I went to a health store and found this product on the shelf and saw that I paid LESS online than in the store, shipping included. I was very happy to see my online purchase was, in fact, a good deal.
