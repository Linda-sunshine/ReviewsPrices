review/summary: Awesome curling iron....review/text: I purchased this curling iron after reading so many good reviews on amazon. I am very happy with my purchase. I wish it came with some instructions on how to use it and how long does one leave the iron on for before curling. I watched a ton of YouTube videos before using it.Anyway, it curls in minutes and my hair looks great. I would like to suggest that you start with the lowest setting and move it up if needed. High heat doesn't mean better curls and it may burn your hair if you have thin hair texture.
