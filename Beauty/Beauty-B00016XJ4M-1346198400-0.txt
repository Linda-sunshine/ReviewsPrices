review/summary: Awesome Toner~!!review/text: This Toner has worked miracles, this was purchased to replace the Proactiv toner I had been religiously using. I want to say it's even better than the Proactiv toner, I haven't had one break out since using this product (3 months). Doesn't leave your face dry, nice pleasant light rose smell, awesomely priced, and works well with my sensitive skin. A+++'s in my book.
