review/summary: Cystic acne and scars from this makeup!review/text: I didn't have flawless skin before trying this product, but I also never had cystic acne before. The makeup looked good and I liked it, but after a few weeks, I started getting horrible, sore, red cysts ALL over my face, but especially on my cheeks. It took me a while to figure out it was the makeup, but once I stopped using it, my skin improved immediately. It's been about two years since I last used this stuff, and I still have some acne scars that are faded but not quite gone. The red scars were really upsetting for a very, very long time. Do not buy this item!
