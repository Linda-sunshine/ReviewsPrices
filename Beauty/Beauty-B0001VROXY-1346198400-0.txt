review/summary: Consistency is poor, won't use it againreview/text: I can't even describe the consistency of this polish. It's thick and runny at the same time. In some places it goes on too thick and in others you can see through it. It takes FOREVER to dry, even with only one thin coat. I painted my nails several hours before bed and when I woke up there were sheet marks all over and there were dents on every nail. I ended up taking it off because it just felt thick and sticky even 24 hours later. I only even got one coat on! I tried to like it because I love the color, but I hope I can find something similar elsewhere.
