review/summary: Affordable but not the bestreview/text: For $5 this eye/sleep mask is great and the top reviews have already covered what's so great about it.But...Having used this mask for a good six months I have two problems with it.1. Despite the fact that my head/face is relatively small, the mask can still push up and let in light from simply laying my head down directly on my pillow. It's certainly bigger than some cheap mask you might find in a retail pharmacy, but there seems to be some sort of sweetspot that's difficult to maintain during my sleep cycle (especially for people who tend to move about while they sleep).2. The elastic strap stretches out with use. After some six months time on my relatively small head there's little room left on the velcro to keep adjusting it any smaller. Thus if I want to continue using it I'll have to add more velcro or modify it some other way.Again, there's not much room for complaint considering it's offered at such a low price compared to the more luxurious sleep masks available, but I think these experiences are worth noting for someone looking for a better solution. I plan on upgrading to a better made mask (or perhaps making my own) in the near future.
