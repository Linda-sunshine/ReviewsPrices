review/summary: melts dirt and cleans fruits and vegreview/text: I use this in empty foam hand soap containers(like Dial) at all our sinks. Love the aroma. Very pepperminty.I also soak fresh fruit and veg for about 2 min then rinse. All dirt, wax and debris are gone.I wash dishes with it, put a few drops in my homemade all purpose cleaner bottle and it does a great job.I also fill a small bowl with a few drops and water and dip our dogs paws in when they are muddy.The mud melts away and I wipe with a rag. No more mud all over our home.Still experimenting on other uses. Will update when I come up with more uses.
