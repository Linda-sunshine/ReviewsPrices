review/summary: Excellent Product, strong, clean fragrancereview/text: Although the bottle can be overwhelming with all the amount of text on it, the majority of it comes from the Bronner families message about the history of the company. I'm not sure the exact ratio, but it is absolutely necessary to dilute the product to avoid drying out your skin excessively. You can feel the difference when you wash with it the first time, your skin feels noticeably different, than washing with soaps that contain sodium laureth sulfate.
