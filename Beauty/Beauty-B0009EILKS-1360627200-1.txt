review/summary: Very good, a useful product for skin care.review/text: The nose strips work very well, they do cleans the pores of impurities. Used over time, they will allow your skin to appear more fresh and glowing. One caveat: If you are using Retin-A, do not use these strips. Your skin is already softened and peeling from the use of Retin-A, using these strips will remove far too much skin and will cause bleeding.
