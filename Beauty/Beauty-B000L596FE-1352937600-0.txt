review/summary: BUY IT!!review/text: I ordered this for my daughter, who has long, very thick hair. After trying many different kinds of brushes and having only moderate success, I decided to take a chance on this one based on reviews. WHAT A BUY!!! She no longer complains when I brush her hair either wet or dry, and after a year it's still going strong! Don't look any further, this is the brush for anyone whose hair tends to knot and tangle!
