review/summary: DreamZone sleeping maskreview/text: First I'd like to say I almost didn't get this because of the reviews saying it has an odor. I went ahead and I am glad I did. I smell nothing and I'm very sensitive to smells. I sneeze like crazy around perfumed items but not one sneeze here.The mask did not completely black out around the nose area but was more than enough for me. No hard areas and I'm recovering from a broken nose and slept with it fine. It may black out more when I can tighten the straps more. I sleep all over and this stayed in place so no complaints there.
