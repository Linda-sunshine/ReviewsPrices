review/summary: Thayers is Awesome!review/text: I've been using this product for several years now as my toner and make up remover. I have to say this is my favorite one. Plain witch hazel smells terrible. This one smells like roses. :D One of my friends likes the lavender one. The original and aloe one is okay. I recently moved, and had my local grocery store didn't carry this one. The local health food store only had the aloe one. It was aloe Thayers vs. burt's bee's witch hazel/glycerin. Ugh, the burt's bees one is nothing but alcohol! :( totally horrible! I will never ever use it again! I had to come online and order my thayer's rose right away! My skin misses it's gentle cleansing and pleasant scent! GREAT Product!!!
