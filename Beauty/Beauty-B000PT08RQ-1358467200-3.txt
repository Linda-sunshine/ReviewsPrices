review/summary: great buyreview/text: i was nervous about using a hair straightener on wet hair... but I absolutely love this straightener. It leaves my hair really soft, and almost no frizz when I'm done.It definitely cut down on the amount of time it takes to get ready also. Price was reasonable too. very happy with this purchase :)
