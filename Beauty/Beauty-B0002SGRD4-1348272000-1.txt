review/summary: Awesome but needs FOUR coatsreview/text: I love this color. After getting a manicure withSinful Colors Professional Nail Polish Enamel 56 Neon MelonI bought this China Glaze polish to try to replicate it. Even at the nail salon they had to do four coats to get the China Glaze color to look nice. That's a lot of work. The Sinful Colors brand that they used last time only took 3 coats and I kind of liked it better. But either way it's awesome and I get tons of compliments on it!
