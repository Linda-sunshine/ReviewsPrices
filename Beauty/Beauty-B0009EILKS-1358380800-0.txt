review/summary: Might work for some people... but not mereview/text: If you have black heads chances are that its genetic. Our skin naturally replenishes itself and the oil build up creates black heads. I used these and saw the gross little white or black 'trees' all over the strip, but it did nothing for the day to day black heads I always have. It removed the biggest ones, but my nose was still covered in black heads. I used three of them a week for three weeks and I still have just as many.
