review/summary: Nothing greatreview/text: I am very disappointed with this product because I see nothing great. I used to use Bulgarian rose water purchased from amazon as my toner. It used to tighten my pores and give me a good fresh feeling. Also my skin looked great when i was using it. I tried this for a change and nothing great infact i broke out after using it. Not liking this product
