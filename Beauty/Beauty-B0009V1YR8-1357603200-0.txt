review/summary: Didn't work properly...review/text: I bought this Chi for my teenage stepdaughter as a Christmas present. She's been wanting one for a while and was so excited to receive one. I have a Chi and have no problems out of mine, but the one we received from Amazon did not work properly, the irons would not heat and that was probably because the irons were falling off of the iron. Returned for a refund.
