review/summary: Smells Great! Awesome pricepoint!review/text: The smell is a bit fruity, but in a good way and has a very pleasant and relaxing feel to it. It's a great everyday perfume, especially during the summer, but it's amazing all around. I bought it when it was on sale for around $15, which was a bargain price for a perfume this good. I would highly recommend this!
