review/summary: Great color, too thin.review/text: I fell in love with this color when I saw it and I was so excited to try it. I absolutely love the color but I agree with the people who said that it goes on too thinly. It also has no gloss or shine to it whatsoever and imperfections are so visible! I am tempted to mix some clear sparkle polish into it or something to thicken it up and make it better. Not the best polish by China Glaze.
