review/summary: FAKE CHI DO NOT PURCHASEreview/text: I purchased a 'chi' from this seller in March 2012 and now, not six months later it has melted itself and no longer works. I contacted Farouk because they warranty their products for one year after purchase and come to find out this is a FAKE. They told me within 2 minutes based on where the item was manufactured that it wasn't an authentic Farouk Chi. I'd like a little action. Amazon doesn't do refunds or exchanges after 30 days and I can't seem to find where to contact this seller. I purchased this flat iron under the guise that it is real and quality, it is neither. DO NO PURCHASE from this seller.
