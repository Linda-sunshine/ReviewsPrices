review/summary: I don't know how they do it, but it works!review/text: I bought this brush being very skeptical about it being as good as it seemed to be. I have thick, very long hair that tangles so easily. I used to have screaming and crying matches with my mom when trying to brush my hair as a kid - now that I'm 25, I just have screaming and crying matches with myself while trying to brush my hair. While this brush looks nearly identical to my Conair hair brush - it is SO. MUCH. BETTER. It went through my hair like a hot knife through butter, and it was pretty painless too! I have yet to try it wet, but I can only imagine it will impress me then, too. I highly recommend to anybody looking for a great detangling brush. And mothers - buy this for your daughters - you will both enjoy it!
