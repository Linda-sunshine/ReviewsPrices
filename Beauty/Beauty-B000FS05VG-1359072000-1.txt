review/summary: Dries Guy Hair Fastreview/text: As a guy with short hair, what I want in a hairdryer: it should dry my hair fast, and not be incredibly annoyingly loud. This hairdryer wins on both counts. Bonus: it is not that expensive.Downsides: after owning this for about 3 years, a small bright white spark shot out of it into my sink, and after that it only emitted warm air (and not hot). No problem, I just replaced it with a second one (I guess I liked it enough to buy another one just like it). It also comes with some bulky plastic attachments which I feel guilty throwing away, so they occupy too much drawer space and never get used.
