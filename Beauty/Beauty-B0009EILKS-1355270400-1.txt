review/summary: I initially thought &#34;it enlarged my pores!&#34; was an exaggerationreview/text: I thought, hey, all it does is pull the damn blackheads out, how is that supposed to enlarge pores?Sadly the result of my naivete showed up not more than a week later: my pores, which had stayed about the same size since my teenage years, have multiplied in size and visibility. I have compulsive issues with my skin and had been hoping that these strips would help, but... au contraire. Just catching sight of my nose now makes me feel slightly nauseated now, and of course that has been no help to the compulsions. I don't even know if I'll ever be able to return my skin to the way it was before I used these.
