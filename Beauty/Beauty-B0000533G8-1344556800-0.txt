review/summary: Can't go backreview/text: I love it. I use a pump or two to cleanse my body. However, I wouldn't recommend using this as a shampoo. Hair will collect the wax residue and the hair will remain dry and waxy.Yes, as a lazy college student- I've been using this soap as a body wash and a shampoo. I've also used this to clean my dishes and it worked well.
