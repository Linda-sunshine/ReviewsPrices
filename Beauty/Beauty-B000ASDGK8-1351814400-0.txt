review/summary: Great professional quality hair dryer.review/text: This is the first professional quality, more expensive hair dryer I've ever bought/used at home. It's very different than regular, cheaper ones you buy at the local drug store. It dried my hair much faster and the high heat resulted in a much more polished, smooth look. People sometimes think heat is bad for your hair, but in reality it's better to use a higher heat for a shorter period of time on your hair rather than a lower heat that takes longer.The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because it is quite heavy. But completely worth it.
