review/summary: orks well on long hairreview/text: I found this product to be very helpful with my thinning long hair. I am 59 years old, so it is probably due to hormones and genetic. I do not like how stiff it makes my hair feel, but oh well. It LOOKS great and really thinkens my hair with a natural look. I used it once, thought is wAS JUST OK, THEN WASHED MY HAIR AND COULD REALLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE. I do not think it would work on totally bald spots, but mixed in with hair it is great.
