review/summary: Good straightener, but died so fastreview/text: I got this straightener for my birthday and it worked wonderfully. However, 20 days later it died for no apparent reason. It hadn't been dropped or damaged in any way. It just won't turn on anymore, no matter how many times I push the "reset" button on the power outlet. I'm pretty upset about this. When it comes to Chi, just spend the extra month or so saving up for a real one from the store, not this one. At least when it's from the store you can return it after 20 days.
