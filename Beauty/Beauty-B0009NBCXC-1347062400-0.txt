review/summary: I use it for giving it massages, and I have no complaintsreview/text: I can't speak for its effectiveness for facial skin and/or hair, but it works great as a massage oil. This oil makes skin noticeably softer and smoother, and just a small amount makes giving and receiving a massage much more comfortable. It has no smell at all, so I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for a fragrance massage oil. So far, no complaints.
