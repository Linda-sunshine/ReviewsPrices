review/summary: I had such high hopesreview/text: I'm being generous with my two stars. I have pretty thick, wavy, highlighted, long hair. This dryer just doesn't have the airflow needed to dry my hair without frying it. It does get hot (HEY! that's worth two stars, right?), but when not paired with powerful air flow, you're just baking your strands. I'm returning it. My drug store hair dryer works much better. I am SO disappointed.
