review/summary: Worthless knockoff- NOT REAL CHI!!review/text: This is NOT a genuine Chi flat iron. It's a piece of crap $1 knockoff at best. It fell apart after a dozen or so uses. The metal on the top literally came off from the cheap plastic as if it were stuck to the hollowed out plastic with Elmer's glue. I was suspicious it might not be real given the price, but I thought it might be an older model, and I trusted Amazon to screen merchants who sell through their site. My mistake. I knew when I got it that it felt much lighter than my previous authentic Chi, and the light that tells you it's hot didn't work the same. It didn't take long for my suspicions that I'd been taken to be confirmed. DO NOT spend a dime on this or anything this merchant sells.
