review/summary: For My Teenage sonreview/text: My son had terrible acne on his face and back. I bought him some black soap and melted it then mixed it with Jojoba oil and Almond oil. It works well, now his acne is all gone, he is working on the scaring by washing with black soap and moisturizing with pure shea cocoa butter.
