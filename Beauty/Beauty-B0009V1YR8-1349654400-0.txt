review/summary: Huge dissapointmentreview/text: Here are the reasons I would not advise this product, it is most definitely not a genuine CHI. I purchased the exact same straightener 7 years ago and it worked great up until a few months ago - best straightener I ever had, but I paid full price for it at a salon. Then, I find this one online thinking it was such a great deal. When I finally received the straightener, it was made of completely different material, the plates didn't clamp together flat so it would pull and pinch my hair when I would try to straighten it, it doesn't get nearly as hot, and it is clearly cheaply made as you can see huge gaps under the plates where there is heaps of weird glue that was slopped on. I was sorely disappointed and went to return it - when they notified me that I could have a full refund and keep the straightener.. wow - what an indication that they don't even have faith in their products! I don't even know what to do with this thing now, but luckily I can go out and purchase I real one.Just be advised ladies - if you want the real thing, go to a salon or an accredited beauty store and invest in it.
