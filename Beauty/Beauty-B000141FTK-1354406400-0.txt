review/summary: Tea Tree Oil is the BEST for Body Odorreview/text: I rarely write product reviews but I am compelled to after using Dr. Bronner's Tea Tree Oil Soap. I have dealt with body odor the majority of my adult life. I have tried tons of different soaps that would seem to help only temporarily . I would sometimes take two showers a day and after sweating this 'funk' smell would start to form in my groin. Frankly it was embarrassing! A couple of weeks ago I decided to end this so I did research on different soaps. The all natural aspect of Dr. Bronner's was the original thing that brought me to the product but then doing further research on the benefits of Tea Tree Oil was what really sealed the deal for me. The anti-microbial,anti-fungal & anti-bacterial aspect of the soap is really evident. I have used it daily for a week and that 'funk' in my groin is completely gone. Even after a long day at work I get home and there is no odor. I'm completely impressed with this product, the people at Dr. Bronner's have gained a life-long customer!EDIT: A month later I am still odor free!! I'm just thrilled to have finally found a solution to this years old problem. I also started using Jungleman All-Natural Deodorant which contains Tea Tree Oil and it's excellent as well.
