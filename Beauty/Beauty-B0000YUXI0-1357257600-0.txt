review/summary: Stopped a 50 year nail biting habitreview/text: That's right. 50 years! A few years ago, I didn't get a job that I desperately wanted because the interviewer saw my fingernails and was disgusted by my bloody stumps. I used to bite my nails when I was in school and I've had teachers tell me to leave the class because they couldn't stand watching me chew on my fingernails. My grandmother passed away in 1989 and one my memories is her giving me the evil eye when she saw me biting my nails. I'm sure I've caught several colds over the years because of all the germs I transferred to my mouth from my nails.I bought this a year ago and it took me awhile to work up the courage to start using it. I decided to stop on December 25. It tastes awful. What I expect lighter fluid or gasoline would taste like. The taste definitely stays on the lips for a long time. I was surprised at how often I put my fingers in my mouth, not only to bite my nails, but to dislodge food that was stuck in the back of my mouth or when I was eating a finger food like potato chips. I see this as a positive because it will help me lose weight. It's been 11 days since I've bitten my nails. I'm getting white on the end of my nails! I used nail clippers on my fingernails for the first time ever today. The temptation to bite is definitely there, but it is less every day. I've gotten to the point where it's been so long since I've bitten, that I don't want to break my record. I'm looking at this as a personal challenge. I know I'll have to continue applying this to my nails for a long time and I'm OK with that.Definitely a 5+ star product.
