review/summary: Great colorreview/text: I wanted this polish forever and I was so happy when I got it. This polish is just gorgeous.The formula and brush are both nice and this polish seems to last. I do usually use fake nails, so I don't have much issue with chipping.This polish with Luxe and Lush as a top coat is to die for!
