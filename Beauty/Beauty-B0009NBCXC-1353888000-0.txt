review/summary: AWESOME product.review/text: This is such a wonderful product!I have been using this product for over 6 months now and I can attest that is great for your body, face and hair. I use this on all three, in body/face moisturizer and I mix some in my conditioner and body wash. It does not leave you feeling greasy at all if the right amount is used. This stuff is potent, you only need a few drops each time! It last months, and I use it everyday on my hair and skin.My fear was that it wouId not be worth buying it in comparison to other oils such as coconut or castor oil. But after doing research and using it for about half a year now I can attest it is one fantastic, cannot-live-without product.I also love that you save by buying a larger bottle and that the bottle comes with a clear UV protectant to extend shelf life. Overall, such a great product and would recommend to anyone who wants softer hair or skin.
