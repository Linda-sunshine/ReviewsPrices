review/summary: It's all true!review/text: I'm often easily duped by "beauty" products. I often buy things only to be disappointed. So, although I had high hopes for Thayer's Witch Hazel AF Toner, a small part of me was preparing for disappointment. But I was so happy to be proven wrong! This product is great. I have sensitive skin with some light acne marks, I've been using this product for about a week and a half and my skin loves it! It leaves my skin soft, and isn't irritating at all. It even feels like it's buffing out some of my discoloration. All in all, a great buy and I can't recommend it enough :)
