review/summary: I could do without all the religious mumbo-jumbo on the label...however...review/text: this is a fantastic bodywash! I use the Lavender 18-in One. All natural, non filmy....you will be SQUEAKY CLEAN. A little goes a long way so try to eyeball the amount you put on a scrubber accordingly. Smells lovely!
