review/summary: I've bitten my nails for nearly 20 years... not anymore!review/text: I started biting my nails when I was 7 years old I have tried every trick in the book (rubber band on wrist, bad tasting nail polish, acrylics, etc) but no luck. I ordered this on a whim, wasn't too optimistic... It was the most horrible tasting polish I could ever imagine! I only put my fingers in my mouth twice and that was all it took. I took the polish off first the first time in about 2 weeks yesterday and I still have lost all desire to chew my fingernails. It was a miracle!Warning, this is incredibly strong. I don't know if I would use it on kids without trying it on myself first. My poor boyfriend made the mistake of kissing me on the cheek after I had scratched my face with my nails. AWFUL! I couldn't eat finger foods or scratch anywhere near my lips while wearing it.However, it DOES work! I just painted my nails for the first time at 25! What a treat!
