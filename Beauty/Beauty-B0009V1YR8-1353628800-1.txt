review/summary: Great resultsreview/text: This is my 3rd time buying this flat iron in 10 years. Aside from the flat iron burning out after 5 years the first time and the on switching breaking after 4 years the second time, this is a great product! My hair is always straight and shiny. I tried a few others and none compare when it comes to long lasting results.
