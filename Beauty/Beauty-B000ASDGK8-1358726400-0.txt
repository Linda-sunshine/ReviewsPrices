review/summary: Works great, but be careful with itreview/text: This is my favorite hair dryer. My stylist (who works at a super fancy salon) actually uses the same one. It dries my long, thick hair in 10 minutes. But it's cracked a little from me dropping it a few times. So take care of it because it doesn't seem to be as durable as others.
