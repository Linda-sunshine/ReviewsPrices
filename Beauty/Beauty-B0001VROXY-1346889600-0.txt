review/summary: Polish is not the same color as advertised in picturereview/text: The product was just delivered yesterday. Applied the polish to my nails and it was MUCH darker than the polish in the picture. After doing some research, the polish advertised in the picture is actually Chine Glaze Aquadelic. I will not be sending this one back, I still like the color, but it is much darker than I expected. It looks a little funny since I have a paler skin tone. It is also a matte finish. I expected a shiny finish since the polish is called "china glaze". The color is still pretty, but it definitely needs a top clear coat to make it shiny. If you want the polish color advertised in the picture, look up China Glaze Aquadelic polish.
