review/summary: Hot Tools Curling Ironreview/text: This was a replacement item for one I already had and where the cord had become defective. The only downfall with Hot Tools is that the cords cannot be repaired so when this happens, you have to replace them. The replacement cost is probably about the same as any repair costs. This curling iron is the best one I have ever used. Have to be careful though as it gets extremely hot and you can either burn yourself easily or it used repeatedly on the highest temperature, you will dry out your hair. Otherwise, a great item as it curls your hair extremely fast.
