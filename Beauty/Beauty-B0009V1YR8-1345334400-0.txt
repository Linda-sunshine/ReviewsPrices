review/summary: WARNING Counterfeit Productreview/text: I bought one of these counterfeit CHI's a couple of months ago and discovered it was counterfeit by calling CHI. CHI is currently suing Amazon for continuing to sell the fake product on it's site. I just learned of fake Canon lenses being sold on Amazon as well. Since Amazon started allowing third party venders, the company has been awash in counterfeit and unscrupulous product sales.I just bought an adapter that Amazon claims works with 27" iMacs to connect blu rays too. What Amazon fails to tell customers is that the iMac must be two years old or older to work. After getting duped into buying the product, Amazon forces the buyer to deal with bogus third party venders to return items. I'd rather pay the extra and forgo the hassle and risk of getting ripped off.
