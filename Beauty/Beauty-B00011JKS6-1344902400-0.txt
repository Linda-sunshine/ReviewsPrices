review/summary: LOVE THIS COLOR!!review/text: For Audrey is an absolutely gorgeous color! It does look very much like the Tiffany blue and works on most skin tones. The fact that it's China Glaze just makes it better, all my China Glaze polishes go on very smoothly and last for over a week without chipping when I use a top coat. I highly recommend the color and the brand.
