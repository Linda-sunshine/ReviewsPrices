review/summary: Works well and covers as it shouldreview/text: I'm in my early 20's and noticed that my hair in the front is thinning more than it should be. I've been searching for a while for a product that was realistic for me to be able to use everyday that didn't require multiple applications of foam (Rogaine). I sprinkle the product on my scalp after I have styled my hair then gently pat/shake the roots of my hair with my hand to have it blend a bit easier. I absolutely could not think of going a day without it now that I have tried it and it has honestly made me feel so much better about myself now that I'm not constantly worried that people are looking at my very visible scalp.My only little problem is that I ordered the Light Brown (I have light brown hair with sandy highlights) and if I apply a bit too much of the powder it looks noticeably yellowish. My next order I think I'll order just the Brown to hopefully solve the problem.
