review/summary: Lights stop working, can't replace them.review/text: I used to have a similar mirror to this by a different maker that lasted decades. Then I tried this Jerdon model and liked the lighting and magnified mirror even better, but after 2 short years, the bulbs will no longer light. I'm sure it's not the bulbs, but rather the ballast. You can't get parts for it, though, so now it's going to Starvation Army or someplace like that. Fortunately, there are a couple of similar mirrors on the market by other makers. I'll try one of those next. I wouldn't buy a Jerdon again unless it were the only lighted vanity mirror of this style. Even then, I'd think hard about it. Other reviewers didn't get even 1 year before the lights went dark, so it seems to be a real crapshoot. Two years might be the max, and that only if you're lucky.Got to go check out that Conair version now.
