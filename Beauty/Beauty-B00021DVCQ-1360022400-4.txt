review/summary: Light and Natural Feelingreview/text: Before i had found this foundation I always was on the hunt for something light and natural. I don't like people to &#34;know&#34; i am wearing makeup. This product covers wonderfully and hides imperfections. I might to a re-apply later in the day unless i paired it with the mineral veil which will help it wear longer. Very little is needed for coverage which helps this last longer also. I always feel like i am wearing nothing with this foundation and have had fewer clogged pores since i started to use it. It also doesn't cake up in the heat when sweating. I hated when you could see someone makeup and the sweat rivers through it. I used to pay full price at the store. Anything less the $20 is a steal in my book.
