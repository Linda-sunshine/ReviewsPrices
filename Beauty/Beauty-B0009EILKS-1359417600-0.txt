review/summary: A Work of Pure Geniusreview/text: Whoever invented these things is a genius, pure and simple. They are amazing. I don't care what you try on your blackheads, nothing works as beautifully as these little miracle strips do.The process is super simple- wet your nose, place the strip and let dry. When you peel it off after 10-15 minutes, you pull out all the gunk that was so happily residing in your pores. And when you do? UgH! The stuff that comes out is fascinating in a way you are probably too proper to talk about (more proper than I am, apparently). You will be shocked and disgusted by what these pull out of your pores. It leaves your nose a little dry afterwards, but that is the small, small price to pay for such a great result!Love these!
