review/summary: Professional Qualityreview/text: So far I have been amazed by this dryer. I have never wanted to spend the extra cash for a pro dryer, but after nearly dying from electrocution from my last cheapo drugstore unit, and almost burning down the house with the one before that, I decided to go for it. A world of difference. Powerful force of air that blows right through my long hair without crisping it. The horrifying whine made by any other dryer I have owned is a low frequency hum from this Baby(liss). Drying time is less than half of what it used to be. Sexy rubberized matte black finish is oh so appealing. Buy this one!
