review/summary: Unblocked some pores temporarilyreview/text: The strips when used properly removes about 60% of the blackheads and unclogs pores. This is temporary though because the pores fill up just as quickly as they were unclogged and many times you'll end up with more blackheads than before. The only way to get clear pores is to use this often which can be irritating to the skin and time consuming, especially for guys. The best way to reduce blackheads is just using a scrubbing face wash a few times a week.
