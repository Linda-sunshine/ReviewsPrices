review/summary: DISGUSTING!!!review/text: I love all Dr. Bronners products, even the tea tree oil which actually smells like Pine Sol to me. This rose does not smell like rose, smells like a**. I NEVER write reviews but I just had to for this because it is THAT BAD. Honestly I feel like puking even thinking about the smell. I don't know what to do with it, don't even want to open the flip top again. Absolutely disgusting UGHHH.
