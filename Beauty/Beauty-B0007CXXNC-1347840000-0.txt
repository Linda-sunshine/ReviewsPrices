review/summary: This really is an incredible product...review/text: I've colored my hair for over 20yrs and it's long - the ends are very dry. I bought this product and left it on for 20 mins with a shower cap on. I went to rinse it off and didn't particularly feel like it was doing anything. But when I got out of the shower and went to comb my hair, I was shocked! I was able to comb it without using any additional products (I usually have to use the Enjoy Conditioning Spray or something similar or my hair is totally matted, even after using a high quality conditioner).Well, after I dried it I was even MORE shocked! It was incredibly shiny, and not at all frizzy. The ends were lovely. Being a bit skeptical, I wrote it off to a bizarre coincidence. That day, I was in line in the grocery store and a lady behind me said I had lovely silky hair! I have never, ever had anyone say that to me - because it has always looked unhealthy and dry towards the ends.3 days later I washed my hair and used this product again. EXACTLY the same thing happened. This product is now my holy grail of hair care. It's amazing. I highly recommend it to every one!CON: The only con I will give to this product is the smell. Yuck. I was shocked that other reviewers fell in love with the smell. It is, to me, exactly like a very heavy men's cheap cologne (old spice comes to mind). I'm not exaggerating. I'm not a fan of overly-perfumed hair care products and the very strong perfumy smell really put me off the first time I used it. But honestly, the results are worth it and the smell wears off pretty quickly.
