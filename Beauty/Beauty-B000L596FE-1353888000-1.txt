review/summary: Love these brushesreview/text: I bought two of these brushes. My hair stylist recommended them and I'm glad she did. I have thick hair and de-tangling wet hair has always been a problem for me. I use this with a de-tangler/moisturizer that I've always used and it definitely works great. I use it on dry hair too and it works just as good. I highly recommend this product. I only wish I could've picked my own colors, but I am happy with the black and purple ones that I received.
