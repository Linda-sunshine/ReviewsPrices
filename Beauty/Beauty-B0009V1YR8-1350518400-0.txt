review/summary: THIS IS FAKE, PLEASE READ.review/text: I want to give this zero stars. I suspected the item was fake, the price was too good to be true. But once I opened the package I immediately put it back in the box, printed out my return labels and sent this garbage back where it came from. If you've ever seen a real CHI or used one, you'd know the difference right away. It's a lot less weighty than the real CHI. The gap between the two plates is a lot wider and totally off. I didn't even use the iron, but just looking at the plates I could tell that they weren't real ceramic. I know I may sound like an expert, but I'm not. It's so cheaply made that it's way too easy to tell that this is not a real CHI. Like some others have mentioned, the pamphlet is tiny, only a slip of paper (maybe 2 pages worth). The real instructional guide for the CHI is 24 pages. They managed to add the comma to the name of the company on the top so it seems more real, but it's not guys. The package the iron was in was cheap, the sides of the box the iron was in (not the brown shipping box!) was sloppily taped together with plastic tape. Please don't buy this if you want a real CHI. I paid $69.99 and got my refund, but you may not depending on how long you wait. The day after I purched online, I saw the CHI at Marshalls for $79.99, the real thing only $10 more than what I paid for a fake one! Now I don't think Marshalls is an authorized dealer, so you may not get the warranty, but I doubt they are selling fakes, and I doubt the real thing is going to break down on you anytime soon (not even in 2 years, I doubt it). I'd suggest paying a bit more and getting the real thing than a fake which will damage your hair. Don't do it.
