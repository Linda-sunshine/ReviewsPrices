review/summary: Great product!!review/text: My son is 7 years old and was sucking the life out of his thumb. I purchased this product because of the reviews I read and it was also in my budget. According to my son, I was the worst mom in the world for about one day. He got over it and he has also stopped sucking his thumb. I only had to use the product twice. He only complained about the taste when he ate fingerfood. I think it has been over two weeks. So far, So good!!
