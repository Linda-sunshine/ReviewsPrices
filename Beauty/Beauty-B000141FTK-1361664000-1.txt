review/summary: Bought 32oz. on 6/29/12, Still Have A Lot Leftreview/text: I use this as both my shampoo and body wash everyday. I put it in an old soap dispenser that has a foaming pump nozzle. This way, with each pump it adds oxygens to the soap, giving it volume and making it easier to lather. It also means that one or two pumps will cover my entire body from head to toe, saving how much is used. I still have about 16oz left after about 8 months of everyday use, so I've saved quite a bit on shampoo and body wash.It should be noted that I'm a guy with short, thick hair who isn't concerned with conditioning or moisturizing. My wife, who has longer, finer hair found that it made her hair a bit greasy and had to switch back to her old products. So for women, it may not be as great as their hair is much different than men's hair.
