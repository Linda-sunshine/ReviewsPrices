review/summary: Love thisreview/text: I bought this as an ingredient to make my own laundry detergent. I did some research on this product and there are so many other uses for it. I didn't know how I would like it so I bought a smaller size, but I love it! So the next time I have to order some I'm getting a bigger amount. I bought the lavender and it smells absolutely amazing! Strong but not so much that it gives you a headache.
