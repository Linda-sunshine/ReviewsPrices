review/summary: Broke in less than 2 monthsreview/text: I bought this flat iron because the price. I should have known a flat iron that costs as little as this one did would break. I was so ticked off when right before an important interview, this thing didn't heat up. With no time to go to buy a replacement, I had to go to interview with a rat's nest on my head.
