review/summary: Wonderful oilreview/text: I bought this a while ago and I'm about to purchase some more. I did a lot of research to find the right almond oil to buy for all my homemade products and this one is great. The first one I purchased from a different seller had fragrance and I thought this will too but it didn't. And I was disappoint and thought I bought the wrong oil. That is until I found out that Fragrance contains a lot of chemicals that is harmful to our health and nobody should purchase anything with Fragrance in it. So thank God for this seller and the wonderdul natural product that is made by them.
