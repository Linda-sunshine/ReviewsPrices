review/summary: Great productreview/text: I have an allergic reaction to many makeup products but fortunetely I am able to use Bare Escentuals. I don't like the way liquid makeup feels or looks on my skin. I have wrinkles and liquids seemed to feel like spackle filling in the cracks! Bare Escentuals powder is so light it's like there's nothing on my skin yet it smoothes out the uneven coloring and makes my skin look soft and glowing and heaven knows, we can use all the help we can get! Easy to apply and lasts all day.Only negative is their new top. I am cheap and try to use every grain of powder but with this new &#34;improved&#34; top, you can't remove it and as it gets empty, I know there is still a bunch of powder hiding in there, just taunting me!
