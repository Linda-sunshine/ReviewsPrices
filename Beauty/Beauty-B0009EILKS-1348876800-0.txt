review/summary: Didn't work for mereview/text: I bought this product because it was on sale and I wanted to give it a try since my nose is covered in deep blackheads. I followed the directions and pulled the strip off. There was a bunch of little things on the strip that looked like little hairs. I looked back at my nose and didn't notice any change. I still had a ton of blackheads. I tried this for 3 weeks and nothing changed. Maybe there is no hope for my nose or maybe I need to try it longer.
