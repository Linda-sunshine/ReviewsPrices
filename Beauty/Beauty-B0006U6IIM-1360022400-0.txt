review/summary: Fabulousreview/text: I add a small amount to baths and it does a fantastic job of adding moisture to dry winter skin. Despite being almond oil, it actually doesn't leave any scent on your skin, so there is no completion against your favorite perfume. I've also used small amounts right out of the bottle all over my skin and it absorbs quite quickly. For the size of the bottle the price is unbeatable.
