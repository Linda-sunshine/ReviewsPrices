review/summary: Design flawsreview/text: I sleep with an eye mask every night. My old fleece one had worn out completely. I was looking for something comfortable and affordable and this mask appeared to fit the bill. You would think a good mask would be easy to design, but this one has some serious flaws.Pros:Opaque material completely blocks out light if you have a small noseMask made of extremely comfortable fabricElastic is adjustableCons:Shape does not work well for people with large nose bridges since mask is thick and does not have a cutout for the nose, it does not bend well over the nose and allows light in the bottomElastic is uncomfortable around ears or under earsElastic adjustment is velcro on the back of the head and so gets caught in long hairHad I known about these flaws I would not have bought this mask, fortunately it is cheap. As it is, I have covered the elastic with some softer fabric which takes care of the velcro issue and the discomfort issue. If I pull the mask down over my nose and tight the elastic enough it is mostly light tight but I find it slips upward during the night. I will be buying a replacement for this.
