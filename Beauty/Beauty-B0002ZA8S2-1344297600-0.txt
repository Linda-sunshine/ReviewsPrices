review/summary: This curling iron is absolutely AMAZING!review/text: I have long (a few inches below my shoulders), thick, wavy-freezy, color treated hair. I've had many curling iron's but none that would hold my hair for more than an hour or two, even with a ton of hair-spray. With the Hot Tools iron, my hair stayed for days & days with only a few touch-ups & without using a ton of products, even in hot, sticky, very humid weather. I also got done in half the time!! No pulling or catching on the iron either. I cannot say enough about this curling iron. I absolutely LOVE IT!!
