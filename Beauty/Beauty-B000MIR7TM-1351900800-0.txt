review/summary: Still in great condition after almost a year!review/text: I've read reviews last year about this "wonder sponge" and thought I would give it a try. After reading majority reviews stating it promotes a flawless, air brush look, I wanted to try it even more. So, the first time I used the sponge I have to say the application is flawless and so easy to apply. I also love the small amount of foundation you need compared to other foundation brushes/sponges etc. So I'm saving A LOT more money on foundation ;)I've also read reviews stating the brush won't clean correctly. I've had my sponge for almost a year and it's still in great condition. I just use baby shampoo and anti-bacterial soap to disinfect after each use. Although, there is color from the foundation still on the sponge, my skin has not broken out. I presume the sponge hasn't harbored too much bacteria. In my opinion, there isn't any sponge that compares to this one! Definitely worth the money.I am ordering two more now!
