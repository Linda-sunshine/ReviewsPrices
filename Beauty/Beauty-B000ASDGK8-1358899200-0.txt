review/summary: Good for 8 monthsreview/text: This hairdryer worked great when first purchased - very powerful for its price.Unfortunately, 8 months later, the high speed setting no longer works. With long hair, this makes the dryer all but redundant unless you want to commit your entire morning to your hair. The rubber around the handle has also started to fray and peel. The dryer was never put under any more stress than you would expect - used to dry hair once every other day, stored in the bedroom away from steam and humidity.I can't recall if it came with a warranty (I assume it did; although the box, instructions, etc were lost during a move). If you do buy this dryer, I recommend keeping hold of all that information just in case. I emailed the seller to see if they could help on the warranty situation but never got a response.
