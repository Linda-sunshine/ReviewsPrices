review/summary: A great product for hair and skinreview/text: I have a very dry skin and hair. I have other products like hair gels and other oils for my hair but they just make things greasy without helping. This oil is great. I only need 3-4 drops (I am a guy with short hair) to oil my hair. It keeps my hair moist and oiled for the whole day without making my forehead greasy. I have been getting more than a few compliments about my hair color as it seems darker now.I also use this on my skin and My skin seems smoother than before as well. I would def buy it again.
