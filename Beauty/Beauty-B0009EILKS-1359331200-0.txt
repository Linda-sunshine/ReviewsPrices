review/summary: Papier Mache For Your Facereview/text: I absolutely LOVE Biore strips. It's like papier mache for your face. It's very easy to use, and it really works! You can literally see the results.I'm weirdly thrilled when I pull off the dried strip from my nose/face and I see the -- for lack of a better word -- gunk stuck straight up on the strip, like little villagers crowding around the town square. I think, "Oh, that's great! It really helped clean out my pores!" Then I think, "Ew. All of that gunk was caked in my pores?" It's really quite the double-edged sword.I usually use the strips about once a week or once every other week. That way, I'm always guaranteed great results. Deep cleansing and exfoliating your face is great, but Biore strips finishes the job that those surface cleansers miss. I've also tried similar generic strips to save on cost, but none work as well as Biore. I'm hooked for life.
