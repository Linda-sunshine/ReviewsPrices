review/summary: The best foundation ever!review/text: I have tried many foundations over the years and this is by far the best I have ever tried. There are many reasons as to why it is but I'm just going to name a couple. First of all, I have dry skin and I have to moisturize before applying any make up. I've tried liquid foundations that are geared towards people with dry skin and none of them have worked for me. They usually look greasy,settle into my pores/lines or just slide off within a couple of hours. I like that I can use a moisturizer that I like and use bareMinerals over it. It feels light(like I'm not wearing anything) and covers most imperfections without looking caked on. Even if you have a blemish or age spot it can be blended away. You can use a smaller make up brush to add a little extra to those areas and it works really well. You can use that technique for dark circles as well. On a final note, let me say how impressed I am with it's staying power. Summers are very humid here and there is nothing more frustrating than doing your make up only to have it sweat right off 5 minutes after you walk out the door. Somehow bareMinerals holds up. Love it! That is all:)
