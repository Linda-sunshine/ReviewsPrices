review/summary: Great Brush for Wet Hairreview/text: Ordered two of these as Christmas gifts. Gave one to my daughter and the other to my granddaughter. They both have very thick hair and complain the entire time they are brushing out their hair after a shower. First time each of them used this brush, they were amazed at how easy it brushed out their hair. My daughter said she didn't even use conditioner and the brush was just gliding through her hair. We were all amazed. This is a great product. Don't hesitate to purchase it for the person with difficult hair in your life.
