review/summary: So disappointed... should be called "Warm" Toolsreview/text: I read all the reviews on Amazon for this curling iron and was so excited to receive it. However, as soon as I plugged it in I could tell something was off. I couldn't tell if it was heated up all the way because it still felt warm... so I waited 5 more minutes and no change... in a lot of the reviews people said it only took 30 seconds to heat up! Not mine... after 15 minutes on the highest heat setting, I could still touch the barrell. So upset! I got this curling iron to replace a bad quality Revlon brand one from the drugstore that barely curled my hair. But with this iron, I don't see any difference.I am positive that Hot Tools is a great brand, but I'm also convinced I got a knock-off. I ordered from the lowest-priced seller, which happened to be "Amazon.com." If I were to do it over again, I would ORDER FROM A SMALLER SELLER. I was enticed by the free shipping, but I would pay shipping all over again just to get the real thing from a more legit seller. Be careful who you buy this iron from, you could get a knock-off!!!!
