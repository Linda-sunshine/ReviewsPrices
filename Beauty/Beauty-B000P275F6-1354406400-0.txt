review/summary: Nice Floral Fruity Scentreview/text: This has got to be the most perfect scent for summer! Its a very nice fruity, soapy floral scent and since there is no citrus in it like typical aquatics, it is not harsh at all and very very pleasant to the nose. And when I say floral, it does that mean that it smells feminine at all, it just has that just hoped out of the shower fresh feeling. The best way for to describe it is think of like a nice fresh body wash and makes you feel fresh and clean, this is pretty much that smell.This cologne gets raved on by basenotes and fragantica as being one of the "best cheapie" fragrances you can get. Longevity and sillage are also pretty impressive as well for an aquatic (6-7 hours on my skin). Definitely a fragrance for a younger guy in high school or college.
