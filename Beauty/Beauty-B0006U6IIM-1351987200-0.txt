review/summary: One of the best oilsreview/text: I use a lot of natural oils and this is one of my favorites. The 16 ounce bottle is huge and will last you a long time. It can be used as a body moisturizer, facial moisturizer, oil treatment for hair and scalp, and my favorite use-eye makeup remover! I use to cringe every time I bought a tiny $4 bottle of eye makeup remover-this stuff is so much more economical. Just rub a little on, then use a cotton ball and warm water to wash eye makeup off. Also removes foundation. I mix a little lavender oil in for a pleasant smell, although it does smell nice on its own.
