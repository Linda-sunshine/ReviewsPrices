review/summary: Worked great until bottle broke when droppedreview/text: This worked great for us on our 4 year old son, who sucks his thumb mostly at night. He did not get the gag reflex, but definitely did not like the taste. Just putting it on the tip (which we tried first due to other reviews) did nothing. When we applied to the whole nail, that's when it started to work. Though we were more likely to put it on each night, as if we missed a days, he would be more likely to put his thumb back in. We did not have an issue with him eating as others have.However, the bottle got knocked a short distance to the floor and shattered. In cleaning it up, it got all over my husbands hands and mine. I definitely had the gag reflex, couldn't stop dry heaving and could not get the taste out of my mouth. It definitely lasted a full day or two. My husband said it was nasty, but didn't have the gag reflex that I had.Now I need to get a new bottle, as he is sucking his thumb again since it broke (though not as much). I have really liked the results to far.
