review/summary: Use it wetreview/text: I had seen reviews stating that nothing compares to the Beautyblender so I decided not to go for a knock-off, and I am glad that I didn't. I am sure others have stated this, but make sure you use the product wet. The first time I used it I only dampened it a little (it did not grow in size) and it did not blend very well. I wondered what all the hype was about. However, if you get the sponge completely wet and squeeze out the excess water, it will grow quite a bit in size, and then it works wonders! I use it to apply a BB cream that I previously had blended in with my fingers or using a foundation brush. There is a huge difference in the way the product looks on my face: it is much more even and blends into my skin much better. I highly recommend the Beautyblender!
