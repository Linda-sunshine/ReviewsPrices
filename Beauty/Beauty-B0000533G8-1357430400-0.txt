review/summary: Very mild and gentlereview/text: Lathers well, and gets me feeling clean, but not too dried out. This is not a harsh soap and the size I got lasts for quite a while, 32oz. I like the tea tree oil, which is the only one I've purchases so far, next I think I'll try the eucalyptus one. I definitely recommend. I don't have any allergies, but I'm thinkin this would be great for people that can do stuff like dove or swauve.
