review/summary: Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Mask, 8.5 ounces Jarreview/text: Macadamia masque revitalizing hair reconstructor for dry, shop-worn hair. a multiple of macadamia oil as well as argan oil along with tea tree oil, chamomile oil, aloe as well as algae extracts reinvigorate as well as reconstruct a hair, withdrawal a hair deeply nourished for softened agility as well as gleam with long-lasting conditioning benefits. It really does all that is says... my hair usually is dry and almost not elastic... this masque leaves my hair feeling soft with lots of movement after drying or if I just leave it to dry natural. Hope this helps!
