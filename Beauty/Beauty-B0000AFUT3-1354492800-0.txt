review/summary: It's alrightreview/text: The magnified mirror is really warbled. You pretty much have to get right up next to it for it to become clear enough to use. Also, my light switch doesn't move. It is stuck on the middle setting & won't budge. Since this lighting is adequate for the most part, I chose not to send it back. My luck on Amazon with just about ANY &#34;lighted&#34; device has been a bust. Getting tired of having to send things back. QC could definitely use some work.
