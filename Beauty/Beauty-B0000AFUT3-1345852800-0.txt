review/summary: Piece of Crapreview/text: I bought this mirror in February 2011, and as of 8/25/12, the mirror no longer works. It is not the bulbs, but it is probably the capacitor. It would cost just as much to replace the part as if would to just buy another mirror. Wow, they have this one year warranty figured out. Like Tommy Boy said, it is a guarenteed piece of crap in a box.
