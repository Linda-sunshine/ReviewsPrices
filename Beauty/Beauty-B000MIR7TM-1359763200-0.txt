review/summary: AMAZINGreview/text: Literally best thing I've used to put on my foundation! I use loreal true match liquid foundation and stipple it in with this and it is just the greatest thing ever. I used to use the real techniques expert face brush and it was a real nice brush but the beauty blender is just so much better, I also used to use a dupe sponge from sephora (yellow face sponge) for the beauty blender and it sucked, nothing compared to the original beauty blender! I have combination skin and when I used a brush my dry patches would be so noticeable and would actually flake but with this my face is smooth all over, my skin is glowy and even!
