review/summary: Very strong pore strips but painful to removereview/text: I used these pore strips many years ago as a teenager when they first started being sold. They worked well back then but I never saw the amount of blackheads being removed as others said they did. I decided to try them again as an adult and I think think this product is actually stronger than it used to be. As an adult I don't have as many blackheads as I used to, but this strip seems to remove them all. I can see them on the strip after I remove it. This product is designed to be used on your nose, but I've had luck cutting it in half to use on my cheeks or using the entire strip on my forehead. I can definitely tell a difference in my skin after using these strips. My skin appears cleaner but the strips irritate my skin and cause it to turn red. Make sure you don't use these right before going out.My complaints with this product:- It is very painful to remove the strips! I wait until they are thoroughly dry and peel them off, and it brings tears to my eyes trying to get them off. The package says you can wet the strips to remove them but I thought that might reduce the number of blackheads that will be removed so I have not tried it.- It takes a while for the strip to dry on your skin - about 15 minutes. In the meantime you'll look like a crazy person with a a bandaid on your nose.
