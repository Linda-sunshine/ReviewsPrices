review/summary: SCAMreview/text: DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! I found out AFTER I purchased this item that it was probably a fake. I checked some specs online and it appeared to pass the tests. That is until it just stopped working 3 months later! I'm dumb for thinking I could buy a Chi for $50. Don't be dumb like me, just cough up the $100 and get the real deal. What a scam. Who knew people made FAKE hair straighteners???
