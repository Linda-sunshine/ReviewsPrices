review/summary: Chi has gone downhill.review/text: This is the same model and brand I've owned since I started buying flat irons when they first came out. I ordered it to replace the one I've used almost every day for three years when the cord started separating from the body. The new one is noticeably more cheaply made. It does heat up just like the old one did but the hinge joint feels loose, the cord stiff and cheap and the whole thing like a light plastic toy compared to the old one.
