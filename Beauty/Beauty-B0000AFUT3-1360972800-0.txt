review/summary: Disappointed, not the same tried and true!review/text: I was excited to find this mirror, which appears almost identical to my ancient Remington brand mirror that gave up the ghost after 20 years of daily use. Unfortunately it is very different: the lighting is signficantly dimmer, the daytime light setting is quite "pink" (akin to the "evening" setting on my old mirror), and the magnified side is concave shaped and distorting. My old Remington, even without lighting, is vastly superior to this model, which I will be returning promptly. This is another case of much lower quality standards where they don't make them like they used to!
