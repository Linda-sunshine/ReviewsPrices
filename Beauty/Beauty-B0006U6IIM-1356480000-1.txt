review/summary: Love NOW!review/text: I bought this oil to be a carrier oil for homemade lotion. I wasn't sure how it was going to smell since the name is *sweet* almond oil. It doesn't really smell at all, which is ok. I actually like the smell of almonds so I wouldn't mind if it did smell. It worked perfectly in my lotion, and has wonderful benefits to your skin and hair. I would definitely buy it again.
