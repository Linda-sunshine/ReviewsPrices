review/summary: HORRIBLEreview/text: I bought this item to replace my previous chi which had broke. When I received this item, it looked exactly like my old one except it wouldn't even turn on!! I plugged it in and the red light would only come on every once in while, making it impossible for the iron to even heat up!! It seems to be getting worse day by day, if that's even possible. I've tried contacting the seller several times, it's been about a couple weeks and still no reply. I'm in the process of filing a claim with Amazon. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this item!! Spend a little extra on the authentic ones in the store, it's worth it!!
