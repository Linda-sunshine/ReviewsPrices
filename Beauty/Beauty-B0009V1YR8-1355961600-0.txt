review/summary: Great flat ironreview/text: I have super-thick hair and most curling or flat irons won't work. They don't get hot enough. This iron works wonderfully and the ceramic surface protects the hair. I bought one for my daughter and she loves it too. We've had them for a number of years and haven't had any problems.
