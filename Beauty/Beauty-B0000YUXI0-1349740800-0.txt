review/summary: I was sceptical...but this works AMAZING!!review/text: I'd like to start by saying that I've never been so impressed by a product that I've been compelled to write a review...UNTIL NOW! My son recently turned 3 and has been a CONSTANT thumb sucker since birth. His teeth were starting to get messed up, his thumb was callused, cracked and bleeding from the constant wetness from his mouth. With his 3rd birthday in the horizon, we knew it was time to do something. We purchased Mavala Stop after reading reviews about it and I will admit...I was sceptical. If it was this easy to stop thumb sucking and nail biting and cost so little...then why doesn't EVERYONE use it?? So, for $10.99 + free shipping we figured that it was worth a try. The first day I painted it on, my son tried to suck his thumb...he announced that it was UHHSCUSTING (disgusting)and has not tried to suck it again. Yes, you read that right...HE HAS NOT SUCKED HIS THUMB AGAIN! Not even while he is sleeping. I am truly amazed by this product and by the affordability. I have recommended it and will continue to recommend it because it really works. Thank you!!
