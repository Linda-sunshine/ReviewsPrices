review/summary: Hot Tools Professional 1102 Curling Ironreview/text: Very nice looking and it really looks professional. Heats quickly and has several settings. The only problem I have is the stand. It tips the iron forward leaving the hot iron touching my counter. I don't want the hot iron resting on my counter thinking it might burn so I leave the wire at the end of the iron hang off the counter and it seems to balance the iron properly. It also comes with several extra springs. I've never had to replace springs on any iron and I use irons for years so I question this. There's also an order form to order more springs.
