review/summary: Bright neon!review/text: I loved this color, but didn't realize it was so translucent. That was disappointing. Three coats gave me the color saturation I wanted, but that meant for longer dry time even with a quick drying topcoat. Also, it made any art (flowers, dots) with this color more difficult because of the layering. I still really like this color, it's fun and bright!
