review/summary: Scent grew on me...review/text: I never buy perfume or frangranced items online since I can't obviously smell it for myself, but becuse there were so many positive reviews on this scent and the price was right I decided I'd give it a try. When I got it I was somewhat disappointed because I thought it smelled like old ladies, but the smell grew on me. I've also noticed it changes throughtout the day as I'm wearing it. I'm not longer disappointed and use it everyday!
