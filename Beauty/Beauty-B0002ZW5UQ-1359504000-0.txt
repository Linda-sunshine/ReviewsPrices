review/summary: Looks like dirt!review/text: If you are reading this, you're going to bald and going to buy this product no matter what I say. Just be sure to save the shipping package and get ready to return.1)Why I don't like product: After applied it looks like you have just sprinkled dirt on your head. It doesn't stick to hair. I just colors your scalp.2)How long I've used product: Once. That's all it took to figure out item #1. I don't believe the reviews that claim they've been using it for years.3)Items that didn't meet my expectations: I realize now why in promo videos they have someone else applying the product. It's impossible to do yourself. How can you feel confident you've covered the bald spot behind your head evenly? Maybe if you have a friend sprinkle this on you every morning and confirm it's been applied correctly you would feel confident. What's worse? The embarrassment of a bald head, or somebody saying you have dirt all over your bald head?4)Selling experience was great. Amazon backs their products.
