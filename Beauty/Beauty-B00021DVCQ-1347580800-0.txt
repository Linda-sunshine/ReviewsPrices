review/summary: exact same beauty store product, only cheaper!review/text: bareMinerals is a great brand and their foundation works well to flawlessly cover acne, scars, or dark circles. However, I use more than one shade of powder to match my natural skin tone. I use 'Fairly Medium' with a concealer brush for under my eyes and problem areas, and I use the slightly darker 'Medium' for my overall face. Buying more than one shade can get expensive ($27 each in stores) and I'm SO glad I found out I can get bareMinerals on Amazon. I saved about $10 on each container and they got to my house by the end of the week. I will definitely buy my bareMinerals through Amazon from now on!!side note: I've used bareMinerals for years now, so I know what shades match my skintone. If you've never used bareMinerals before, it may be wise to find an Ulta or a Sephora and have someone help you match your tone. You dont have to buy at the store, but at least you wont waste time/money by getting the wrong shade!!
