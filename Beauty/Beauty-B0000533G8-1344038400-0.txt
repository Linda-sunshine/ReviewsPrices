review/summary: STINGS EYES BADLY!review/text: Whatever you do, don't get this stuff in your eyes. And remember to dilute it for showering/shampooing. I got it in my eyes, full strength, and I spent the next hour wondering if I would need to go to the emergency room. Fortunately I had some eye wash on hand--a lot--and used it constantly. This is nasty stuff.
