review/summary: They workreview/text: Like everyone else says, they work. Now the effectiveness can be up for debate, but I have fairly sensitive skin so I don't really want to melt my nose off. I am happy that it doesn't pull the skin off my nose, yet still seems to get some of the blackheads every time.
