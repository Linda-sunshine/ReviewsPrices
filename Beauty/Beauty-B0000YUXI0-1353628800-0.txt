review/summary: Didn't work for my little nail biterreview/text: My little 3yr bites his nails terribly, and would even go at his toenails when he's done with his finger nails. It was easy to apply, smells horrible, tastes worse. My hubby complained about the lasting aftertaste it left. But after all that, my son still bites his nail. He did throw up from the first time he tasted it after trying to bite his nail. It deterred him for a day, but even after daily applications for a couple of weeks, he still bites his nails. So will have to find something stronger.
