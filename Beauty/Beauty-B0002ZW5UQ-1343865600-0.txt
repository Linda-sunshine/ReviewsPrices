review/summary: Makeup for your hair - good, if a bit fiddlyreview/text: Got this to cover up thinning hair on the top of my head as well as my crown. It's a bit fiddly to put it on the back of your head by yourself, and you'll definitely need two mirrors so you can see properly. Once you get the hang of it, it's fairly straight forward to use. The real benefit for me was thickening some areas around the temples so as to extend my hairline a bit further.I'm also using Rogaine, which has given me headaches. Toppik does contain ammonium chloride which is meant to give you headaches too - something I have experienced, but not sure whether it's the Toppik doing that or not.Overall though, if you just need a bit of coverup, this does a pretty good job!
