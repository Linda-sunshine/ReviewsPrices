review/summary: Great product!!review/text: This works perfectly. I will now never be without this product. I color my hair and have used both the medium and dark browns. When my hair is first colored (dark brown) the corresponding dark brown product is undetectable. Once the color starts fading and my hair gets lighter again I switch to medium brown and again it matches perfectly. Next spring I'm getting heavy blond highlights and will purchase the blond. This has been a miracle for me..
