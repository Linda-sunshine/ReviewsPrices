review/summary: Works like a charm!review/text: My dentist recommended Mavala for my daughter (when she turns five) because she said it worked on her daughter. Well, I didn't wait until she was five, I waited until she was two and a half and it did not kill her. Astonishingly, she stopped sucking her thumb immediatly. She had a moment where she cried in my arms and said, "mommy, I just want to suck my thumb!" crying and crying. I told her, honey, your thumb doesn't taste good at this age and it's time to stop. That was the end of it. Within a week, I didn't have to apply another drop. It has been over and month and she is thumb sucking free!! I was talking to co-workers about it and she friend bought the rest of the bottle. I didn't have to use much. She paid me for the remainder, so the Mavala paid for itself essentially and now both of her boys (two and three) are also no longer thumb suckers. Love this product and would recommend it to anyone. Just FYI, put it on their thumb when they are sleeping. Children are clever and can put two and two together. Nailpolish on thumb=bad taste and want to wash it off. Good luck!
