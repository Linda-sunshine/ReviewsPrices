review/summary: Better design since I've last tried...review/text: I haven't bought a box of Biore pore strips in over 5 years. I am impressed on several new factors: There is better coverage to more adequately cover the nose area, strips stick much better, and lastly there is no gooey residue that I remember being left behind on the older strips.I gave it 4 stars because I like the improvements, however I feel that it didn't quite get everything. My pores looked cleaner and there was a definite removal of gunk, but I feel like they didn't remove as much as they did on the older version.Bottom line, these strips work and get some of the dirt out but it will not be a deep clean.
