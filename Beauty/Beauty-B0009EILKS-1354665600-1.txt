review/summary: Wow!!!review/text: I had absolutely no idea that my nose was bad, and it definitely isn't compared to a lot of the videos you see out there of massive blackheads being pulled out. BUT! I decided to get this after I was beginning to become bothered by cleaning the pores with my fingers because they were definitely noticeable when you got real close.I followed the instructions and before peeling it off, it was almost as though you could actually see the strip sucked into the pores ready to pull stuff out. Sure enough, the strip came off painlessly, just a little tug on the skin. If you have really sensitive skin I can see where this would cause problems. Needless to say from the title, it certainly worked. My nose feels fantastic and I was shocked at how much it got out. It left my nose a little red but that's quickly fading and boy oh boy does it feel smooth and fresh!Looking forward to seeing the real results after a couple uses!HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
