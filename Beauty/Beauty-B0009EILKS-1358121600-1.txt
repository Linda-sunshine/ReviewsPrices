review/summary: Addictingreview/text: I don't know why I keep buying these, its some sort of sick need to see all the junk that accumulates in my pores. These strips are supposedly really bad for your face, and yet, I buy them. I find they work fairly well WHEN they work. According to the directions, you wet the area of your face you'd like to clean, and stick this on for about 10 minutes until the strip gets hard (like paper mache). Sometimes, the sticky goop that comes on the back of the strips stays stuck to my face. Therefore, the strip doesn't remove any of the dirt stuck in my pores, and I have glue and gunk stuck on my face. My skin gets really irritated and red after having to scrub the glue off. But when they do work, they make for a fun girls night. These strips + nail polish + funny movie = lots of laughter.
