review/summary: Amazing hair productreview/text: Using this product is the absolute BEST thing I have every done for my hair. I have hair that is oily at the scalp and dry on the ends. It is processed and goes through daily flat ironing or curling irons. I use a little of this masque in the shower every day and my hair looks so much healthier--is softer, stronger, and more easy to manage. It leaves no oily residue, just healthy hair.
