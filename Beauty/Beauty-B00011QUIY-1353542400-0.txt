review/summary: Good curlreview/text: I have very fine, thinning hair and the regular curling irons I have been using left my hair flat and whatever curl was there, left immediately. This curling iron does manage to make a good, lasting curl. I was very concerned about the heat intensity, but I have it smack, dab in the middle and it works just fine. I do like the swivel cord--makes maneuvering it around the head nice and easy. It has a strong spring and I do like the indentation in the tip. It allows me to put a finger in it for better control. I know some people remarked about the dial, but I don't find it moves--it stays exactly where I put it.
