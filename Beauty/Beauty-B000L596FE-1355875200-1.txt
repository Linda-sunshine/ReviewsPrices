review/summary: Miracle Worker for Thick Curly Hair on Pre-schooler! No Breakage, Just Detangling!review/text: This is the ONLY product I have found that gets out the knots and matted messes in my daughter's hair. She has thick, short, curly and sort of nappy hair. She was 3 years old before I found this product and we struggled mercilessly before that. No detanglers, shampoos, conditioners, or any other types of brushes, picks, or combs worked. It also works on my hair which tends to knot up very easily in the back (my hair is wavy). Other brushes have ripped out or broken off my hair instead of detangled it. I have several of these brushes now.
