review/summary: I think my hair is just too thick...review/text: It does detangle wet hair, but if your hair is long, thick and curly like mine, it takes quite a while to brush through all the tangles. Some tangles are too stubborn for this brush, and oftentimes I lose patience and end up just brushing my hair with a regular brush (when wet). This is a great brush for thinner hair that does not tangle easily. Great concept though; just didn't work wonders for me...
