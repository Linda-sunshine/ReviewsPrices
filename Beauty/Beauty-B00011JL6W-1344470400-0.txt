review/summary: "Dorthy Who?" Is FANTASTIC!review/text: This is some of the most beautiful polish I have ever owned. Just so bright, shiny, and vibrant on the nail. A gorgeous brighter navy blue with fine flecks of shiny micro glitter create the perfect blue, without being to overwhelming or dark. Just great! By far one of my favorite polishes ever!
