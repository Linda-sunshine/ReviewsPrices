review/summary: Very bad tastingreview/text: This worked great to break my daughter from sucking her thumb. However, not so good with my son. He has a strong gag reflex and he would gag and throw up from the taste. My daughter figured out very quickly not to stick her thumb back in her mouth. My son, not so much. He would just do it over and over and then throw up over and over. So, I guess you just have to decide if you want to take a chance. Works for some, but not all.
