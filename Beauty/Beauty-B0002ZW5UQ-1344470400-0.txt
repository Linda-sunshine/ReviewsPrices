review/summary: Worksreview/text: I bought 3 different colors because I did not know which would work because my hair is a mixture of colors. I have very thinning hair due to meds I take and in the crrown it was getting worse. I was very skeptical about using this but a friend recommended it and I thought I got nothing to use. Well I put it on and it actually worked. Now I actually did not look bald in spots where I was getting. It makes you look like you have a full head of hair and I really did not use a lot. It also did not come off on my clothes nor my pillow as I slept all nightIt came shipped on the exact date it was promised and imwouldmdefinetly recommend itIf you are not suremofmthe shade buy a few. Get the smallest bottle and then when you decide which one or ones work for your hair. Then buy the larger size. As I will nowRobin
