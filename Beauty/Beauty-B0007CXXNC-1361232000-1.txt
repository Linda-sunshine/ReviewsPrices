review/summary: Great product!review/text: I gave this product 4 star instead of 5 because of the price. It cost me around TT $130 plus shipping, customs and VAT to get it here in Trinidad and Tobago. Nevertheless, I love this product!!! I came across this product while on the hunt for a good moisturising deep conditioner. My hair is relaxed and craves moisture; this keeps my hair really moisturised for days. I have tried many deep conditioners before this; I also tried finding something to replace this because of the price but always keep coming back to it. I will definitely recommend that you try this.
