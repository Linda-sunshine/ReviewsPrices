review/summary: Didn't work for mereview/text: I was really disappointed by this product after hearing all the hype. I have very large pores on my nose and expected a lot of junk on the strip when I removed it. Nearly nothing. I need to try it again, and will update after I do, but it's hard to get motivated to use them again after the first experience. :-(
