review/summary: Wasnt as expected!!review/text: I had ran out of my previous stock of almond oil from India and was looking to buy a good grade sweet almond oil. I was pleased reading the reviews and I was tempted into buying it. The product didnt quite turn out to be as I had expected. I felt it was much thinner and less viscous than the oil I paid for from India. Especially when I paid twice the money for the same quantity of oil i expected it to be atleast similar to the one I had. Disappointed... :(
