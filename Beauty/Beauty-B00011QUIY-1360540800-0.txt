review/summary: Wonderful Cruling Ironreview/text: I had a curling iron of this same brand for about 10 years, it was a wonderful iron, but the spring finally broke. I bought a replacement at Sally's, but I would not recommend buying anything there. It was expensive and a piece of junk! I tried to return it, apparantely customer satisfaction is not important to a company that sells low quality junk. I came home and ordered this iron on Amazon for half the price, what a delight this curling iron is. It heats up wonderfully, has a nice long barrel and even came with extra springs. I'll bet this one lasts 20 years!!! :) If you are in the market for a curling iron you won't be dissappointed, but don't shop at Sally's.
