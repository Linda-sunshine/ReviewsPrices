review/summary: ABSOLUTE BESTreview/text: I had one of these previously and when the cord went bad I could not find one in any of the stores. Thanks to Amazon I was able to find a replacement. This is the absolute best curling iron I have ever used. The only negative is the cord gets twisted really bad and you have to stop and untangle the cord. The twisting of the cord is what finally killed my previously iron because the wires broke in the cord. With that said, I did get to use my iron for a quite a while before the cord went bad and it is still totally worth buying.
