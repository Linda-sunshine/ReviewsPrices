review/summary: Miraculous and Life Changing!review/text: I can't begin to sing the praises of this product enough! I've always had very thick, dark hair and so much hair, in fact, that I often had to have it "thinned out" when I went to the salon. After surviving cancer and having a hysterectomy last year, I noticed that my hair was dramatically thinning on top. Having dark, thick hair - my hair loss became so noticable, especially against my (pale) scalp. This side effect of my illness and took a devastating toll on my self esteem.I had never heard of Toppik before but I accidentally "stumbled" upon it, as I was reading (less than positive) reviews for another, "spray" product, meant to combat the same problem. Then I went to the Toppik website and was shocked to see how many positive reviews this product had. Despite all the positive reviews, I really didn't think it would work for me as well as it had for everyone else who had posted their reviews.Within a few days I had a small bottle of Toppik in my hand and decided to give it a try. After a few shakes of the product, I stood looking at my scalp in the mirror, in complete disbelief. It worked! In fact, I'm going to say that it worked miracles!! It made the wide, pale patches on the top of my hair completely disappear in seconds. I shook my head and the fibers didn't fly off. I ran my fingers through my hair and it didn't rub off on my fingers or fly off in the sink. The real test came when I went to bed that night with the product in my hair, and the product was still in my hair (and not on my all white bedding!) when I woke up the next morning.This product is easy to use, can be applied in seconds and is one of the most effective products for thinning hair/hair loss I've ever used. I can now go out in public without feeling self-conscious about my hair loss. Wonderful.. and yes, life changing.
