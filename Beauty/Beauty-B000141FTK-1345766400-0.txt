review/summary: Dr. Bronner's soap i'm a fanreview/text: I kinda like this soap. You don't have to use much like other soaps, so i'm thinking it will last me a while. The soap is very runny or liquidy? not like Dial or any other soap i've ever used before. But it does a great job in cleaning me, my body feels refreshed and tingly in some areas (maybe an effect from the peppermint). But, one thing i noticed about the smell, it has a certain odor i can't describe...i'm talking besides the peppermint smell, it's a little strange since i'm not used to it. Possibly something to do with that fact that it's organic? maybe it's the oils? anyway, it's the only negative about it really. I'm new to castile soap, maybe i'll just get used to it. Still, i'd buy this again it seems to work great.
