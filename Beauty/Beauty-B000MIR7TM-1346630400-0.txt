review/summary: AMAZING! Must havereview/text: I was a little skeptical when purchasing this product but after reading the reviews, decided it was worth the try. I've used it for 2 weeks now and can't rave enough about it! It has done wonders for my foundation routine. I was using a MAC foundation brush, but I haven't touched it since I purchased this. I used a very thick, long wear foundation. This sponge was easy to use and does in fact give me an air brushed look. It does NOT soak up foundation like most sponges and blends product perfectly. I've tested it out with drugstore and department store foundations and have gotten the same results. Both look flawless. No cake-yness at all.
