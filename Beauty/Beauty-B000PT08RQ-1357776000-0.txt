review/summary: Not that goodreview/text: My daughter-in-law wanted a wet to straight straightener so I purchased two of these, thinking I would love to skip the blow drying process. My daughter-in-law loves this product, but it does nothing for my hair. My hair is thick and semi-curly and it took FOREVER to get my hair from damp to straight with this thing. I even tried drying my hair first but it just didn't do a good job straightening my hair plus it weighs a ton.
