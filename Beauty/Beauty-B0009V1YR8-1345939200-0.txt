review/summary: Top Quality Chi Flat Ironreview/text: I had a CHI for over 5 years that was finally biting the bullet. It was making funny noises and I needed something reasonable and similar. I found this CHI on Amazon for, not only, cheaper but better quality. I started looking on websites and this one seemed to meet my budget and was overall a better CHI. It has very good quality, held heat and a smooth finish to my locks. Its actually very sleek and portable. I recommend using a Thermal protector as well as a smoothing gloss when using this product, especially if you have color- treated hair. Great for short hair, and adds a glossy flip and hold.
