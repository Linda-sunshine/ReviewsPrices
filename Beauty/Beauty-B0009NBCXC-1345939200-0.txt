review/summary: A Great Oilreview/text: It leaves your hair very shiny and skin very soft. use only a little because its highly concentrated. I use about two teaspoons in my 16oz shea butter for my hair. Its a very good combination for african hair.I also used some on my 4 month old nephew's cheeks because he has a very bad case of eczema. It smoothed his skin and took some of the redness away.
