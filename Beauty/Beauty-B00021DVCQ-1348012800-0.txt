review/summary: Fake onereview/text: I use Bare minerals for 3 years now, I really love it. I was thinking that was a really good deal on Amazon, but I can tell that is not the real bare minerals!Bad coverage, even I try to put more on my face, the result is not uniform at all and looks like I don't have any make up on my face. I am very disappointed. I don't recommend to buy it.
