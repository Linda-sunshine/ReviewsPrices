review/summary: Works!review/text: I love this product! I simply wet my nose as the instructions said to do, put the strip on and forgot it for about 15 minutes. When I pulled it off I was shocked at what it had pulled from my pores. I put the strip under my 'day' lamp and a magnifying glass because it looked like dark stubbles of hair! Gross! Especially since I sure don't have any hair on my nose -- nor was all that black 'dirt' visible to my naked eye! I knew my pores were large there but I didn't know they were THAT bad. I'll be using this weekly now. My nose even felt smoother afterward as if the cleaned out pores had made the skin itself tighter. I highly recommend this product to feel like you've done a super thorough job of cleaning ALL of the skin on your face.
