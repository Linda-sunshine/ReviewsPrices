review/summary: For the price its good, short shelf life thoughreview/text: i received my item and is GREAT!!! i keep it on a max of 1 hour per day. With that being said i expected it to last longer than 11months. Yup thats all i got was 11 months of usage. But for $30 i decided to by another (because i did like it). Hopefully this one last me longer. The lights just wouldnt stay on anymore, worked for like 30seconds then would go off. Sigh
