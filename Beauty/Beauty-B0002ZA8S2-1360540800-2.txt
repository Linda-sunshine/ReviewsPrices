review/summary: Love it!review/text: This is the 2nd of this specific curling iron that I've purchased. The first one I had for about 6 years before I dropped it too many times and it finally quit working. I love it though! My hair holds the curl the best when curled with this iron, and I don't even use product. It relaxes a little throughout the day, but I like it like that. I use it on the highest heat setting and have no problems. My hair is about average I think, not way thin but not thick either. I hope this review helps.
