review/summary: Addicted!review/text: This stuff smells amazing! I'm totally addicted. If you use toner you have got to try this brand! It's alcohol free (so it doesn't dry my skin), Paraben-free, Propylene Glycol-free and used un-distilled Witch Hazel. And most of these ingredients are Organic. It's scent comes from natural rose water! Plus, all Thayers products are vegetarian and never tested on animals.
