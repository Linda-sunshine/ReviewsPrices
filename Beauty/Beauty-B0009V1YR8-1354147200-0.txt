review/summary: Happyreview/text: I bought this same CHI straightenair two years and has lasted me a year and a half. This product works very well, ceramic is healthier then metal. It straightens very good and curls and flips. I bought it for 100$ at target. so I was recently on a hunt for it and found it here for a unbelievable price. I didnt believe it but still continued to purchase it. It not only got here before delievery date it was brand new. And didnt pay for shipping! So I'm still using my new one with no problems. Can't go wrong with that price(:
