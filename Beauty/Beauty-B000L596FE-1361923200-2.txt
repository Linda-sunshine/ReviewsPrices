review/summary: Pain-free brushing... that leads to many split endsreview/text: I got one of these for myself and one of these for my niece who has VERY thick hair.I love that it does not hurt to brush my hair, but I haven't been using this product that much because of how many split ends it caused for me and my niece both. It's a little unfortunate. I still have the brush and I toss it in my beach/pool bag because when it comes to getting tangles out at the beach or pool this product is a lifesaver!I would not use this product for everyday use because of the split ends!
