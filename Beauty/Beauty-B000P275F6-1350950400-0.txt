review/summary: Doubting it's authenticityreview/text: At first I was pretty happy with this purchase. It smelled nice and while I noticed the scent only lasted an hour or two, I got a 3.4 ounce bottle when I only paid for a 1.7 ounce bottle and I paid like 1/3 normal retail price.The other day while shopping at a department store, I saw this cologne at the fragrance counter. I gave it a quick spray on my wrist (free cologne!) and noticed it was much stronger and more pleasant than mine. The single spray also lasted longer than the 2-3 I usually use.I'm seriously starting to believe I received a knock-off. The price is almost too good and the scent isn't as good as the stuff from the department store. Amazon should look into this.
