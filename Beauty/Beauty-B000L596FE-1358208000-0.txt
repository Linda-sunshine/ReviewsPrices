review/summary: It really works on long wet hairreview/text: My 9 year daughter has wavy long thin hair and gets so tangled. This brush is great after swimming and for getting the tangles out of wet hair. I like it for my hair after the shower. Helps with less breakage. The only negative is at 1st my daughter said it hurt her scalp? After a few weeks of using it she no longer complains that her scalp hurt. I did notice it was red after the 1st time we brushed her hair but now no issues.
