review/summary: Do not get in plastic bottles!review/text: Jojoba oil is awesome stuff, but do not buy it in plastic bottles. Personal care products are a major source of phthalates, which are endocrine disruptors, and can help promote thyroid problems, diabetes, etc. Phthalates are in plastics, and phthalates leach into oils. Any jojoba oil in a plastic bottle will be choke full of phthalates. Buy Jojoba in glass containers. La Ronna is a good source for this.
