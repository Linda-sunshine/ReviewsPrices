review/summary: Castilereview/text: Disappointed with the film that Castile leaves on my stainless sink. Other than that, the product is as described. Scent is mild. While the label on the bottle is chalked full of interesting graffiti, nowhere does it give any dilution ratios. I found that very annoying. I had to look them up online.
