review/summary: This stuff is greatreview/text: I'm not trying to hype this up, but this is honestly some of the best soap I have used.I use it for hair, facewash, and bodywash. If you plan on doing the same you have to keep a few things in mind. This stuff is rather concentrated, so don't use as much as normal. Also, it has no lathering agents, so you have to do that on your own. It took me a little getting used to but I am happy I made the switch. Also, I bought a 16 ounce for like 9 bucks and didnt have to get shampoo, body, or facewash again for about 3 months. Cost effective much?For hair, put a little in your palm and lather it up, then put it in your hair. scrub as usual. If your hair is especially dirty, rinse and do it again. Once I started using this product I stopped washing my hair every day, and only rarely use conditioner now. You might want to do the same and see how it goes. A lot of people think that it will get greasy and gross, and maybe yours will, I dont know. For me however, a day or two after washing with this soap is when my hair looks its best. Its not greasy and gross, but it looks more natural, and is easier to manage. Honestly it awesome, try it out.For face and body, just toss a bit on a washcloth or scrubber and lather it, then wash away.The peppermint feels great, and smells good too. I have tried the citrus and almond as well and they both are nice too.
