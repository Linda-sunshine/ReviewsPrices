review/summary: It made our 4-year-old daughter stop sucking her thumb!review/text: Our 4-year-old daughter had been sucking her thumb since she was born. I didn't know if we would ever get her to stop. After her last dentist appointment, we decided it was time to get serious about getting her to stop sucking her thumb before she ruined her mouth. I reviewed a lot of products online and Mavala seemed to have the best reviews. I was disappointed that it could only be purchased online, but I received it really fast considering I ordered it right before a weekend and Holiday (I ordered it on Friday, December 28 and it arrived Wednesday, January 2). I put it on her thumb right away. The first two nights were a little rough - she tried sucking her thumb and hated to bitter taste, so she kept begging for us to take it off so she could suck her thumb. It hasn't been two weeks yet and she has only tried sucking her thumb just those couple of times in the beginning. As of now she has all together stopped sucking her thumb! She doesn't even try since she doesn't want that bad taste in her mouth. I've probably only reapplied it three times - she doesn't realize that it wears off, so she doesn't even try to suck her thumb and I haven't reapplied it in over 5 days! This stuff really works, I'm amazed! I would recommend starting this on a weekend, though - she didn't get much sleep the first night because she kept sticking her thumb in her mouth inadvertently and she'd wake up crying. I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants their child to stop sucking their thumb.
