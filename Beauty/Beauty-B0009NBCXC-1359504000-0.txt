review/summary: Not what I expectedreview/text: This product is ok but I find it does not hold the moisture in my hair as I had read about after moisturizing my hair. Though I love the larger size of this oil the biggest disappointment is most of the oil leaks from the bottle and the lid does not stay securely closed. The first day of use I took the oil to work and by the time I got there a fourth of the bottle had leaked in my bag and that happen a couple of times. So when I need to travel with it I have to wrap the top with something and bind it down to keep the lid from leaking or opening. It was truly disappointing after spending all that money for it and still not get the results I was totally hoping for. I would still recommend this produce because where it may not have worked on my hair as I thought it would, does not mean it would not do better on some else hair. Mybe I got a defective bottle and maybe this won't happpen with another but be cautous because that oil will be on everything making a big mess.
