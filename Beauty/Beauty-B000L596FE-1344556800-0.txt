review/summary: Ahhhh-mazing!!!review/text: I don't usually write reviews on products, but I MUST on this one! I see I'm not the only one. After seeing a hairbrush making similar claims for twice the price plus s&h on T.V., our 4 year-old daughter said "I want THAT brush so I don't cry anymore when you guys brush my hair!" Naturally I hopped on to Amazon to check out the reviews prior to ordering said brush and stumbled upon The Wet Brush. We received it today and I kid you not I didn't even have to use any detaingler on our daughters nauturally curly, extremely long, thick hair. There were no "owwww"'s, no "stop"'s, no tears. This brush was amazing despite my skepticism after feeling the extreme flexibility of the bristles on the brush. The only downfall (in our daughter's eyes), we got a yellow one and she of course would have preferred pink or purple. ;) I knew going in we couldn't choose the color, and apparently unlike the one on T.V. for twice the price, it doesn't make a difference what hair type you have the awesome brush is the same. I even tried it on my extremely thick and coarse hair and it went through with ease and left no tangles behind. Buy the brush, you won't be disappointed.
