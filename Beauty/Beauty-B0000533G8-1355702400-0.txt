review/summary: Stings!review/text: My 3 year old told me it hurt his eyes the first time we used it - hubby said he might be overreacting, so I tested it in my own eye (a mother's love...) and it had me doubled-over in pain it hurt SO BAD...it is still hurting now, 10 minutes later, as I write this review. I disagree with whoever had the idea that making baby soaps that aren't tear-free was okay. My two toddlers make my brain swirl by the end of the day...but even then I don't take pleasure in burning their little eyes!
