review/summary: This brush packs a punch!review/text: I was browsing for a new paddle brush on Amazon a couple of months ago, and this came up as a recommended item. Being that I have shoulder length, very thick, color treated hair, having a good detangling brush for my wet hair is a must have for me. I have tried so many brushes and detangling sprays and nothing works as good as this little gem!At first, I was a bit skeptical when I saw the size of the brush, thinking that it wouldn't help get the knots out of my hair after washing it. However, this is a miracle brush! This makes detangling my hair easy and pain free. Yes, even at 25, tangled hair can hurt just as much as when you were 5!My hair dresser has always told me to use a comb on my wet hair, but I find that's more of hassle than using a regular brush. With the Wet Brush, I just spray some leave in conditioner on my hair before brushing, let it soak into my hair and a few minutes later, I start combing my hair section by section. I usually start with the underside first and work my way around my head. I do find that I have to go over it with my larger paddle brush, but at least all of the knots are gone.I would definitely repurchase this brush. I just hope that they make this brush in a larger size one day.
