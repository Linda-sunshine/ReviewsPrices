review/summary: Only got to a few pores.review/text: We had bought a similar type product a few years ago and had amazing results, however, I couldn't remember what brand it was so I bought these instead. We were totally disappointed. It pulled stuff out from maybe 10 pores onto the strip. We felt as though this product was poor quality. If I had bought it at a store I probably would have returned it, but since it's online I don't want to go through the hassle of shipping it back. Waste of money. Would not buy again.
