review/summary: WORST FLAT IRON, CHEAP WALMART REVLON IRON DOES MUCH BETTER!review/text: When you first do your hair, it's shiny and smooth. By the end of the day, your hair will be back to it's normal texture. (I do my hair at 6:30am. Around 9, I notice it's wavy, thick, and frizzed like it normally is.) It doesn't have a tempature setting, and at 350 degrees my hair stays straight and beautiful. I'm gussing this flat iron is around 200 degrees. My Revlon flat iron straighted and kept straight. If I knew how to return this iron, and have the proper packaging, I would. I guess the next time I go to the mall, I'm going to have to spend hundreds of dollars on a iron at a kiosk. At least I will be able to tell if it does good with my hair...
