review/summary: Love this straightenerreview/text: This is my 2nd Chi straightener. I love this brand because it lasts pretty long. The reason why I got this second one was because the 1st I had, well I share it with my siblings and it's getting quite old. I love how this straightener does not pull on my hair like other cheaper brand straighteners. This specific straightener was slightly different from my first Chi, because it somehow put a shine on my hair as my straighten my hair with it. Which was nice and different.
