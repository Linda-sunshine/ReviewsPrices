review/summary: Unusably hotreview/text: This hairdryer has 2 heat settings: (1) Too Hot, and (2) a setting I can only describe as Unsuitable For Hair But Handy For Paint Removal. If you want a good thumb workout, you can flash the cold shot button on an off in a vain attempt to prevent this thing from vaporizing the hair right off your head. Mainly my hair ends up hot and still wet, or frizzy from overheating.I threw the packaging away before I realized how awful it is, so I'm stuck with it. I am incredibly cheap, and yet my intention is to get rid of it and buy a new one next time I'm at Target. I hesitate to even give this thing to Goodwill, but maybe I'll do that instead of throwing it out. I'll be sure to attach a note saying &#34;not for use on human hair&#34;, just to preserve my karma.
