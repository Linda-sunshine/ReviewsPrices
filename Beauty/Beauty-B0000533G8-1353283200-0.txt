review/summary: Scent Repulsed Mereview/text: Something in the product's fragrance profile resembled vomit to me, to the extent that I became nauseated while using the soap for laundry. I generally love rose-scented products. As this was a very unpleasant experience, hopefully I am the only person who will have this experience. Also when I used it in cold water, the soap solidified on clothes. I am looking forward to trying the unscented version, for hot & warm washes.
