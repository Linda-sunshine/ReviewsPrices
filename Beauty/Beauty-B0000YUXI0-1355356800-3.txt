review/summary: Works great and so easyreview/text: This was so very easy to put on my daughter's thumb to get her to stop sucking it. She is 5 and has been sucking for a very long time. The dentist was recommending all these contraptions to put on her thumb but they were all so expensive. When we found this one, I was like, what could it hurt to try it. WE have only had to put it on maybe 3 times and she hasn't sucked her thumb anymore!!! It really works!! I even used it on myself and was able to stop biting my nails. It is an awesome product that is small enough to fit until your purse and go anywhere, is always there when you need it.
