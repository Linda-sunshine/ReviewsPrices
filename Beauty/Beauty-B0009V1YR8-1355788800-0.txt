review/summary: I would die without my Chireview/text: I live in Florida, so everyday I am bombarded by heat and humidity. I have very thick, wavy, coarse hair. Due to Florida's climate, I can't leave the house with my hair natural, or I will just look like a hot mess. But thanks to my Chi, I don't have to worry about it.I used to buy cheap straighteners, but it would just damage my hair, cause static, and a few hairs would stick straight up. Horrible. And all the hairspray and products in the world could not save it. So, finally, I saved up and bought myself a Chi. One of the best decisions I have ever made for my hair.Now, I do not have static. My hair comes out straighter, less frizzy, and shiny. I also do not have to worry about protecting my hair because of the way the Chi is built, it barely damages the hair. I've had mine for almost four years, I've dropped it quite a few times, and it still works like a dream. A plus is also that the chord is very long, so finding an outlet is no problem. I take my Chi everywhere I travel.Also, there is no heat settings. While that might seem bad, its actually really helpful. That way, all you have to do is turn it on, and in literally two minutes its ready to go. You don't have to worry about setting the heat, whether it will be too hot for your hair, and all that crap. It just does it all for you.Anyways, so I use my Chi after I blow dry with no product, then finish off with Bed Head Masterpiece massive shine hairspray. And ta-da, my hair is ready to face the Florida humidity, and it doesn't budge an inch.Amazing, must-have for hair!! Its what almost all hair stylists use, and there's a reason for that. Buy! And get it on Amazon, because I paid about 160 in store.
