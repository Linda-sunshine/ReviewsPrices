review/summary: China Glaze Flying Dragon :(review/text: Totally hate it. In the bottle, it looks like a fun fuchsia with blue and pink micro glitter, but in reality, it dries unattractively matte, shows EVERY brush stroke, and the glitter (which is barely visible) resembles little pebbly specks. A huge disappointment since it looked so nice in the bottle. I managed to salvage the manicure by hiding it under a glittery top coat, but I think this is ultimately going into the swap pile. I still love China Glaze, I just don't consider this to be one of their successes.
