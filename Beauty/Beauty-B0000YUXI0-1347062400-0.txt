review/summary: SWEET VICTORY!!!!review/text: Our daughter has been sucking her two middle fingers since she was 6 months old (she is 3 1/2 years old now). We have tried several items to break her habit. None worked. Her new pediatric dentist recommended Mavala. After ONE week of application, she stopped sucking her fingers. It has been 2 months since she last sucked her finger. Sweet victory!!!!
