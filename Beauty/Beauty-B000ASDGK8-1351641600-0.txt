review/summary: My Hair Likes the BabyBliss!review/text: I've only used the dryer once so far, but I can tell you that I saw a big difference in the end result of my hair. I had way less frizz at the scalp line and my hair just felt smoother overall. The dryer itself didn't feel all that heavy to me, but it's definitely a solid piece of hardware. I like it! I'll update a few months down the road and let you know how it's holding up.
