review/summary: Classy, light scentreview/text: I wanted to try Egyptian Goddess to compare it with Abdul Kareem Egyptian oil since it's a little cheaper, more portable. I love it; the scent lasts forever without being overpowering. This is the scent that morphs with your body chemistry to create a unique-to-you signature. It's hard to describe, so if one was curious about what all the Egyptian oil user rave about, this is a good place to start.
