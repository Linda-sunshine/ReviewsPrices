review/summary: This Sponge Saved my Lifereview/text: OK, that's a little dramatic but I'm seriously thinking about ordering one for all of my friends so I can spread the joy. For years I used a brush to apply my foundation (Make Up For Ever HD) and that worked well until I started using Atralin (Retin A). All the lovely (read excruciatingly annoying) flaking that comes with Retin A made using a brush impossible because it encouraged more flaking. So I switched to a powered foundation (still Make Up For Ever HD) and applied it with a stippling brush. That worked well but I craved more coverage. More research ensued and I found this amazing product.My new and highly rewarding foundation routine: after I apply my sunscreen (Supergoop! Save Face SPF 35+ A.m. Moisturizer, 3-Ounce) I wet the sponge and squeeze out all the water I can, then I put a small pea of beauty balm (Dr. Jart+ Water Fuse Beauty Balm SPF 25 PA++ Water Fuse Beauty Balm SPF 25 PA++ 1.7 oz) on the back of my hand and dab, dab, dab one side of the sponge in and out of it to work it into the sponge evenly before using the same dab, dab, dab motion on my face. Then I do the exact same thing with my foundation. Afterwards, I set both using a micro finish powderMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microfinish Powder 0.35 ozbefore cleaning the sponge.Highly recommended!
