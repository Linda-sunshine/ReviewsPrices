review/summary: Excellent mirror!review/text: I had a mirror like this long ago and it got lost in my cross-country move. I've gone through several magnifying mirrors since, all non-lighted, and although they weren't awful, they just didn't compare. This mirror rules. Hands down. I can finally see again when I tweeze my brows.
