review/summary: Horrible product!!!review/text: I bought Br. Bronner'castile soap in 3 scents.After started using it,my skin became itchy and dull looking.Before using Dr. Bronner,we were using a different brand,just as healthy but in a bar.On top of my skin issues,I had to scrub my tub after each shower due to the awful residue that this soap was leaving.So,I decided to put it away until a few days ago when I found a dish liquid recipe calling for this soap.I made the soap and all I can say is that again this thing is awful.My dishes and my sink have the same residue as the tub.Love the lavender scent and the fact that is pretty natural,but that's about it.
