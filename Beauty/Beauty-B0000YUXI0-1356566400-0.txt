review/summary: TOXIC! - You're a fool if you don't research the ingredientsreview/text: I almost purchased this product... I mean the reviews are stellar. It sounds like it really works and I wanted to buy it. Interestingly I didn't see reviews that questioning the safety of this product.I researched only the first ingredient, "Ethyl Acetate," and here's is just a tiny excerpt of what I found on the osha.gov website..."Affects on Animals: Ethyl acetate is a respiratory tract irritant and, at high concentrations, it causes narcosis and depression of heart function [Hathaway et al. 1991]. The oral LD(50) for acute exposure to ethyl acetate is 4,935 mg/kg for rabbits and 5,620 mg/kg for rats; and the 8-hour rat inhalation LC(50) is 1600 ppm [Sax and Lewis 1989]."That's all I needed to see. You can read the rest of the article here:[...]I love my kid too much to risk using this crap, even if it does work.
