review/summary: Best eye mask I've ever ownedreview/text: This is far and away the best eye mask I've ever owned. It's lightweight comfortable and does a great job blocking the light. These are almost as small and lightweight as the ones they give away on trans oceanic flights-they take up almost no space and weight nothing.There are what seem like little pockets on the lower inside part. I thought they were for tiny cold packs, nope, this extra bit of padded fabric blocks light entering from the bottom. Well done! This is accomplished with other eye masks by tightening up the strap.All in all a terrific eye mask. I'm going to order a couple more so when I lose this one on a long flight I'll have a spare.
