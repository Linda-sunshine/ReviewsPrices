review/summary: New favoritereview/text: Does have a bit of a minty/chamomile smell fresh out of the package, but that fades in a few days -- it's not stuffed with it or what have you (I hate lavender, so it was important for me to find a mask that *wasn't* 'imbued with essential oil of lavender' or whatever fluffy marketing speak for "stinks".)The bridge of the hose is a little low on my face, making that part feel a little snug/tight and less comfortable but after a few days that breaks in as well.It's very smooth on the inside. The pictures don't show it well but there's little padded bits along the bottom edges to help make it comfortable and keep light out.So: give it more than a one night's wear before making an opinion on it. Fits comfortably and does what it's meant to.
