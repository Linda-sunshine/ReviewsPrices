review/summary: nice & tingly!review/text: I squeeze a dab onto a shower pouf, put some warm water on and lather, then wash with it. I have sensitive skin and NEVER had an issue with this product. It does tingle so my only recommendation would be to not try to shave with it (if you have sensitive skin like me that is) scent does not really linger.
