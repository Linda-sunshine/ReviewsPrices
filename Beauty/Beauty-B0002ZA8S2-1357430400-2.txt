review/summary: great tool!review/text: This was a gift for my daughter who loves mine (i have the same one)... it makes amazing curls in just the right size and i have even learned to do them without leaving a &#34;clip&#34; mark. Just make sure the stand is flipped down and away so you don't burn part of your face with it (yes, i did manage to get a mark on my forehead)...i use the hottest setting and it works like a charm...just add some beach spray if your hair is fine, so the curls stay better. Then separate and you have some awesome waves!
