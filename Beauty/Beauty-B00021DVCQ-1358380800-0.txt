review/summary: Good makeup, company perspective is very poor in other areasreview/text: The makeup line is overall excellent - looks and feels flawless and light. The best I've tried. The company keeps trying to compete in the wrinkle and facial treatment arena also but that's definitely not their strength. I've used many of their treatment products and they don't come close to the products you can get from Olay or L'oreal or better. The biggest frustration I have with this company (besides their customer unfriendly no return policy which is why I buy from Sephora only) is their packaging - absolutely the worst. Hard to open up the tabs on the containers - if you had arthrtis or bigger fingers than mine, it would be impossible. Additionally, the thoughtless design makes it difficult to extract the last bit of powder in the container unless you somehow figure out how to cut or tear open the heavy plastic seal. Ridiculous! Honestly, it's such an incredibly stupid design and makes the product frustrating as heck to use. Lastly, I just bought a new "warmth" bronzer after mine ran out and they had shrunk the product container size so that the price was the same but the package itself contained half of what was in my original container. Needless to say, that didn't grow my loyalty to them.
