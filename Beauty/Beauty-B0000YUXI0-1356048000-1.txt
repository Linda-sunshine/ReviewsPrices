review/summary: Doesn't really workreview/text: My daughter is 2 and I have been trying to get her to stop sucking her thump for the longest, I would put this on her thumb, 2 minutes later her thumb is right back in her mouth, should would frown a little bit but it did not stop her frrom sucking her thumb. She has stopped sucking her thumb throughout the day but still tries to do it at bedtime to soothe herself.I began putting sucks on her hands at night to keep her from sucking her thumb.
