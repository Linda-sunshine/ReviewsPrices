review/summary: Works great! my hair and hands are hydrated and moisturizedreview/text: I used it on my hair to solve fuzziness. With only 1-2 drops, the oil moisturized my hair and added a styling effect with increased elasticity to my curved hair. And I have tried to put some into my hand cream and it makes my hands feels really soft and hydrated. Love it!
