review/summary: Nice but not favorite - Water Goddess by Auric Blendsreview/text: I like this perfume. Not typically attracted to very flowery or strong scents, I was looking for something a bit different and thought this might the answer. It is nice, but not a favorite.The good: it is musky, more mellow a scent. So, if you like that - this perfume might be for you. It is light and doesn't overpower, but still has a nice linger. It also does not smell like "old lady perfume" (per my sister). It has a more earthy quality that smells more natural than other store-perfumes (if that makes sense)To consider: if I were to give an untried smell description it would be: light notes of flower (like a cross b/w a lilac and daffodil - delicate but with substance), a somewhat soapy mid-tone, followed by a nice woodsy base note. For me, the slightly soapy smell - not bad, necessarily, but I just couldn't shake the association - made it fall into the 'nice but not favorite' category. Overall, I like it and wear it upon occasion (probably more in the summer) but not something I love enough to wear daily.
