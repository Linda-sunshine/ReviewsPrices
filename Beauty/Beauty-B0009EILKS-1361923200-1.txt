review/summary: Great Addition To My Weekly Beauty Routinereview/text: I used Biore strips as a teenager, but felt they never cleaned as well as a normal cleanser and weekly facial mask, so I stopped using them. My have they changed! The Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips (nose strips) are now a permanent part of my weekly routine!The first time I tried the new strips, I was familiar with the easy to use instructions. I applied the strip to my nose and waited for it to harden, so I could see the results. When I removed the strip, I couldn't believe my eyes! These strips totally cleaned the gunk that was trapped in my pores. I thought that maybe it was a one time thing, so I tried again, and once again, blackheads and trapped dirt were easily removed--this time a much smaller amount though.Since using the Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips I have noticed a difference in the appearance of the pores on my nose. In addition the skin on my nose is brighter and rejuvenated.I am so excited for these strips and encourage those looking to improve the appearance of their skin while deeply cleaning their pores to try the Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips.
