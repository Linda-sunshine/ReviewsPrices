review/summary: Phenomenalreview/text: Amazing product! After many pediatricians told us that my almost 6 yo daughter would "grow out" of sucking her thumb, Mavala Stop did the trick in about a week. We tried hot salsa, jalapeno juice, rubbing a fresh garlic clove on her thumb, and another OTC product called THUM. Sounds like I am a pretty mean mom. Wish I would have tried this first, but I thought it was too pricey. Not so! Worth every penny!Mavala Stop tastes bad, but not revolting and leaves a tingling unpleasant taste even after the thumb is out of the mouth. I put it on my own thumb to see. Another positive is that one application stays on for a full day so you don't have to worry about applying it all the time (like other products). Just once at bedtime was enough for us. As an added bonus, my daughter has also declared that she no longer needs her "special white blanket" which she used to rub on while she was sucking her thumb. I cannot say enough good things about this product. You will not need the whole bottle so if you know of another thumb sucker pass it along.
