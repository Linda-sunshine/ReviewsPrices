review/summary: Well made, soft, lightweight and good eye coveragereview/text: Found these at a local "discount department store" retailer (think dress for less) about six months ago. I bought one and haven't regretted it.Working two jobs, one a standard daytime office job and also a web designer on my weekends, I tend to sleep strange hours. Through much trial and error to get my bedroom as dark as possible in the daytime, these were the next best thing to having a pitch dark room that was unachievable. They are soft, breathable and with the adjustable strap, fit well to your head.I have not found much problem with "pressure points" (there are little pockets) that other people have felt. Perhaps I have just gotten used to them because so many other products fail in coverage and in material or the price is out there. But I recommend this sleep mask.BTW, wash per instructions. Be gentle with them. They are silk after all. :-)
