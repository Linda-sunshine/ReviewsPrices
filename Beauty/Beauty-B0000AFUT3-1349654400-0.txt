review/summary: Really disappointedreview/text: When I got this mirror last year for Christmas I was really pleased with it. It had different lighting for day, evening, etc. The 5X magnification was perfect so I could apply eye makeup without glasses, which would be impossible. But after about 7-8 months, one of the bulbs became very dim. My husband tried to find a way to take it apart to replace the bulb, but there isn't one. All in all it was a waste of money. My old Conair from 20+ years ago still works, but it's only 3X magnification. But! I'm back to using it anyway. Too bad. It had everything I needed, just didn't last.
