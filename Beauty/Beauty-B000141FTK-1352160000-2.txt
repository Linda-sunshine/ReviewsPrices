review/summary: Cleans good, smells just okreview/text: The soap is good for cleaning. It is a mild product, good for cleaning around the home that has children or pets. The smell is ok. It is not overpowering, which is good because the almond smells a bit gross. At first I found the smell pleasant but my Hubby said it smells (sorry for this description) like vomit. After he said that, I kinda agreed. It does have that hint of musty, putrid smell. I really like the cleaning aspects of the soap so I might try a different scent.
