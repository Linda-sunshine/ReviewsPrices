review/summary: A. Piercereview/text: I purchased this product last year. I began working at night, for Amazon imagine that, and needed something to help me sleep during the day. The mask is nice. It does a good job of blocking out light. It did have a lavender/mint smell when it first arrived. However it didn't last long, and to me it wasn't over powering. It did not stain my face, and is actually pretty comfortable. The elastic is adjustable, which comes in handy, as I have kind of worn mine out. I would purchase again. :)
