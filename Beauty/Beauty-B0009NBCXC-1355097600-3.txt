review/summary: Great product!review/text: I read somewhere that jojoba was closest to our own skin oil. I don't know if that's true or not but I know that this stuff works! Love it! It's great for my skin and my sons like putting it in their hair instead of conditioner. It must be good cause they have great hair.
