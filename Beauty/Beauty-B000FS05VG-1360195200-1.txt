review/summary: A fine little hair dryer.review/text: We bought this for my partner to take to the gym since the ones there are pretty weak, sometimes broken or being used by others. There's nothing fancy about this one but it does the job. The attachment stays on well. Can't attest to the Ionization - makes no sense to me and I can't tell any difference between it and many others we've used without this feature.
