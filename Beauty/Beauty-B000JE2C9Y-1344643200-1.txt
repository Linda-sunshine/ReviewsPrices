review/summary: Poorly Designedreview/text: I wanted to like this mask, and convinced myself the others complaining about the pressure against the eyes were being drama queens. They were not. It seems to be made of quality materials, and all of the fuss about the smell seems a bit overstated. Yes, it did smell of Eucalyptus after first opening it, but as you would expect, the smell fades rather quickly and by night time I couldn't smell a thing. However, the design of the mask is such that when the band is tightened at all, it pulls in on the mask, forming a crease of pressure perfectly aligned with the eyes. Yes, you can adjust so the pressure is across the bridge of the nose, but then light comes pouring in from below and above. I've had it for less than 24 hours and am ordering a different one as soon as I finish writing this.
