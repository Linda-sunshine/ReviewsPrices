review/summary: Great Product, Great Pricereview/text: My hair stylist recommended the Hot Tools brand to me. My Mother in law had this awesome curling iron that I used and the name was Helen Of Troy. As reading through other reviews, Helen Of Troy and Hot Tools are the same company. This product works great, heats up very quickly and is easy to handle. I did read some of the negative reviews, I don't agree with them. I have not owned the item very long, but it's exactly what I wanted and the price was WELL worth it. I would certainly recommend this brand to my family and friends.
