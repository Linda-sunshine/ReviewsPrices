review/summary: works greatreview/text: I used this for my 3 year old son who kept sucking his fingers. I brushed it on the finger nails and the next time he tried to put them in his mouth those fingers came right out. I reaplied it every two days for a month and that was it. he was done sucking the fingers. he is now 7 and he has not gon back to sucking them ever.
