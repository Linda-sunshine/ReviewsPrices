review/summary: A MUST HAVE!!!review/text: This thing is one of those...WOW , this really does work. I didn't give it 5 stars because when I washed, it ran pink dye under the water. Not a huge deal but I kinda wonder if any of that pigment is getting on my face? However, I love the fact that you can get heavy coverage by using it dry and light coverage when you wet it. The Beautyblender should be in every woman's makeup bag.
