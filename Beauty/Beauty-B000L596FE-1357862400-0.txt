review/summary: My daughter finally lets me brush her hairreview/text: OK, I have no idea why this brush is so special. It looks like any other brush but I have to tell you- my 3 year old has sensory issues and HATES hair brushing, clips, headbands... anything in her hair. So you can imagine that brushing her hair has been a power struggle. I bought this brush and the magic part is true. She has fine hair that is messy post bath and post sleeping but this brush literally glides through and makes it soft- no pulling, snags, or fussing. Love it!
