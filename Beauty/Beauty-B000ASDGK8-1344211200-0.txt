review/summary: Awesome dryer for an awesome price!review/text: This is by far the best hair dryer I've ever had. It dries my hair literally in 5 minutes or less (and I have very long hair) and leaves it silky and smooth. On high it does tend to tangle my hair a little but it's not too bad and it definitely something I can deal with. Before this dryer I would have to blow dry my hair and then flat iron it to get all the frizz and waves out . . . but not anymore. I highly recommend this hair dryer!
