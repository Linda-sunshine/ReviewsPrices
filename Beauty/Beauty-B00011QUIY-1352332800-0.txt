review/summary: great productreview/text: Excellent product. I would highly recommend it for thick curly or frizzy hair. Other curling irons I have tried either did not reach the necessary heat level, or started out hot then cooled down as styling proceeded. This curling iron keeps a very even heat level at the setting I choose using the dial on the side of the handle. The controls are conveniently positioned without being in the way. The iron does get extremely hot, however, so be careful around the scalp. There was absolutely no damage to my hair at settings over 400 degrees, and at this level of heat I can finish in about half the usual time I was taking with a 'cooler' iron.
