review/summary: wet or dryreview/text: a pretty amazing flat iron.i try not to use it when my hair is really wet due to the smell of burning hair,boiling water splashback, & the loud sizzle. i wait until my hair is slightly damp & put it on 300.i haven't found any split ends & my hair looks healthy after using it
