review/summary: Dr Bronner's Tea Tree oil soapreview/text: I bought this product on the recommendation of my dermatologist to help treat folliculitis which prior to this had only been responsive to oral antibiotics. The soap really has been helping to keep this skin condition in check and also really cleans the skin without excessive drying. I would recommend this product to people who have oily skin or who suffer from folliculitis.
