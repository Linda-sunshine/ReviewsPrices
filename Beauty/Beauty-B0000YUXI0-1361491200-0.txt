review/summary: Amazing Productreview/text: My daughter had sucked her thumb since birth. She refused a pacifier & went for her thumb from day 1. At 3 years old she would still suck her thumb raw. We tried everything, the sour stuff (she loved the taste!) the hot stuff, bitter stuff, even a device that was like wearing a thumb-only glove! Nothing worked and at 3 years old, she was starting to affect her bite. We heard about STOP on-line and gave it a try. I didn't want to give it to my child without knowing exactly what she was in for, so I put a little on my nail, let it dry & put it in my mouth. WHOA! The taste was a combination of burning rubber and rotting fish! And boy did it linger. We put this on her thumb nail and a few hours later we were driving in the car. Her thumb went in her mouth, came right back out, and she started crying for a drink to get the taste out. Remembering how bad it tasted, I pulled over at a gas station for some juice. THAT WAS THE LAST TIME HER THUMB EVER WENT IN HER MOUTH!This stuff is amazing. My only warning/concern is if your kids are messy eaters & tend to eat all their food with their hands, the taste might get into their food.
