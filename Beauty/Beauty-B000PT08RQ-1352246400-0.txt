review/summary: Decent for the pricereview/text: I have curly hair, but it's pretty frail. This straightener did a great job straightening my hair, it warms up relatively quickly (a few minutes) but after a year or so of use it start to smell when it heats up which in turn makes my hair smell. Don't get me wrong, the price is good, but the smell... the smell is bad.
