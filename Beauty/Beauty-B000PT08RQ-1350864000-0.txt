review/summary: Good!review/text: I recently got this item and it works really well on dry hair! Unfortunately, if you are looking for a straightener that will dry and straighten your wet hair I wouldn't recommend this item. It takes long and is not worth it. But still a very good straightener if your hair is already dry.
