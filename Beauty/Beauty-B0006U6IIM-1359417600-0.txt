review/summary: A miracle for dry skin and hair/menopausereview/text: I was skeptical to purchase the NOW brand sweet almond oil. They seem to have a cheap formula for everything under the sun, even D-mannose. But I have to admit, this is good quality swt almond oil. I'm in perimenopause and my skin has so many problems. Oily all my life and now it's severely dry & scaling. I also have hormonal acne on my chin and it was so discouraging. This oil nourishes my skin completely, while drying up any existing acne. How? I don't know---but it does and it never breaks me out. I was reading that some with severe dry skin, will use the oil to wash their face & rinse. It's healing properties are amazing. Using a moisturizer alone just wasn't enough. No matter how much I used my skin would drink it all up. I wash, exfoliate, oil and use a night time moisturizer [Neutrogena ageless essentials]. My face is 80% better. My hair was also getting dry thanks to lack of estrogen. I use the swt almond oil as a deep moisturizing treatment bi-weekly. I sit under the dryer for 30 mins & then shampoo it out. I also apply it to seal my ends 3x a week & my splits are few & far between. My hair is so moisturized, shiny and it stopped shedding. I can't say enough about this stuff. Wish I would've tried it sooner. Can't believe something so inexpensive works! I'll be using it for the rest of my life.
