review/summary: Pleasantly effectivereview/text: So, I've had some pretty tempermental skin since I was a teenager. Large pores on my cheeks and nose, dry flaky skin to extremely oily skin, light acne here and there- and I've tried different things...Proactive, oil cleansing, Philosophy products (which I still use and love) but I think this toner has been wonderfully effective as it combines the toning/moisturizing steps. I'm halfway through the bottle and my skin tone is even, my pores are closing and not a pimple in sight. I think I may have been over moisturizing and this light coverage is all my face needs. Maybe some eye cream, but from now on I'm going to keep buying this product. I now use Philosophy's Clear Days Ahead acne cleanser with a circular face brush followed by one to two cotton swabs of Thayer's Witch hazel morning and night and my skin is looking fabulous and bright. To remove eye makeup I use some coconut oil and it comes right off. I like the rose smell as does my boyfriend. So its definitely a you've just gotta smell itfor yourself situation...
