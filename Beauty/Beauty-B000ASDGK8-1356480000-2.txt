review/summary: This is the best hairdryer!review/text: The only reason this hairdryer isn't getting 5 stars is because this sucker is HEAVY. If it weren't so heavy, it would be absolutely perfect! My hair does not get super frizzy, and it dries in half the time it used to take with my old crappy Con-Air hairdryer.It's so powerful and warm, that my boyfriend uses it to dry himself off when he gets out of the shower!This hairdryer is so great that after my mom used it at my house, she demanded I buy her one for her birthday, which I did! She loves it as much as I do.I also recommend purchasing the diffuser attachment if you enjoy going with curly hair, the diffuser makes all the difference!
