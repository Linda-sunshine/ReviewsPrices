review/summary: Solution!review/text: I've used make up sponges for years, but the last few years they all tend to have a rubbery finish that just smears the makeup around. I've had to cut off the outside to get to the spongey part of them at times. I did not know if I'd like these, but was getting desperate. Every time I find a type of sponge that I like, then they discontinued it.These sponges are great. I read a review on them that suggested putting the makeup on my face w/ my fingers first, then using these to &#34;finish&#34; it. I did not really want to go there, but decided to give it a shot. It worked great and I continue to apply it in this way.I use face wash to clean these - the foaming face wash works best - and I wash them out about every 4-5 uses (I work my way around the sponge each time)..I am very pleased with this purchase!
