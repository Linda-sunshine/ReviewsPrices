review/summary: Definitely not impressedreview/text: I am NOT at all impressed with Bare Minerals makeup. I had a makeover done at one of their new storefronts, and I can now say I will NEVER buy this product. 1)It took about an hour to apply, with all the different steps and layers of material. 2) The lip gloss felt sticky and stiff and smells like Playdoh (even after I wiped it off). 3)The eyeliner was harder to apply and looks worse than the $5 liner I buy in the drugstore.But the real kicker: 4) Though the foundation looked fine in the store's soft lighting, when I checked a mirror at home, I thought my face had been painted by an undertaker! The foundation looks weirdly shiny and fake, with a thick pasty texture like paint, and the blush is garish. My pores look as huge as the pores of an orange, and the creases around my eyes are very exaggerated. I wish to God I'd rechecked my reflection sooner, instead of wandering around the mall for hours looking like an idiot.I wish I could recommend this stuff, because they advertise on my favorite radio station, but all I can say is, I'm glad I got to try it for free. If you really want to see if it's for you, please do the same thing--and then go look in a mirror under a BRIGHT light before you shell out any money!
