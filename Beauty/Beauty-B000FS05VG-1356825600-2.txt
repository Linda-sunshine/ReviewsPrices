review/summary: Best Hair Dryerreview/text: I've had this hair dryer for 5 years and it still works perfectly. Best hair dryer on the market hands down and the price is unbeatable. Also its great that its super lightweight; I don't get tired spending an hour blow drying my hair. Its been with me for five years already and it has traveled a lot but it still works as if I just bought it and it heats up very well. Definitely recommend!
