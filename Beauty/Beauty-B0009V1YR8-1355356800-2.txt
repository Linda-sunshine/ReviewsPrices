review/summary: PRODUCT FAIL. Buyer beware.review/text: Wife bought this product based on the name brand. Said she always wanted one, had to be this name brand... well, she bought it, it worked for about 5 months and then died. Won't come on, heat up, nothing. So it ended up in the trash along with the money spent to purchase it. Buy a better rated product.
