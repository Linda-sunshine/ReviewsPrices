review/summary: LOVE IT!!!!review/text: Buy it and you won't regret it (I hope)! I bought the witch hazel based on a recommendation and reviews, my skin now thanks me. I'm 28 and I started to break out, after using the witch hazel two times a day I've seen a huge difference in my break outs, they're not as intense,my skin is much tighter, and pores are smaller. I will say that I've also being making my own face masks out of natural ingredients and that too has been helping my skin and not just the witch hazel but it's definitely helped. I bought 2 bottles thinking is like it and I'm glad I did!
