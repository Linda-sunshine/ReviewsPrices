review/summary: Seriously worth itreview/text: Love this stuff!-it doesn&#8217;t flake everywhere like some of the other products do.-it makes you hair look fuller-it hides grays between colors-it doesn&#8217;t rub off onto clothesYou want to make sure you get it on the ROOTS/Scalp.. brush hair afterward to knock off &#34;extra&#34; and use hairspray. It will look awesome and STAY PUT. Been using this for 2 years now and tried SEVERAL types before I found this... if I was a &#34;prep per&#34; I would stock food, water, emergency supplies and THIS for the vanity side of me.
