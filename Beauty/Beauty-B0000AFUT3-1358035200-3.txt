review/summary: Awesomereview/text: This is a hundred times better than what i WAS using. I love that you can change the light settings, and the flip feature for magnification is fabulous. The ONLY thing I would change is to make it mountable on a wall as I have to set it on something to bring it high enough on my vanity table. I'd rather stand up and do my makeup than hunch over a table
