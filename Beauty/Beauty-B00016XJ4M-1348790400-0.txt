review/summary: Good Stuff!!!review/text: I'm never branching out again. I have found my skincare trifecta here on Amazon. Jergen's Face Cream, Thayer's Rose Petal Witch Hazel, and Nivea's CoQ10 Night Cream. My skin is now supple and glowy. It used to be dry, red, irritated and super peely. If I was dehydrated enough my skin on my nose would start to peel, BAD. I'd look like I had a bad sunburn that I was recovering from. I'm so happy with my current skin care products. The biggest surprise for me was that none of these products were the super expensive make-up counter creams. Also, in case anyone is wondering, the rose smell isn't perfumey or gross. It smells like the rosebud tea I make with rosebuds.
