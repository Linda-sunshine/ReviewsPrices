review/summary: Why did I wait so long?review/text: I bought this dryer because of the awesome reviews but was still not sure how good it could be. Well, seeing is believing. I, like others, have been buying average dryers from local stores and hate them all. I have curly hair and like to wear it straight but because it always turns out frizzy I usually just deal with the curls. Not any longer. Since I got this dryer I have been wearing my hair straight and no more frizz. I can't even explain how happy I am with this dryer. Not only does it keep the frizz down but it is really quiet and dries my hair much quicker. It's a keeper!!!
