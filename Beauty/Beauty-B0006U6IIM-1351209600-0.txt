review/summary: Awesome Oilreview/text: I &#34;Now&#34; have an appreciation for the almond. I buy this oil atleast once a month in the 16 oz size. Not only is it a great moisturizer but I have discovered that it has healing properties in it, as well. I have applied it on sunburns and rashes and watched them disappear in a short time. Because it is 100% almond oil it does not irritate my skin like an oil that has a fragrance. I given it away to family and they love it too. Thank you for this oil and the others that you make. I have been using the appricot oil, too. It is a fine product, as well. My next oil will be avocado. I have not tried these oils in other brands. I figured &#34;why should I?&#34;. I already have the best and you have many other items that I want to try. Thanks again!
