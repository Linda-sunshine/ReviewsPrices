review/summary: Flat iron only worked for 3 months!review/text: I bought this "CHI" flat iron back in July 2012. I use it about every other day! This past saturday when I plugged it in, it didn't even light up! This is the 2nd CHI that I have purchased & this has happened to. The first one lasted over a year (which was good I guess). This is an expensive product & you would think it would last longer. The one I purchased in July 2012 can't be returned because it is past the return date. I just ordered another one & hopefully it lasts longer!
