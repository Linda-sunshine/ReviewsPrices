review/summary: Wonderful dense maskreview/text: This product was recommended to me by my friend who is a professional hair stylist. She travels all over the world working for high-end fashion magazines, so when she recommends a product, I take it to heart. I recently wanted to go from dark to blonde hair. She suggested buying this mask because my hair is curly and porous & I frequently play around with different hair colors.I've been frequently using this product -- doing a 7-8 minute soak twice a week over the past two months & the jar still has some product left.The mask is wonderfully dense, it coats and holds well & I can feel my hair getting softer while it's on. ONE THING TO NOTE: when you rinse the mask off, the bottom of the tub/shower area gets a bit oily. I find it kinda fun/funny because it is so slippery, but if you have issues with balance, you may want to keep this in mind.Highly recommended! This has truly helped repair a lot of hair damage I acquired from tons of over treatment.
