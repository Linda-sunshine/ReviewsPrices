review/summary: Cheap & works wellreview/text: My daughter is addicted to this toner. It has helped to clear her mild acne, the smell is a little too rosy for me, but she likes it and it's gentle & natural. I put a little in a travel sized container for myself so we could share this bottle since it would take me forever to use all of this.
