review/summary: My favorite nail brand and colorreview/text: I chose five stars because there is nothing that i dislike about this product. The shade of pink looks amazing with my skin tone and the china glaze brand products are always quality. The polish never gets thicker in the bottle which is so frustrating when your favorite color polish gets all thick and goopy and you cant even use it anymore cause it wont dry. This polish also has vitamins for your nails and strengthens your nails without staining them the color you just painted them. Totally worth the extra few bucks to get this brand over the one or two dollar brands at target and wal mart. top salon quality for sure.
