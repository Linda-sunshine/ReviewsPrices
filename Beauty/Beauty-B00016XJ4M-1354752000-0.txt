review/summary: Skin so Smooth!review/text: My daughter had this on his wish list for Christmas. I ordered it, and when it arrived I decided to try it. Not to sound weird but I can't stop touching my face. It feels so smooth! IGNORE the comments about the scent. It's a very light rose scent. I think some people just find things to complain about. This product feels like silk. I am 49 so I don't break out. I have normal skin that only gets oily (slightly) in the t zone. My skin tends to get dry in the winter. This hydrated my skin without making it oily. I will definitely order a bottle for myself! I will update this post after she uses this product.
