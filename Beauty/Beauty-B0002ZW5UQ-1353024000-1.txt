review/summary: wish i'd tried this soonerreview/text: This stuff really covers the spots where my hair is thin. It stays where I put it until the next time I wash my hair. I actually don't use it all the time because I feel more comfortable with my hair because I have an option. The only problem is that it takes a long time to shake it out of the container.
