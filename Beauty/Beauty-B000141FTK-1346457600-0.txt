review/summary: Great for your plants, too!review/text: I prefer Dr. Bronner's Peppermint soap for bath use, but I have a special use for the tea tree infused soap: It makes a superb safe bug spray for plants, as tea tree oil is a natural insect repellant. A dilute solution of the soap in water will kill many mites on plants indoor and out. Adding a bit of oil to a soap solution will create an emulsion that's idea for aphids and other suckers- I spray it all over my garden. Mix a tablespoon of Dr. Bronner's and a tablespoon of any light vegetable oil in a gallon of water. Pour into a garden sprayer, agitate well, and spray the leaves and trunk of any plant or tree you wish to protect. It's totally non-toxic, and even safe for vegetables. (For smaller batches, mix a teaspoon each of soap and oil in a quart of water.)
