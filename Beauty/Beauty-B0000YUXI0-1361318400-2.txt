review/summary: great product to help you stop biting your nailsreview/text: I am a compulsive nail biter and before this product I have tried numerous products available at local pharmacies to try to help me stop biting my nails. They just weren't awful enough. This product is awesome. After you put this on your nails, you will slip up at most one or two times before you will begin to think twice about biting your nails. This stuff tastes AWFUL and you will be spitting and making an awful face trying to get the incredibly bitter taste out of your mouth for 5 minutes. Do not use this and then feed your lover grapes or strawberries or anything like that because if their lip accidentally even touches your finger nail they will be gagging and hating you for a good 5+ minutes. One slight drawback I have noticed about this product is that it comes off easily during showering, so every few you will have to apply a new a coat. But with this product, a nail biter for many years, I was able to get gorgeous and groomed and manicured nails.
