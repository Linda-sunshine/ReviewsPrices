review/summary: A Classic that Lives Up to its Claims ...review/text: Having used these strips since their introduction years and years ago, I can testify that they really do work if one follows the instructions carefully.Here are some dos and don'ts that may help you have a successful experience:-Do not wet the area excessively or wet the strip itself. If the strip isn't conforming to shape of your nose, you've used too much water. (This is also why some people get a glue substance on their faces ... too much water.)-I, personally, have never had success with using these while relaxing in the bath. I have tried to use these while taking a bubble-bath, but they never dry when I do that. I think the steam from the water may prevent them from drying properly. So, I would suggest using them away from warm, steamy areas.-Allow the strip to dry completely. If you have ever experimented with paper-mche, it should feel like that when dry. It should be hard ... not firm, but hard.-Peal slowly from one side in the opposite direction. Do not "rip it off like a band-aid."-Finally, if you trim the product to customize it, you have to toss the excess. I have tried to use the left over segment a week later, it does not work. (Again, I assume it must have something to do with exposure to humidity (since these are individually packaged and sealed).And, yes, there may be a startling moment afterwards where your pores appear large. That is because you just removed all that build-up. Do not worry, it will be fine:)Like a lot of folks who love this product, I find them super gratifying. I love the feeling of my skin afterward (so smooth!) And I love the idea of removing all that "gunk." Biore was an innovator who quickly became the standard. Before them, people would literally use extractors to have clear pores. It was slow and uncomfortable (and most people had an aesthetician do it). So, many thanks to Biore for a product that makes life easier!! Love these!
