review/summary: nice tonerreview/text: This is my first toner ever. I quite like the product. It gets the left over makeup out after cleansing. Leaves the skin moisturized. The smell is also pleasent.I have oily skin, so it feels a tiny bit shiny after using this toner. But wiping once with a towel just makes it fine.
