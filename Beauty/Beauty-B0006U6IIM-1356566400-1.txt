review/summary: Soft supple skin!review/text: I use this product all over my body during and after a shower and then I put on lotion. My skin feels soft and moisturized until my next shower. I even use this on my lips before I sleep and they feel supple in the morning. My coworker recommended that I put this on my loofah after soaping when I shower since its an emollient and doesn't clog pores, it will make my skin softer as i shower-- awesome results. Maybe I sound a little crazy, maybe even a little obsessed, but I am crazy and obsessed about my skin so anything that makes it better I gush about. ;)
