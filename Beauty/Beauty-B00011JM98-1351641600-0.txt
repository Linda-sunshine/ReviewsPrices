review/summary: Crappy texture, but awesome colorreview/text: I really really loved this color for summer toenails! The texture is very odd - a little watery, which goes on streaky until you do the 2nd coat... and there's not one bit of shine once it dries. However, I always use Seche Vite as a top coat, which is super-shiny, so that solves it completely. I found that it wears as well as any other polish that doesn't start this weird, and since it's a total bargain I'm only knocking one star for it. I swear I got compliments on the color every single day I wore it! This and China Glaze Refresh-Mint (which is more of a pale Tiffany blue than mint, FYI) were the two colors I wore and loved this entire summer.
