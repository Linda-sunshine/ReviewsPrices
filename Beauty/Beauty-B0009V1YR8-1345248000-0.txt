review/summary: Hmmreview/text: Got my chi in a reasonable amount of time and everything seemed fine. I've had it for about 5 months and I was very happy, but recently one of the straightener plates came unglued. I've been pressing the plate back in and crossing my fingers hoping that it stays in place long enough for me to finish my hair. I'm a little disappointed since I grew up sharing a Chi with my mother and sister which had been dropped multiple times, stepped on, and worked flawlessly.
