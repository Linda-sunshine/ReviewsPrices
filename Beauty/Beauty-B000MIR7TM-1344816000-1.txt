review/summary: Amazing.review/text: These sponges are amazing!!!!! I bought these to apply my liquid foundation and it works miracles! I've previously been using makeup brushes and I saw these online and they had rave reviews. I must say, the hype is true. It made my foundation go on so much smoother, no streaks and the finish was amazing. You soak this pink sponge in water and then squeeze it out. It doubles in size and will be slightly damp for application. You basically just stipple and roll this over your face and it evenly distributes the foundation and makes an utterly flawless finish. I've been raving about this to my sister. It worth the price and Amazon had the best price that I could find anywhere. Its worth it.
