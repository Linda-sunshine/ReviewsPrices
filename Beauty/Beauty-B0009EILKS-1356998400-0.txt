review/summary: Effective for your nose!review/text: I was told by a woman who waked my eyebrows that I had a lot of blackheads - I had never really noticed, but it started to bother me, so I tried these strips. I was amazed by how much crap they pulled off my face! It was disgusting and fascinating at the same time. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it only covers your nose - I think I have blackheads on my cheeks too, and it would be nice if they would make strips for that too.
