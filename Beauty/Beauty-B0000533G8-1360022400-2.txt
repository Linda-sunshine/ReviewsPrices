review/summary: How could you not love bronners?review/text: Great product for a shower gel and baby shampoo. I feel very comfortable using this product because it only contains ingredients that I recognize as being natural. The almond soap would be better for a baby shampoo, but we used the peppermint when our daughter was young, with no problems.
