review/summary: MY HOLY GRAIL.review/text: DEAR GOODNESS I CANNOT. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. My hair feels like Rapunzel, and my hair has been pretty damaged (bleached, straightened, etc...). I never thought I would fall in love with an inanimate object, but I did. My hair is FINALLY feeling soft and beautiful after countless products. Safe to say I am always going to buy this stuff.
