review/summary: Worked Great.review/text: Tried it on our four year old who had problems suckin her thumb. She no longer sucked her thumb. It was a great reminder for her and the taste was really bad. Tried it myself. It was yucky enough to help her stop. Was NOT so yucky that she threw up though. Read reviews that it made other children vomit. I think that is probably because the children wanted to vomit and knew it would make the parents stop using it. Kids are smarter than we give them credit. My child once tried making herself vomit to get out of eating a dinner she didnt care much for. My advice is to try it. Its only $11.00 and it may save you hundreds on dentristry later.
