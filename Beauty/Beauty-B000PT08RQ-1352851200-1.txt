review/summary: A beauty must havereview/text: I absolutely love this flat iron:) I had a regular Remington flat iron prior to using this great device. I was lucky enough to get this iron as birthday gift from a great friend. I wash my hair, towel dry it per other reviews and use this iron while my hair is still wet and 20-25 minutes later my hair is absolutely gorgeous, silky smooth and fantastic. A must have if you like having frizz free shiny sleek hair without having to blow dry it at all:)
