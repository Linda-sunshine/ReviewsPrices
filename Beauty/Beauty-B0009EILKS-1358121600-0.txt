review/summary: Really good for a few blackheads.review/text: I actually like this product, it is so easy to use and makes you feel so clean and refreshed. It definitely does a great job removing black heads. This product is not so great for really deep black heads which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I wish this was a little cheaper, I don't feel like it's really worth $1 each. I would recommend getting the 14 ct for about $1 more than the 8 ct. Overall, I would point a friend towards this product.
