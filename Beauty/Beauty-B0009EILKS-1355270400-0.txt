review/summary: didn't work at allreview/text: I have been using Bior&eacute; pore strips for a while, but this box didn't work at all. After I apply the strips to my face and wait the recommended time, I can't release them since the &#34;glue&#34; is just a yucky mess and it's stuck to my face. The strips break after I gently pull them and I have to end up rinsing my face with water to remove all the glue stuck to my face. I don't know what happened this time, but it doesn't work at all.
