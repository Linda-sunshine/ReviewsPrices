review/summary: BEWARE OF COUNTERFEITSreview/text: The real make-up is great but unfortunately there are 3rd party sellers on Amazon selling a counterfeit product. It is almost impossible to tell from the packaging that the product is a fake. If you have been using the makeup for a while, you will notice poorer coverage and skin irritation. I took my make up to a Sephora counter and they confirmed the product does not match their product. The only way you can differentiate the packaging is the real makeup has a number code engraved on the back. There is no color to it and it is hard to see unless you hold it up in the light. The counterfeit product I got does not have that engraved number. I will never buy makeup online again from unknown sellers. I assume if you are buying it from Amazon directly you are safe, but there is a good reason for the cheaper prices from 3rd party sellers. Lastly, if you are trying this makeup for the first time, make sure you get an authentic one, because you may get a fake and think it is not good makeup. The authentic product is excellent but the fake is not very good. The seller I got mine from is highly rated name "Always Beautiful" The high ratings obviously do not mean much.
