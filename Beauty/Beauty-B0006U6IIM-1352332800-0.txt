review/summary: Great for Stretch Marks & Itchy, Pregnant Belliesreview/text: I bought this when I was pregnant and my belly started to itch. A daily quarter size drop of sweet almond oil managed to not only take away the massive itching on my belly (and other growing parts of my body), but it also moisturized it to the point that I didn't get any stretch marks with my pregnancy. (hooray!) It was also the only non-smelling item that I could use that didn't aggravate my ultra-sensitive sense of smell and therefore make my morning sickness worse. (I had to throw away all my cocoa and shea butters and *still* can't use them.)Aside from my pregnancy, I use this for so many different purposes - moisturizing my hair, moisturizing the area around my eyes, as a makeup remover, etc... I love this stuff and couldn't live without it!
