review/summary: A makeup must have!review/text: I've always wanted to try the beauty blender but was afraid that it wasn't worth the hype. I used the sonia kashuk sponge (from Target) for a while and it worked pretty well until I decided to try BB. There is NO comparison! I definitely recommend these sponges if you are looking for a flawless application with your foundation. Also, I suggest buying the two-pack because it's a better deal.
