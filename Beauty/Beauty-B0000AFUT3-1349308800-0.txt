review/summary: Fine till the bulbs go outreview/text: I've had this mirror since Oct. 2010 and it was great till last week when the bulbs went out and there is apparently no way to replace them. If you don't mind having to replace this item in about 2 years or so then I'd say go for it. As for me I'll be looking for another similar item that I won't have to trash in such a short time span. What a waste!
