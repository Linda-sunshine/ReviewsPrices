review/summary: Pulls hairreview/text: I bought this for my daughter for her birthday last year. She has very thick, wavy hair and she was always complaining about how 'poofy' it was. I wasn't sure what to get because I have never used one myself, but I ended up picking this one for the wet/dry feature. I thought it would be easier for her to use if she could do it while her hair was still wet. This straightener does work, however I used it on my own hair and it does pull alot.. it's not smooth at all. I know these things damage hair anyway but I don't like the feel of it. I will be looking for a different one.
