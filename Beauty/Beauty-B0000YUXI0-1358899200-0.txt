review/summary: Amazing product worked in 3 applicationsreview/text: My daughter had been biting her nails for years.I tried lots of nasty tasting nail lotions from various drug stores).....nothing seemed to work.This product had good reviews so I thought I would try it.WOW this really worked. Just 3 applications. I didn't need any more.No bitten nails...I haven't even been tempted to use any more of the product...no need!I'm very happy and the bottle is still full! I will have to find a friend who would like to use it.
