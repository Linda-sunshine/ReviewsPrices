review/summary: Amazing!review/text: My 3 yr old daughter has beautiful naturally curly hair, but is so tenderheaded. I used to have to hold her down to try and get tangles out and it was just awful. I had thought I was going to have to cut off all her beautiful curls until we tried this brush. I had bought so many different types of brushes and every detangling solution out there. Finally something works. It does work better wet but you can use it dry too. Not sure how this works but it does. Just start at the bottom of the hair first and gently brush and it will just slowly work the tangles out painlessly!!!!
