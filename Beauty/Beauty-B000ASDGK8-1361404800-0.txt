review/summary: Dry hair, here you comereview/text: This hairdryer has some serious power. If you have thick hair and are sick of spending a decent amount of time drying your hair, consider this product to significantly cut that time down. I find that if I use the high speed until my hair is dry, the airflow is so strong that my hair gets tangled and a bit frizzed out, so my solution is to dry for awhile with the highest setting, then drop down to the lower speed to finish it off. I have long, thick hair and I can have completely dry hair in approximately 4 minutes with this hairdryer. Definitely worth spending a few extra bucks for this haridryer.
