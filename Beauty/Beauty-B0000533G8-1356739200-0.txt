review/summary: Everything, including the kitchen sink (except the hair)review/text: This stuff is wonderful! I can wash my clothes with it, my dishes and even brush my teeth with it. Everything but wash my hair.After reading many reviews I was determined to use Dr Bronners Magic soap (diluted) as a shampoo but no matter what I tried it came out horrific. I had hoped that I could use this as a rinse after the magic soap as I had read but that was a major &#34;FAIL&#34;. I even tried super diluting the magic soap and dumping a whole bottle on vinegar on my head, still came out nasty. So needless to say, 18-in-1 magic soap is a 17-in-1 since I can wash anything but my hair with it. I'm set on this soap for life. I love the peppermint tingle too.
