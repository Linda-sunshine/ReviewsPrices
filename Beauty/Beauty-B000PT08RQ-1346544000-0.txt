review/summary: The best $25 I have ever spent!review/text: I have very managable hair. It's long, and kind of wavy. I used to use the "instyler", which was my favorite hair straightener because it did my whole head within 10 minutes. That was convenient when I had work or school. But the problem was, whenever I straightened my hair, it would become wavy by the end of the day. I must say that this hair straightener is absolutely amazing! First of all, it came in the mail a day early, so I was pretty impressed with the shipping. But when I used the product on a small section of hair, it made it pin straight. That piece of straight hair lasted all day until I washed it and tried the straightener on my whole head of wet hair. It took about a half hour to finish. Which is great compared to the amount of time it takes to blow dry, with that annoying round brush. Afterwards I noticed that the straightener had given my hair a silky, shiny finish, and made it extremely soft. Now usually, I'll sleep on my hair, and will have to straighten it again the next morning. Not with this product! I woke up, and brushed my hair, and it was still as straight as the night before. This is day 3 since I used the product, and my hair is still pin straight. It even rained today, and I got no waves whatsoever! I'm in love with this, and it was by far the best 25 dollars I ever spent.
