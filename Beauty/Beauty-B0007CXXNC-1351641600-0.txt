review/summary: Works Wellreview/text: The Macadamia oil deep repair mask works very well. I dye my hair and use a straightener/blow dryer and this helped to keep things from drying out. The only thing I have to say is that for the price I thought it would be a miracle worker, but I've used several slightly cheaper repair masks that work just as well. Good product, but I can get the same results for less elsewhere.
