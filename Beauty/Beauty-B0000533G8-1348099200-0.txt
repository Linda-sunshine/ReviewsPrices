review/summary: The most AMAZING soap for sensitive skinreview/text: Length:: 3:04 MinsThis is my video review about Dr. Bronner's Magic Soap, which I absolutely love!-It is great for my sensitive skin(I bought a whole SLEW of products from Sephora especially for sensitive skin (DermaDoctor, I think and others), but none of them worked for me.)-I can use this on my face and my body with glowing results-I always have to wear make up, but when I started using this, I went without make up for a while bc my skin looked so good!-It is tingly and it feels SO refreshing-You can take a "quick" shower with this by putting water in a bowl, adding a little Dr. B's soap, dipping in a washcloth and wiping yourself off - save water, save time :-) - then wipe the soap off with the wash cloth and some water ;]- I believe they support efforts to INFORM consumers and encourage honest labeling on food, based on my research -- another reason to buy and support Dr. Bronner's!
