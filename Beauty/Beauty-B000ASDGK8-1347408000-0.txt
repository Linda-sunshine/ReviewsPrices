review/summary: I think I'm in love...review/text: So, like many other reviewers here, all I've ever owned is a $25 Conair from Target or Wal-Mart. I honestly didn't think blow-dryers were worth any more than that. I think this product is an absolute STEAL because it dries (in my opinion) as well as my friend's T3 Featherweights and other higher-end dryers (I like nice things, too, but I'm not shelling out $250 for a blow-dryer).It gets the job done beautifully; this dryer arrived in the mail the same day I decided to re-snip my bangs into their former blunt style. I love wearing my bangs this way, but I used to have to wash, dry and flat-iron them daily, which was a lot more upkeep than I was willing to do. Now all I do is shampoo them and blow-dry them with this bad boy (and of course my trusty Olivia Garden nanothermic 2" round brush) and they're shiny, gorgeous, and with a round brush, just a HINT of turning in to my brows at the tips. I'm beyond pleased with this dryer, as I always am with BaByliss products (they have great hot rollers, too!) and would recommend it to anyone. Dry away!
