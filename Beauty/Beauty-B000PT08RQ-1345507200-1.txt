review/summary: Better that I had hopedreview/text: I was gone for a week when it arrived so I cannot say when exactly it arrived but it was in a timely manner. After reading all of the reviews I was a little skeptical because of how my hair is (completely uncontrollable). When ever I straighten my hair it is a poofy mess and I might as well not bother with it and put it up in an ugly bun (my hair doesn't look good up either). Then I got this straightener and I LOVE IT! Everyone noticed a huge difference right away. I have used it on dry hair which took maybe 20 minutes all together and it looked great. And then one day I used it on wet hair ( I have done this twice now once wet (30 min after a shower) and once damp ( an hour or so after a shower)) and it still was controlled and not a frizzy mess like always. The best part? It lasts all day! I have even went two days with out doing anything to it except brushing it and it still looks great. My only complaint would be the smell which the package warns you of. But when you are frying your hair that smell is to be expected.
