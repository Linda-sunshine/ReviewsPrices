review/summary: Worked like a charm!!!review/text: My 3 year old daughter has been sucking her thumbs so hard and for so long that they have become red and sore. I was looking for a way to stop the thumb sucking without having to use a cumbersome device. I came across Mavala Stop on amazon and after reading some great reviews I gave it a try. The thumb sucking stopped within two weeks. This product works. I also have to say that we didn't experience any averse reaction to eating finger foods, like some reviewers stated might happen. The bottom line is if you need a solution to thumb sucking this just maybe it.
