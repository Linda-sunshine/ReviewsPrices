review/summary: Did the jobreview/text: We only had to use this twice before my 11 year old daughter quit sucking her fingers. That said, I am not sure it was really the Mavala Stop that did it so much as her orthodontist telling her she would end up with so much damage they would have to do painful surgery to correct it. That really motivated her; the M.S. was more of a reminder not to do it (like when asleep). As many others have said, it DOES make finger food taste terrrible.
