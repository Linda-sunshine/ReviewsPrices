review/summary: I wanted to love this Soo bad!!review/text: I had read So many positive reviews on the Egyptian Goddess" scent,and it sounded so enticing!While it arrived very quickly,..as soon as I opened the bottle..I smelled what seemed like a pine sol scent or some kind of cleanser,I had also read in some reviews that the bottle just might need to be exposed to the air a little to really bring out the true scent,I gave it 2 days on my skin,which you can not get off for about 2 days any way,even after scrubbing in the shower,..seemed to just keep getting stronger and started to give me a headache.So as I really tried and wanted to love Egyptian Goddess,..it was just not for me."as I sit here still with the scent on my wrist"unable to get it off " took another sniff, and ugh..
