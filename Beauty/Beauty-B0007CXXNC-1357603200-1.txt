review/summary: Awesome!review/text: I read all of the reviews here before purchasing, but I also did a ton of research before deciding to purchase. WORTH IT. Made my hair silky soft after just the first time (obviously it will vary per hair type) but worth the money, didn't have to use a whole lot (again longer hair will use more). The smell is NOT overwhelming (comparable to regular shampoo/conditioner) and shipping was fast!
