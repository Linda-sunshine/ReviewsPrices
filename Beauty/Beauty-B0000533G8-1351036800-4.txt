review/summary: Dr Bronners rocksreview/text: Been using the peppermint brand which is great, was at fairway today and it was on sale for ten dollars, I purchased the tea tree oil and looking forward to use it. A few drops is what you need because it's very strong and lathers well, the bottle lasts me a few months and is a great feeling after showering.
