review/summary: Great flat ironreview/text: I wasn't sure how this flat iron would work since it cost less than the ones at the stores, but I have to say it works great! It heats up fast and smoothes out my hair in no time. It has taken alot of time off of doing my hair in the morning and makes my hair very shiny. I would definitely buy this again!
