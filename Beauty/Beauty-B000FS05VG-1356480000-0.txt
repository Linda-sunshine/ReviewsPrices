review/summary: BEST DRYER I HAVE EVER OWNED!!review/text: I have owned a lot of hair dryers in my life trust me and this is without a doubt the BEST i have ever owned. I have long hair and it dries my hair in half the time....i also have a huge static problem and def see a difference after using this dryer. Usually after drying my hair straignt i would have to go over it with my straigtening iron...with this dryer i do not have to do that, it leaves it so shiny! It saves me sooo much time in the morning! I cant comment on how long it lasts since i have only had it about 3 weeks...but even if it lasts me 6 months to a year who cares for 20 bucks! id go out and replace it in a heartbeat! This is a def must have for everyone who uses a hairdryer!!!
