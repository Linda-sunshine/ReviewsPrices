review/summary: Good stuffreview/text: I tried this on a lark this summer and found that I liked it very much, although I don't really think it smells all that good. It does have a wonderful feeling on my skin (clean and refreshed, especially nice in the summer), and it is terrific for shaving with no nicks or cuts. I have since tried the orange scent and really like it. I put a diluted solution in a spray bottle, spray it on a pouf, enjoy the great lather and marvel at how well it rinses. The orange smell is subtler than the peppermint, but very enjoyable; and with winter coming, a little easier to deal with than the cooling peppermint. It is good basic soap that goes a long way. You will enjoy it.
