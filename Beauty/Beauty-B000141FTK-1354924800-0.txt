review/summary: Love this soap!!!review/text: This soap is all you need! It works great for so many things. I add vinegar in a spray bottle and then dilute with water and it make a great all purpose cleaner. It's great on hard wood floors leaves no residue. And you only need a small amount. So many uses for this stuff and the smell is great too.
