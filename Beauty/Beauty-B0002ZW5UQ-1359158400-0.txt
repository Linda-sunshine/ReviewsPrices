review/summary: 40 yr old thinning part and bangsreview/text: I love this. I have beginning thinning.. Can see through to scalp, age appropriate for someone with thin hair to begin with. It's not 100% perfect but it stops my incessant looking at my hairline in mirror and pics - that alone made me feel confident. I did the transitions hair where they add 4 hairs to one strand with great results but expensive and last 6 weeks. I am thrilled this option as cheaper and in between if necessary. I wore my hair down- I usually side pin my bangs to deceive my thickness and avoid seeing my scalp but it is getting old and I wanna wear side bangs without seeing my scalp. It made me happier and less self conscious.
