review/summary: So that's what just plain clean feels likereview/text: Your hair won't feel slick because it leaves no residue. Instead, you may think it left something else. That's your natural hair! When dry, it won't tangle or be weighted down. I have short, thick hair and it has natural body now and is very soft to the touch. It takes hair wax well and is easy to style. The mint scent leaves after a little while. Good as body soap as well and even for laundry. But others may not like a minty washing machine.
