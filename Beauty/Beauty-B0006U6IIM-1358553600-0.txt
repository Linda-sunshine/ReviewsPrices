review/summary: Good natural moisturizerreview/text: Fed up with trying to decide who to believe (parabens, fragrances, BPA all bad and in everything!), I decided to give this a try. If it's safe to eat, it must be ok to use topically. You can use this for most anything, hair, skin, etc. It works great! Love it and will keep a bottle in my medicine cabinet.
