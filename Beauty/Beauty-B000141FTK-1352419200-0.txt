review/summary: Pepperminty Goodnessreview/text: Dr. Bronner's liquid peppermint is invigorating - as close as you can get to bathing in Altoids - and leaves a subtle, non-cloying scent afterwards. You feel thoroughly clean, but it doesn't dry your skin. The soap lacks lathering agents or other thickeners, so it's rather watery. I recycled a foaming hand soap dispenser and this works perfectly to foam up the Bronner's and make it easier to use on a washcloth. This stuff is very aromatic can work wonders in a hot shower to help open sinuses.
