review/summary: It's a hairdryerreview/text: I don't do anything with a hairdryer except dry my hair (meaning I don't use it to "style" my hair). This hairdryer does dry hair. It's not as lightweight as you might think (which is why I bought it). It's really kind of bulky. Also, the buttons are too easy to push and located right where you hold the thing, so I'm constantly turning the dryer off when I'm using it..... annoying. I guess I shouldn't complain too much about a product that didn't cost much.
