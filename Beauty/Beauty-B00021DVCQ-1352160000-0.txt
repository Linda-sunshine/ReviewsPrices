review/summary: Hazardous warningreview/text: I used the full line for the past 3-4 yrs. I loved it at first then began having problems with runny, irritated eyes. I was told by a professional that the foundation causes respiratory problems and eye irritation. I stopped using the foundation 2 months ago but continued to use the eye shadows. My eye symptoms were reduced but did not go away completely.Last weak I had a routine eye exam and reported a decline in my vision. After examining my eyes, my Dr asked if I wear Bare Minerals makeup. I was shocked that she knew my make up brand by an eye exam. The Dr went on to inform me that the lining of my eyes and tear ducts were coated with the makeup which is not only unhealthy but was causing some vision problems as well, this is common with Bare Minerals. I spoke with my esthitician who said she is no longer recommending or selling Bare Minerals due to these known issues. I do not have sensitive skin.
