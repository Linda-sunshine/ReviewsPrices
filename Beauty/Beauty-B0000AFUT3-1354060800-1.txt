review/summary: Meh....Good Enoughreview/text: Why is it that you just cannot find 'good' makeup mirrors that are pretty? This one functions fine - the lights are bright and the magnification is adequate. The issue is that this mirror is just NOT PRETTY. I have a beautiful antique vanity and this looks dumb sitting on it.The mirror is bright white plastic. Plastic. I am keeping it because it does work, I am just unhappy with the way it looks.
