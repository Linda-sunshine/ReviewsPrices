review/summary: Great Product that really works!review/text: I'm 46 years old and have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember. I have been using this product for three weeks now and I have completely stopped biting my nails! The taste is just plain nasty, if you put your fingers in your mouth once or twice by accident it probably won't happen a third time. It took about two weeks to lose the urge to bite them and now it's week three and I've removed the nail polish altogether and it looks like I'm home free. Highly recommended!
