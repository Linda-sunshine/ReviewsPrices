review/summary: Really does last!review/text: Finally, I found a good everyday colonge that last. The scent is light but noticable, pretty crisp and pleasent. Of couse the smell fades a bit by the end of the day, but it has lasted much longer than others I paid more for and I don't need to put a lot of it on.The exact same thing sold at the mall (the ones close to me anyway) sells between $25 and $30+ dollars so Amazon's deal is pretty good.For me it's the perfect everyday colonge.
