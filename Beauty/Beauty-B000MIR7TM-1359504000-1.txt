review/summary: Excellent quality applicatorreview/text: This sponge is very soft, flexible and a great shape with a smaller end to use around the hard to get areas of nose and mouth. Cost seems to be the only drawback. I looked at some other less expensive but felt they lacked the softness and just appeared lesser quality to me. I may try one in the future but may have been spoiled by the Beautyblender one which appears very durable.
