review/summary: Heavy but Strongreview/text: I have been faithful Bespoke Labs T3 user for the past 4 years. The first 3 of those years were fantastic. The past year, the hair dryer has been burning my hands and my hair. I don't know what happened. The filter is clean and I use the same settings. Figured it's life was over and I'd just get a new one. But you Amazon reviewers now rate the BabyBliss better than the T3. I was hesitant because of the weight increase. But I bought Baby B. It dries my hair in half the time of the T3 and no burnt hands. I would give it 5 stars if it was the same weight or less. This BabyBliss has a lot more power than my old T3 and scares my frizzy hair straight.
