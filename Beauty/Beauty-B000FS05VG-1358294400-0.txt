review/summary: So far so goodreview/text: Just got this to replace my T3 that my daughter accidentally dropped in the toilet. My husband had gotten me the T3 as a gift, but I didn't want to shell out that kind of money again unless absolutely necessary. So I'm trying this much cheaper but well reviewed alternative. I've only used it a few times, but so far drying time is relatively fast (maybe takes 4-5 more minutes than the T3) and the result is a nice smooth blowout. So seems like a good value. My hair is long, curly, but not very thick, just for reference.
