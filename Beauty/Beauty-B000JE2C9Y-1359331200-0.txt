review/summary: IT WORKS!review/text: I can't sleep with light. Any light. This blocks out all of the light. I'd stop there, except for the one drawack; the elastic headband irritates the back of my ears unless I wear it in too high or too low on my head, so I just put the straps over my ears a little, instead of behind. It's only very mildly inconvenient, so I am still very satisfied with this eyemask. Who knows, maybe I just have a weird head.
