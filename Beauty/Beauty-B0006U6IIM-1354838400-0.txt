review/summary: Unscented, nice oilreview/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the bottle, it's bigger than I expected for some reason! I just got it so I'm excited to see if it causes any break outs (sensitive, acne-prone skin!) I am working up the courage to try it on my face as a cleansing agent to remove makeup because I am tired of my facewash drying my skin out so bad. That tight dry feeling is awful! Once I try it I will update this :) i am also using on stretch marks and undereye wrinkles to see if theres any improvement there.
