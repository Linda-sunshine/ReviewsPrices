review/summary: topnotchreview/text: I just love this blow-dryer. It does leave my hair feeling softer than my old one. I have fine/thin hair and am happy with this dryer.I have not had any problems pushing the wrong buttons or pushing buttons accidentally as reported in other reviews.It's light and drys fast on the warm setting.I'm glad I bought it.
