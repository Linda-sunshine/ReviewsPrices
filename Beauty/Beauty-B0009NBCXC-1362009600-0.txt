review/summary: Works for mereview/text: Although it was smaller than I expected, the delivery was lightning fast. I usually have problems with my address because I live in an apartment but they knew to put my Apartment number on the delivery label. Also, what I love about this oil is that there is no fragrance at all. I plan to use this in my hair regime and I was afraid that the fragrance would interfere in the overall upkeep of my tresses. I highly reccomend this product to all who would like to purchase it.
