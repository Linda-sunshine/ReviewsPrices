review/summary: Can't Do Without This!review/text: I am a 60+ year old woman with one main area on the top of my head toward the back that shows scalp. Toppik is like a miracle to me. No, it's not as good as having your own thick hair (as I had, when young), but it works amazingly well to cover up the bare scalp. This is absolutely not a scam. However, to avoid embarrasment (having it come off down your neck or come off on someone's hand or on a pillow) you MUST:1. Keep your head down for a full 2 minutes after applying2. Pat your head gently a few times in the area of application after the 2 minutes3. Comb it through once or twice after the 2 minutes.These instructions come with the product and MUST be followed. One more I made up. Lift your hair up and wash the neck area and the back area in case some of the product came down and gives the appearance of dirt.It's really simple: the whole operation takes 3 minutes and you can go out and not worry about looking bald.
