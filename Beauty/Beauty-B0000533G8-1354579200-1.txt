review/summary: Great for sensitive skin!review/text: I have palmo-plantar pustular psoriasis on my hands and feet. I switched to using this soap as a body wash and hand wash daily. I love this soap! My hands are clearing up from my psoriasis! This soap has a very luxurious lather and is very good at cleaning dirt and grime. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I will be buying the 32oz next time I need to buy it and pouring it into my 8z bottle.This is not nearly as drying and nowhere near as harsh as traditional 'soaps' since this isn't detergent like all other soaps are. This is real castile soap (all organic, too!) so this is very gentle yet thorough in cleaning. It has no scent at all.This soap does not hurt my hands. When I use regular 'soap' my hands sting and itch not long after I wash my hands if I don't immediately moisturize. This has no effect like that. My hands feel dry but not itchy or stinging. I have not developed more pustular lesions since using this soap. I'm thrilled! Now I can wash my hands as many times as I want during the day or night and not have any problems with my psoriasis flaring up.Because of all the detergents ive used over the years I soon learned not to wash my hands unless I got something on them like grease, dog poop, sticky stuff, etc... because it would literally hurt my skin. But now I can be clean and not worry about it! Yay! +1 for hygiene!
