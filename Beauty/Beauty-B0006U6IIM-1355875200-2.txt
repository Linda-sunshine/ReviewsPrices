review/summary: Great for dry feet.review/text: I bought this sweet almond oil to mix with some essential oil for my husband. It was such a big bottle that I decided to try it alone as a foot moisturizer. It soaked in fast so I reapplied and wore cotton socks to bed afterwards. It improved the condition of my dry feet within a week of daily use. It is messier to use than foot creams but when I need the extra softening, I use this oil. There's a faint pleasant smell to the oil which is important to me as I don't care for strong scents.
