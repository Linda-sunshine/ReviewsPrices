review/summary: Chireview/text: I was just sitting here looking at my flat iron and felt compelled to write a review. I did not buy my original CHI from Amazon but wanted to share my CHI experience with you. I bought mine directly from CHI and it as been working beautifully for 4.5 years. And I've certainly put it through hell. It's been dropped a million times, left out in the freezing car over night (don't try to turn it on when it's cold), and been left on by accident for days. I feel like maybe its not as SUPER hot as it used to be, but it still out performs any straightener I've ran across. Once you use a CHI, there's no going back to a cheaper straightener. I couldn't live without mine. But like I said, I didn't buy from Amazon so I don't know if this specific one is the real deal. But I can say that forking over the money for a real CHI (it was over a $100 when I bought it, not sure what they run for now) was some of the best money I've ever spent.
