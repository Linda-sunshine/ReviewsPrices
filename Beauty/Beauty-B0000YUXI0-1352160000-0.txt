review/summary: Tastes Awful, it's perfect! :)review/text: My daughter has been bitting her nails and surrounding skin for a solid two years. this product is certainly helping to break the habit. It really does taste awful. It lasts about 1 - 2 days depending on hand washing and immediately has her taking her fingers out of her mouth. I would also recommend it for thumb sucking problems. Great product.
