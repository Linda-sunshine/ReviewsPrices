review/summary: I LOVEEEEE IT!!!review/text: I had recently gotten my hair chemically straightened with the Japanese Hair Straightening system and I loved it but it left the ends of my hair dry and straw like. I already have medium-fine hair even though it's very dense, porous, and long, and I have 3b type curls (tight ringlets) so I already have naturally dry hair (I also dye my hair) but this left my ends even worse. I tried oils but I needed something that would restore my hair completely without weighing my hair down or making my roots even oiler. I bought this after hearing raves and decided I might as well give it a go. It was a lot cheaper here than on the Macadamia Hair website so I decided to give it a try and it was probably the best decision I have ever made! I absolutely love this! It smells amazing and the texture is nice and thick. By the fourth use my hair was completely restored and I only use a little bit, maybe a dime size amount through my ends. You should leave it in for at least 7-10 minutes but I usually do it at night then wash it in the morning (and put my hair in a bun for the day) or I put it in during the morning or mid-afternoon and wash it off that night so that it can penetrate my hair best and give me maximum results. I can totally justify the price, it's totally worth it. Now I only use it about once every 2 or 3 weeks, now that my hair is back to normal so I rarely use much at all. I use this in conjunction with the Healing Oil Spray, even though I like the repair mask better. I might try the actual healing oil after I finish the healing oil spray to see if the thicker oil might work better. Regardless, I absolutely love this product, it completely saved my hair!!!
