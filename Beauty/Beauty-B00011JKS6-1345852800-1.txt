review/summary: I love the color!review/text: I loooove this color.It looks really pretty and girly.I usually buy China Glaze because China Glaze produced really nice, easy to use nail polish.However, I rated it a 4/5 because the nail polish didn't seem like a brand new bottle (which is easy to apply and smooth)... It seemed more like a used bottle since the nail polish was hard to apply smoothly. But since I loved the color, I would just redo the nail if it didn't turn out smooth..
