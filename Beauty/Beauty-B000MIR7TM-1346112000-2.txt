review/summary: It's okayreview/text: I bought into the hype but, I don't like how you have to clean it...kind of gross. If you think about how much bacteria stays in a kitchen sponge...eew...I couldn't get over how it couldn't be cleaned enough...the makeup went on flawlessly but, a nice brush can do the same and it is easier to clean.
