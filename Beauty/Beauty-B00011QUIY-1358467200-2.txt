review/summary: Works very well so farreview/text: I haven't owned a curling iron since 1995, so I purchased this after a hair stylist recommended it to me.Works well so far. The 1.25&#34; size makes more waves and end curling on my hair, which is naturally stick-straight, thin, but I have a lot of it. I can curl relatively larger sections to achieve the wave look, but if I do too aide a section, the hair gets caught in clip area near the springs and also makes it hard to turn the curling iron. I will keep it and continue practicing and I ordered the 1&#34; to see if I can achieve tighter curls.
