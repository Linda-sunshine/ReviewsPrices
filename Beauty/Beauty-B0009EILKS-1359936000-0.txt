review/summary: Not very effectivereview/text: These seem more of a novelty than anything. Each time I use them they pull more tiny hairs than blackhead gunk. They are easy to use and the slits help the to adjust to any nose. They are a bit painful to remove but it's not intolerable. I will us these up for my "spa days" but they aren't life changing or very effective at all. In reality my chemical peels are more effective at doing what these are supposed to do. On the plus side, they haven't caused any breakouts thus far.
