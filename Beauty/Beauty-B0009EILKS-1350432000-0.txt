review/summary: Does what it says...review/text: This is the second time I've bought these. They mostly work well, but in both cases I've had a few strips that, when I pull them off after 10 minutes, some of the 'glue'or whatever the sticky stuff is that is supposed to pull the gunk out, disconnects from the strip and stays on my nose, meaning that all the gunk stays too, and I have to scrub to get the 'glue'off. Overall though, they do work, when not getting stuck.
