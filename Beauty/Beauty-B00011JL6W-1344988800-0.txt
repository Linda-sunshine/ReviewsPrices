review/summary: Gorgeous color, make sure you have a great manicuristreview/text: This color is stunning for the summer; equally beautiful on fair and olive skin tones. The only complaint is the makeup of the polish causes the first coat to be very streaky and chalky. The second coat will smooth it out beautifully and a top coat will literally seal the deal. I had one manicurist apply it really well and another one who did a terrible job. Just depends on the technician doing your nails.
