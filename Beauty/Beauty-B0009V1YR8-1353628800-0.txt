review/summary: It worksreview/text: The iron heats up fast and does what it is supposed to do. My hair is very thick and I have to go through layers to flatten it down, but once I do, it stays in place. The ceramic area is smaller than I thought it would be. I dropped it once and it seemed like I broke it, but I unplugged and plugged back in and it worked fine.
