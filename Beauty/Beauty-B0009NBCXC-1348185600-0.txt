review/summary: Perfect for facial skin care!review/text: I use Now Jojoba Oil for facial skin care. It's perfect for my slightly dry, sensitive skin.After cleansing and toning, I moisturize with a mix of 1 drop of jojoba oil and a small dab of Aubrey Organics Vegecol with Aloe Moisturizing Cream. This combination makes my skin super soft, smooth and glowy. It also works well under my mineral foundation (Valana Minerals).I also use Now Jojoba Oil to remove my natural make-up. Here's my process: massage a quarter-sized amount of jojoba oil into skin; wipe off oil/make-up combo with a warm, wet washcloth; follow-up witch hazel (on a cotton pad). My skin feels great after removing my make-up -- clean, supple and soft.I'll be using jojoba oil for life!
