review/summary: Total Flopreview/text: I'm 43 and these strips have been around for some time now. Over the years, I have tried these strips and was left disappointed. I'd stop then years later try again, hoping the product had been improved. Each time, I came away with the same result, disappointment.I have pretty oily skin and get acne in my nose and it enlarges my pores. I got these strips again a few weeks ago, again, hoping they'd improved. But they didn't. These strips cost $8 for 14 strips.I used an entire box and each time I used one of the strips, it didn't work. The instructions say leave on your nose for about 15 minutes, which I do. When I remove them, the strip is clean and fails to serve its purpose. I think its safe to say, I'd never buy or use these strips ever again. Sorry Biore', for me, these strips were a flop.
