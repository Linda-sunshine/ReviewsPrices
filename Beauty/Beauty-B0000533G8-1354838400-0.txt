review/summary: Shower with a friend,It's a fun soapreview/text: A lady friend in the early 1970's introduced me to this product in the shower.It's a great product also loads of fun in the shower with that special person in your life.Since that long ago day I have turned quite a few people on to Dr.Bronner's products.My personal favorite is peppermint it makes you taste and smell like a candy cane.I'm 64 and after almost 40 years of using this product I still look forward to a shower with the good Doctor.
