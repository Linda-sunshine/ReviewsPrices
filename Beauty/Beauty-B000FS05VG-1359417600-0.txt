review/summary: It really works, and is easy on the wrist.review/text: The Tourmaline really does help keep down the frizz. I have very fine hair, and most blow dryers tend to leave it frizzy or with lots of flyaways, even on low heat. This one didn't.I also really appreciated that it is significantly lighter than my other blow dryers. Between carpal tunnel problems, fibromyalgia, and a touch of arthritis, I have had problems with holding my old dryer. This one did not hurt or even tire out my hand or wrist!Definitely something I'd recommend to others.
