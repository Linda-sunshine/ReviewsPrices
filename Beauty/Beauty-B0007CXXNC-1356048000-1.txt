review/summary: HIGHL RECOMMENDED!!review/text: i recently had hair extensions installed and i had to have them bleached in order to match my natural hair color. Of course the bleach dried out my virgin malaysian hair so i had to use like 5 different products to smooth down frizz, moisturize, and "repair"....none of those products worked like this one!!!!! i will forever use this product!!! Forget moroccan oil, this stuff is waaaayyyy better
