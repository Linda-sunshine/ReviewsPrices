review/summary: Pet Shampooreview/text: I have always used this to bathe my dogs once a month. We live in Colorado and they never get oily or dry during the year. This is a good balance to use on them and the almond is gentle and clean smelling. It makes me feel great to use on them because I know exactly what is in the bottle. I use it as a body wash for myself and my skin is much happier than when the several other moisturizing soaps I had tried.
