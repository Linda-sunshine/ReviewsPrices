review/summary: Causes Break outsreview/text: I thought this product would help prevent or heal up my acne prone skin. I rarely get break outs, however after a week of using this product, my skin broke out horribly, even in places it doesn't usually get acne/pimples in. Completely wasted my money...I guess for acne prone skin, do not buy. Maybe it is helpful for people who have skin that is not prone to acne already. It does moisturize. However in my case my skin got oily(even though it is never oily) and all my pores became horribly clogged.
