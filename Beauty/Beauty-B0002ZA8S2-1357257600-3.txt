review/summary: Makes a Differencereview/text: When my hair was shorter, I used the Hot tools brush curling iron, which was about 12 years old. I grew my hair out to a chin length bob, and coudn't use it anymore. Too much tangling. I really didn't want to spend a lot of money for a new iron, so I just picked up a Conair. I used it for a year, with OK results. It was wearing out, and needed to be replacedd, so I decided to try the Hot Tools again.My hair is thin, fine, and straight. The difference was surprising. With the Conair, the volume and slight curl was gone in a few hours. Using the same volumizer and hairspray, the volume and curl lasted all day with the Hot Tool iron. I actually use less hairspray. I would recommend this product. It is worth the extra money, and it is a much better quality iron. I will never waste my money on the cheaper irons.
