review/summary: Seemed to work well at firstreview/text: Like most people who would shop for a product like this, I was looking for something to make the hair brushing task a little easier on my kids. The first couple of times it was used, they said it was better. After a few uses though, the complaints started back up again. Don't think it is the brushes fault as it looks the same, nothing has broken off or anything, it could just be that my kids were expecting it to be easier the first couple of times so maybe they tricked themselves into thinking it was better. At any rate, its a decent quality brush for the price, I would recommend giving it a shot, it just hasn't worked the miracles I was hoping for in my case.
