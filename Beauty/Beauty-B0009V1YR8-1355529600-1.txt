review/summary: I had this on my wish list, but removed it when I read the reviewsreview/text: I did not buy this product. My old Chi, that is as ancient as can be, finally went kaputt and I needed a new one. I am a self-professed "Amazon junkie", so naturally I turned to the website to purchase my next Chi. After reading numerous(horror)reviews of fake Chis and chunks of hair burning from heads, I am going to stick to my local, reputable salon to get my new Chi. I have worked too hard to get these locks lookin' this way!
