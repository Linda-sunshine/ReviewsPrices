review/summary: Junkreview/text: I bought this dryer in August, 2012, by December it stopped working. I contacted Conair's customer service and was told that since it was still under warranty they would fix it, but I would have to pay postage for their defective item, which was $16.00. It has been a month since I sent it to Conair and I have still have not gotten it back. When it worked it worked great, Conair = Con-job.
