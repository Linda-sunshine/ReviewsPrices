review/summary: LOVE this sleep maskreview/text: This sleep mask is so comfortable. I've been using it for so long it feels weird to not have anything on my eyes when I don't have it.The velcro strap is very comfortable and adjusts to many different sizes. It is big enough that it blocks out all the light. I like that it is kind of pillow-y so it forms where light might let in around the nose.The mask did have a kind of used-car-smell (more of a new-eye-mask smell) right when I opened it. I let it air out for a day and then it was fine. You could wash it right away if you wanted it to smell like your clothes.Overall this is probably the 4th one I've had over the past 6 years or so, I love it so much.
