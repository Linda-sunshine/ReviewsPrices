review/summary: GREAT FOR HAIR!review/text: Ordered this on a suggestion of another review for my severe sudden hair loss and remaining hair breakage, and it certainly does work. It's going to take several months to see the full effect but it looks promising at this point. Also, there is a receipt on the internet for a mask using Chick Pea's pulverized into powerder with Tumerick(Spice) and Almond Oil, so I mixed it up and it is the BEST mask I have EVER put on my face, it has cleared up any minor acne I was getting and makes my face feel like a baby's bottom! I have used masks that cost ALOT of $$$ and have tried almost every brand on the market and to find something so affordable that WORKS is nothing shy of a miracle for me!!!I will be back for more, but it will be awhile because a TINY bit of this goes A LONG LONG ways!! LOVE IT!!
