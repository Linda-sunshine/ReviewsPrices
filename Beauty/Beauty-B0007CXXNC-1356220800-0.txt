review/summary: This masque is worth the investmentreview/text: I was introduced to this masque while visiting Scottsdale, AZ. I stopped in a beauty supply store just to seek color for my hair. I was given a sample of this masque. I have never turned away since then. It is over two years now. Faithfully this masque have put the body back into any loss. I love it. I am multi racial and my hair loose its curl when blown dry or adding color...this masque is my hair savior. Great stuff
