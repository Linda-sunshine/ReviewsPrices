review/summary: Good hair dryer, bad nuzzlereview/text: It is a very good hair dryer regarding heat, weight, style etc, but the nuzzle has a fabrication problem, it falls off after some use until the point it never stays in place anymore, I contacted Babyliss directly to get a replacement concentrator nuzzle and they said will send me a universal nuzzle without charge that hopefully will fit, they do not carry the exact one for this model. However, to make sure it was not just this product and since the universal nuzzle takes 10 days to arrive I decided to buy the same model of hair dryer in a regular store to check it out, after two days using it, the hair dryer had the same issue on the concentrator nuzzle :(... Too bad since overall the hair dryer is really good. I returned both products (online & store), and I am ordering online a different model "BaByliss PRO 2800 Super Turbo Hair Dryer" which also have very good reviews, in general I know by friends and reviews online this brand is really good, but this particular model comes with this issue.
