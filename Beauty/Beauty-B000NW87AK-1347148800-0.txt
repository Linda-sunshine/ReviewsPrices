review/summary: omg...review/text: This is really awesome. I wasnt expecting too much from an eight dollar fragrance, but damn, this is like on eof the best perfumes Ive ever had, and Im a vet at fragrances, Im a perfume junkie!!Especially oils, and Ive used the best! From Kuumba Made to Madinni and Possets, I Love perfume oils and this is the best one!Its not fake smelling, or synthetic smelling at all, and its very subtle and awesome, almost like an invisible perfume, and it lasts all day. You dont need alot, and I catch these whiffs of it thruout the day and its fabulous, Love it!! I was amazed at all the good reviews all over the internet, and decided I cant go wrong, and they are right, it is awesome!
