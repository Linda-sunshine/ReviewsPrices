review/summary: YES!!!!!review/text: I am really enjoying this soap on my face.I have really sensitive skin so it's hard to dry something that doesn't make my face burn, or itch after washing it. However, this works nicely. I do wish it didn't make my face feel dry after I wash it, because I almost instantly have to put something, lotion or something on my face. I don't know if it's just the one I'm using, because when I used a different &#34;scent&#34;, don't remember the name, but it's in a orange wrapper; my face never dry out. Besides that I love it.
