review/summary: Works Like It Shouldreview/text: I like using a sleep mask because my bedroom has an window which gets the first morning light. I also travel by plane and train a lot. I bought this for obvious reasons and love it. It is comfortable and not too tight. Also, the inside of the mask has divots for your eyes. You don't feel like you are blindfolded. It is also cool, your face does not warm up. I like mine a great deal and am very happy with it.
