review/summary: A little drying, but great soap!review/text: I love the almond scent, and I love that this can be used for so many tasks. My main use is mixed with some water in a foaming handsoap dispenser. I do find it to be drying (even though the foamer calls for just a small amount of soap: water ratio), but still a very good product, and no weird chemicals.
