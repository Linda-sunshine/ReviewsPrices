review/summary: Best dryer I've ownedreview/text: My hair is shoulder length and thick and this dries it in less than half the time of my previous one, and leaves my hair far smoother and less frizzy...its a little heavy but since its so much faster its not an issue. Spend a few extra bucks and get a much better tool!
