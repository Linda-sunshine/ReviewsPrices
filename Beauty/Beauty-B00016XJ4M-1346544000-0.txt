review/summary: Great moisturizerreview/text: I have somewhat oily skin, and this is just enought hydration without being oily. I tried regular drug store witch hazel and another brand, and they both contained alcohol. They dried me out to the point of my skin peeling in a couple spots. This is great after I wash and if I need a little freshening up throughout the day. Smells great and I have seen a reduction in my pores across my cheeks and nose too! I've tried the lavender too, but I like this one better. I also LOVE that I have found another American made product too!
