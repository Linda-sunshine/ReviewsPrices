review/summary: Disappointingly AMAZING!!review/text: I was a little dismayed by this brush. Call me sadist, but I LOVE to hear my children whine and scream every morning and night when it is time to comb their hair. It is so enjoyable to have them cry and claim abuse as I tenderly comb their hair. After using 1/2 gallon of relaxer, straightener, cur detangler and random other chemicals each night just to avoid them curling up like a ball in agony and howling like a cat.Enter, the wet brush. This comb glides through the nappiest of bird nests with ease. As a professional knot remover, this brush is putting me out of business. Now I no longer have the bonding time of ripping their hair out by the roots when I comb their hair.I have two daughters with Tangled-length hair and tight rolls, so let me tell you, I get my fill of fun hair mornings. I'm a dad with short hair, so my styling skills are limited. Now, this brush allows me to explore my pinterest fancy and push the limits of combing works of art in their hair.All kidding aside, this brush has changed the relationship with my daughters. I can't believe we've gone through 10 different &#34;amazing&#34; brushes only to find this inexpensive game changer. It would only be perfected if it would help them get out of bed in the morning for school.
