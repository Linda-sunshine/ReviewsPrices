review/summary: Like it, don't love itreview/text: It is a nice little shape and puts on foundation very nicely. I just feel it's a little over priced; only lasted about a month and a half before it sort of shredded, and I don't like that you have to buy a special cleaner for it. I didn't buy the cleaner, but cleaned it with gentle soap and water. When cleaning it, a bunch of the pink dye would come out, making me skeptical about rubbing that damp sponge all over my face or my clients faces. I most likely will not purchase this sponge again, I do like sponges, but this one just didnt perform any better than much cheaper sponges.
