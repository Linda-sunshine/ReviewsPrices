review/summary: Love the color, but difficult to work withreview/text: The polish looks much lighter in the bottle in real life than in the picture, but it's much brighter on your fingers than in the bottle. It's also pearlescent, which was kind of a surprise to me. I love the color though, along with China Glaze in general. It dries SUPER FAST.The product is very hard to work with, however. Since it's a white based color, it's hard to get it to apply evenly. It's also very matte, so if you want it to be shiny, use a top coat.
