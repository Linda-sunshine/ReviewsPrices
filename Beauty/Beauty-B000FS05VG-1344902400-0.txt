review/summary: Lightweightreview/text: Got this about a month ago and so far so good. I was quite surprised at how light it was and it does blow dry my hair a tad faster than the one I had. I have really long curly hair so to get my hair dry in less than 10 minutes is HUGE. I haven't used the diffuser yet, but I am happy with it so far.
