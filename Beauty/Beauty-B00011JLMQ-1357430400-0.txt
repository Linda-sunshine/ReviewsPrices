review/summary: Beautiful Dorothy Slippers!review/text: I personally am a HUGE fan of the Wizard of OZ and this nail polish does not disappoint in the shiney glitter that makes your fingers and toes look like her ruby slippers! They only negative there is it that because there is so much glitter in the polish it does tend to chip but with it being glitter it is easy to touch up! Love it!
