review/summary: My skin has never felt softerreview/text: I really love the jojoba oil. It feels great on my skin and I am glad that it does not have any strong scent. I use it right out the shower on my wet skin and just let it "marinate" for about a few minutes while i do my hair and makeup, then dry off the excess water. My skin feels so soft and moisterized. All I use is a total of a quarter size and it goes a long way. I really love this pure oil.
