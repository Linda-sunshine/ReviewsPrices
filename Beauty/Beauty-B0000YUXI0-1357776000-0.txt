review/summary: My daughter stopped sucking her thumb that night!review/text: This product works incredibly well. It is funny because most people don't believe it could be that bad so they'll let my daughter put her finger in their mouth...it takes about 10 seconds or so before they're trying to find something to drink or eat to get rid of the taste :-)Beware that it will cause problems eating with your hands if you let your fingernails touch your mouth...everything will taste horrible.
