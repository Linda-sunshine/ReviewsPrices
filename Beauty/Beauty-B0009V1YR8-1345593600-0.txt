review/summary: Farouk CHI 1 inch Ceramic Flat Ironreview/text: This offer was too good too be true as I seen this same Chi Flat Iron that many of my friends have that cost them over a $100 more then I paid for it at $58.00. I research the produce against other sites and compared in beauty salons and nobody could match the price of $58.00 and I also made sure that the logo had the correct commas's that are inprinted on the Real CHI product. It looked ok , so I took a chance and once I receive the CHI Iron it was a perfect match to the CHI Iron that my friends paid so much more for. It was exactly the same. Work's great , I love it. I would reccomend it to anyone and a great bargin.
