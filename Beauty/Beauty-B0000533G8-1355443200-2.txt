review/summary: Great product!review/text: I love the scent, it's soft and subtle. Even my boyfriend uses it, as it doesn't leave him smelling at all feminine. I always feel clean after using Dr. Bronner's castile soap, no weird residue. I've had very dry winter skin in the past, and regular bar "soap" as they call it, would leave my skin feeling tight and itchy. One of my favorite things about this liquid soap, is the fact that it lathers so well. A quarter size amount on a pouf will get me through my shower. A 32 oz bottle will last me and my boyfriend 2-3 months easy, so the initial cost isn't so bad.
