review/summary: This is not a real Chireview/text: This is not a real Chi flat iron and does not come with a warranty. The swivel cord is very awkward and hard to work around. It does get hot quickly like the real Chi but because it is fake I'm not sure if the plates are real ceramic and cause less harm to the hair. It did come extremely quickly however, in like two days.
