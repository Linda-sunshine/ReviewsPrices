review/summary: Adequatereview/text: This mask is ok. Two things I don't like about it:1. It is not contoured, so the mask is up against your eyelids2. Light leaks in around the nose area. In practice, if my wife is on her laptop, light leaks into the mask.The mask works ok, but it's not any better than the generic mask that one can buy at the drugstore. Note that you are buying *two* masks, which makes the price even better.
