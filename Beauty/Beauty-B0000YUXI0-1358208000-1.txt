review/summary: Worked on my sonreview/text: My son has had a habit of sucking on his pointer and middle finger together at once since he was 4 months old. He was sucking on the fingers so much that he has sores on both of those fingers and the nails are extremely soft and brittle. Now he's 2 years and 8 months old and I desperately wanted him to shake the disgusting habit. I put this on both nails and 15 or so minutes later he stuck his fingers in his mouth. He shuddered and pulled them back out. It's been a week and his fingers haven't gone back in his mouth, not even while asleep. I'm still putting it on him every other day just in case but this was definitely money well spent! I just want to add that part of the reason this worked so well for us is firstly because my son is very sensitive to taste and secondly because once I ordered it, every time his fingers went into his mouth I would tell him that if he didn't stop his fingers would start to taste bad.
