review/summary: Thayer - Witch Hazel Tonerreview/text: I am glad I found this product. It's very refreshing and cleanses my face really well and it doesn't dry up the skin. I used to have so many pimples in my forehead but they are gone now. I use it in the morning or night before going to bed. It also smells great... like roses!
