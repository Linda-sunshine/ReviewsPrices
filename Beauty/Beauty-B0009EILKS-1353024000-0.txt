review/summary: Feels so refreshed BUT it makes your pore biggerreview/text: WOW. I love this product. It works good and gets rid of all my whiteheads and blackheads! I must admit that I've been addicted to this product lately.BUT, don't use too much. I would say once a week is too often. If you are going to use this product on regular basis, it can lead you to maximize (be careful, not minimize) your pore size. My recommendation is to always use pore minimizer afterwards to make sure your pore got tightened up and feel smoother.
