review/summary: No more knots (or tears)!review/text: We ordered this brush after reading the reviews, and it totally works! My six year old daughter has long hair which gets tangled quickly, and she HATES having her hair brushed. We received the brush today, tried it out right away and she reports that it doesn't hurt at all. She did a side-by-side test brushing her hair with her regular brush on one side and this brush on the other, and she could see and feel the difference. We don't know how this works, but we love it!!!!!
