review/summary: amazing......subliminal....magic..review/text: i was leery to try this perfume,w/all purchases via internet,u can't "try before you buy" which can certainly lead to regretfu purchase..However i was very pleased w/this oil. EGYPTIAN GODDESS is so many things. In reading reviews, alot said it smelled different on everyday,i haven't experienced that but the scent is 1 i quite enjoy& i'm looking forward to purchasing a larger bottle as well as solid perfume(when available). My ONLY drawback was that some reviewers stated to only buy from Auric Blends, i've no prob w/this&thought I HAD but when i recieved perfume in mail the order invoice stated it came from"OLD GLORY"i've no prob w/O.G.,it just troubles me that i clicked on Auric Blends in order to be sure the E.G.oil was the real thing&still ended up getting it from elsewhere.It still smells great but i WILL make sure to have a witness for my next purchase lol! Enjoy this perfume oil,it begs to be worn,shared&experienced..just be careful in crowded places,you may find yourself overwhelmed!
