review/summary: Works really well on coarse, straight Asian hair.review/text: I have very straight, thick, long Asian hair, and it's hard for me to find a curling iron that will work for me. This one works great! It's super hot and the spring is strong enough to tightly grip my smooth, slippery hair. It's also very comfortable to use.
