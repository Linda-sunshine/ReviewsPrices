review/summary: The Iron Melted Apartreview/text: After owning the iron for only a few months the metal part that heats up would completely melt the plastic that's it's attached to and come apart. I could squeeze it back together and wait for the plastic to cool and harden, but this only took care of the problem until I turned it on again. I was excited about this iron and thought it would be great because it's a CHI. I didn't realize when buying it that it only heats to one setting, which might be the problem. The straightener gets way too hot and it actually fried my hair and caused split ends for the first time in my life. I've recently bought a new iron (the HSI, which I highly recommend). If you're wanting a CHI definitely pay extra to get one with a heat control adjustment!
