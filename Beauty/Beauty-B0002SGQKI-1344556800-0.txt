review/summary: Moonlight is my sunshinereview/text: When white is too bright, Moonlight is the way to go. Opaque: one thick coat or two thin coats is all you need. This polish gives professional looking results, no streaks. This polish can be used alone, with a coat of glitter for a magical affect, or even for a French manicure. I love it. If you love polish, don't hesitate to add this color to collection. It looks good on the palest to darkest of complexions. It's a fabulous neutral.
