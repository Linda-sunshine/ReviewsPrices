review/summary: Doesn't heat up enoughreview/text: This is the 3rd Chi I've purchased (one was gift to my niece), and the first one I am not happy with. The red light blinks continuously, and the plates just don't get as hot as my previous Chi, which is evident in how my hair does not stay as straight and frizzes. I didn't experience this with the 1st one which lasted 5 years. Btw my niece still has hers and it is still working just fine. Not very happy.
