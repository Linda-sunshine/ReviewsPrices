review/summary: Very light; absorbs easilyreview/text: NO funny smells, absorbs easily. I mix it with other oils (vegetable glycerine, coconut oil, body oil made with sesame oil, and jojoba oil.... SO GOOD!) and it's just terrific. My skin felt soft and subtle all day long, unlike using regular lotion.
