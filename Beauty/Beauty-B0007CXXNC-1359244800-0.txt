review/summary: Great stuff!review/text: Keep in mind I didn't buy mine here ^_^ so idk if it's fake here since its cheap.Okay, I got mine for about $35 at ulta. I read some review said the real color of the mask is white. However, my is real and is the color light gold yellow ^_^ n it works wonder ! I use it 3-4 times a week and it leaves my hair super soft. So I pretty much use it as my daily conditioner . I mix mine with morrrocanoil and leave it in my hair for 5 minute. Also, I brought a trial pack at a salon for maybe $3 or $4 and it was white. It didn't work good for me. Target product is also white too. So I'm confuse ^_^ maybe they have two diff colors but both are real. Since my friend is a YouTube guru and her was sent by the company for free and it's same golden colored as mine&& I love love the scent . I get complicated on how my hair smells good. It stays on for 2 days too. Maybe because I also use an oil afterward from morrrocanoil. Which smells super good !!!!But this of you have dry hair. This helps me get less tangle hair. I don't like the price but my mom prefer I use it to save my hair from breakage since I get tangled hair a lot!!!!If you don't like the smell. Just get it from morrrocanoil masque it smells less strong. But cost $42-$45 for the same amount.
