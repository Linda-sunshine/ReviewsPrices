review/summary: i like it but it is too strong, makes eating finger foods difficult and gross.review/text: i never write reviews but i feel this is important. I have been biting my nails for as long as i can remember and it has already stopped me and i've been wearing it for a week now. I can see my nails already growing back. But it is a little too strong. It is very hard to eat finger foods, because when you eat all i can taste is the bitterness, its bad if you get hair in your mouth because you will also taste the nail polish trying to remove the hair. If you accidentally touch your lip it the taste stays on your lips and in your mouth, so i have been chewing a lot of gum recently to combat this. The taste lingers in your mouth far too long and its quite annoying, but it is definitely stopping me and that is the goal.
