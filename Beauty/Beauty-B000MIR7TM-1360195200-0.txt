review/summary: The BEST Make Up Tool I have EVER Owned! - BUY THIS!review/text: I have purchased thousands of dollars in make up and tools (brushes, sponges,etc.) and have almost always found the downside to every product. I usually buy my wedge sponges at Merle Norman which is pretty pricey. I have ditched my wedge sponges entirely after receiving these! Rarely, I do come across a product that is simply AMAZING. This is one of those products. The sponges were delivered in the time frame provided and I couldn't wait to apply my make up when I got them as I had read all of the reviews and KNEW this was going to be incredible. I also watch a lot of You Tube videos by Wayne Goss who is a magician when it comes to make up. You can find him under the handle gossmakeupartist. Anyhow,these sponges are a miracle. They blend better than anything I have EVER used and they are very well made. If you follow the instructions provided, you will have a flawless face, even if you have little or no experience with make up application. The tapered end is perfect for under they eyes and around the nose and the bulbous end is perfect for blending on the rest of your face. You cannot go wrong, it is foolproof! I was a little wary about spending so much on sponges but after reading all the reviews figured I couldn't go wrong and I was right! I have told so many people about these sponges because not only have they made my beauty routine easier, my face looks amazing! I haven't even had to use the 2nd sponge yet so when the first one bites the dust, I already have my back up ready and waiting. They are super easy to clean and feel great on your face when using them! If you don't buy these, you're missing out!
