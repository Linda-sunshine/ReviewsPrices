review/summary: gets rid of beesreview/text: I used this product combined with a few drops of citronella oil to rid bees from the wall of my house. It worked great! I drilled a few tiny holes through the drywall, then used a 60cc syringe with 1.5" 20 gauge needle to spray the oil into the wall. Bees were totally out in less than 2 days. I learned this trick from a bee keeper, who said that there is an acid in the almond oil that bees hate.
