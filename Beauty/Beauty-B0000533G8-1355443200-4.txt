review/summary: I really like this product!review/text: I like this product a lot and really appreciate that the gallon bottles are available online. I've used this soap for about 30 years - and the best way that I can describe it is that it makes me happy in the morning. For those who have never used this product, it might take a little adjustment. The peppermint definately gives you a little sensation that you don't get out of a lot of soaps. After a little while though - nothing else will do. From the all natural ingredients to the healthy amount of suds - this is a great product.Prior to buying the product online, it was always difficult to find in the stores. I would be able to find the smaller bottles in a store for a few months, then they would be gone from the shelves - seemingly forever. A few months later, they might appear in another store. Now I just purchase the big bottle and refill my smaller bottles as needed. Much easier and I'm much happier!
