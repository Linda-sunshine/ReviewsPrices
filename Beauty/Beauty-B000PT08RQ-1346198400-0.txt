review/summary: best $25 I've ever spentreview/text: I love love love this straightener. This product saves me so much time from drying my hair and then having to go back and straightening it. I have yet to use my hair dryer after purchasing the "wet 2 straight" hot iron. Heats up quickly, and has adjustable temperatures. This is the straightest my hair has ever been.. it makes my hair stay perfectly straight for several days. I highly recommend this product!
