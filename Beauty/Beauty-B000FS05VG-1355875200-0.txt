review/summary: I have fine, (very) damaged hair and I love it!review/text: I love love love this dryer! I have blond, overprocessed, long, fine hair and this dryer leaves it so smooth! I can't believe it! It dries my hair in five minutes, compared to twenty minutes with my old dragon dryer (you know the one, practically spits fire and weighs a ton!). This does blow fast, even on low, but that is the great thing about it! The dryer is so LIGHT! 14.8 ounces to be exact! I just can't tell you enough about why I love it! The shipping was free, and the price was half what it is in the store. If you have fragile hair, this is for you. If you have thick hair, this is for you. If you have frizzy hair, fine hair, any hair.. well you get the idea!
