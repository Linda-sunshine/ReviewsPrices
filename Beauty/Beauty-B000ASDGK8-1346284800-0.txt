review/summary: Shorter drying timereview/text: I bought this hair dryer after my Coroliss Apollo broke. It came quickly so kudos to the seller.As far as my experience. I have relatively fine hair (don't get me wrong, it's not thin, but it's fine). It's the kind of hair that looks amazingly full after a wash and blow dry but can fall limp mid day. This hair dryer dries my hair much quicker- let's say 5 min versus the 10 or so prior and it also makes my hair feel dry. That may be the cost for more efficient drying. I'm not complaining though- my hair retains its fullness bc it doesn't get weighed down with oil as easily, but this may bother others. Overall, I would give it 3.5 stars. It's a good buy for the price.
