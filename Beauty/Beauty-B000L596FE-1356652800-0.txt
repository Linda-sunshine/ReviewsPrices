review/summary: the best freaKin brush ever.review/text: I have REALLY long thick hair. This brush does the trick. It is my out of the shower brush as it doesn't get caught up in my wet hair and cause more tangles. I was shocked at how well it brushes through all my hair even when it is dry and it doesn't make my hair frizzy or full of static. My 6 year old niece loves this brush as it doesn't hurt to brush her hair. If you have a kid who doesn't like to brush their hair because &#34;it hurts&#34; this is the brush for you.
