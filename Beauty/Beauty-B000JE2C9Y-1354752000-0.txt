review/summary: Is it worth $12?review/text: the easy answer is... NO. the smell of chamomile and peppermint was nice, but it lasted for a day. the sleep mask has an adjustable velcro strap which is great. the mask also has extra padding for the bottom part of your eyes, awesome. but is this item really worth shelling out $12 for? not at all, and you can find something cheaper that can do the same. it seems these reviews are a bit exaggerated IMHO. this mask covers your eyes from the sun, nothing more. i didnt notice any"refreshing feelings" before bed or any change in sleeping quality. this product just covers the eyes.
