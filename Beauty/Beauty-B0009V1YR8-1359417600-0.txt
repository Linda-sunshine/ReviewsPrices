review/summary: Awesome straightenerreview/text: I Never write reviews but because of how great my CHI was I had to. I have had my CHI for 7 years and it has been great! It finally died tonite and I am fixing to order my 2 one. It did a great job straightening my very wavy frizzy hair and it was very durable! I dropped mine a tone of times and a plate did come lose once but I used some apoxy on it and fixed it but I was really clumsy so it was bound to happen. If I could give more than five stars I would :)
