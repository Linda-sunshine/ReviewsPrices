review/summary: Love This Flat Ironreview/text: This iron has made such a difference in managing my hair. By styling it wet, my hair doesn't have the time to dry in it's own wave pattern so it is much more manageable. I also like not having to blow dry first. It saves time and damage to my hair. It works wonderful on dry hair, too. This is a great hair tool, especially for the price!!
