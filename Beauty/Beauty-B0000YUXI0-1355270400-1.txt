review/summary: Worked in one dayreview/text: I was a little skeptical at how this would work, but based on the reviews, decided to give it a try. My 3 year old was a horrible thumb sucker. She always had a thumb in her mouth. We were having such a hard time breaking her of this habit. Within one day this worked. It was amazing. Based on previous comments I only applied a very small dab on her thumbs. I reapplied 2 days later, just in case, but she really didn't need it. I highly recommend this product!
