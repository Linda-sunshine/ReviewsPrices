review/summary: The good stuff.review/text: I have a pretty bothersome case of seborrheic dermatitis, and I read on a pretty popular forum that this stuff really helps. I've tried Jason shampoo for dandruff, which states that it helps seborrheic dermatitis, but it didn't work for me. I also tried several other shampoos, like tgel and selsun blue, and they didn't work for me either. the only one that did anything besides this was nizoral but i wanted something less harmful. I wash my hair every other day or every 2 days, and after trying this stuff the itchiness, red patches and flaking was gone. I've been using it for a couple of months now and I dont have issues anymore. The fact that it can also be used as a body was is even better, less cluttering.Edit: 11.19.12 I switched to Nizoral just to see the different effects. I have to say that it works better in controlling it. With Bronners after 2 days my seborrheic Dermatitis starts to kick in with itching etc. With nizeral sometimes I'd go 3 or even 4 days and I'm okay. This might be just me, but I've also noticed less hair loss. Still like Bronners though since it's the next best thing and its more natural than anything else, plus i use it for numerous other things.
