review/summary: Dries hair fastreview/text: This is a great blow dryer. It dries my hair really fast, which I appreciate because I have a lot of long, thick hair. My hair does get kind of tangled, but that could be my lack of technique. The only thing I would change is I wish it had a retractable cord. This one gets tangled and crazy.
