review/summary: Definitely don't want my fingers anywhere near my mouth!review/text: I got this to help me stop my nail-biting, and it definitely has a gross, bitter taste every time my fingers touch my mouth. I reapply each morning, and so far, it's serving its intended purpose. My only issue with it is that eating finger foods can be a little tricky, but otherwise, I'm on my way to stopping my nail biting.
