review/summary: Love all the flavors!review/text: My Dermatologist told me that the white heads on my chin would never go away. My Dad told me to try the castile soap (Orange w/ tea tree oil). I was amazed at how fast the white heads disappeared. I have to use it everyday though.I just rub a few drops in my hands (Undiluted) and clean away. The Lavendar flavor my husband and my self put in our bath water. It's wonderful. My sister uses the Baby flavor on all her kids. Two have sensitive skin and two do not. She thinks it's great stuff two. Oh yeah, I got the Oil of Olay face scrubber last Christmas. I use it some. I have Rosacea on my face and neck and the Excema is around my eyebrows. The Tea tree oil is still the best hands down. It's a bit pricey. But, I figure if it works with my problem areas, It's priceless. My Dad uses the Peppermint to wash his hair. He loves the tinglyness but Knowing his hair is clean is the best feeling. You can actually use the tea tree oil (Orange) for washing your hair, shaving, cleaning you face, put in your bath water for the enticing aroma and cleanliness, I could go on and on. The tea tree is the best for all around cleanliness. In other words you don't need all the different flavors to do the job, The one is sufficent.
