review/summary: Mild and Aromaticreview/text: My dermatologist recommended Dr Bronner's lavender or almond to use as a body wash for my very dry skin. This is my second bottle. The first one lasted three months, even after I refilled the hand soap dispenser in the bathroom. I never would have thought that something labeled &#34;castile soap&#34; could be so mild and smell so good. I love the lavender aroma.
