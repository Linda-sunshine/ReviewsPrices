review/summary: If you have fine hair, DON'T buy it!!review/text: After reading all the good reviews I decided to ignored the bad ones and try this product, bad idea! I have fine hair, I tried with my hair wet and another day dry and after using it only two times I end up tons of split ends my hair looks lifeless; also it takes a lot longer than my thin cheap conair pink ceramic, I'm back using my very cheap conair with pink ceramic.
