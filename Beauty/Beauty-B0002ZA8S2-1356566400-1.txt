review/summary: AMAZING!!!review/text: I have very straight Asian hair that doesn't curl at all. I've watched every guru's technique on curling hair and tried salon bought hair spray but my hair just wouldn't stay curled. I started to think that it was just my hair. Then I got this curling iron for Christmas and it worked so well. I didn't have to use any product and it stayed curl through out the day. I never realized till now how important it is to have a good curling iron. The price isn't bad and I love how the curling iron rotates with you as you curl. I highly recommend.
