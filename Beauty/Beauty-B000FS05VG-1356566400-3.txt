review/summary: Great value hair blower for the money!review/text: I bought the Revlon RV/544 in April 2011 for less than $20. I went through three Bespoke Labs T3 dryers for tons of money (one was replaced at minimal cost by Bespoke), and decided to try inexpensive dryers. The Revlon RV/544 and the Andis RC-2 with retractable cord (need travel dryer a couple times a week) had very good reviews so I bought both. They are both great dryers! I have mid-length, very curly, color treated hair that I style smooth and then finish with a flat iron so power that won't fry my hair or make my hair frizzy is important to me. Also, I am petite and holding a heavy dryer with my arms up is not easy, and both dryers are very lightweight (years ago I was using wonderful, older technology Elchim and Supersolano hair blowers that I just can't hold up anymore). The Revlon purchased in April 2011 just broke and I just bought another one. I was tempted to buy another Andis now instead, but I think I'll wait until it breaks before getting another. It's just not worth spending between $200 and $300 for a hair blower that doesn't do the job any better or last longer than the Revlon. Kudos to Revlon for a great product!
