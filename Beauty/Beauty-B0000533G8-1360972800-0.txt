review/summary: A Very Invigorating and Concentrated Soapreview/text: This soap is wonderfully energizing and has a very refreshing aroma. It's also very concentrated so a single bottle lasts over a year. My skin and face are in great condition so I can see no downside. Perhaps you would prefer a soap that ran out faster so that you could enjoy a variety of fragrances? Perhaps you find the powerful cooling sensation unpleasant? Perhaps your method of applying soap to yourself is incompatible with such a concentrated soap? These are the only reasons I can think of for not enjoying this soap.
