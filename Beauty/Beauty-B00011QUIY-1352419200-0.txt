review/summary: So far so good!review/text: I just received this Tuesday and it came just as described. It only took a minute to heat up and it gets super hot! I've only used it once, but I have thick, wavy hair and it gave me exactly what I was looking for-bigger, looser curls. I'll update my review once I use it a little more, but so far the price is hard to beat and it works great. Note: They sell the same Hot Tools curler down the street from me at Sallys for $43 before tax.
