review/summary: As close as we are going to getreview/text: My daughter has a very sensitive scalp with baby fine long hair (think angel hair). She has hated every single brush I have every used on her, natural boar bristles, plastic with ball tips, metal, cushion... Many a brushing has ended in tears. This brush is not perfect but it is as close as we are going to get. The bristles and very thin nylon with small balls on the ends. The bristles bend very easily with pressure. She still says the brushing hurts her scalp but not as much as anything else we have used. Everyone else in the house thinks the bristles feel like a massage on the head. This works best when her hair is wet and conditioned (true of many a brush we've used). When her hair is dry and tangled it is very slow going but better than a "regular" brush.
