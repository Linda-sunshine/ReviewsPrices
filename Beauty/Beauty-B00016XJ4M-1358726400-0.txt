review/summary: Love it!review/text: I bought this after reading the reviews and I am now in love! I have combination skin and I usually only breakout during that time of the month. I was always using salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide pimple creams at night (sex killer! lol) and my face used to have red areas even blemish spots (face picker).After using this every night my face is red-free and blemish spots are not as noticeable. It smells nice like natural roses and leaves my face soft and clean. I've only been using it like a month but noticed the different the first week. Just try it and see!
