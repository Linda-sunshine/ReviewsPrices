review/summary: Gentlereview/text: Overall, I love this soap. It does have a somewhat &#34;medicinal&#34; smell, but I might add some mint to soften it. If you are used to highly perfumed body wash, or if you aren't familiar with the smell of tea tree, you might prefer to try one of the other DB scents.
