review/summary: It lasted 5 months....review/text: My first Chi straightener was great. It lasted for years but eventually died. I replaced it in August. This one died after five months. I talked to my stylist who said that he has heard similar complaints. Its too bad. It used to be a good product. But they aren't what they used to be. I purchased the HSI straightener today.
