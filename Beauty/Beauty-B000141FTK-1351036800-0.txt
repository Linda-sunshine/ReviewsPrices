review/summary: Best soap everreview/text: I became a big fan of body wash when I realized how much more efficiently I can get through a shower. I then decided I wanted to get something that was less perfume filled and would keep from feeling like I just bathed in my deodorant. Dr. Bronner's was an excellent choice, it doesn't dry my skin, it rinses clean and it's supposed to break down better, meaning it's better for the environment. I also can get about 6 months out of the 32oz container, a little goes a very, very long way.
