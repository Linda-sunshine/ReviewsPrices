review/summary: Wish I had had this 50+ years agoreview/text: All my life I have had very dry rough skin on my hands. Nearly all of the hand lotions burn my skin when I use them and give me a terrible rash. As a child my knuckles would actually crack and bleed. That was my usual state. My mother would only buy one type of lotion and that was the type that was the most irritating to my skin. As an adult I was able to find lotions that worked much better, but I was never able to completely get rid of the dryness on the sides of fingers and around my nails. Then as I got older the skin on my knuckles seemed to thicken and deep wrinkles formed especially at the base of my little fingers. About 2 months ago a friend gave me a bit of Dr. Bonner's Hemp Tea Tree soap. I have sensitivities to many things including mint so she made a point to give me something she thought would not bother me. With in 3 days of using Dr. Bonner's soap my hands looked better then they EVER have before. The skin on my fingers was soft and the wrinkles on my knuckles smoothed out until they were almost gone. My hands look better then they did when I was in my 20's. I haven't even been using lotion. The redness and burning and stinging and itching is gone. If I had known about this years ago I could of avoided years of pain and embarrassment about the condition of my hands. The really amazing thing is that I only use it to wash my hands. I still use all my regular cleaners and soaps for others things. Granted they are all perfume and dye free and biodegradable but so was the hand soap I was using before. Dr. Bonner's has been great 'medicine' for my hands and really does seem to be almost magic.
