review/summary: Works great!review/text: I have been using this product for over a year now, and I recommend it to anyone that has thin hair on the top of the head. The color blends in well with my own haircolor, and it adds body and texture to my own thin strands. I do try and add a side part using a thin comb or pick in order to obtain a more natural look, otherwise it can sometimes look like a wig without a natural hairpart.I am a young woman, and without this product I would probably go back to feeling very self -conscience and uncomfortable in public.
