review/summary: Love this hair dryer!review/text: I bought this hair dryer immediately after using it at a friend's house (she's a hairdresser). It was surprisingly affordable, and it works really well. It has a warm setting, which I really like, and it is powerful but quiet. My hair comes out silky and less static-y than usual. Love it!
