review/summary: Got shipped in USED CONDITiONreview/text: I received this item in a box, appropriately packaged and all but when I took it out to open and use, there was liquid/product all over the sides of the lid. It was clear someone had used it or it had been opened, spilled and then the lid was put back again. It was smeared all over the sides. It was really disgusting and I decided to not use it in case of any bacteria/safety issues.
