review/summary: Can't bite my nails but can't eat finger foodreview/text: After a life long habit of nail biting this product has deterred me more than any other. I have tried the 'spicy' or 'bitter' ones but after a while I got use to the taste or would stop putting it on my nails. I've been using this for a couple weeks now and have not been biting. Once you put it on the taste lasts for a few days and what an awful taste it is. I mean just terrible. I regret every time my fingers touch my lips. Unfortunately this includes when I am eating finger foods. The taste rubs off on my fingers and my lips. I've had to change my eating habits a bit but so far it has been worth it.
