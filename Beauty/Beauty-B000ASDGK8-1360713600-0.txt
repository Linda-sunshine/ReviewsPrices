review/summary: LOVE THIS HAIR DRYERreview/text: I got this hairdryer for my birthday last summer. I have very very thick hair that takes over 45 minutes to dry and straighten. Using this hair dryer, it cuts it down to 20 minutes. No joke. I love it!! My sister who has really really thin hair, used it when she stayed over one night and she was floored at how much volume she was able to get out of her hair. So I bought her one for her birthday. Highly recommend.
