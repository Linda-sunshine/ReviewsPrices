review/summary: You'll feel so tingly!!!review/text: Seriously, though I have left my hippy days behind me, one thing that has followed me is my great love for Dr. Bronners Castile Soap! Yes, the soap with the crazy label created by the mad scientist himself still sits in my shower, and is used quite often . If you want to feel literally sparkling clean, use it, and remember.... Dilute !Though the Doctors soap is great for a shampoo, unless you're looking to grow out some dreadlocks you need to make sure that you use a conditioner with it if you have fine hair, the peppermint will definitely strip out the oils from your hair and leave it dry, but if you ever del at all greasy, this is the soap for you. In fact, using the peppermint soap can be a bit drying to the hands as well. But the trade off is well worth it.Like many of the other reviewers here, I'll also point out that the product can be used for multitude of purposes. I have used it on the road, and in countless country's where I needed something easy to carry that I knew could clean in both liquid and bar formats .Ive used it as a tooth cleaner,& mouthwash , as a clothing detergent , dish soap , I've used it to de-grease auto parts on the side of the road in southeast Asia , I've used it to wash off fruits and veggies!!I'm not saying I would go out of my way to use it as a mouthwash everyday , but if you're traveling really light & fast, and you need to a Swiss army knife of cleansers that is green and won't hurt you , this is what you need. And as I said in the title, if you wash your, umm...bits with it.. They will feel darn well tingly , and somehow minty fresh!!!
