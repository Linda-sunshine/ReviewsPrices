review/summary: Counterfeit!!! Do NOT Buy!review/text: The product is not a Farouk CHI, but a counterfeit product. The iron stopped working after 40 days, just after the Amazon warranty expired. When we contacted CHI we were informed that the product is a cheap counterfeit and they can't honor the warranty. Buyer beware.
