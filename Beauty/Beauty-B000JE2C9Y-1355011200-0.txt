review/summary: So soft and comfortable!review/text: I was surprised to find such a comfortable, adjustable and soft sleep mask for this price. It really is a steal. It blocks out light, it's silky soft and extremely comfortable to wear. The velco adjustable strap is perfect. I recommend it to friends and family who are looking for a sleep mask.
