review/summary: Outstanding Pro Curling Iron At A GREAT Pricereview/text: I'll caveat this review by saying I'm not a hair stylist and no nothing as in zip, zilch, nada about the tools used in that profession. However better half has been a stylist for twenty years and serves as Creative Director for one of the top ten Day Spas in the United States - he knows his scissors and then some.Based on his feed back Hot Tools are a top choice for professionals for a couple of reasons:* They hold up to commercial use* Have a reliable thermostat which apparently is essential, who knew?* Solid Warrantee* Comfortable gripAs for sizing the one inch is the most popular and any hair stylist worth their salt can make any size curl or wave with the one inch diameter rod. The price on Amazon was the best - beating out even the closed to the general public beauty supply houses that cater only to professionals.Over the years I've found this to be true with virtually all tools of trade and recently bought him a pair of $700 Kamisori shears for $265 with free shipping to boot. As for the curling iron it arrived in it's sealed retail packaging and again with a Prime membership you get free two day shipping to boot.
