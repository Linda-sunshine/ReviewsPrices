review/summary: Excellent dryingreview/text: Bought this for the current girlfriend to try to get her out of the bathroom quicker. She had some outdated blow dryer and it seemed to take forever to dry her hair. Since we got ready for work at the same time in a one bedroom apartment, this was becoming a problem. Bought her this and I must say I'm just as happy as she is with it. Quick with different settings. The only downside is the noise but when isn't it with a hair dryer? Worth every penny.
