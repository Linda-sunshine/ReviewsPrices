review/summary: Pretty great curling iron, just hasn't worked perfectly for mereview/text: I have mixed feelings about this curling iron, because it has some really great features and hasn't royally screwed anything up yet... it just doesn't work very well for my hair.Here are some awesome things:-the swivel cord... keeps it out of the way when it needs to be-the temperature adjust... allows you to choose exactly how hot you want the iron-it heats up VERY quickly-it has a little stand so you can prop it up when you need to put it down on the counterBut for some reason, my curls just won't stay. I'm still giving this 4 stars, however, because I don't doubt that this is because of the length and thickness of my hair, and not necessarily the curling iron itself. I have not tried it on its hottest setting yet (because I'm scared of the burn horror stories I see in reviews) but may just have to try it if nothing else works.So overall, it's a very cool looking curling iron with a lot of really fantastic features, but it hasn't quite lived up to my expectations yet.
