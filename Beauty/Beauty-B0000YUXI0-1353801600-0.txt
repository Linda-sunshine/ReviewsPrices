review/summary: Great productreview/text: I bought this because I have been biting my nails since I was in grade school. My nails look terrible and the front teeth are starting to wear from the years of bitting. I haven;t tried anything else in the past for this but now that am 31 years old I figure it;s time to break this habit for good.I apply this stuff daily and IT WORKS! It's the worst tasting stuff when I am conscious of when Im about to bite my nails I stop myself and the few times today that I have forgotten and unconsciously tried to bite them I am bitterly reminded of why I need to keep from biting. I'm hoping to be broken of this habit very soon. Only bad thing is that it will get onto finger foods and make whatever you are eating taste funny; otherwise great product.
