review/summary: Excellent Scent, if you like the stylereview/text: I honestly purchased this due to the great price a few weeks ago, and had never smelled it previously. I read the reviews and just couldn't pass up the deal.I'm extremely happy that I didn't pass on it. This has become one of my favorite colognes, and it is now in heavy rotation along with Armani Code.This is a 'water' cologne, and some people just don't like that style...and that's just fine. I love the style, and think this is one of the best smelling colognes in it.It's also quite long lasting. I generally apply it before work, and it's still noticeable when I'm getting home ~10 hours later(at very close distance)All in all, a great scent that I'm really glad I jumped on. I jumped at an even cheaper price on Nautica Blue, and while I'm not as enamored with the scent, it's not too bad.
