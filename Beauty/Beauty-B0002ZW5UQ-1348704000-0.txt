review/summary: What I thinkreview/text: I have been using this product for 3 years, though I don't use it every day, only on special occasions where I expect to be photographed.I recommend against using this concealer every day though, there was a time when I used this concealer every day and my scalp became irritated because of it, but the irritation stopped when I reduced my usage.There's not much to say though. The product does its job as described. It effectively conceals any bald spot that you have but you won't be able to benefit from this if you don't have any hair at all.
