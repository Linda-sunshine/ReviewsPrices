review/summary: greatreview/text: I have had this for 2 years now and use it almost every day. Its not too loud, still works great, easy to hold in hand, has the bonus piece, good price and good setting, hot, warm, cold and low/high. Works perfectly fine as should and I have no complaints with product.
