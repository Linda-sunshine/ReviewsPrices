review/summary: Works just as describedreview/text: I had my doubts about this brush. I have thin, tangly hair which is complicated by illness and the fact that I stopped using conditioner on it (chemicals). So this brush had a big job to do. It did the job! It was really easy and painless to run this brush through my hair and it detangled it with ease. I am really impressed. Excellent product.
