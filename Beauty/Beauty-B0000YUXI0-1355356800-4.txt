review/summary: Aptly Named: Mavala STOP!review/text: The down 'n' dirty:This stuff works as advertised, period!The Long Story:I have a child who was a hardcore finger sucker until the age of five. My wife and I tried several &#34;home remedies&#34; such as bandages, soap, hot sauce, and caster oil. None of them seemed to be consistent or highly effect deterrents. We tried positive and negative reinforcement, but both proved fruitless. It seemed as though the habit was too strong to break, having been in practice for those five years since birth (our only child that preferred his digits over a pacifier).On the recommendation of a friend of my wife's, we decided to try Mavala Stop. Initially, we were skeptical, but decided it was worth a try. To our great surprise, the very first application effectively negated the problem for a good three weeks to a month. What was more amazing was, even while he slept, he didn't dare put his finger in his mouth! Impressive, to say the least. However, the after that time, I suppose the strength of the habit kicked in, and he was at it again. After another application, the problem was mitigated for a considerable while, only happening during sleep several weeks later. After one last use, the problem ceased to exist, even a year later.Conclusion:In my experience, this product has delivered on its promise. From interacting with other users, as well as reading reviews, I understand that the results will likely differ based on the child and the strength of the habit. Some people have had the fortunate &#34;one and done&#34; scenario, while others had to stay at it a bit longer. I would theorize that the sooner you use it, the better. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to break the habit (in my case, about four years overdue). I would highly recommend this product!
