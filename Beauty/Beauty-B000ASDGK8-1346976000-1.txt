review/summary: Great Dryerreview/text: I have lots of hair and needed a dryer that would dry it fairly quickly. The Babyliss Pro is great; I can get all of my hair dry in about 10-15mins. The other reviews were true about the dryer being a bit hefty, but otherwise it does a great job and I have no complaints. It even worked on my dog!
