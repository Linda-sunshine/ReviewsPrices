review/summary: Just buy it alreadyreview/text: I wasn't expecting too much from this productBut OMG let me tell you...This soap smells & feels amazingI really recommend this product and I only got it 2 days ago!!!You need to try it for yourselfIt has a bunch of weird writing on the side, I think the owner of the company had a spiritual enlightenment & decided to print religious type text all other the bottle which is fun to read when sitting on the toiletAnyways I say it is worth trying at least once, I'm probably going to be a long time customer, well until sometime better comes out that is...
