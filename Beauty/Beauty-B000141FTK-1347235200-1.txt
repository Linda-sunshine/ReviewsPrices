review/summary: Good soap, but not worth the damage it can cause!review/text: Over this past weekend I took a shot of Dr. Bronner's liquid Pure Castile soap to my right eye while trying to clean out the bottle spout (clogs up all the time). I spent 10 hours overnight in pain while trying to wash it out every 90 minutes. The following morning I went to see a physician who determined my cornea cells were damaged 3+ layers deep. The physician numbed my eye, put me on pain relievers and antibiotics. I next saw my optometrist. He confirmed that my cornea was damaged, and concluded I had received chemical burns which damaged the outer layers of the corner and my vision was 20/100 vision. As the optometrist viewed my eye under a dye (blue is normal, green is scratched), my entire right eye glowed green. The eye has been swollen for the last two days and very sensitive to light. The pain was excruciating (magnify a scratch in your eye 100 times kind of excruciating). The good news is the cornea heals quickly and my vision should be back to normal after 3-4 days. The soap cleans well and is all natural according to the label, but all natural doesn't mean safe. Based on the damage to my eye and the risk of this happening to my family, this soap is gone and gets a thumb's down from me.
