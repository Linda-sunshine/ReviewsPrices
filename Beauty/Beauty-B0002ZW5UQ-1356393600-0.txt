review/summary: My heads been burning for two days nowreview/text: I'm a new user and after the first week, I'm was impressed beyond my wildest dreams,my hair looked full and natural and my confidence skyrocketed. Now after the first week and a half I noticed this burning on my scalp,I didn't notice any rash but it was uncomfortable,so I washed it out and I'm hoping that this feeling will disappear with a shower every night .their will be no more sleeping with this product on my scalp even though my hair looked amazing the next morning.has anyone else had this experience? Maybe it's because I used so much and slept with it on..I'm hoping that I can still use this product with evening showers to remove..
