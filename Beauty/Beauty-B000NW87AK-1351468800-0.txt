review/summary: Wife tested, husband approved!review/text: I was looking for a new scent to change things up. I've worn Amber Romance from Victoria's Secret for years and while my husband never complained about the scent, he never nuzzled up on me and told me how good I smelled. This is the kind of reaction I got with Egyptian Goddess. Yes!!I almost gave up on this little bottle of oil after a mere 2 wears, but luckily I came back on Amazon and read a few more reviews saying the bottle almost needs to breathe to really develop a good scent. By the fourth wearing, my husband was inhaling me! I've been with the man for 13 years (since I was a teenager!) and I can't recall him ever doing this, but it's exactly the reception I was looking for!!I don't fully care for the initial "spicy" scent when I first put it on, but as the oil soaks in, my body heat sort of makes it bloom. The scent almost seems to change every few hours, which is kind of fun! Is it going to be slightly floral, is it going to be a sultry musk? I don't know, but I like to be kept guessing!!
