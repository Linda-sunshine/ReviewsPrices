review/summary: Works as promisedreview/text: My daughter has been sucking her thumb religiously since birth. Now that she's almost 3, we needed to break her of the habit so she may have straight teeth. Our dentist recommended Mavala. After reading some of the other reviews, I was a bit concerned that the product would affect her eating habits. I didn't have to worry. The Mavala broke her of the thumb sucking in about a week. I am still pretty amazed. I thought it would take much longer to break her habit. I didn't notice any issues with her eating, although I can see how it might cause some concern with young children, since almost everything is finger food.
