review/summary: Should have bought 2!!!review/text: This is the most amazing product, I can't believe I didn't buy this sooner! It's surprising that a little sponge can make your face look so great, but it does. I use high end makeup brushes and I've never been 100% satisfied because it'll sometimes make my makeup look flakey. I don't know if it's because the sponge is damp when you use it or what, but it blends my foundation perfectly! And, it's good for getting under your eyes and in the corners. Great product! I will def be buying again once it's time for a new one!
