review/summary: Patchouli perfume oilreview/text: I love patchouli in general, but for whatever reason I'm not totally in love with the scent of this particular oil. That's not to say I dislike it, and I wear use this perfume oil regularly. I'm just not sure I would buy it again, maybe I will try a different scent. My only other complaint is that the color of the oil seems pretty dark, I'm sometimes worried it will rub off on light clothing.
