review/summary: Worth every penny...review/text: I purchased mine from Duane Reade. I've owned 2 of these masks...the first one lasted about 3 years, and the 2nd one is still in pretty good shape after almost 4 years. It's very comfortable, and the back strap is long enough to accommodate even bigger heads, without feeling like your head is in a wrench with some of these other sleep masks.
