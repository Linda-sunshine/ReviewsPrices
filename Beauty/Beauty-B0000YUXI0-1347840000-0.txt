review/summary: Amazing! Many uses!review/text: This product is amazing! My 7 year old was still sucking her thumb and both of us wanted it to stop. After reviews of Mavala on Amazon, I decided to give it a try. Within 3 days, she had stopped. We had to reapply on day 3 because the taste had faded. I can't even describe the bitter, chemical like taste it has, it's awful! It lingers in your mouth for several minutes until it is washed away by saliva. Be careful though, you may want your kids to wear a glove on the affected finger when they are eating since it seems to taint everything they handle with the hand that has the nail treatment on it. That is obviously why it is so effective. As a side note, my 19 month old was still pestering me to nurse her before bedtime, long after my milk supply had vanished. I couldn't even sit down with her on the couch without her pulling my shirt down or putting her hand on my breast. My daughter said, mommy, why don't you put the mavala on your boobie? So I tried it. It absorbs into the skin, isn't sticky like nail polish and yes, it is effective. I felt sorry for my toddler the first time she latched on and started gagging! ;) I told her the boob is yucky now, and she accepted this fact and fell asleep in my arms. The next night she was a little scared to nurse, but still wanted to. I let her latch on, and she again gagged and wanted nothing to do with nursing from that point on. I successfully quit nursing without much effort and pain for both of us! I am now giving my bottle of Mavala to my 7 year old daughter's best friend, who also wants to quit thumbsucking! Thank you, Thank you Mavala!Mavala Stop - Helps Cure Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking, 0.3-Fluid Ounce
