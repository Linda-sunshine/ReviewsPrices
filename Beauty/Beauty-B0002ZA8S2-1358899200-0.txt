review/summary: Pleasedreview/text: This is just what I was looking for. I was apprehensive because other reviews said it burned hair off, but I have no idea why that would happen. I have thicker hair, but still my straightener has a similar heat setting so I don't see why the heat would be too strong. Creates large, natural looking curls like I wanted. Great for longer hair and more natural looking curls.
