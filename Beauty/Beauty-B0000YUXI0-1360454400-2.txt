review/summary: It works only on the days that you use itreview/text: My son is 3,and has an extreme overbite,due to thumb sucking,so I needed to do something to get him to stop sucking his thumb.I tried socks,and tape,putting tape on his fingers and all that good stuff,and it didn't work.So,when I got this,it worked immediately.However,you can only use it once every two days.When I put it on his finger he would cringe when he tried to suck his thumbs so he stopped,but the next day he was at it again,and sucking the hell out of his fingers.So now his teeth are affected,his thumbs get really chapped and red,and sometimes he won't even take his thumb out to talk.I guess its that good!Hopefully,someone out there makes something that will work everyday,all day.
