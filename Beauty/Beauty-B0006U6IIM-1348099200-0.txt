review/summary: Lovely light moisturereview/text: I love sweet almond oil and the NOW foods brand. I find the price is very reasonable for the size. I have tried a few of the NOW brand oils and have been pleased with all of them. For almond oil specifically I like:- light oil that is quickly absorbed into skin- does not clog pores/cause facial breakouts- leaves a lovely dewy glow on skin- a small amount goes a long way (I use 2 drops for face and neck daily)- versatility for skin and hairI use this oil to bring back moisture in a facial mask, daily facial moisturizer and hair oil.
