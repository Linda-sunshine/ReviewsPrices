review/summary: What a Great Idea!review/text: My niece who is 5 has been biting her nails (hands and feet) since she was 1 and when I went to visit for a few weeks I figured I would stop her habit. I tried a product I found at a local Riteaid/CVS type store. That didn't work. Then I found this product and she stopped after about a day and a half! This stuff is bitter and nasty. You have to paint your nails with it twice a day so that it stays on there but once it's on the nail and it's dry, it does not come off. I even ordered it for my daughter as I've noticed she had started to bite one nail. Best product Out There!
