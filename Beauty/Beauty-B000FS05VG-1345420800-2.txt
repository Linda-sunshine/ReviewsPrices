review/summary: love itreview/text: I have very very long blonde thick hair so i always would buy expensive blow dryers thinking that they had to be the best bc they cost so much but i just got sick of them not working. My friend had this same Revlon Dryer i tried it and loved it worked so great i got one of my own. It has multiple settings for when you dry yr hair but doesn't damage it and best of all its light weight.
