review/summary: Lovely oil especially for natural hairreview/text: I swear by coconut oil and shea butter. I mix them together and use them all over my body. I also mix them for my husband and children. I had not used jojoba oil since I was a child and recently purchased this product to round out my carrier oil collection.Overall, I am sooo glad I purchased this. It is lighter than olive oil but smoother than coconut oil. It mixes well and is not heavy. Most importantly, it blends well with other oils and butters. It helps to preserve my curly ends and adds moisture to my homemade spritz sprays. This is one of the few oils with molecules small enough to enter the hair shaft or be absorbed into skin. I would definitely recommend this product to those looking to add a light, moisturizing oil to their regimen.
