review/summary: smells diferent then beforereview/text: iv'e purchased this product from other retailers before and have always been happy. this time it was not as musky, and the color was a lot clearer. not sure if they watered it down or changed the ingredients but the pathouli oil was not as strong of an earthy smell that it use to be. don't get me wrong, it's still a good price for a good item. I'm just not as sattisfied as i use to be when i got this oil. think i might look around for another brand next time
