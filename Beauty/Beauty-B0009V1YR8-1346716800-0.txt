review/summary: The Best for the Most Stubborn Hair!!review/text: I usually don't write reviews, but I felt compelled to write one for this one, yes, even with 2000+ reviews already.I have extremely thick and frizzy hair and I have tried everything, literally, from all kinds of hair product, conditioners, flat irons, hair dryers, brushes, even Japanese magic straightening perm (which took over 6 hours, because the hair was so stubborn!). Usually when I try to flat iron my hair, it takes so long and my arms get so tired that I end up giving up half way and just tying it in a ponytail -and I only have mid-length hair! Plus it wasn't too pleasant a sight to either see my hair smoking under the burning iron or the poor weak iron trying to heat it up but not doing much. Then I tried CHI. And my oh, my, was I blown away!! Not only was it able to straighten my hair easily, it did so while smoothing out the frizziness. I used to depend on luck on how my hair looks that day as it was so hard to style it, but now I don't have to worry about the uncertainty. The CHI is reliable, extremely effective, and does not damage the hair, either! There is really no need to go the salon and style it for $$$ when I, someone not particularly skilled, can make my hair smooth, sleek, and presentable at home with this iron. And I couldn't in my wildest dream thought I could say this! A WONDERFUL product, the best thing since sliced bread and a life savor, and I would highly, highly recommend it to anyone. If it was able to fix a crazy stubborn, frizzy, and thick hair like mine, I can't imagine it not working on most anyone's hair. Thumbs up!(And FYI, I had this for over a year now and it is in still an excellent condition as new and retains its high quality build.)
