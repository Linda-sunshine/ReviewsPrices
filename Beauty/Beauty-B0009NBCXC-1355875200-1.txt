review/summary: excellent product !review/text: I bought the 16 oz about a year ago and I still have about 1/2 bottle left -- I use this in making my own moisturizers -- This is my favorite base oil -- It is thick rich texture -- it mixes with other oils no problem -- I always have a batch mixed to use instead of those expensive moisturizers -- I was a little put off by the price when I first bought it but it has lasted a long time -- I bought some shea butter un processed and mixing these two together - or combine with other oils -- you can add 1 part of jojoba oil to 5 parts shea butter that is my combo -- add essential oils -- I really like lavender -- I use as a body cream and face moisturizer --
