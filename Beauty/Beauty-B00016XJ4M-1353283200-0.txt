review/summary: A great alternative to Proactive's toner.review/text: I have used Proactive for years, and wanted to find a less costly alternative. Since a main ingredient in the Proactive toner is witch hazel, I thought I'd try Thayer's. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I prefer this inexpensive alternative to the Proactive toner. This product is alcohol free (important with my sensitive skin), gentle, non-drying, and is a pleasure to put on my skin. I immediately noticed my skin was softer and smoother after the first use. I have been using it morning and night for weeks, and I love it. What shocked me most was that even after I washed my face thoroughly with a cleanser and wash cloth, I still removed dirt when I used the Thayer's on a cotton pad. My face is clear and my pores more refined, and I haven't even been having the occasional blemish I used to get. I firmly think that is because the Thayer's is removing oil and dirt from my skin that used to get left behind even after scrubbing. The light rose scent evaporates as soon as the toner dries, but it's very pleasant while it lasts. I will absolutely never be without this stuff.
