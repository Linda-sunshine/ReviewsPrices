review/summary: very happy!review/text: My hair stylist recommended I pick up a professional Hot Tools curling iron. Found this one for $26--very happy with it!! It came with spare springs, which I read the spring giving out is the main complaint about it. So I should be set for years of use. The tip is never hot...I only use it 15 min a day...so maybe it's different when left on all day. For the home user, this is an excellent product....wish I'd been told to buy a Hot Tools curling iron years ago!!!
