review/summary: Broke after 4 mos.review/text: Ordered CHI on Aug 18. Liked it very much, smoothed my hair efficiently. Until it broke on Dec 6 (4 mos. later). Amazon would not accept full return after Sept 24 (1 month later). Only option was to send product back to them, postage at my expense, for a partial refund. Four mos. of use for a $60 product. Tremendously dissatisfied.
