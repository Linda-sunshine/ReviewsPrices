review/summary: Hot and curlyreview/text: I was seeking a large curling iron so I could create soft, loose curls. I have the 1/2" Hot Tools Professional iron and after almost 10 years...it still works great. I was biased while shopping for a new iron and wanted to stick to with the Hot Tools products. This 1-1/2" iron works great and is very easy to use. The iron gets super hot fast, which is very helpful when you are short on time. Yes, it's a curling iron that can burn your hair...so people, you need to make sure you use a heat protection treatment before curling.
