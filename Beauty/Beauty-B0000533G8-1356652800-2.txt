review/summary: Good product!review/text: I love the Dr. Bronner's soaps. I have sensitive skin and get very dry skin during winter and have been on a search for a good soap. This soap lathers up and rinses clean with no residue. Dry itchy skin went away and we are using much less water too! The rose scent is very light and fades away as well as the lavendar which has a stronger smell to it but it also fades away. I have been using the tea tree oil bar soap on my face which is also helping with breakouts.The other side benefit is... it seems that the bathtub is not getting as much soap scum and is easier to keep clean. It's a win win... Less water, better results and a cleaner tub. I have been recommending these products to family and friends!
