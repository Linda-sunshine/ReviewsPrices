review/summary: 1-1/4 size created the Perfect wave for fine and long hairreview/text: First of all, the price is amazing but so is the quality! My hair is typically very straight and it holds a curl when I use this iron! It's lightweight and gets hot quickly! The 1-1/4 size created the Perfect wave for my long hair!
