review/summary: Ya Gotta Love Peppermin Folkst!!review/text: The peppermint oil combined with the castile soap is a great combination; my use for this soap is to repel rodents which HATE the smell of peppermint. It's easy to mix, spray, and does NOT stain and will not be harmful to your house pets. Best part is I can very easily tell when my younger nieces and nephews have washed their hands after going to the bathroom, and that's a real plus in flu season!!
