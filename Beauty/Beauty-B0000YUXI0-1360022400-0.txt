review/summary: Tastes disgusting - stops nail biting immediatelyreview/text: I am a nail biter and decided to try this product in a last ditch effort to stop the habit. The liquid tastes bitter and disgusting and is a constant reminder to stop biting my nails. Another unconsidered advantage is that I am constantly aware of putting my hands to my face, which is a good thing to avoid in cold and flu season. I highly recommend this product.
