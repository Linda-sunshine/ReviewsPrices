review/summary: DEFINITELY WORKS, but cautionreview/text: Exactly like nail polish, put a thin coat on the nail (as well as the surrounding skin), when you try and bite your nail, a really disgusting taste will STAY in your mouth, you'll want to wash it out with gasoline or old milk... hard to describe the taste, it's how I'd imagine french kissing the Queen of England would tastePROS-it works. seriously. I hate biting my nails now. It brings back memories of 'Nam, and I wasn't even born yet.CAUTION!CONS-you can't remove the taste from your nails right away, it'll slowly fade (usually gone by day 2 or 3, but you can reapply a fresh coat!), so if you're going to have any lady friends nibbling on your hands, you should probably warn them...-eating finger foods? not anymore. I had chicken pizza, touched the pizza with my Mavala-coated fingers, ate the pizza, and guess what I tasted. That's right.Queen Elizabeth II's tongue.
