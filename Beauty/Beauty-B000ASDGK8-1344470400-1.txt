review/summary: Love it!review/text: I am so happy with this purchase. I have had a T3 hair dryer for almost 10 years now...it does not compare at all to this one. I've been putting off buying a new hair dryer since my T3 cost me $150. This one dries over 50% faster. It's amazing. Makes my thick, coarse, curly hair almost straight. Drying time went from 25 minutes with the T3 to about 10-15 with this! I love it! I am so happy I made this purchase!
