review/summary: Wow! I think this is FINALLY the KEYreview/text: I have been trying to quit nail biting for over a decade. Everytime I about give up I look at my bloody cuticles & remember why. Before my wedding I sucessfully quit for 3 months by wearing gloves from morning to night. It wasnt a very easy task, daily things like cooking, cleaning, showers, you had to take them off and remember to put them on again. Tried this approach since & now with children it's impossible.A few years ago, I had several I thought to be good bouts of non-biting after reading this bookhttp://www.amazon.com/Stop-Your-Nailbiting-Gilbreth-Brown/dp/1412023645/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1352313041&sr;=1-2&keywords;=stop+nail+biting.I would still suggest this book as a great read on the insight of biting, made me realize its not as cut and dry as biting it's more of a OCD.People who don't understand call it a nervous habit asking; "what are you nervous about?" Really?! It might have started that way, IDK I was such a young child I have no idea, then it turns into a OCD, something you do non-consciencly. That's what the book said, and I agree, but I woudld go one step further and say.. I ENJOY IT! I like the constant busy work of it, the way the nails and cuticle feel when i chew them, the way feeling afterward when I know I smoothed out that hangnail. Then I look at my hands. They are BAD, it's no wonder either.----->Now to the product, after applying it less then 24 hours ago for the first time. At first I absent-mindedly put them in my mouth, this stuff in TERRIBLE! It takes any and all enjoyment out of this habit. Making you conscience of what you did & are doing with a lingering disgusting aftermath depending on how big of a hangnail you got. It tastes kinda like power steering fluid,(nail-biting is how power steering fluid ended up in my mouth, haha, the irony) I have taken a shower, done the dishes, & washed my hands at least 6 times; the stuff is still coating my nails with taste still there haunting me. I LOVE IT! I think this is finally the key! Because now I keep looking at my nails, knowing that the taste is not worth the bite. I'll let you know in a few months...Sorry such a long review
