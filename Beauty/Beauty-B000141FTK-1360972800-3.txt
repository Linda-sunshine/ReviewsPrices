review/summary: Organic Almond Castile Soapreview/text: I keep the Almond Castile Soap in my shower and have added a pumpthat I purchased in a Co-op (I think it is the pump sold for bottles of coffee flavoringsused at coffee stands) The Almond is soothing, relaxing and warm. Perfect forshowering before bed. I will never use those additive-heavy, chemical laden bath products again.
