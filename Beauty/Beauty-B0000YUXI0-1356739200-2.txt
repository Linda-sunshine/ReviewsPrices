review/summary: Taste horrible but worksreview/text: The point of this stuff is to taste horrible so you wont chew your nails. I have chewed mine for 27 years and for the first time in my life, I have nails. I was able to use this product for a few months and now have basically stopped chewing completely. I still do at times, but just re-apply some. The biggest complaint is if eating a sandwich of other &#34;finger&#34; type food, you end up tasting this when not even biting the nail.
