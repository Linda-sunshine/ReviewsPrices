review/summary: My favorite long hair brushreview/text: Until very recently I had long, thin, knotty, straight hair. This was my favorite brush, it was very massaging in the scalp and didn't pull at the tiny tangles like many others. It cleaned easily. The size is good and overall I was very happy with it. I went back and bought another to keep a spare in the car.
