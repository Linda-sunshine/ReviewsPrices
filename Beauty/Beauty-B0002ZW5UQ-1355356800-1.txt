review/summary: Blend away those thin areas of scalp with Toppik Hair Building Fibersreview/text: Toppik Hair Building Fibers really give the appearance having more hair. It blends in with the natural hair to cover thin and balding areas to make it look full. The fibers stick to the natural hair and washes out when the hair is washed. There is several colors to choose from which helps to find a shade that matches the natural hair. All you have to do is sprinkle the fibers on in the areas that it is needed, then spray hair to keep it in place. Wonderful product and I will be buying it again and recommending it to others.
