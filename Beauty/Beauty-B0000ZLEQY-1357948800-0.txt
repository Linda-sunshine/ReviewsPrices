review/summary: MMMMMM!!! Amazing smell!review/text: First, let me say I have terrible allergies to many perfumes. This scent doesn't bother me at all!! I have several of the sample size perfume oils from Auric Blends. I love to put on a swipe of the Vanilla Sandalwood and follow it up with a much smaller swipe of the amber patchouli oil. The combined scent is evocative of Arabic Incense perfumes. Amazing, and I get compliments constantly. Its warm, and rich and deep without being overpowering or cloying. The vanilla is subtle and truly smells of vanilla, vs. the odd smell that many perfumes try to pass of as "vanilla" scented. All in all, I love this perfume, by itself, or mingled with other scents!
