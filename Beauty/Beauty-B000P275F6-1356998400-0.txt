review/summary: Great smell, but wears off about 10 minutes after sprayreview/text: I have bought this from a retailer in the past and smelled great/long lasting. But this has a very weak scent, it staym with you for around 10 minutes and it wears off!! my gf told me that she can only perceive the scent when her nose is in direct contact with my skin.
