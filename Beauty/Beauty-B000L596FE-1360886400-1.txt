review/summary: Awesome Brush!!!review/text: I was a little skeptical about the claims this brush makes, but I was happily suprised. I usually have to use detangler before I brush, but with this brush I don't have too. I also have a 10 year old daughter who hates brushing her hair because of the tangles and she loves this brush too. No more fighting with her in the morning to brush her hair before school. I highly recommend this brush!!!!!
