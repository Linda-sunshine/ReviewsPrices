review/summary: Actually detangles...! Greatest brush, ever.review/text: I have medium long, wavy hair that has been color treated with highlights. My hair gets tangled so easily when it's wet. I usually have to use a lot (I mean a lot) of conditioner in the shower with a wide toothed comb, then some leave in conditioner/oil when I get out of the shower with a boar bristle brush that also has nylon pieces....even with all this, and the special brush - it hurts to brush out my hair and it somehow gets knots.Anyway - now that I have overly explained the state of my hair - I got it in the mail a few days ago and wasn't really expecting much. I mean, let's be honest - it looks like something out of an 80s jazzercise video; if anything it would be a cost effective replacement my other brush that's ready to be tossed.But...regardless of my skepticism - - it actually works. I mean really works. I didn't feel like it yanked on my hair when I was brushing it out, I felt like I could use less &#34;goop&#34; on my hair. I'm so impressed, I think I have to buy another one for my gym bag!If you have hair like mine, or a little girl that gets squeamish after a bath or shower as she sees you coming toward her tangled mop with a brush and detangling spray - - this product is for you. No more tears and fears. :)
