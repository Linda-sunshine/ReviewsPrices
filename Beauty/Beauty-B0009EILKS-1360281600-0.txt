review/summary: Actually used these for about 15 yearsreview/text: I started using these back in the mid-90's in while I was working in Tokyo. GF complained about my pores and told me to use them and honestly, works extremely well. They probably could use my strip as an advertisement and to be truthful, most users will get a small perverse pleasure from seeing all the dirt and oil formed in small stalactite formation. My gf would say it's gross but when she used it, she would always examine it like a jeweler and a prized diamond if I wasn't looking.There are ultra (super strength) versions of this in the light green box which I usually use but these seem to work maybe 90% as well. To be the most effective:-take a warm shower-wet the strip lightly-apply, press it to the nose and don't touch it for 15-20-hide in a discrete place so no eyes of judgment will see you especially if you're a dudeThe key to this working is opening the pores up first and making sure your skin and strip are moist. It's activated with water. I actually pour a little water on it and shake the excess off so when you apply it, it will slide a little bit.Use twice a week. Works better than any other method known to mankind for blackheads and cleaning pores. The only downside is it totally cleans your pores out so...sometimes makes them even more visible right after.If anybody I know is reading this, I deny everything.
