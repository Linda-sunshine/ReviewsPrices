review/summary: Truly Awful, Don't Buyreview/text: After doing some research on Amazon I decided to ask for this curling iron for Christmas on my amazon list. My sister got it for me. I used it 4 times. The second time, on the lowest setting, it FRIED my hair. It is truly frizzled/fried in places, which is very distressing. After talking to my stylist and buying some heat protective spray, I tried it again. It seemed OK for 2 more uses, then stopped working entirely. The power indicator light goes on, but it does not heat up AT ALL. This happened right before an important professional meeting I had to travel to, which I had to attend with flat hair.Re-reading the reviews I see that other people have had a similar if not identical experience. It is probably the worst product I've ever gotten. And I can't return it because it was a present plus I threw away the packaging. I recommend that you AVOID THIS PRODUCT. I will never buy a "Hot Tools" product again.
