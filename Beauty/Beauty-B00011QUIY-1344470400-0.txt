review/summary: Holds curls, easy to usereview/text: There are many things I love about this curling iron. The barrel is very smooth, thus making it easy to slide down the hair section. It is the only curling iron that is like that. The others feel rough on my fine hair. It gets hot and holds a curl in pretty well.
