review/summary: Great for dreadlocks... among many other things.review/text: I used to have dreadlocks and used this stuff every time I'd shower. My hair smelt (smelled?) great 100% of the time, and since tea tree oil is a natural fungicide, I didn't have to worry about anything growing in my dreads.As a matter of fact, I still have my dreads in a bag in my basement, and last time I opened it to look at them they STILL smelled great!Speaking of.. maybe I should toss those things out... one day.
