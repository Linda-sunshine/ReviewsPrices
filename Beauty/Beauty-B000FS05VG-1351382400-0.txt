review/summary: Nice Find!review/text: I bought this hairdryer over a week ago to replace an old mini-styler I had. So far it works great. Seems to dry my hair much quicker than my old dryer and the attachments are just want I need to go from curly to straight styles. I have medium-thick, very long hair. It's really nice how light weight the dryer is too because my hair gets exhausted with some other models trying to blow-out my hair.
