review/summary: I can't imagine using any other straightener!review/text: I have been using CHI brand straighteners for about 7 years now, and I can safely say that I'm never going back to using any other brand. I broke one by being a little too rough with the cord (never wrap it around the straightener!), but if I had treated it better I think I would still be using my first CHI today.These straighteners are pretty pricey, but the Amazon price is a better deal than you could find somewhere else, and you will certainly get your money's worth if you use it regularly.Over the years I have straightened a bunch of friends' hair, and every single one of them has raved about how much they loved it. I would say about 75% of them ended up buying one themselves afterwards. It has stood the test of a variety of difficult hair types with consistently beautiful results.
