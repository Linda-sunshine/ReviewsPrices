review/summary: Gets the job donereview/text: Overall great product for the price. The reviews about the dryer being heavy are true though. It is the heaviest dryer i've ever used but not to heavy to get the job done. It is also not very quiet. Dries my hair very nicely and get's it done faster than other cheaper dryers. For the price, this is a good deal.
