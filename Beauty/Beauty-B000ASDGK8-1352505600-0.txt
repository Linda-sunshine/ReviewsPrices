review/summary: Very strong airflowreview/text: I agree with the other reviewer about the super strong airflow on the low setting -yikes! If you're looking for that feature, this is the dryer for you. It is a good looking appliance: matte black with the soft touch plastic coating, solid, slightly heavy and well made, a real work horse. The motor is strong though a bit loud but that did not bother me.I bought this dryer because it has separate heat and air flow settings and wanted the same dryer my salon uses yet the airflow on the lowest setting is so forceful it's ridiculous. Makes it nearly impossible to dry/straighten my hair in sections (blows around everything in my bathroom that's not nailed down!) plus it dried the bejeezus out of my hair.The three heat settings are accurate and it has a great cool shot option. At first I thought my dryer was defective as the salon's dryer has a weaker airflow so you can zero in on drying a particular section. I waited too late to return it though. For the record I have normal, mid-length, very wavy, fine hair that is prone to frizz.
