review/summary: Pretty good for the pricereview/text: I got this hair dryer a few weeks ago because I wanted one with a concentrator, which this one does have, but it melted after the first use. I have a lot of hair and I think the plastic bit melted because I put it right against the hair and my round brush, so while it is still usable the quality is lacking. Other than that it is a good dryer it is pretty quiet and dries my hair quickly.
