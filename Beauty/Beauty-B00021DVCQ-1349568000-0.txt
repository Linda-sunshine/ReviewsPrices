review/summary: Best makeup EVER!review/text: This product is the best ever!!! I first tried BM when it came out because a friend who owned a salon decided to sell it and talked me into it. The shades available were quite limited at that time, and one major complaint I had against it was (being extremely fair-skinned with neutral undertones) was that it was either too pink or too yellow. I also began using it in the summer and felt like it melted down my face when I would sweat. I use Fairly Light original formulation with SPF now and it matches perfectly. I always use the Handy Buki which is great for around the nose and eyes and chin, and gives full coverage.I've got a lot of redness, am prone to breakouts and have combination skin. I started using Revlon Colorstay foundation for about 4 years, and noticed my skin was breaking out even more and I started getting cystic acne. And so the caking stage began!!!I rediscovered Bare Minerals again about 2 years ago. A friend of mine was a true "believer" and convinced me to try it again, this time using Prime Time and Illuminating mineral veil. What a huge difference it makes!!! Prime time is essential for making this foundation apply well and stay. It can settle into fine lines, dry spots and look hella ugly if you don't use Prime Time. All you need is one little tiny pump of it for your whole face and you will notice you use less product, buff more and you will have fantastic, healthy looking skin with a dewy natural finish. You must always exfoliate and use a nice light moisturizer like Bioelements Crucial Moisture.It beats the hell out of caking chemicals all over your face and risking ugly breakouts that are even harder to cover.Coverage is Med/full. Extremely buildable, lovely finish. YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!
