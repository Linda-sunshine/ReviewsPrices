review/summary: Saved hair time for my little girls!review/text: My daughters are 3 and 5 with very thick, curly, ethnic hair. They used to hate getting it combed and I hated them screaming through it! Not any more. This brush works on wet and dry hair and is extremely gentle yet does what a regular brush does. I want to give the creator of this brush some kind of parenting award! This is a must have for every parent!
