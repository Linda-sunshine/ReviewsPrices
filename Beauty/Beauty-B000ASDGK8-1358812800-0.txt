review/summary: Product stopped working after 6 monthsreview/text: I ordered this product through Amazon. It worked like I expected for 6 months and then one day it just wouldn't turn on anymore. I realize that blowdryers can sometimes be flaky but I feel like a $50 one should last more than 6 months. I contacted the manufacturer to replace it and they said that because I ordered it through Amazon they could not replace it for me. I couldn't find anywhere on the Amazon website to request a replacement. From what I understand, Amazon only replaces products that are brand new. So, needless to say I am a little disappointed with the quality of the product and the lack of product guarantee.
