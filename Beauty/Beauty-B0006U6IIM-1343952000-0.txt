review/summary: Perfectreview/text: This is great stuff for your skin and is really moisturizing. It is highly used in the massage business and is a great carrier oil. It does not have a smell and it's not supposed to, you add your own essential oil(s) to it if you wish to create scents (lavender, mint, etc.). I highly recommend this post-shaving especially the bikini line and for massage. Good price and great stuff.
