review/summary: Neither too drying nor too moisturizingreview/text: I FINALLY found an affordable toner that works to balance my skin without over-drying or over-moisturizing it. I have used "gentle/non-drying" toners before while trying to avoid the alcohol ingredient that is so common to freshening astringents only to find that instead, the toners would leave behind an emollient or sticky residue that I ended up having to wash off. This product falls into that fortunate "in between" group. It is perfect for me at this time of year when my oily skin needs just a little bit of help keeping the dry skin away yet it doesn't clog my pores or exacerbate oil production. Fortunately I have no problem tolerating the witch hazel (I don't notice it at all, really.) The size and price of the bottle make it very easy to afford. A whole bottle should last me a year. It is highly fragranced with a rose scent; but that's no surprise as it states it openly on the label. If you can't tolerate highly fragranced skincare products you might consider Thayer's Unscented toner.
