review/summary: Wonderful!review/text: This is my go to fragrance. I LOVE it. I feel like something is missing when I don't wear it. It calms me and helps me feel more centered. I put a little on my scarf and smell it through out the day. I live in NYC and it is so wonderful walking around smelling this lovely scent for a change.I hope they don't ever decide to not produce it anymore.
