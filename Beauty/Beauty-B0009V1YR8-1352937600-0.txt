review/summary: broke within 6 weeksreview/text: I really liked this flatiron UNTIL it broke on the 40th day after it arrived. As Amazon (and all internet sellers) is NOT an 'authorized' dealer of Farouk Chi products, the one year warranty is not applicable. AND after 30 days Amazon won't take it back for returns.I will have to buy it again at salon prices in order to get the warranty for the future.
