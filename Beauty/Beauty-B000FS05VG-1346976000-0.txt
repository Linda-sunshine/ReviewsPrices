review/summary: Great Hair Dryer at a Great Price!review/text: I must say I was skeptical about buying this hair dryer, but no more. For $20 it gets the job done beautifully. I have long curly and frizzy hair, and it normally takes me twenty minutes or more to dry my hair, but with this dryer it is done in 10 minutes. It also leave my hair feeling softer and much less frizzy that a normal dryer. I have only used it twice so far, but I am a happy customer. The only problem with this hair dryer is that the cord is about 10-12 inches too short, but I can deal with that for $20.
