review/summary: No horror stories here. Just a great productreview/text: I was a little concerned when I read the horror stories about this product, but it worked absolutely as advertised for us. Immediate results, and 3 weeks later the child is still not sucking fingers. My child didn't like the taste, but had not wild/far out reactions, it seemed to be the perfect level of motivation to stop sucking without going overboard. I told a friend about it and they used it for their child with similar results.
