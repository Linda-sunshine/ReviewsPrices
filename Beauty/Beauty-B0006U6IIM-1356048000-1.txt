review/summary: Delicious and smoothreview/text: I use this for body wash and shampoo. I've heard it is also a great moisturizer by itself for sensitive skin but that didn't work out for me. I tried it on my face a few times by itself and broke out. You definitely don't need to use much of it for any project. It spreads smoothly, smells great without being over powering and reminds me of sesame seed oil in cooking. I've made about four batches of 16 oz shampoo and three batches of 24oz bodywash with this oil and have yet to use half the bottle. A little goes a long way.
