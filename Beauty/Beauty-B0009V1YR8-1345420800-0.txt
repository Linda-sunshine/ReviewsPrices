review/summary: ONLY USED IT ONCE-DOESN'T WORK ANYMOREreview/text: This is the worst expecience ever!!! I got this product and I was so happy because I was purchasing a CHI flat iron for an excellent price...BE CAREFUL!!! it's not original (it's FAROUK CHI). I received it and I tought it looked cheap, then I checked the reviews and I felt so dissapointed (you should read before getting the product :s). It only worked once,never turned on again!!! If you buy this product "GOOD LUCK and say bye to your money"...By the way: you can get the real CHI at Walmart for $99 and you have 90 days to return it if you don't like it (it's really good)
