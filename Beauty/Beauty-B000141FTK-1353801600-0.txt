review/summary: Use it for so many thingsreview/text: We use this stuff for the base in our dish soap base, body wash, toothpaste, face wash, multi-cleaner, floor cleaner, etc, etc. Peppermint seems to always be the cheapest. It works really well for toothpaste with the peppermint, and adds a very fresh feeling in our other soaps.We haven't had great success in using it to cut serious grease, but such is the nature of castile soaps. Some day when I have time to do research, I want to look into the use of lye in its making and whether that is an issue. For now, we use it daily.
