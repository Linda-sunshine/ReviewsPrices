review/summary: Macadamia Magicreview/text: I have used this product for over a year and wouldn't want to be without it. It is truly help for my long, coarse, dry hair. I have tried many other products that are good but this is one I always have on hand. I love the scent and of course the way it makes my hair smooth and shiny. I dont need to use alot of product but do leave it on for a deep conditioning once a week for about 20 mins, longer if I have the time. I just ordered the larger size jar and I am very happy with the value for the amount of product you get. I also use their macadamia oil on my ends after blow drying. Great products.
