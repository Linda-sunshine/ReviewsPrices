review/summary: Worked great for 40 days...review/text: I bought this as a Christmas gift for my teenage daughter. After 6 weeks it stopped working. No physical damage, no smoke, no indication that anything was wrong...it just wouldn't turn on. Amazon won't take it back after only 30 DAYS and it doesn't have a manufacturer's warranty. I thought I was purchasing a genuine Chi product. I have my doubts. No manufacturer's warranty practically screams knock-off branding but I chose to ignore the warnings.Stay away!
