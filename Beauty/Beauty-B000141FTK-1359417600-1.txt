review/summary: the best-smells greatreview/text: this smells amazing.... I use it as soap,bodywash,and shampoo. i have used the unscented and peppermint but this is by far the best. it smells sweet and almondy ...almost like a cookie. my skin felt great afterwards, i didnt see the part about the hemp just bought it for the almond but all i can smell is the almond so it doesnt matter. i would definitely recommend this.
