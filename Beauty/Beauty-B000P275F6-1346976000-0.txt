review/summary: Long lasting. Better than Nautica Bluereview/text: I've tried Nautica blue, island voyage, and voyage.This is certainly better than Nautica Blue. It's very similar to island voyage. However, it certainly lasts a long time. It is a mellow fresh scent. It feels a lot more "real" than blue did. It's not the manliest thing around but it is a worthwhile upgrade to Nautica blue. The big bottle choice is actually massive compared to the one you find at wally world and so it is certainly a good deal. If I had to guess the small choice is actually the large option at wally world. I like it. Out of the three, I think this may hit the sweet spot by a small margin over island voyage for scent. What is interesting was that Blue was my everyday scent, and I think I probably won't go back to it.The bottle itself looks very well made and looks classy.My only complaint is that a little goes a long way with this one so you have to be careful with the amount you use per spray if you want to use more than a spray or two as it is potent.
