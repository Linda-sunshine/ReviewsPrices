review/summary: Good hair dryer, terrible delivery timereview/text: I love this hair dryer. My old dryer would leave my naturally curly hair frizzy and awful when I'd blow it straight, but this is a great machine. My hair now shines with the combination of this dryer and Kiehl's Smooth Silk Creme.Since I wasn't a regular hair dryer user when I ordered this, it didn't inconvenience me so much that this product took a little over a month to arrive. If you need this product, you'd probably be better off paying more plus shipping at Target than to buy from this vendor unless or until this vendor will address this problem.The reason I'm giving this four stars is that it's a great product. I don't feel it's reasonable to pan the product review just because of the service, so I only removed one star for the vendor.Buy the product, be weary of shipping times from this source.
