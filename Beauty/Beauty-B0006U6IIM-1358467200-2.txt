review/summary: got both sweet and bitter almond oil to get scent and moisture.review/text: Great feel, absorbs well on skin and hair. Left hair soft and my hair sheds less! Wish it smelled like traditional almond oil. But I found out that it's the bitter almond oil with the scent. The bitter isn't a moisturizing oil so I've bought both and added a free drops to my sweet almond oil to get the best of both worlds.
