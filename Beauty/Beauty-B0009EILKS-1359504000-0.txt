review/summary: Long-Time User Still Pleased with Resultsreview/text: I've been using these strips on and off for the past few years and have been immensely pleased with the results.Firstly, the product is simple to use and painless. Simply wet your nose, apply the strip, wait 15 min then remove. If you remove before the strip has hardened too much, removal should be painless. (Hardening to the point of painful removal usually happens if you wait longer than 15 min. I've been using this product for some time and have only once accidentally left it on too long so that removing was painful.)The best part is the results. This removes a lot of dirt from your pores upon your first use. If you use it regularly after that (such as weekly), you'll see a decrease in the amount of dirt in your pores.It's not often that I stick with a beauty product (lotion, shampoo, hair conditioner, etc.) for years at a time, but this is the one product that I always turn back to for deep cleaning my pores. I've found nothing better. Definitely recommended.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*
