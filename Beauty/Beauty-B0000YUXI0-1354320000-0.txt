review/summary: Didn't work for all my kidsreview/text: All my friends said this was THE product to stop thumb sucking. My three-year-old is a serious finger sucker. I put Mavala Stop on her fingernails and she just sucked on them anyway. She hated it, but she alternated between sucking her fingers and wiping her tongue on her shirt until the Mavala Stop finally wore off. I tried it for weeks and finally gave up because I was afraid it was bad for her. The only thing it did was prevent her from taking a nap during the day. However, it wasn't a total waste. It cured my 7-year-old son of nail-biting, but he refused to eat any kind of finger food during the process--no sandwiches, cookies, crackers, carrot sticks, etc., because it made the food taste bad. I tried it and it really is awful stuff. I was pleased with how quickly the nail biting was cured. This may be the best product on the market, but it doesn't work for everyone.
