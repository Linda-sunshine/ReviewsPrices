review/summary: 12-year nail biting habit, broken in 3 applicationsreview/text: I started biting my nails in high school, and seemingly nothing could get me to stop, despite my multiple attempts over the years. I only had to apply the Mavala Stop three times (it lasted about 2 days with each application) and the taste was SO. INCREDIBLY. VILE. that I haven't bitten a nail or cuticle since. (I am now 4 months free of nail biting!) I only wish that I had found out about this product years ago!
