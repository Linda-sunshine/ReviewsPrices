review/summary: CHINA GLAZEreview/text: China Glaze For Audreythe best nail polish ever. Colours are fabulous, dries quickly with up to date colours. Try . with the " fast forward" dryer and you will be good to go in no time. Stress free fast manicure. Better than lippman or opi with good price point allowing you more colours to buy with the extra cash you saved. Really can not say enough about this great great polish.
