review/summary: Not gross enoughreview/text: I'm a bit disappointed to find out this isn't as awful as many of the reviewers made it sound. However, I do think it might be enough of a deterrent to at least make me aware that I'm biting my nails. For me, it seems to be a subconscious habit as opposed to something I know I'm doing. I've been doing it for 25+ years and have half hazardously tried to stop several times to no avail.I think it's important to note that just using the nail polish to kick the habit probably isn't going to be enough. When I was younger my parents tried all these nasty polishes and I just kept trying until the bitter taste finally subsided. I was determined to keep biting so their efforts were never enough. It's important that the nail biter WANTS to quit. This is just a tool to help aid in reminding you to reach the goal of quitting. Using it without the true desire to stop will probably not be enough.This polish tastes similar to hand sanitizer but the chemical taste lingers for several minutes longer. A glass of water will make the taste disappear.This product IS shiny and not matte. However, after 2-3 days it will lose it's shine. For me, the taste sticks around well after a few days primarily because I have been making a conscious effort not to bite. It's been about a week and I think this product has helped but I still have quite a ways to go before I can say I've kicked the habit.
