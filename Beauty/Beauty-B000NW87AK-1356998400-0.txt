review/summary: Love this stuffreview/text: I have ordered several items from Auric Blends so far and have loved every one of them. Lover's Moon is my favorite so far. A light cool floral with staying power. As with all perfume oils, a little goes a long way. This is a great perfume for a great price. I hope they keep making them!
