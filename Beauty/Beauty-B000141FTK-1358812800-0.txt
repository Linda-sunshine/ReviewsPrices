review/summary: great product, cheaper elsewherereview/text: i found this at a local natural foods store and at whole foods cheaper than on amazon. it was cheaper, then appeared at a higher price in my cart. i hate that. i'm buying local. it's cheaper even with sales tax at home. not worth the price on amazon. but i love the soap. use it diluted 50-50 in soap dispenser, use to wash dishes. doesn't irritate my hands. all natural product. highly recommend it, but don't buy it on amazon unless you find it at a cheaper price, and be sure to check how the price changes after you click on it.
