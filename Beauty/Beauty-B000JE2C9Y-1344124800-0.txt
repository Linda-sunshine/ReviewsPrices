review/summary: Works great, great value!review/text: I love this mask. I just got it and tried it outside in the full summer sun. It worked fantastic and I fell asleep for a quick nap. It had a scent as described but it was not overwhelming to me as others described. I think it is already fading. I adjusted the Velcro straps to loosen the fit and there is no discomfort on my eyes, the straps on my ears, or on the back of head when resting on my back. The price is right. I'm glad I tried this mask first.
