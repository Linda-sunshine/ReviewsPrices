review/summary: great shampoo/body washreview/text: As a shampoo it's great, although my hair feels rubbery during the first lather after the second and a towel dry it feels really soft. If you have to shampoo regularly, every other day should be fine with this stuff.As a body wash it's great, the tingle is really noticeable...especially if you leave the lather in between your legs for too long it can get uncomfortably tingly so unless that's your thing, beware.It lasts a LOOOONG time. It's called magic because of how easily the oil lathers up, half a palm full should be enough to wash your hair and body easily.The smell is pretty strong compared to the others but I'm pretty sure it depends on the batch, the bottle I'm using now isn't overpowering but a lot of people have gotten bottles with too much peppermint
