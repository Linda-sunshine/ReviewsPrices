review/summary: It's Shimmery!review/text: I got this polish because I needed a nice grey, and this far exceeded my expectations! This is a beautiful light grey, and it has a very nice grey shimmer! The shimmer makes it very shiny and neat and it looks great with a glitter or something over it or on its own! China Glaze is my favorite brand and this did not dissapoint!
