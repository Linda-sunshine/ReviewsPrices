review/summary: Love this product!review/text: This is the second one I've purchased. My last one lasted several years before it stopped working. Works great on my hair- better than any other straightener I used. You do only have a 30 day warranty but mine lasted a very long the first time so I purchased it again. $50 is much less expensive than any other Chi I've seen. I definitely recommend!
