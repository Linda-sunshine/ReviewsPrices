review/summary: Does the job the first time aroundreview/text: I love Hot Tools. This is the 3rd Hot Tools curling iron I've purchased because I want curling irons in several sizes. It heats up quickly and does the job the first time around--no holding and counting. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a bit of curl in their hair or a lot.
