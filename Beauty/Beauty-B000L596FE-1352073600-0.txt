review/summary: Too gentle?review/text: Tried this for kids with waist length, thick and curly hair. Works best with wet hair with conditioner in it. But seems to penetrate only the top layer of the hair. Would be good for a child who gets really upset about having hair brushed as it gets the job done without pain but it WILL take longer.
