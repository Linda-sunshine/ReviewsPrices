review/summary: OK productreview/text: I finally decided to try the beauty blender, and although it does a great job of applying foundation for a natural finish, I just don't think it's worth the hype. I have a brush set that cost just as much as these brushes, and it does an amazing job of applying my foundation flawlessly. I feel like the Beauty Blender sucks up a lot of the product, and then it's hard to clean it out of the sponge. Then there's the issue of the dye from the sponge bleeding when you wash it.I used it a couple of times, and then decided to just go with my brushes. I will be giving the 2nd sponge to a close friend of mine.
