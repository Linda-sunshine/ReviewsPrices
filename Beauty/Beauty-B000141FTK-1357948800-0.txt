review/summary: I LOOOOOOOVE THIS STUFF!review/text: This is probably the best relaxing soap I have owned in years. I have the Dr. Bronner Peppermint Castile Soap which is great for the morning. It really helps wake you up with its tingly sensation. But there is nothing better then taking a hot shower before bed and using Dr. Bronner Lavender Castile Soap. Its very calming, has a great lavender scent, and leaves your skin feeling soft. I also use it on my face, dishes, and more. Its really an all purpose soap. They aren't joking when they say 18 uses, and more. I've also tried it in my hair. It is drying. There are some reviews out there where people say its not. They must have very oily skin/hair. Because I've found it to dry my hair. However, it does get all the oil out. After the gym Ill wash my hair with Bronner's soap first, then use my regular shampoo after. Then apply conditioner. Seems to be the best way to use it without drying your hair. I would defiantly get the 32 oz over any size. Seems to be the perfect size for multi uses. I've also price checked, and this was the best price I found anywhere.
