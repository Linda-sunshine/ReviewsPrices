review/summary: Buyer bewarereview/text: I thought I was buying a genuine CHI product. Not only has the CHI label worn off, but so has the ceramic on the flat iron. Originally it seemed to work wonderful, then as time went on, the ceramic plates looked different than my daughters who had bought CHI products, but they purchased from a different source. I realized to my great dismay, that the ceramic plates are only coated and very thinly! The on off button does not always function just adding to the whole negative. I now have to resort to my old Conair one and am so disappointed in this purchase. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone and also warn, buyer beware. Very sorry to have invested the money in this and now am not able to use it at all.
