review/summary: A good straightenerreview/text: This is my first ever hair straightener, so I didn't know what to expect from it. However, it was very easy to use right out of the box. The power button, and heat setting buttons are very much visible. Your settings are shown on the LCD screen. It was very easy to operate. I have short hair (shoulder length). I was able to straighten my hair in 10 minutes, which is awesome. I had thought that it would take me longer since it was my first time ever to use a straightening iron. I did read the manual before using it, so as to know different heat settings for wet/dry conditions.I do have one question though. The item description here says that it comes with 30 heat settings, but the manual just showed 3 settings (which just showed temperature range for each of them)1. dry/damaged hair,2 normal hair3. wet hair.Those, who have used this before, am I missing something here? Are there more settings that I don't know about? Did I get a wrong product?, which I doubt, because my iron looks exactly the same as shown in the pictures here.
