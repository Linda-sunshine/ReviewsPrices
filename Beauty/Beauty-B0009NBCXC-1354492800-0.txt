review/summary: The best!review/text: I can't say enough about this product, it replaces cleanser and moisturizer too. I add it to shampoo, conditioner, shower soap and use it on my cuticles and as a foot softener. Very gentle, it is I scented which is why I am able to use it, but it can be used with essential oils as a massage oil.
