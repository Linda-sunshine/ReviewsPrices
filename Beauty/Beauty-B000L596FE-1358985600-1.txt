review/summary: Great for curly hairreview/text: My daughter has long curly hair that tangles easily. She loves this brush, she only wants me to use it on her hair. We love that you can use it on wet hair and it does a pretty good job of getting out tangles. She took it with her to the pool everyday last summer, all the girls kept trying to beg her to let them borrow it. They ended up buying their own and they loved them. It is easy to use on curly hair, and does not make it frizzy. I highly recommend this brush.
