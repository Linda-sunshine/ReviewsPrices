review/summary: Lasted less than 2 yearsreview/text: This is a pretty good hair dryer. However, I'm giving it 3 stars for cord not lasting for more than 2 years. I blow dry my hair about 3x/week. I am mindful not to coil it up or bend it when storing, however, with my less than average use, it has met my expectations.
