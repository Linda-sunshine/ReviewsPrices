review/summary: So far, so good!review/text: I don't normally do reviews, but I've got a little time on my hands. lol. I received this blow dryer in the beginning of January 2013 and it has worked well for me so far. I haven't used the diffuser attachment yet, but I plan to in the future. I am a black woman and have natural hair. I do not blow dry my hair more than once a week. I also did not use the blow dryer when my hair was fully wet, only when damp.I really like the cool shot button!
