review/summary: Soothing Rose Petal Tonerreview/text: This Witch Hazel Toner with Rose Petal is soothing and refreshing during hot and dry Colorado days. Wonderful after dermabrasion treatments, as it cools, calms and heals the skin quickly and cleanly, without a residue. I put the toner in a spray bottle, keep it at bedside and find it refreshing before sleeping - face, neck, chest - even on the pillow.
