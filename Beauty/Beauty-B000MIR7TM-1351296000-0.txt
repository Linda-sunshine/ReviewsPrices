review/summary: I could never really get them cleanreview/text: Unfortunately, I didn't like these. The Beautyblenders applied my foundation well, but no better than the disposable round sponges I usually get. My main problem with the Beautyblenders was that I never really could get them clean (and they quickly became stained with foundation, which adds to the impression that they're not getting clean). And I'd go to use them the next morning and they'd still be a little damp - I worried bacteria was in them. Since I'm prone to acne and I have to be careful what comes into contact with my face, I've gone back to using disposable sponges. Also, I didn't care for whatever pink dye they used in these... it bled out of the Beautyblender every time I washed it.
