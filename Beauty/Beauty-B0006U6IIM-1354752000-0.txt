review/summary: My favorite facial moisturizer!review/text: I am 48 years old and have sensitive combination skin with mild rosacea and some early wrinkling around the eye area. I have to be careful with commercial lotions and creams because certain chemicals will cause dry patches, acne, itchiness and redness. I had used almond oil on my fingernails in the past to get rid of dry cuticles, but didn't realize at the time that I could use it anywhere! Originally bought it this time to make lip balm, then one night I thought, you know what? I think I'll try it on my face. It's fantastic! I only use 2-3 drops on freshly washed skin, applying extra around my eyes. It soaks right in with no greasiness. Very lightweight and mild. No miracles on my eye wrinkles yet after using for a couple of weeks, but my skin is soft and smooth with no fresh outbreaks of acne, bumps, or redness. My facial skin is comfortable and not itchy. The extra I rub into my hands and hair, although I prefer argan oil on my hair and olive oil (made into lotion) on my body, a little extra moisture can't hurt.
