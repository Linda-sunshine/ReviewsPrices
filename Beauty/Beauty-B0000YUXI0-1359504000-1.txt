review/summary: Worked great for my 3 year old!review/text: The dentist was putting pressure on us to help our 3 year old stop sucking his fingers. For a while we kept trying to remind him, but it never worked and he just felt bad. We were desperate and decided to try this. I got his buy-in prior to putting this on his fingers. We have been applying it for about 3 weeks now. We apply it after bath (3 nights per week) and it works great! It is just like clear nail polish; you cannot see it on his fingers. Every now and then he puts his finger subconsciously in his mouth, but removes it immediately. Yes I tried it....it tastes horrible! My son is very proud of his success. I highly recommend this product!
