review/summary: Excellent dryer at an excellent pricereview/text: With curly, thick hair in Florida summers, a burned out blow dryer is nothing short of a crisis. I had to shuffle through reviews in moments and place an order as soon as possible to recover. Out emerged the BaByliss. This product was exactly what I expected and better. Much lighter than my older dryer, warms up in an instant, nice matte finish that repels unsightly fingerprints, and power that can be wind tunnel strong or breezy light. The slide controls versus switch was also a huge savior, preventing the many times I would often shut off the dryer or change settings on other models. For the price, you simply can't beat it. It's definitely a keeper :)
