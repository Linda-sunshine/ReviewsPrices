review/summary: Effective maskreview/text: This is a solid mask. Used it on a redeye flight to sleep and it was very effective. The smell is bad, but it is so light you don't even notice it unless you put the mask up to your nose. While wearing it I didn't smell anything. The adjustable velcro fit is nice and the material is nice and soft. Much better than those masks that the airlines give out.
