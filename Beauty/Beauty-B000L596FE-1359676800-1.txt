review/summary: Unique brushreview/text: My hair is very thick and long, so I'm always worried about breakage and knots. The bristles on this brush are very soft and flexible, enabling it to glide through the hair easily. It's perfect for brushing conditioner through hair when you're washing it, and it does a great job detangling wet hair after washing it. Getting knots out of dry hair is a breeze. I've used wide toothed combs previously and now I primarily use this brush. FYI...get an extra one to keep in the shower.
