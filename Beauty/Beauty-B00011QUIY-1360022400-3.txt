review/summary: My Rating on Hot Tools HT1109 Midi Professional Curling Ironreview/text: i gave it 4 stars, because I do like the product. My hair is fine, and the product holds it in place while curling. It seems reasonably priced also. I have had two of these before, and they died on me before year-end. It does have a year warranty. The first one I did not return, but the last one I am returning, since I kept all the info on it. Hopefully Hot Tools will replace it; I'd like to have an extra on hand just in case this last purchase does the same thing.
