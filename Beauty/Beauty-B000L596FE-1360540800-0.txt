review/summary: makes my super curly haired son's life easierreview/text: he's got tight ringlets (not afro, but a caucasian equivalent!) and hair washing is always bad. this makes it easier. i shampoo, then get a glob of conditioner worked through and comb it out. this is the best i've found for gently untangling.
