review/summary: Love dr bronnersreview/text: I like dr bronner products....but after a long while i noticed when i use it as a body soap that it starts leaving a ring of scum in the shower- probably due to the oil base. I tried it in homemade coconut shampoo and only used on my scalp-but found it to be very drying.
