review/summary: Dangreview/text: Unfortunately I have to give this product 3 stars. After just a few days of using it I a big rash broke out on my face. I wanted to be sure that it was caused my the Witch Hazel so I stopped using it until they went away. Then, I started using it again and right away the big red rash came back. I've always had sensitive skin, so I suppose it's more my fault then the products. That's why I left it at 3 - for a neutral review.
