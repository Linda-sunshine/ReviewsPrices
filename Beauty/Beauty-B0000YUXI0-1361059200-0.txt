review/summary: Great for nail biting and thumb suckingreview/text: We had used this product in the past to stop thumb sucking and it worked just fine. Now our 7-year-old wanted help to stop biting her nails so we turned again to Mavala Stop. And it worked! It has been a week and she hasn't bitten her nails and is very proud of how they are growing.When we first put it on, she seemed to accidentally get it on everything - her food, her face, her lips - and the taste is bitter. But she learned how to avoid that and now it is working well.
