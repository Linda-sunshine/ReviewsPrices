review/summary: I Should have tried this sooner!!!!!review/text: I was so pleasantly surprised at just how well this product works. I had previously used Great Hair Days powder and the Toppik fibers blows it out of the water! I have severe thinning of my hair in the front, due to weight loss and am very self conscious about it. This product has restored my confidence! It is easy to learn to use and gives a very nice finished look, I Highly recommend it! I WILL be buying it again. Good Luck all :)
