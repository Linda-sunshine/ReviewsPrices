review/summary: Toppik Hair Building Fibersreview/text: I really like this product. Like a lot of women, if my hair isn't combed exactly right, in the back of my hair is a slight bald spot. When I use this product, it covers up the problem. The first time I used it I bought the blonde color, which allthough I'm blonde, didn't prove to be as successful as the light brown. The light brown seems to give me a better covering than the same color as my natural hair.
