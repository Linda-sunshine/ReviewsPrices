review/summary: works, bad bottle designreview/text: The liquid itself works great...but the liquid got around the bottle top a little as normal but mine adhered together and when finally loosened to open it actually broke the top and the liquid all dried up and it cannot be used now. I had use it maybe three or four times so it was full and waisted..And that also says not much had to be around the top for it to adhere itself.
