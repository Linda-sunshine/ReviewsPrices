review/summary: Tastes horrible!!!review/text: My son had a bad habbit of biting his nails. Once I put this on his nails for the first time, he about gagged when he bit his nails. The downside about this product is once you put it on your nails, you taste it when you eat food with your hands. My son stopped biting his nails for a while until I guess he got used to the taste. The polish chips off easily so you have to re-apply nightly. I put some on one of my nail and it tastes HORRIBLE!!! It gets the job done!
