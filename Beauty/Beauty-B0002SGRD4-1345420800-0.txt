review/summary: China Glaze Mint Polishreview/text: Product was shipped and received in a good amount of time. When I put this polish on, it didn't look like an actual mint color. It was more bluish but it's still alright. After 2 days, it started to chip pretty badly with a protective overcoat on top, so I had to remove it all.
