review/summary: Fantastic Value for a Great Hair Dryerreview/text: I purchased this after reading a bunch of reviews for this product on Amazon. Gotta say this is a top end Pro dryer for a fraction of the price. The feel is great, the finish on the product is fantastic. It has nice weight to it too. Definitely feels and looks like a high end pro level hair dryer. Its quiet yet very powerful and has setting from med, to high with settings from hot, warm and cold. You could easily pay three times as much for a hair dryer of this quality. My hat is off to BaBayliss for creating such a fine product. I know that this will last for years to come.
