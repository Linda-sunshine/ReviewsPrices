review/summary: Toppik Hair Building Fibersreview/text: I stumbled upon this product by accident on YouTube. After wearing wigs for several years I noticed my hair is very thin at the top. While waiting on biotin to work I figured I would give this a try. I saw videos on both (biotin & hair toppik) via YouTube. I spent about $15 including shipping and was pleasantly surprised by how well this covers the thin areas of my hair. At this price, it's worth a try. You won't be sorry!
