review/summary: I'm a male, and this solves it all.review/text: I was looking for a product to add to my hair that would give it shine, make it manageable, and overall, not affect my face. I was using another hair product that contained a lot of additional chemicals and my forehead was in constant breakout. My mother recommended Jojoba Oil and I gave it a shot. After reading reviews and product description, I gave it a whirl. From hair to all over my body, this stuff is amazing. I never felt so nourished before, like my skin was actually drinking this stuff. The first day I tried it I took an 8 hour train ride and the entire time, I just felt GOOD. My skin didnt have any reaction, in fact, I kinda had, and still have a glow immediately after application. I added a few drops of lavender oil for scent, and its even better. I apply after my shower, and even a little to my face before I shave as a pre conditioner. Give it a shot. It's natural, and you wont be disappointed. I would also recommend ordering some raw coco butter (I even add that to my hair as well) so you can switch it up every few days. Give your skin what it needs.
