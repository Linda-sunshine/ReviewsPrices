review/summary: Just as good as the really expensive one I used previouslyreview/text: I just got this, so hopefully it won't fall apart in a few days, but as of now it works great! I had a straightener that cost almost $100 previously, (my dog chewed through the cord on that one) and this one heats up faster, and display is great, much better than the more expensive one my dog killed. Also, it has an automatic off after 60 minutes which I like, because I am always wondering on my way to work if I remember to turn off the straightener.
