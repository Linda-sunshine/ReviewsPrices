review/summary: Amazing product!review/text: First of all this product can be used everywhere; on your hair, hands, feet, body, and probably in a skillet! I love the consistency most of all. A little goes a long way and there is no oily finish. If it is used to moisturize the body you feel very smooth and need little to no more after the first use. Also if it is used in hair it stays for a few days and slowly sinks in. The oil is even better when mixed with other oils such as olive and jojoba.Best time to use it would be after a refreshing shower! Bottom line: it's natural, it's healthy, it's perfect!
