review/summary: chronic nailbiterreview/text: I am a chronic biter for mg entire life. After purchasing mavala stop I started seeing my nails grow longer than I ever remembered! After about a month of not biting I stopped using it, and unfortunately the bad habit kicked in yet again. My advice to nailbiters is that this product DOES work. But dont believe the folks who claim it takes 30 days to break a habit. Get in the habit of slobbing this stuff all over your fingers for at least three months. Let your nails grow long and keep putting mavala on.
