review/summary: Not as good as it was years ago, but I still use it.review/text: I have been using Bronner's since 1972. Back then, it was about twice the strength it is today. Full strength would burn your eyes like gasoline. It was much better at removing oil based grime from skin. Several years ago, the hole in the cap was enlarged. I suppose this was done to increase profit. I have been using one of the older caps with the smaller hole for years. Some dishwashing liquid caps will fit, and actually dispense the soap more conservatively than the old caps. It is still a pretty good soap, just not as great as it once was.
