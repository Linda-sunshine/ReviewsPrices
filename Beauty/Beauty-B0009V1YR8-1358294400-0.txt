review/summary: Lasted 6 yearsreview/text: CHI has been around for several years. I did not purchase my CHI from Amazon, and would be hesitant to do so, since you cannot be sure of the authenticity. I am a licensed hairstylist and have owned this original black 1 inch ceramic CHI styling iron for over six years and has been working for a long time, as I take care of it, unplug it after use, try not to drop it or wrap the cord around it (BIG NO NO). The CHI is great. It works in one to two passes. I've used it on clients, who've had different hair types. It's worked for African-American hair, to Caucasian and Asian hair. I love that it doesn't damage the hair by getting overly hot (only goes to a set 392 degrees) and heats up quick and has even heat.After six years of use, my beloved CHI stopped getting as hot as it normally did, and I found myself going over the same section of hair to no avail. I remember when I first bought it, and I flat ironed a section, the newly ironed hair would be almost too hot to touch. Needless to say, the hair does not feel that hot to touch anymore (hoping this makes sense).I would rebuy a CHI in a heartbeat. My recommendation is to purchase one through an authorized dealer or beauty supply retail store. I would do your research and find out about the counterfeit products out there. They do exist, and often frequent the shelves of discount stores, and online. These counterfeit items claim to be the real thing, but often will damage your hair, break quickly and could even hurt you. A good quality (not the cheapo brands) flat iron with normal use should last at least two years. If you are hard on your iron, or drop it, even once, it could break the delicate implements inside.
