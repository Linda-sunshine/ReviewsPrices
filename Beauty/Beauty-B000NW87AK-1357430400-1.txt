review/summary: black coconutreview/text: Omg this scent is a disaster. It smells like coconut for about 3 seconds and then it just bitter. I don't even know how to describe it. Is it how coconut supposed to smell like? Because it gave me headache and i had to wash it away. I don't know about other scent but I'm warning you, DO NOT purchase the black coconut, uhgg.
