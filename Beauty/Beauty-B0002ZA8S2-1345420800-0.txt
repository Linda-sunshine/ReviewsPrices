review/summary: 12 Years of Amazing!review/text: I bought 2 of these irons about 12 years ago. They have gone through the ringer in use, moves, and traveling. Two days ago they finally broke...on the same day. The heating element never went out on either of them and remained equally as hot as the day I brought them home. I only had to replace the spring in one of them a few years ago(using the replacement spring that came with it.) How did they break? The end of the handle finally cracked and the cord came out. These irons are AMAZING! I have thick hair that normal curling irons don't really work on so it really was a tragedy when I was without my own away from home, even more so now that they are finally broken. The barrel is smooth and the spring is tight so it holds hair, even small pieces, wonderfully. My only complaint, which is really not much of a complaint at all, is that the numbers on the dial and the words were mostly gone at about the 8 year mark. By that time though I hadn't changed my heat settings and I knew which position was "off" and "on."
