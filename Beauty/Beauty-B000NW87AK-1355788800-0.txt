review/summary: divine opium perfume oil by auric blendsreview/text: This, Divine Opium, is a very lovely fragrance! Nice for Autumn & Winter. Auric Blends Fragrance Descriptions - Perfume Oils says, &#34;A spicy oriental, enhanced by cinnamon and pepper, with carnation, jasmine and rose supported by vanilla and patchouli.&#34; I have ordered this fragrance more than once, and have also tried several others too, with which I have been very pleased. And I love the roll-on form.
