review/summary: i would kill for this stuffreview/text: My hair is so much more healthier than I ever thought it could be again.I've used this product for about two months now, and just wow!! And! I have only used about an inch of the product. [Just to the top of the label, see image, applied at least once a week, saturating dry hair from the ends up, massage scalp].I have dyed my hair every which way, and it showed. My dead hair was so obvious with it's straw like frizz, or when I would run my fingers through the strands, they stood straight out like a broom. Not any more =D. My hair isn't so stiff from being over processed, with dying it dark, then bleaching it lighter only to repeat, repeat..repeat.The only other product that helped tame my hair was WEN. I absolutely love WEN. However, they've become too pricey for me, and now that I have more virgin[ish] hair, my new growth doesnt seem to like WEN [cleansing conditioner] as much as my damaged hair [I used Sweet Almond Mint].I'd love to go on and on about how freakin' awesome my hair is now from this, but you'll have to try it out yourself.
