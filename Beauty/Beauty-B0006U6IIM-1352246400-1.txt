review/summary: No CAP!!review/text: I ordered this from amazon so I could use the prime shipping which worked well, but... NO CAP! The safety seal is intact so it's not like I have oil leaking everywhere but as soon as I open it I'll have no way to close it. I'm going to try to find a cap from something else that will fit on the bottle but really, how inconvenient is that. How do you ship someone a bottle with no cap!?
