review/summary: use with foam dispenser!review/text: I bought this to use as hand soap, and like another reviewer suggested, you should mix this with water (1:5, soap to water) and use a foal dispenser. If you don't you end up wasting a lot of soap b/c the bottle just squirts out at you. i love the idea of using natural, non chemical products that are good for the environment and apart of a fare trade system!
