review/summary: Great Moisturizerreview/text: I have been dealing with some really dry skin lately and it seems like no lotion I buy is up to the challenge. I tried the almond oil and not only does it work, it gives my skin a nice natural glow. I have been getting more female attention since I started using it which is always a plus. I put it on before bed and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks great, I couldn't be happier. I would not recommend you put it on during the day, it takes a few hours, for me at least, to absorb into the skin if you don't want greasy looking skin. I haven't tried it for cooking but its oil so I'm sure it works fine :)
