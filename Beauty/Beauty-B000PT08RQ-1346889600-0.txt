review/summary: Very Good Straightenerreview/text: I have long very thick curly hair and I have found it near impossible to find a strightener that works well. This one did the trick perfect! I used it first on dry hair and it was so silky and smooth and this morning I used it on my wet hair, and although it did take me longer than I anticipated, based on other reviews, It did do a very nice job. I would def recommend this item.
