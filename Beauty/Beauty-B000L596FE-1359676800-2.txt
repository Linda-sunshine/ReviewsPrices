review/summary: Great, usually :)review/text: UPDATED: I was very politely contacted by Mr. Wet Brush to inform me of some recent manufacturing issues that led to my stinky brush. He very kindly offered to replace my brush, which was super customer service. (Good customer service always gets huge bonus points for me!) So good customer service combined with a good working product makes this a great brush. :)FIRST POST: First off, I will start by saying that we have one of these brushes, and I really do like it. It works great in my daughter's long hair. I sometimes like to use a more typical brush afterwards though because these bristles are so flexible, that they miss a spot or two. But overall, this is the best brush we've owned and I love it.However, we recently ordered a second one, and for some reason this one stinks so bad. It smells like used motor oil from China. Our last one didn't smell at all. But this one even transfers the smell onto your hands, and hasn't gone away with sitting out for weeks. So, if you can get a non-stinky one, this is a great brush. :)
