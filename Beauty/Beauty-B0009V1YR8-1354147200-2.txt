review/summary: Broke after 3 months!review/text: I received this item in mid-September, and over the Thanksgiving holiday it just stopped working -- I used it, unplugged it, and went back about 15 minutes later to touch a spot up and it was totally dead. I wish I'd taken the time to look at these reviews before I bought it -- I didn't even realize counterfeits were something to be concerned about. I have no idea if this one was or was not, but after contacting Farouk they informed me that the warranty isn't valid if I bought it from a non-authorized seller and most of the "Chi" products sold online are fakes. I totally agree with an earlier review...it's not worth saving $20 on this iron when there's no warranty to cover it if it breaks -- in my case, after less than 3 months!
