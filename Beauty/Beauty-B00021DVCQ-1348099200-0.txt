review/summary: Love it! Won't Use Anything Elsereview/text: I love this product. I am 35 with dry skin. I have started having more redness and an uneven skin tone in the past five years. I have never worn foundation regularly in my life. Every time I try a foundation, I hate it. Foundations tend to settle into the small lines around my eyes and forehead making me look older. Two days ago I decided to stop in Bare Escentuals and try their makeup. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Bare Minerals made my complexion more even and didn't settle into the lines on my face. My skin looks like it did when I was in my early 20's. It doesn't fade either and I can hardly tell it is there. I've also noticed that it has covered up small pimples to make them less noticable without looking like they are "covered up."If you do try this product it is important to follow the steps and make sure your skin is clean and moisturized. As with any product you may have an allergic reaction to something in it. I do have sensitive skin but nothing in this product seems to be irritating my skin. Try before you buy!
