review/summary: Cut my dry time by a third!review/text: I have really thick hair and it usually takes a several minutes to dry. This dryer significantly cut my dry time. Lots of air movement and the ionic feature really works. I agree with one of the other reviewers who said the buttons were awkwardly placed (hence only four stars). There's something not at an optimum there. Maybe if the on/off and temperature buttons were put in reverse order or moved so you didn't accidentally click a button while you were using the dryer? The other suggestion would be to insulate the barrel. I like to hold it when drying the back and you can't on this dryer as it gets way too hot. Still I love this dryer and would purchase again.
