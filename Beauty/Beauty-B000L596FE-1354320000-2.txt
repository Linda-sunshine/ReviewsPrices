review/summary: Was Sceptical but...review/text: Well when this brush arrived and i saw how it felt and looked i thought i wasted 8 dollars...my hair is thick and coarse...how the heck was this gonna work on my hair. So i gave it a try today and i must say, do not judge this brush....it de tangled my hair with minimal hair breakage....a must have for anyone with kinky/curly course hair...pair it with your favorite conditioner and get even better results...
