review/summary: Hair Dryer and Mini Space Heater in Winterreview/text: I seldom review products but this hair dryer is simply AWESOME! Forget about just drying hair with it because you can do so much more. In the fall my university's dorm management wants to cheapen out on gas and leave students surviving in their cold rooms AND they ban all space heaters so they can cut down on electricity bills and give themselves a higher salary for doing nothing. Guess what? I simply turn on my babyliss pro dryer for 2 hours and I get a warm toasty room. Been doing this for 3 years + hair drying and I've owned this baby for 8 years and still going strong!
