review/summary: It Works!review/text: Mavala Stop really works! My 6.5 year old would not stop biting her nails. After a few months of reminding her to stop and her continuing to do so, I decided to do something about it. It only took one day. She claimed it tasted so nasty that she had to drink water to get it out of her mouth. At any rate, it worked just like the reviews said and now I'm left with about $9.75 out of $10 worth of nail polish. :) I'm okay with that.
