review/summary: "A Total Scam!review/text: "I think where this started was a Bud Westmore Product used in Hollywood for years to give the impression of hair on face or head." Well it may work for someone on camera for a few minutes but to actually use this stuff for hours upon hours throughout the day or night in public is a total joke! It looks like dirt or heavy dust on your head. And its hard to come off.. then you use the hair spray, its like in my case medium brown glue on your head! Its awfull and I don't understand how many millions including myself overpay for this crap! And this brand is supposed to be the best. My Salon Owner laughed at me for using this so-called quick fix to a small balding spot I have. She told me that is was a "Scam" so you did not hear that from me. You can tell a mile away that you use this stuff. And god forbid you use for your hairline and it will start running down your forehead with just the slightest bead os sweat. Terrible product and the folks that make and sell it should be in jail!
