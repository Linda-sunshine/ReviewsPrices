review/summary: Works Wonders!review/text: This is an absolutely fabulous product that is worth the purchase. I am always skeptical because every blow dryer I've had always took FOREVER for me to dry my very thick, long and wavy hair and broke after about a year. 25 minutes was the norm. Now I dry my hair in 12 minutes with this dryer. As I said, I have thick hair that is probably about midway down my back and this thing is a monster! Very powerful. I was skeptical too at first because it didn't seem hot, but after the short dry time, I was hooked. BEST BLOWDRYER EVER! Don't be afraid to give it a try - I was very happy I did!
