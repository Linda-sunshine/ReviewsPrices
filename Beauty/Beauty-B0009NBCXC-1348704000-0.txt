review/summary: I like it!review/text: I have used the oil for about a week now. I use s few drops at night mixed with my serum and my skin looks dewy, and feels soft and supple-no breakouts-in fact I think my skin is less oily. I use a few drops on wet hair and I like the effect-my hair feels thicker and softer. I think this is a very good buy for an oil that is safe and effective for facial skin.
