review/summary: Fixed my little thumb suckers wagon....review/text: This product works. Our 4 year old is still a pretty heavy thumb sucker and also a nail biter. Got this on the recommendation of his Pre-K 4 teacher. It definitely put a stop to it. Unfortunately our 6 year old broke the bottle and our 4 year old regressed, so we are in the process of reordering. It is true what others say about transfer onto food so don't be liberal with it when you apply. I found myself on the receiving end by accident at one point and it definitely taste horrible.
