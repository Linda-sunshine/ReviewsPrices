review/summary: Dead after three months.review/text: I bought this for a friend. This iron lasted exactly 9 weeks, with one user, once a day.Amazon should stop allowing this product being sold. If they are genuine, they are not lasting like a genuine product. If they are counterfeits, they shouldn't be on Amazon. The warranty is only THIRTY days, and the manufacturer's warranty is void when purchased from Amazon.Not happy customer
