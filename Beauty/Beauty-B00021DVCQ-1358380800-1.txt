review/summary: Best Foundation, hands down.review/text: I absolutely love BareMinerals. After several years of using it, I can't imagine ever using anything else. It's lightweight but with heavy duty coverage. It's reasonably priced for how long it lasts. It's actually enjoyable to apply, unlike heavy liquid foundation, but it's never flaky like powder. Love.
