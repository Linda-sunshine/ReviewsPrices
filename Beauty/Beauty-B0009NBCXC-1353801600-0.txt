review/summary: Dry sensitive oily breakout prone? You'll love this... p.s. Toss other moisturizers..they're obsolete!review/text: It's amazing. I have sensitive, acne ( thankfully not severe but always present)prone skin. However, acne products dry my skin out terribly and cause reactions, while moisturizers clog my pores big time causing breakouts...enter jojoba oil! It's a miracle product for skin that's dry oily breakout prone sensitive. As long as you exfoliate with a sponge daily used with a mild foaming face wash ( sls free). Youll love this a few drops on damp skin after the shower....amazing. I should note I only use this in cold weatherr and as needed. For the body add a drop or two of your fave essential oil!
