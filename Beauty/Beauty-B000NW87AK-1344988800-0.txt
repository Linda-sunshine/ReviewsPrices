review/summary: Egyptian Goddeathreview/text: I was 100% disappointed by the aroma of Egyptian Goddess. I put it on and immediately wished I hadn't. It stayed on for 3 good days, and I showered each day. I have tried to give it away, but nobody wants it. Next week it will be making it's way to the great-grandmother, maybe she will like it. To sum it up very quickly: Do not buy this scent if you are under the age of 75; it smells like old lady, exactly. Pretty much the same reason I cannot give it away.I would give 1 star, but I don't want to trash the entire Auric Blends line. Their Patchouli blend is awesome and I love that. Not sure what happened with the Egyptian Goddess, but pee-yew! I'd like to try their other scents, but now I am not sure I should stray from the patchouli.
