review/summary: Didn't last 2 yearsreview/text: I chose to buy this hair dryer because of the great reviews and comparability to the T3. I didn't like how the hot setting was too hot and the warm setting was not hot enough. I've had this hair dryer for less than 2 years (purchased in May of 2011) and it just broke--it won't turn on anymore. I've had cheaper hair dryers last 10+ years! Would not purchase again. :/
