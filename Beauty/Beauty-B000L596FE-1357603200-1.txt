review/summary: The Tangle Teezer works better for mereview/text: I have long, fine, wavy hair, and this dry winter weather has been causing some serious knots and tangles. I bought this a few months back, but it hasn't worked too well for me. It has a hard time getting through my knots, even when I use it with wet hair that is slathered with conditioner or de-tangler.I've since picked up aTangle Teezer Brush Original Professional Detangling Hairbrush Pearl Blue, and that works much better for me. You might find the Tangle Teezer to be better, too, if you also have fine hair.
