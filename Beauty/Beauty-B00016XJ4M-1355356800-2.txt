review/summary: I love this stuff.review/text: I'm working on revamping my face care routine and thought I would give this a try. I really love it. Its nice when you don't want an astringent/toner that feels like it is burning your face off. The smell is pleasant and old-fashioned. Sometimes to give it a little more oomph I add a drop of tea tree oil on the cotton and it works great.
