review/summary: Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips - The Key Word Is Deep.review/text: I used a Biore Deep Cleaning Pore Strip as a lark. Given my fastidious cleansing regime, I knew there was little chance of it removing any dirt from my nose. Wrong! I pulled the strip off and (ewwww!) it was striped with little spikes of dirt. Enough said. Add Biore Strips to your cleansing regime too if you want to be sure you're getting EVERYTHING.
