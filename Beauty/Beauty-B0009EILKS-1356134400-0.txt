review/summary: Not as good as the Ultra cleansing strips!review/text: I've been a blackhead sufferer since high school (I'm in my early 20s now) and I've used scrubs, pore strips etc. and Biore pore strips tend to do a great job with unclogging my pores of blackheads.This pack does a good job, but often times, the sticky strip would rip as I gently remove the plastic and doesn't dry as well as I would like.It also doesn't pick up as much as I would like the strips to too.I've tried the green and pink Biore strip packaging (the Ultra deep cleansing strips I believe they're called )before, and I must say, I prefer those over these.It's still better than nothing, but I like feeling cleaner in one go, rather than using two strips to feel ultimately clean.The service and packaging was decent though for standard shipping :)
