review/summary: This is really a great buyreview/text: I am a beginner using hair dryer. I moved to US one year back , and in India natural weather is enough for fast drying [ except for winters ] , but after moving to San Francisco, which remains foggy mostly around the year , i needed a dryer. I simply love this one , and how quickly it dries my hair. And also it leaves my hair soft and silky instead of dry and rough. I use the cold shot at the end to diffuse any static ions.
