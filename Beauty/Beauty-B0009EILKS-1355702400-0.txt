review/summary: I like it But I'm not any prettier now.review/text: I thought if I start using all these girly products that I would magically just get prettier, and it's been like 4 months and I'm still the same. What gives? Sure my nose has less noticable pores now, but I ain't got noboday loving on me cuz of it.They work well nad make me feel pretty even if I still look (relatively) the same
