review/summary: Not a great value for 4 months of use!review/text: Bought this based on reviews, so I thought I would submit my expierence. I purchased this in April, received it in May, and it wouldn't turn on in November. I am not hard on my items, and used this gently. I can't return it under the warranty because Amazon is not an authorized dealer. Do yourself a favor, and buy something else.
