review/summary: Beware!!!review/text: I LOVE Bare Minerals Original Foundation and give it 5 stars.. I am rating this with 1 star because I believe it is a knock off or a fake. I'd actually give it 0 stars if that was an option. I have been using Bare Minerals Original Foundation Medium Beige for nearly seven years now... What I received is NOT the original foundation. What I received is more like a tinted mineral veil. It has a shimmer to it which the original foundation is not supposed to have. The coverage was not that of the original foundation but more of the mineral veil. Be careful who you buy from. Before I bought this from this seller, I always got it from Sephora. Lesson learned! I will never order from anywhere else again.
