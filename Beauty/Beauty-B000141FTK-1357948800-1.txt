review/summary: For the whole familyreview/text: Love this soap. I use it in foaming hand soap dispensers at each sink, in dispensers in the showers, and the whole family from the toddler on up uses this soap. It has a lovely, subtle scent. I love Dr. Bronner's soaps because they don't add any artificial, cancer-causing, endocrine-disrupting bad ingredients like most brands.
