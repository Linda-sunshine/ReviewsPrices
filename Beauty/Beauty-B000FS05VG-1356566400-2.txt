review/summary: Super fast, Super cheap, Super efficientreview/text: I am really impressed with this blow dryer so far. I stopped going to a hair stylist because it started to become expensive and started doing my own hair. But some of my products required heat and I was not impressed with other reviews for box hair dryers or hair dryers you literally pay an arm and a leg for. So I did some research and found a hair bonnet to attach to a blow dryer and this is the best dryer I have ever had and it gets the job done. It drys my hair super fast, an hour and thirty minutes to be precise. I used to use a box hair dryer and those things took the entire day to dry my hair and then it still was not dry. This dryer is perfect. It is high powered, its fast, super hot (a little too hot but that is okay). All I can say is that it is perfect. I do not ask for much and this dryer does not give me anything extra except the capability to dry my hair fast. And that is what I love about it. And it does not hurt that it is not an expensive dryer.
