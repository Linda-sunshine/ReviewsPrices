review/summary: Worth the Moneyreview/text: I was skeptical to spend the money on this product because I have a set of make-up brushes but so many people said this is one thing you definitely need! So I bought it and couldn't be more satisfied! It works great and I have used it everyday! It is great for applying liquid foundation or blending out messes like too much foundation or too much blush! I would definitely say that all those people who told me to get this were definitely right! If you don't have one, you are missing out.
