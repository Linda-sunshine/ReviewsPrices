review/summary: Works wonders on my long hairreview/text: I have long, thick hair and after showering it can take up to an hour for my hair to dry (sometimes longer), blow drying makes my hair frizzy and wringing it with a towel damages it. This hair straightening iron works wonders, with it my hair can be dried and styled in less than 10 minutes. Highly recommend!
