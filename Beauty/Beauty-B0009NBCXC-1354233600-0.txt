review/summary: Great product.review/text: Used this oil in conjunction with others in homemade lotions, creams, balms, and lip balms . The color is very golden but that doesn't affect the way my products looked- my lotions and creams were still white.Jojoba oil is really moisturizing and very shelf stable so my products last well (I also use a preservative though). The price is way cheaper than Whole Foods and it showed up pretty quickly.
