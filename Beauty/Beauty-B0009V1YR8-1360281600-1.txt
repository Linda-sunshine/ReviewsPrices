review/summary: VERY DISAPPOINTED..review/text: i AM VERY DISAPPOINTED wit this product, it doesn't work and appears to have faulty wiring. You have to wiggle the cord to get it to work. This is a faulty product and I would never recommend to anyone. Its too lt's to get a refund as it was a Christmas gift and the allowed time has expired. I'm left with the option of a partial refund plus shipping or to repair the faulty product myself. Very unhappy!!!
