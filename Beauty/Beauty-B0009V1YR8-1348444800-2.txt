review/summary: I love this straightener.review/text: I got this straighter a few weeks ago and I love it. I only had 5 minutes to straighten my hair this morning, and this iron did it in no time! I have very long, thick hair with some wave. I am so impressed with this iron! It doesn'y kink my hair or pull any strands. It's also great to do beachy waves. It is so worth $50!
