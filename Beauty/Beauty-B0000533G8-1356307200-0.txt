review/summary: Not like the old days........review/text: I saw a lot of reviews about how people remember a thicker Dr. Bronners product; you are right to recall that it used to be quite thick! I first used this 20 years ago, and recently bought a gallon off of Amazon because it was cheaper than a local store. When I received it, my first reaction was to have a fit. It wasn't thick like I remember, at all. I was pretty upset about that.Before I cried "fake, watered down", I went to the local store to see for myself what was going on. The Dr. Bronner gallons in the health food store were the same as the gallon of product I bought on Amazon. My suspicion is that the manufacturer has tinkered with their product. I don't want to say watered it down, who knows what they have done to it. But it's not the thick stuff of the old days, and if you remember the old days, it was a great product then.Having said that, it still works as part of my natural soft scrub recipe and that's what matters to me. I have much thicker castile soap products here that I bought at our health food store, but I paid almost twice as much for them as I did the Dr. Bronner product. (shrug)
