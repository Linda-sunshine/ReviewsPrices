review/summary: Swear By the Stuff!review/text: Almond Oil is simply amazing! It has rejuvenated my skin in ways I did not know possible. I love how affordable it is, plus it's all natural so I don't have to worry about any damage to my skin or side effects down the line. A quick dab spread on my face, hands, or feet in the morning keeps me going all day! The only thing better is combining it with coconut oil!Coconut oil keeps moisture trapped even longer which I love. My skin stays silky without looking for feeling greasy. You can even get the almond and coconut oil in a package together which I do to save time and money- (NOW Foods Sweet Almond Oil - 16 oz. + FREE 100% Cococare Coconut Oil - 4 fl oz). It's only a couple bucks more, but mixing them makes the staying power better and obviously spreads out the 'dosage' a little. My skin has never felt so consistently soft and smooth as it has since I started using these products.
