review/summary: Nice, for something different...review/text: I tried this as a tester in a local health store. I was almost out to the car when my husband smelled it, and asked if I would go back in and buy it. It is different.... It has an interesting "familiar" scent ~ it reminds me of something from childhood and brings back a happy feeling in me. I have gotten compliments on it, and I NEVER have received compliments on a scent before. It is inexpensive enough to try it, if you want something different! Lasts forever, too, because you use so little.
