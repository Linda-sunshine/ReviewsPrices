review/summary: #1 Curling Iron!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!review/text: I received my curling iron this week and even though I've only used it for a few days, I am loving it! I bought the Hot Tools Professional Curling Iron 1 1/2" barrel, which is the perfect size for larger curls and adding body to your hair. I've used Conair brand, same size barrel for over 10 years and every time I had to buy a new one, it was because the spring on them always gave out, the heat was always fine. This time I decided I was going to try a new brand, since I wanted a longer lasting one and being a big fan of Amazon, I done my research and this is the one I went for based on the mixed reviews and the awesome price.Here are some PROS:** VERY HOT at the highest heat (For thick fine straight hair such as mine I need the hottest setting, and the curls feel so soft when done using it and adds nice body).** Cord length is perfect, longer than Conair.** Barrel thumb holder at the end is awesome, Conair doesn't have this feature to stick your finger in to hold the end of the barrel.** End of the barrel holder is longer and helps not to burn delicate fingers.** Swivel cord is very helpful.** Definitely start at a low temperature and move the dial forward as you need to for the temperature setting you like.** Hand grip is soft and comfortable.********* The BONUS: 2 extra springs (Comes with directions of how to install them, with black and white step-by-stem photo process, seems easy). Now this makes having this curling a MUST for long term, especially when the spring is the first to go. Plus, the directions come with a mailer if you want to buy more springs at a rate of about $2.00 per spring (If you absolutely want more).OVERALL: For the price of this curling iron and the 2 additional springs that come with it, long term seems indefinite and it is an EXCELLENT DEAL!! Only question is how long does the temperature dial button, on/off switch, and heating element go out? That is the only question that arises when using this for years down the road...Here are some CONS:** The location of the temperature button on the left side and the on/off switch on the right side take some getting used to for your fingers if your new to Hot Tools. It can be easy to turn on/off with your finger, which could cause some problems. Takes time to get used to having an on/off slider switch.** The power indicator light is on the left side, where the temperature control dial is. The power light indicator is a light orange color, it's not that bright to signify the power is on.** ONLY DOWNSIDE: The power light indicator stays a solid orange, does NOT signify when the curling iron is ready to use at your select temperature setting. The directions says it takes 60 seconds to heat up, but the power light indicator does not show the time it's taking to heat up. As a previous Conair user it was very handy to see when the curling iron was ready to use because the power light quit blinking to signify to the user that it was ready to use.**** Recommendation: A different power light indicator would benefit this curling iron, perhaps a better location at the top, in between the temperature dial and on/off power slide switch, a brighter light to indicate power, and some sort of blinking motion for the indicator power light to let the user know that it is ready and hot enough to use. A different on/off switch could help as well.Best wishes to any new Hot Tools curling iron users, I hope this review helps you to decide and ENJOY! :-)
