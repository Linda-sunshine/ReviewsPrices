review/summary: Replaced my conditionerreview/text: Bought this item from CLLOF BEAUTY and they were very quick to send and gracious about a problem I had with shipping. This mask makes my hair so soft and smell so good. Typically my hair is dry and brittle at the ends when it gets too long but this mask solves the problem. I use it every other day.
