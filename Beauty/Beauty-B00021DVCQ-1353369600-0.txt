review/summary: Bare Minerals is the Best Mineral Makeupreview/text: I have used Bare Minerals since it hit the market and it is by far the best mineral makeup on the market.I have tried several other mineral makeups only to be disappointed. If I had tried them first I probably would not be using mineral makeup.It does take a little practice when you first start using the mineral makeup, but it is worth the time spent practicing in the beginning. It takes much less makeup and that was hard to get used to. I didnt "feel" it on my skin like I did with the liquid and that was hard to get used too also. (I didnt feel made up) I learned to trust what I saw instead of what I felt and got used to the fact that it takes a lot less time to apply it than liquid.With Bare Minerals it goes on silky smooth and covers beautifully, looks natural, and it does not rub off onto your clothing! It goes on so quick I can do my makeup in a fraction of the time it took when I used liquid makeup. Plus when you look in the mirror it just looks like I have good skin instead of seeing the makeup on my skin.The new sifter bottle case it great. The minerals are so fine it is hard to keep from spilling using the older bottles.
