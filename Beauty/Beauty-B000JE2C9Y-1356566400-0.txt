review/summary: Comfy on eyes, torturous on earsreview/text: The mask is nice, soft and smooth, but the strap that goes around your head is a cheap band that is painful on your ears. I tried to remedy this issue by placing the band higher above my ears but then it just falls off while I'm asleep and ironically wakes me up. Find a mask that that has a nice strap!
