review/summary: Love this Fragrance!review/text: Egyptian Goddess has been one of my FAVORITE fragrance oils ever. I used to wear it years ago, before I had children. Then a few weeks a go I recalled the product, looked it up and had to have it. It brought back a lot of memories, and it smells amazing. Not a strong smell, it's plesant and not offensive to others. It's the perfect touch to wear everyday!
