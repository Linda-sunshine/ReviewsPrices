review/summary: Makes a nice aftershavereview/text: I use this as a cooling aftershave. The smell is a bit floral/feminine but it fades quickly and I personally enjoy it. I've found it helps minimize irritation, especially on my neck and has also eliminated my very mild and infrequent acne spots on my forehead. I don't use cotton pads or anything. I just dump it in my hands and splash it on. I also use a quick squirt here and there around the bathroom to freshen the scent of the room.
