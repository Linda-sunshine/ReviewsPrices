review/summary: macadamia oil deep repair maskreview/text: i had heard this product was a miracle for hair but i found that it didnt do much for mine at the first time of use. but as i progressively used it i did start to notice a change in my hair it went from dry and crunchy to soft and smooth. except i went from 2 time per week to 4 times a week instead during shower since my hair was extremely damaged and 2 times per week wasnt helping my hair enough. all in all it does help your hair sooooooooooooooooooooooooo much to return it to health it just takes its time to work its magic and please ladies just be patient it will give you results.
