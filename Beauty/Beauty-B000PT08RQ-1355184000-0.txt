review/summary: LOVE THIS!review/text: Have had this a couple months now and I just love it! My hair is on the thicker side and has natural curl to it so it often does it's own &#34;thing&#34;. A few swipes with this iron and I am good to go. I have only used it on dry hair at this point only because I haven't taken the time to read the instructions on how to use it on wet hair.
