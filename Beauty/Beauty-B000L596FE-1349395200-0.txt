review/summary: Love it!review/text: The wet brush is fantastic! My daughter used to yell and scream when having her hair combed out after a shower until I found this brush. It glides through wet hair very easily and makes brushing tangled morning hair a breeze as well. It's the only brush my daughter will use. Will be buying more.
