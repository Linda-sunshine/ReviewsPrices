review/summary: Finally!review/text: Finally a product was strong enough to break the will of a stubborn 7 year-old with a 5 year habit of biting nails!!!! Tried the weaker versions at major drugstores and multiple other ideas with no success. Co-worker recommended this and added idea I read off another Amazon review for a shopping trip (x5) for nails getting long enough to trim. We are 3 shopping trips in and I couldn't be happier to spend the $$$. She has no desire the bite her nails. The stuff is nasty. Must be applied at least every other day. Finger foods are out as long as it is on.
