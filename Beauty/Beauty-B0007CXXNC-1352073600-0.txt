review/summary: Smells amazingreview/text: I have spent alot of money on hair products because my hair is dry and I constantly blowdry & iron my hair. If I don't use this product after I shower, I probably wouldn't have much hair. It smells amazing and works!After I shampoo and condition my hair, I towel-dry my hair and put the masque for 1-2 hours. I then wash my hair with warm water and it feels amazing. I get compliments all the time on how good my hair smells and looks. It does not make your hair oily but it gives it a nice shine. I've been using this product for over 3 years and can't get enough of it. Must buy!
