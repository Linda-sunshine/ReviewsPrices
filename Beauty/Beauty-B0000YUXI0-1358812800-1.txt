review/summary: Worked with one application!review/text: My son is 3.5 and has been sucking his thumb since birth. His dentist noticed some changes starting and recommended we get him to stop as soon as possible. We bought and applied the Mavala Stop one day and he made the mistake of trying to suck his thumb twice that day--immediately asked for water after! He never sucked his thumb again and we didn't even re-apply it! A few days after he tasted the Mavala Stop, he mentioned something about missing his thumb and wondered when he could suck it again. We told him he was all grown up and didn't need it anymore. We thought we might need to re-apply, but never did!
