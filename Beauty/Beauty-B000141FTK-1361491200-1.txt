review/summary: My favorite scent!review/text: The citrus scent is my favorite by far! I use Dr. Bronners for just about everything, My favorite this to use it an all purpose spray I make with 32 oz of water, 2 tsp Dr. Bronners and 2 tsp Borax (sold at walmart and other grocery stores in the laundry isle). It cleans like a dream! Gets a grimy stove clean with hardly any scrubbing!
