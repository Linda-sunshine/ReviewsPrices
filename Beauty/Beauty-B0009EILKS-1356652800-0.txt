review/summary: Doesn't work too well.review/text: Maybe I'm using it wrong, but it's hard to use and kind of annoying. I tried using it after shower, after steam-toweling my face, and nothing seems to really help. I used up the whole pack without getting any real results. Kiehl's Rare Earth Deep Pore Cleansing Masque works a lot better and easier for me, as well as being a more economical choice (that batch lasts forever!) Also, you really can't use the strips for other parts of your face, unlike with the mask. If you aren't already used to this, I'd say go the other route and get a pore cleansing mask or lotion or some other product that works better.
