review/summary: Better than the competitionreview/text: While this cannot perform miracles, compared to my previous brush it gets more tangles less painfully and more quickly. Not only that, but it is completely waterproof and it is extremely cheap. For this price range there is no better. Only problem is that some of the tines are not as well made as the others, but this does not noticeably impact the effectiveness of the brush nor are imperfections rough or likely to damage or catch hair. Got a nice bright pink color.
