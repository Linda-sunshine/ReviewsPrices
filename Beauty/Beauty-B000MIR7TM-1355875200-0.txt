review/summary: Help for the inept, revisited.review/text: This is another product that saved the make up naive me. It blends perfectly and avoids that lovely line that shows between different layers that shows you dont know what you are doing. It is washable. The dimensions are perfect so I can use it on eye shadow as well. I need all the help I can get. It is pricey, but I use it daily with most of my products so it does count as reasonable. I read a lot about these and finally got one, and I have to say it lives up to the hype.
