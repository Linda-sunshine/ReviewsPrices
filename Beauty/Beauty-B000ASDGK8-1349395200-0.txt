review/summary: Best dryer I've ever owned.review/text: This is by far the best dryer I have ever owned and the cost is well worth it (and it's not even the most expensive). It is quiet and dries my hair so fast. The hot setting isn't too hot and the warm setting is perfect for my 5 year old. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a fast-drying hair dryer.
