review/summary: works finereview/text: My oldest son just washes his longish hair, brushes it out and lets it dry. I got him this brush hoping it would be gentle enough for tangled, fine (but thick and longish) hair. It works well for detangling without repeated strokes and doesn't seem to be causing breakage.
