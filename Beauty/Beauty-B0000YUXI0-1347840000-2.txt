review/summary: Just what I neededreview/text: I started using Mavala when my fingers started hurting of so much bitting, I had to stop some how, I found Mavala online, I liked the reviews and decided to give it a try, and I got to say, my nails are long now! my habit of bitting my nails had to stop as the taste of this product is terrible and so hard to get off. I only had to use it twice in two weeks, now with the longer nails I don't feel uneven edges neither the urge to bite them off. I keep it handy in case I need it again. I would highly recommend it!
