review/summary: Great Aquatic-Type Scentreview/text: This scent is great, especially for the price point (under $20?). I had purchased this for my brother, and Calvin Klein Eternity Aqua for myself. I think I do like this smell better. Gives that nice warm, summer aquatic vibe. Just smells so good. I would highly recommend it. If you can get your hands on a genuine item, do it!
