review/summary: Better than I expectedreview/text: This is a must purchase if you are trying to get glowing, fabulous skin. I use 2 to 3 drops of this warmed by rubbing my palms together and then massage upward in circles into my face. I then take a washcloth and run the hottest tap water I can stand on it and wring out and steam my face with it twice. Then, after the second time I wipe my face in massaging circles to remove the excess and the dirt and makeup. I then splash cold water on my face to close the pores. Dry and then take 2 more drops and massage in as a moisturizer. I need nothing else. I have not broken out, the little white bumps are gone and I have only been using this for a week and a half. I even use it in my hair while wet. Only 2 to 4 drops on wet hair (2 if its dry unless I am doing a treatment before shampooing). I have color treated, abused, dry hair and it looks amazing. Body, shine, health...I could not recommend anything more highly. I am in the process of cutting all silicone products from my regimen because I found out that was what was killing my hair...it was suffocating it. If you are on the fence, I would order this immediately, whether you have oily, combination, or dry skin, this WILL work for you.
