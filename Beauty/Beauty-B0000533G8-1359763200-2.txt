review/summary: LIFE CHANGERreview/text: I absolutely love this product. I use it as body wash, as shampoo, and as face wash. It has entirely changed my personal hygiene routine, in a good way. I no longer need to use conditioner! I also don't really have to use moisturizer on my legs or arms, unless I'm feeling particularly dry. The smell is nice, which is an added plus. A little of this product goes a long way, so it's worth the money you pay for it. If you care about your body, try this product! You won't regret it.
