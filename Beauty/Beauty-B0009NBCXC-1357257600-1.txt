review/summary: Great for acne!review/text: I bought this oil because I've read around quite a lot that jojoba oil is great for acne prone skin. I've used face washes that had jojoba oil in them, and have seen great results so I decided to buy some natural and see how it works.I haven't used it too often, I mostly just forget. But when I do use it, I put some on a cotton ball and dab onto my face. I put a generous amount to soak in for at least 15 min, before I wash it off in the shower. When I use just a little, it leaves my skin very soft, and though it looks oily, it doesn't FEEL oily, and easily rubs off my fingers so I can just wipe them off with a towel instead of washing, trying to get rid of the grease. I love that. After I use it, I find that my skin is soft, and the acne is less irritated. I also use natural tea tree oil along with it as a spot treatment, and the two together seem to be a good match.I rate it 4/5 stars because I haven't used it often enough to really see what it can do for me. I've used it on my hair and that was pretty nice, too. I know it won't work miracles, and it doesn't work as quickly as the tea tree oil.The only issue I have is with the bottle; it comes with a snap cap, like with most body washes: you push down one side and the other snaps up with the dispenser. That works best with thicker substances. But with the oil, it pours out fine but it gets all over the cap, and gets in the cracks. I've just taken to twisting it off and pouring it onto a cotton ball, or dipping in a Q-Tip. It's nothing drastic, but I would've liked it if I could just squeeze some out and snap it shut without having to clean it each time. I'll live, though! xD
