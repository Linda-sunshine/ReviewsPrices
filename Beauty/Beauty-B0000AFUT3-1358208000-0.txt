review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I had high hopes for this item because it was so well rated. I rarely do reviews, however I felt it was necessary to say something about this mirror.The good bits: The tri-fold gives a good view of your face, and the magnification is great! It's good to be able to tweak the light settings between green/purple/orange etc to check your makeup.The bad bits: The first time I turned on the mirror, the lights were really bright, but within a second, there was a loud POP and the lights went out. I tried a different outlet, different plugs etc but only once did it respond with a faint flicker. This made me think the bulbs were not yet completely gone yet... But no matter how long I turned on the light, or what type of converter I used, the mirror wouldn't light up again. I'm disappointed because there was no voltage warning on the instructions or the box that would have given me an indication that this would happen.I'm just using this mirror as a normal mirror now... which completely defeats the purpose of getting a lighted mirror.
