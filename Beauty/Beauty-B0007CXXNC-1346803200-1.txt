review/summary: A go-to deep conditionerreview/text: I've been using this deep conditioner now for about a year and I'll (probably) never look back. Its quite expensive in the store and amazon has been the best source for me. Highly recommend, I have very curly hair (3c for those of you who are in the natural community.) But I found out about the product from a girl who has pin straight hair so it works for anyone. I like to leave it in over night and it makes detangling in the morning MUCH easier.
