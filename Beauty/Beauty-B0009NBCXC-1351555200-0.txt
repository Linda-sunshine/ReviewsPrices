review/summary: No Good as a Hair Treatment, Stick with Arganreview/text: I was planning on using this as a hair treatment oil... bad idea. This stuff is super greasy and horrible with provoking acne that was perfectly managed. My skin is combination/oily and my hair comes from an ethnic background of middle eastern and Egyptian. Totally gross residue and made me want to soak my head in the neutrogena ant-residue shampoo solution. That said, I'd highly recommend the organic Argan oil, or for those of you on a budget, get the garnier frutise argan oil treatment. It isn't organic and it isn't as strong, but it is very good, leaves your hair very soft, and it's only $5 in store, so you can probably get it in bulk for cheaper.Don't be fooled though, true organic argan oil is very expensive, to the tune of $30 per 2oz
