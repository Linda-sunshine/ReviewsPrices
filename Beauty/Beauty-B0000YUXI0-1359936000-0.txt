review/summary: Amazing stuff!review/text: I've been biting my nails for over 15 years and this is the first time I'v been able to stop. This stuff tastes so bad that it makes you stop biting. The stuff stays on your nails like just nailpolish so it lasts a long time. I put on again each morning just to be safe. It's clear color so it looks okay, just a little shine. My nails are finally growing back but I have a feeling I'm going to need to use this for a while in order to really break that habit. You also need a manicure to fix up your nails if they look bad but I can say that this stuff really works to help people stop biting.
