review/summary: Excellent soap, but gets cloudy in foam dispenser.review/text: I use a clear foaming dispenser in the kitchen. This soap gets cloudy in the dispenser so it looks like you're washing your hands with dirty water. It smells amazing, so I'll probably continue to use it, just as a body wash, not a hand soap.
