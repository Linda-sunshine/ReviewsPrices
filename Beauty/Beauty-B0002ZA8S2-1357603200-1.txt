review/summary: stopped working after 2 months\review/text: initiially, the item worked wonderfully!! I LOVED this iron.... Then one day, after approximately 2 1/2 months it just stopped getting hot. I made sure it was plugged in to a working outlet and was turned ON - but nothing....wouldnt even get warm. The orange &#34;ON&#34; indicator light was illuminated and i even tried different temperature setings....still nothing. Debating on whether or not to buy the exact same or switch to a different brand :/
