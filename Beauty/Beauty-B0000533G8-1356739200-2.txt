review/summary: Multi-purposed Wonderreview/text: Wife bought this and the hemp peppermint for general use throughout the house. Very satisfied with the product. The soap is well concentrated, smells great, and has worked as intended in every use to which she's put it. Goes great in homemade bathing soaps mixes and in laundry detergent. The homemade laundry detergent featuring this stuff is noticeably less expensive than the store brands, and we haven't noticed any drop in cleaning quality. Would highly recommend this castile soap.
