review/summary: DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCTreview/text: I purchased this item about a month and a half ago. It worked great until yesterday when it just would not turn on anymore. I contacted the manufacturer and found out that they have NO authorized retailers of this product on the internet and therefore what I purchased may not even be an original CHI and would not fall under any warranty. I have now missed the return window with Amazon as well. I will be in contact with them to see if there is any way I can get my money back and I have hopes that they will work with me. But - don't waste your time or money with this!
