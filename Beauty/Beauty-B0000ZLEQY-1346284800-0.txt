review/summary: not for mereview/text: Ok so I received this item quickly and in good condition, kudos to shipper. But I do not care for the scent. I didn't like the smell from the bottle and neither from the back of my hand where I placed a small amount. It smells like a funeral pallor or something funky,there is a dominant scent perhaps Lilly, sorry, not for me. To be fair I will try on pulse point to see if there is an improvement, which I doubt. I will come back and update if something changes. This will be gifted to another.
