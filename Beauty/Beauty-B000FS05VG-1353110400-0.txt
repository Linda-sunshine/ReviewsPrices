review/summary: Not heavy or too noisyreview/text: This dryer is lightweight & dries my hair very fast; I have curly/coily african-american hair & have to use products to make my curls pop, so I wet it almost every morning & this dryer definitely works fast getting my hair dry. I'm very happy with it.
