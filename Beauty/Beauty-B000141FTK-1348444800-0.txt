review/summary: not exactly like a rosereview/text: I've seen so many recommendations for Dr. Bronner's that I finally bought a bottle of the rose scent to use in my foam soap dispensers. The scent is light and pleasant, but it doesn't smell like a rose. I have a dozen rose bushes in my yard, so I know what I'm talking about. I may try some of the other scents. It works fine as a foam soap.
