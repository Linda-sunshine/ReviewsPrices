review/summary: Makes my hair so soft!review/text: I have been having a terrible time with static in my house since the winter months have come, I've been spraying static guard in my hair like crazy and just end up putting my hair up in a pony because I get so sick of it. Since I started using this hairdryer I have had NO problems with static AND it makes my hair so soft. Love it! Would buy again!
