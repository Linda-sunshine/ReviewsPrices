review/summary: Detangles with ease; so far so goodreview/text: I have ethnic THICK, CURLY hair as the result of my genetic make up (half-black / half-mexican). My hair is sooooooo very curl, so curly...WOW!!!! My daughter's hair is also curly, she is multi-ethnic (half-mexican/ one quarter black and one quarter caucasian). I purchased this brush to ease with the process of detangling her hair. This brush definitely serves it purpose. Her hair is easier to detangle than mine, but the main thing is that on her hair, it detangles her hair with the ouch factor, which is a major plus. But the proof in the pudding for this brush, was when I used it to detangle my hair. Now like I said, my hair is THICK and CURLY. I used this brush and detangling factor was amazing! I have only had it for about 2 weeks or so, so I haven't experience the pulling or lost of the end protectors on the brush, but at this point, I am sure that if this does occur, I will proceed to just order more. This brush is a winner!
