review/summary: Wet Brush from Amazon.comreview/text: My granddaughter has very long fine curly hair and hates to have it brushed. With the wet brush the chore is so much easier. The tangles just seem to slide right out. It is good for wet or dry hair and I recommend it to anyone for your little girls hair. By the way I have used it on mine and love it also. I ordered 2 and will be ordering more again soon since I am afraid these will get discontinued as so many other things I like seem to do.
