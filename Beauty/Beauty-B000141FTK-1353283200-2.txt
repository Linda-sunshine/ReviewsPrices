review/summary: Made me Itchreview/text: I purchased this yesterday. I've been itching and scratching all day at work. It made my skin really dry, much worse than soap. I would never recommendd this to anyone. I have no idea what these people are talking about, this stuff is awful. Years ago I had purchased the peppermint and it was just as bad. I've learned my lesson, won't buy any of Dr. Bronners products again.
