review/summary: Just what I expected!!review/text: This review was written by my wife:I saw this advertised about 6 months ago with rave reviews, yet I held out on getting it as I was managing with my flat and curling irons, so why get another one? Well, with the extreme summer heat, I have been just too hot to dry my hair, so it's been just air drying, and guess what? That causes my hair to turn frizzy and wavy and then I have to work at straightening it with my iron. Well, the other day I just happened to find this on the daily deal so I went for it! And I'm glad I finally did!! I used it for the first time and it performed just as I expected!! The iron heated up in under a minute and it was very easy to use. I have long hair and it took me less than ten minutes to run the iron through all my hair and it looked sleek and smooth right away. There were some areas near my scalp that felt a bit damp because I didn't want to put the iron too close to my scalp, but those areas just air dried. My hair still looked just as fresh and smooth when I woke up in the morning too! I didn't even have to spend time styling it--I just quickly ran a brush through it and I was done. This product is a MUST-HAVE and I will definitely recommend to all my friends and family!
