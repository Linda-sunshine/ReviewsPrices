review/summary: Complete Disappointmentreview/text: When I purchsae this product it was listed as new. When I placed my order I could not track my order. Then when I received my product it didn't even have a cap it was not in a box, it actually looked used. It has a sticker that says tester. So obviously this was not a new item. This was supposed to be a gift for someone.I am very thankful to have found FragranceNet now that is a great company, not only did they send me a new item they sent a lot of free stuff like samples of other fragrances and a pocket mirror. I will be going withFragranceNet for my fragrance purchase.
