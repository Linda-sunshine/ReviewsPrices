review/summary: This stuff is da bomb!review/text: I first used this product after I began using violet shampoo to keep my highlights white and not yellow-toned. The violet shampoo is extremely drying so I needed a great conditioner to use afterwards. I bought this in a small sample size to give it a try and immediately fell in love. I use it 2-3 times a week and leave it on for about 5 minutes while in the shower. Unlike lots of conditioners, you don't need a ton. I have very thick hair and was surprised at how little I needed. It is better than any other deep conditioner or hot oil treatment that I have ever used.
