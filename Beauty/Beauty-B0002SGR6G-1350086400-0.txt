review/summary: love the colorreview/text: The color is AMAZING. obviously, its not 100% Tiffany Blue(copyright infringement and all that) but its VERY close. that being said, I wasn't really crazy for the way this polish goes on, its not very forgiving to mistakes, you have to be very specific about the pressure you use, otherwise, half of the nail will have color, and the other won't. also, this color starts to get tacky VERY quickly, within about 5 seconds, normally, that would be wonderful, but you have to go over this to correct it when you mess up, but when its tacky, it doesn't really behave the way you want it to.
