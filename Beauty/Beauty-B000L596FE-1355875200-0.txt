review/summary: Bad Chemical Smell and Lame Bristlesreview/text: My heading pretty much says it. I like bristles which are firm enough to feel good on the scalp. These are flimsy. It may be a decent hair detangler, but I wouldn't know as I have short hair. Also, and most importantly, even if the brush does what you personally want it to, it literally reeks of the chemical material of which it is made....so much so, in fact, your hand will reek just from handling it for a few seconds. So if you don't mind being poisoned, or having to scrub your hands after brushing your hair, this brush might be for you :)
