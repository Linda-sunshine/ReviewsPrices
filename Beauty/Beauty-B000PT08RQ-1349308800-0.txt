review/summary: LOVE ITreview/text: I had the smaller 1 inch wet 2 straight. I love that one and have not been able to find a bigger one. I was so excited to find this one. It works just like it should. I have mixed hair. I'm Puerto Rican, so I have the dry, frizzy hair, really curly hair. I use this and 1 at most 2 passes through and it's done. With my little one it took me 45 min to 1 hr to do all of my hair with this bigger one it takes 20 mins max. I love it and would recommend this product to everyone! Especially people with my hair type.
