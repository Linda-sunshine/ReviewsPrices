review/summary: Nice, quality sponge, no miracles of coursereview/text: I like the fact that you dampen the sponge before using it to apply liquid foundation, because that helps with the smooth application results. This sponge is made of good quality sponge material that I dont anticipate cracking or breaking apart like cheaper sponges tend to. It doesn't work miracles, of course, but I am pleased with the sponge and it works a bit better than my fingers (which work better than any previous sponge). Read the directions for use and care.
