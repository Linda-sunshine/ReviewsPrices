review/summary: Fit / Comfort good.... unknown herbs smell, reaction Badreview/text: It's a nice fit and quite comfortable.Problem is that it's packed with all sorts of unknown herbs and scents that they don't even put on the label. It's made in China so I wonder about the materials they use. Smells like licorice and lavendar. Lavender has been shown to interact with hormones in men and reduces testosterone while increasing estrogen.I would prefer them to list what herbs they put on or better yet, not put the herbs in there and just have it be a mask.
