review/summary: The Best!review/text: My hair doesnt do too much.. or if it does it doesnt last. I have an older version of this and its AMAZING!My hair is long and thick. I dont like blow drying it because it makes my hair all frizzy and then i have to put so much product in its ridulous.This heats up quick.. within 2 min id say on the hottest setting. I can straighten and dry in 20min max with only 1 product in my hair so its still light and fluffy.You can do dry OR damp OR wet hair theres really a setting for from dry to wet and everything in between. Def recommend!!
