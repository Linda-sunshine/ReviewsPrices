review/summary: Color is very appealing but it takes at least 15 coats. No kidding.review/text: This color is true to the picture and is very neon. It is very attractive if you like neon and I have received many compliments on it however it takes at least 15 coats. No kidding. It is very thin so it does not even look or feel caked on after that many coats. You can actually apply a new coat to your first hand just as soon as you finish your second hand, that's how quickly this dries but I would not use this nail polish if you want to do your nails quickly. After putting this nail polish on with 10+ coats on, my nails still needed more coats of polish, I didn't want to mess with it so I just put on black crackle the next day and it looked very nice. It does dry matte so don't forget your topcoat and I like to put on a base coat as well as neons have a tendency to chip. I don't think I would buy this again just because it takes so many coats. If my rating were based solely on the color, I would give Celtic Sun a 5.
