review/summary: Barbarareview/text: This is the best curling iron I have ever owned. I have wavy, short medium thick hair. I am 50 years old. I put it on the highest level to try it out because of the reviews I had read. It is fast. Do not use it like the older curling Orion. Holding it for a few minutes. Roll your hair up and less then 2 seconds take it out. The temp control is away from your hands. That means when you are holding it your fingers do not change the dial. This is truly the best iron I have ever owned. The shipper was right on time. No peanut packaging. Huge bubble packing. I am more the satisfied
