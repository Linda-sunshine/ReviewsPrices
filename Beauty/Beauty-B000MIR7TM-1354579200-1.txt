review/summary: Much better than skunk brush or regular sponges!review/text: This sponge is the one of the best beauty tools I have ever purchased! I had been using the MAC 187 brush prior to the beauty blender and was not thrilled with the results--the foundation just looked too heavy. Mind you, I use a medium to heavy coverage all-day wear foundation. After watching a demo on YouTube, I took my first shot at it and was AMAZED at how airbrushed and perfect my foundation looked! the MAC brush has since been gathering dust. I have actually bought a couple more beauty blenders so I can rotate them and not have to wash one every day. Just wet it squeeze the extra water out, dot on your foundation throughout your face and tap the sponge around to blend. Use the pointy tip for areas around your nose and eyes. The whole process only takes 2 minutes tops, yet your foundation will look professionally applied. Don't think twice about it--buy it now if you're wanting that perfect airbrushed foundation look.
