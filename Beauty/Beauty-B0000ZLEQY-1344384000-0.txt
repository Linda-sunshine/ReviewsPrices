review/summary: Many Must-Have Scentsreview/text: I have been wearing one Auric Blend roll-on perfume or another for the past 15 years and receive compliments all the time. I figured I'd take a moment and describe some of my favorites. Please note that this is just my perception of these scents and that I typically prefer earthy over floral, powders, or fresh scents.My all-time favorite is Forbidden Desire. It is sultry, earthy, and spicy; it makes me think of Marakesh. It is a very strong and heady.Divine Opium is also fantastic- also spicy, incense-like but sweeter than Forbidden Desire.Note: the Divine Opium doesn't smell like the branded opium smell found in beauty supply stores, and to me, this a good thing.Rasta is a heavier smell, but seems to be more along the lines of sandalwood.Majik is darker with cinnamon notes.The Patchouli is classic and tried and true.I hope that this helps a few people.
