review/summary: Better than my MAC brushes!review/text: I read over and over about how great this product was, but cringed a bit at the price for "a sponge." After ONE use, my only regret is that I didn't buy one sooner. Not only does it perfectly apply and blend my foundation, I also use it to apply my concealer and it's NEVER looked this good! I can't believe that this funny, pink, sponge works better than my MAC foundation and concealer brushes. If you're hesitating, don't - you won't regret the purchase.
