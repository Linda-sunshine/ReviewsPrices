review/summary: Stopped a bad finger sucking habitreview/text: My daughter was sucking her finger in the womb and at the age of 8 was still going strong. We tried everything...products, bribing, appliances, etc. and nothing worked...she would be back at sucking her finger the next day! Literally put this product on her finger and she stopped sucking her finger after one taste of the stuff!!! Never, ever went back after that!!!!!!!!! I accidentally got some on my finger while painting hers with it and tasted it and I can see why she stopped....the taste lingered for days even after brushing teeth!!!! Best product out there in my opinion!
