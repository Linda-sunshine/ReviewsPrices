review/summary: Perfect for shift workersreview/text: I never thought I'd be able to use a sleep mask but I can hardly even tell its on. Fits perfectly and the material is so soft. That's probably why you can't feel it. I start work at 2 am so I'm usually going to bed in the afternoon. I used to have blackout curtains but I hated how my room always felt like a cave. Now I can have my sheer curtains and still sleep without being bothered by the sun. Love that it has an adjustable back so it never feels tight.
