review/summary: THE WORSTreview/text: I purchased this product as a replacement in January after I accidentally fried my previous chi in a foreign country. Yesterday the replacement straightener broke. The quality of this product is very sketchy- it in no way resembled the former chi. The plastic is flimsy and the straightener is much lighter than the original chi I purchased. I suspect this straightener is a fake and would warn any buyer against purchasing as this product has neither the longevity nor the quality that authentic chis provide. A $30 straightener from a major retailer would likely last longer and provide better quality.
