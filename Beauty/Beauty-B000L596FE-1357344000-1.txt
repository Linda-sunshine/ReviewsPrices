review/summary: Amazing, works EXACTLY as advertised!review/text: As a busy woman with long hair, I have always found the morning task of brushing my wet hair out before drying it very annoying. They say that brushing it with a regular brush can damage it, but I don't have time to go over it with one of those special detangling combs, which takes FOREVER and still hurts almost as much as the brush. I used to brush it with a regular brush, which was painful and only seemed to tangle certain areas of my hair more.I saw this brush on Amazon and decided to ask for it for Christmas. The price was reasonable and I figured it was worth a try. When I received it as a gift I tried it in the shower and it worked like a charm! I could not BELIEVE how quick and easy it was to brush out my usually unruly long, thick hair. The best part of this brush is that it doesn't hurt at all!! I don't understand how this brush works, but it is amazing. I am going to buy several more, just in case they come to their senses and start charging twice as much!I agree with other reviewers that this brush would be great for anyone with long and/or thick hair and anyone with a tender headed child.
