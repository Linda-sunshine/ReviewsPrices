review/summary: Love Bronners Lavender Soapreview/text: We've been buying this for a while and really like it. I've used it for face and body wash, even for shampoo (with an apple cider vinegar rinse afterwards, works really well in taming my curly hair). I use it for the kids, in foaming pumps for hand soap in the bathroom, and I've even used it in a pinch for an all-purpose cleaner or on gentle laundry (especially hand-wash wool items). I also like that it scores a 1 (low hazard) on the EWG Skin Deep database. I generally get mine on iHerb for pretty cheap being that I get a discount there (anyone can sign up for VIP membership for free) and they usually have free shipping (if you've never shopped on iherb, you can also get $5 off or $10 if you spend $40 using the coupon code MOS036). Last time I just bought a full gallon and I keep the house well stocked by refilling the smaller bottles. It DOES sting if you get it in your eyes, though. Otherwise, I'm a big fan. The lavender smells great.
