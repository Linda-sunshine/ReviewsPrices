review/summary: Every day usereview/text: I'm extremely picky about what I put on my body, especially what I wash with. After much trial and error I happened to buy Dr. Bronner's Lavender soap. I use it for both hair and body with great results. I mix a little bottle of it with baking soda and tea tree oil for my hair. For my body, I just use it right out of the bottle. I tried the peppermint soap first, but it's too harsh on my body when used like I do, which is pouring a little in a washcloth. I ended up buying a gallon jug of the lavender stuff and with how little it takes, I probably have a two year supply in one jug.
