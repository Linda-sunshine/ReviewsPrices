review/summary: I bought a second one after I got the first.review/text: And I may buy a third so I have one at work.This brush is awesome for wet hair. It is soft enough that it doesn't hurt, but it also treats the hair as though it were a comb and doesn't increase split ends.I use the brush for wet or dry hair and it actually makes my hair look better than it did before. Crazy good. I ended up with a yellow and a black one. You do not get a choice on color, but this isn't a bedspread, so who cares!Awesome buy!
