review/summary: Subtle and Exoticreview/text: I wanted to comment on the reviewers who state this product has no scent- Right from the bottle, the oil is odorless, and at first I was a little dissapointed when it came in the mail. I rolled it on anyway, and let it soak in because its quite viscous, and slowly the scent started to release from my skin. The scent is subtle, if your used to spraying on a department store perfume and becoming lost in the fumes, then this is a nice surprise. Its very exotic and slightly sweet, nothing like I have smelled. Patchouli? Sandalwood? Jasmine maybe? What a treat to wear at such a great price. I can feel the African sand as I bathe beneath the Giza acropolis...
