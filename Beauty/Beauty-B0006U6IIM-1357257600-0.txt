review/summary: My skin is baby softreview/text: and I do not have the dreaded crepe neck anymore. I was looking on Amazon for a skin lightener because my years in the south have caught up to me and I have lots of age freckles along my arms. I stumbled on reviews for almond oil and bought a bottle based on the reviews. Now I am subscribe and save and I am never without it. I use it in the morning when I step out of the shower and rub it in along with the water that is still on me. At night I use it full strength on my neck, around my eyes, and on my arms. It is kind of heavy at first and takes a while to absorb but it is worth using. It does nothing for freckles, but does not claim to, so i went back to Porcelana for that. However, it does smooth your skin and works miracles on your neck.
