review/summary: Great!review/text: I was shocked with how well this brush worked on my long, fine hair. I have a lot of it and the longer it gets, the more easily it tangles. I have just dealt with it for the most part, thinking there was nothing I could do about it other than choose a shorter hairstyle. I used to dread having to brush my hair after a shower (I always brushed it beforehand as well). Every brush or comb I tried took 5 minutes or more to get through all of my hair when wet, and it hurt! This brush only catches on a few tangles, and even then it doesn't pull them hard. I manage to get through all my wet hair in less than a minute now, and it's magically tangle-free! At first I was worried it wasn't doing anything, but it definitely works.
