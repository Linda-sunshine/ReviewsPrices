review/summary: 9 months and it stopped working.review/text: I purchased this flat iron at the end of Nov 2011. I was happy with the product overall but its been 9 months and the flat iron doesnt turn on. I previously had a cheap conair flat iron that lasted at least twice as long so I am not going to waste my money again on the CHI brand and am completely dissapointed with my one and only purchase of a CHI product. I will go back to the cheaper brands becuase at least I know what Im getting for my money.
