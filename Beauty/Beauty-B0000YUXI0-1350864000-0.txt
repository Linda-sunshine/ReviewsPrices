review/summary: Not that impressedreview/text: I bought this to use with my 3 and 1/2 year old son who bites his fingernails nearly all the time. It worked the first day (and that may have been more of a placebo). We re-applied it after 2 days and I still noticed he was biting his nails, so we went to applying it every day. Still chewing incessantly. I have tasted it and do believe that it could work, but I think my son has gotten used to the bitter taste and it doesn't bother him now. He still bites his nails terribly and I've given it nearly 2 weeks. I'm not all that impressed.
