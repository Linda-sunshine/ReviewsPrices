review/summary: OMG, one of my favorite China Glaze colorsreview/text: This is a neon pink polish that I absolutely love. It is so bright and smooth. And on top of that I got it brand new for only a penny with free shipping (I think somebody messed up really bad on that one). What an AWESOME deal!!!
