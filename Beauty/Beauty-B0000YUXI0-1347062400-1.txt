review/summary: Best product I have triedreview/text: I have been a nail biter for 50 years and was cured in ONE WEEK. I have tried Thum, Tabasco, anything I could think of. This stuff tastes SO bad. The tradeoff is everytime you lick your fingers or touch your lips, the taste is DISGUSTING. You will be looking for somewhere to spit. On the plus side, it teaches you to keep your hands away from your mouth. I have not bitten a thing since July 4. And I have learned how fast your nails actually grow! :-) Now I am working on stopping the cuticle picking habit I have always had. Any ideas would be great!
