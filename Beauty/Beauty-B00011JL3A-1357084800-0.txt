review/summary: Love china glazereview/text: Every year I go on vacation in sept. to Jamaica and when I ran into this polish 3 years ago I just had to have it. I have super long natural nails and the name Jamaican out was perfect. I buy china glaze over OPI. This polish doesn't chip or fade even in the Hot Jamaican sun. Love it!!!
