review/summary: Great Facial Moisturizerreview/text: My acne riddled teenage self would balk at the sight of me putting oil on my face. But ever since using jojoba oil along with tea tree oil to moisturize my face, I've noticed that my skin is softer, more radiant, and less prone to breakouts. I haven't used another brand of jojoba oil yet, so I have nothing to compare this product to. But it's been working well for me, so I doubt I'll be trying anything else anytime soon.
