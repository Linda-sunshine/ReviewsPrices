review/summary: The best thing for burnt-on greasereview/text: I learned about this soap through a posting on Pinterest. After I run the self-cleaning cycle on my oven, with the shelves taken out, I still had the burnt-on stuff on the shelves. The old-fashioned oven-cleaner spray would take the stuff off the shelves but wouldn't leave them shiny, and they wouldn't slide. I learned this from previous ovens. This magic soap melts the burnt on stuff right off. I have to put them in the bathtub and leave it to soak with some paper towels overnight, and they come out shiny. The same thing with old roasting pans, they come out like new.
