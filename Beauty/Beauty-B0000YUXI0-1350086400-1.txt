review/summary: thumb sucking!review/text: I heard about this from my sister apparently this is what my mom used on her for her thumb sucking! my almost 4 year old has sucked his thumb since before he knew he had fingers! ive been trying every thing! for years! so finally i looked this stuff up, now let me tell you i have a very stubborn little boy. but my sister assured me it was horrible, even too horrible for him. the fist night i put it in him, his brothers (5 and 2.5) wanted some too so i figured why not....then i told the boys to lick their thumbs. wow i was not ready for what happened next. every one was screaming running around about how horrible their thumbs where! that was the end od my stubborn thumb sucker. because that went soo well i tried it on my 1.5 year old. very cautiously because 'stop' is ment for 3 and up. he had a hard time he wanted to suck his fingers soo bad. he would put his fingers in his mouth caugh n spit and try it right away again. he must of tried it 15 to 20 times! i felt so bad for him but eventually he did fall asleep with out his fingers in his mouth. if i could give this 7 stars i would! after years of trying this finally worked. the only thing id mention is put it on every night. i went days with out putting it on at first and my stubborn little guy was hiding sucking his thumb....so every day till he was really done
