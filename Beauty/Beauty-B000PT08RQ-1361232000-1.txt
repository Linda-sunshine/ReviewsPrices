review/summary: I always Buy this Straightner! Love it!review/text: I've been through 3 of these, approximately every 2-2.5 years I have to replace it due to me dropping it (every time!) and i used my straightner almost the entire 365 days of the year. The body style has changed but still the same great results! This gets so hot it make steam come off my hair. I have very thick frizzy kind or curly/wavy hair so i part my hair piece by piece to get it super fine straight and it works! no one would ever guess my natural hair is frizzy or curly.
