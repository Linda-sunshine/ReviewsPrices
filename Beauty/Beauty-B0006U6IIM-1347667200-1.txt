review/summary: This Almond Oil is a great productreview/text: I use this after shower to moisturize all over. Makes my skin baby soft! I also use it in my hair and scalp. Makes my hair super shiny and soft without leaving a greasy feel. My scalp gets really dry sometimes, so this oil completely moisturizes my scalp and keeps away flakes and soothes itching. I bet it would be great for a sexy massage too. When I get a new boyfriend, I'll let you know!
