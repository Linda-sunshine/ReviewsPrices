review/summary: new favorite brand!review/text: I only applied this a couple hours ago and already I'm in love!! This is my first bottle of china glaze and I definitely picked a beautiful color to try. I've heard people say that with china glaze it takes 3 to 4 coats to get true to color, luckily with this color it only took 2.I used a revlon quick dry top coat and so far this is one of the best manicures I've ever had! I've had really bad luck with other polishes so if all china glazes look like this I'm sold!!
