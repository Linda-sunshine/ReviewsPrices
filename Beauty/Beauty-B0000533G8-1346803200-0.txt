review/summary: Good:review/text: I like the peppermint feeling of this soap after you step out of the shower. I bought this soap because of an episode of the walking dead, stating on the story notes they sometimes have on the bottom screen while your watching the movie, that the reason you don't see bugs around the actors in that hot climate they're in is because of the peppermint soap, it is supposed to keep them off, well, I don't know if I am using it wrong or, putting on deodorant that attracts but I can't see it keeping bugs off, at least it didn't work too well for me.
