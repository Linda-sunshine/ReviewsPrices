review/summary: Clever tool that gets the job donereview/text: I was very Impressed by this product because it has evolved from the traditional curling iron. This item has a handle at the base that leaves the cords tangle free and allows the user to get the job done leaving your hair looking fabulous and picture perfect. This is the closest thing to a solon look at home and is well worth the investment.
