review/summary: Great!review/text: My makeup priorities: decent quality, not too expensive, and fast (I have 2 small children). These sponges are easy to use and leave my face looking even but dewy. I use them with Revlon Colorstay foundation, nothing fancy, and it looks much better than when I apply using just my fingers-- better finish and much longer-lasting. The only problem is that the bulbous, bright pink sponge is terribly cute to a 3-year-old's eyes...good thing I bought the 2-pack.
