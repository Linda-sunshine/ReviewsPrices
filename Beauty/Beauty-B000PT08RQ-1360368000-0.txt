review/summary: Remingtonreview/text: I use this twice a week to keep my hair sleek and straight for work. I would definitely recommend using a good shampoo and conditioner and ALWAYS a heat protective spray before styling your hair with any heat appliance. Good product very durable and i like the lock feature. It has an auto off so it turns off after a while, not sure exactly after how long. Its a great price also. The plates are wide so it doesnt take too long to straighten my long, frizz prone and wavy/ curly hair.I would recommend and buy again if needed to in the future!
