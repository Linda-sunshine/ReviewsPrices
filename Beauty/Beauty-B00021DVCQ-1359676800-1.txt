review/summary: Most likely a fakereview/text: I've used bareMinerals foundation for a couple years now. I usually go to the department store to purchase it but since I order so much from Amazon I thought I would save myself a trip and order it online. I was very excited to see how much less expensive it was, but this should have been my first warning. While the packaging is the same, the powder provides pretty much zero coverage. It also seemed to slightly irritate my skin. I love bareMinerals foundation, but this is not bareMinerals foundation....
