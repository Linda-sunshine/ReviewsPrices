review/summary: Not as bright as I expectedreview/text: When I ordered this polish I was thinking more of a ultra bright green glow stick color. It was far from that. I find China Glaze does dry rather quickly but to achieve the color I wanted I needed about 5 coats. Which is a little ridiculous because who has time to sit and wait for FIVE coats of nail polish to dry?! This color is a disappointment for me but it will not stop me from purchasing or recommending other China Glaze colors to others.
