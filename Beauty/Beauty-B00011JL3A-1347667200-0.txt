review/summary: kiwi kooladareview/text: Love China glaze polishes. Saw this neon green and absolutely had to have it. Came pretty quickly by mail. Its a great colour but doesn't get 5 stars due to the way it streaks. I also had to put a white coat down first to get it to really pop. Other than that its a good buy!
