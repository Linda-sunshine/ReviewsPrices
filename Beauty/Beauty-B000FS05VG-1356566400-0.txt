review/summary: I wish I had this YEARS ago!review/text: I grew up with straight to wavy hair and until a few years ago my hair just became curlier on it's own and I had no idea how to control it. I kept reading about diffusers and how it helps with naturally curly hair, so after years of using a regular blow dryer, I decided to buy this and all I can say is WOW. Not only is it a good product over all, the diffuser attachment it amazing! I wish I could have had this years ago, it would have reduced a lot of bad hair days. The price is unbeatable, and it is lightweight.
