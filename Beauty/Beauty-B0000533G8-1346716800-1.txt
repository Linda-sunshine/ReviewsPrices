review/summary: Well..review/text: First off, I ordered Dr. Bronner's peppermint scented soap and I have to say that the smell is AMAZING. I read that a small amount goes a long way from a reviewer and it really does if you use a shower "poof" or sponge. Sadly, I didn't notice any difference from this soap and a organic/natural black soap I used to use. And after being out of the shower for awhile, I didn't smell like peppermint at all. That really sucks because I really do love that smell and find it to be quite pleasant.So I would only recommend this to someone who would want brief euphoria from a soap that will last them quite some time (which also saves money) but doesn't provide any big changes in skin smoothness or softness..
