review/summary: It Works for me!review/text: My hairstyle is the short/messy look. I normally use some type of paste on it to style it. The front has been thinning for a few years now. I especially notice it when I'm in a photograph. You can see straight in to my scalp. I use all of the shampoos, conditioners, etc. they are fine, but nothing really can hide the fact that it is indeed thin up front. I ordered Toppik a few weeks ago and was hoping for the best. I also grabbed the add-on atomizer that screws on top of the bottle. It works. I use it after I shower, then I let my hair dry completely. I shake/spray about 4-5 shots into that specific area, then work it around so it doesnt clump or look "too black" in a specific area. I then use my normal paste & style as normal. It works. There is a definite visible difference. and the cool thing is that it is not going to stick out like a sore thumb to others. I do heed others advice about sweating or standing in the rain. I have heard it will run like mascara, and I dont want that, so I play it safe. also, I try to wash it out before I go to bed. I think its best for thinning hair. if you are almost bald, its not for you. All in all.... I will be a customer for a long time
