review/summary: Cured my 2 year old's thumb sucking!!!!review/text: This product is fantastic. My 2 year old loved her thumb and her teeth/bite were pretty messed up because of it. I tried mavala around her 2nd birthday and applied it every 2 days for 2 weeks. She tasted it a few times and that was it. She ended up attempting to suck her thumb again when I stopped using the product so I started using it again for another 2 weeks and it worked! I'm so grateful as she is a different child, more social and talkative, not to mention her bite is improving! Thank you!!
