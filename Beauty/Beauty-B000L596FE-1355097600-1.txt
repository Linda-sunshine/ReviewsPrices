review/summary: Absolutely Amazed.review/text: First off, I NEVER write reviews.. and I buy a lot of things on Amazon. My hair is pretty normal, nor is it very damaged from styling it. It's very long, but it gets tangly SO EASILY. I have to shower ever single day just to be presentable to the world, otherwise it's so unbelievably tangly and dready. When I shower I spend so long just trying to brush my hair out with a comb with tons and tons of conditioner, but somehow it always ends up tangled again. After my shower, I use detangler and morroccan oil. Nothing worked for me. Today I received my new brush and was super excited to try it out. I had hairsprayed, tangled curls from the night before and suprisingly this brush brushed it out in the shower with just shampoo! Before I had even used any conditioner, my hair was softer than it had ever been after soaking it in conditioner in previous times. So so so happy with this purchase; cannot believe it's not sold in every single salon and department store.
