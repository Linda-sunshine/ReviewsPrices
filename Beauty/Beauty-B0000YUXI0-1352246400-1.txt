review/summary: Mavala Stop is very Effective, recommended by my child's dentist.review/text: My 5 year old and 2 year old twins could not stop sucking their thumbs. I put Mavala Stop on their thumnb nails and they quit within 2 weeks. You have to endure the agony of your child gagging on the nasty stuff, (I tried it, and it is nasty). They are not going to be harmed by it, and the benefits are lasting. Great stuff!
