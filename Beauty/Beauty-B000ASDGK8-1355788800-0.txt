review/summary: The Ceramix Xtreme...Proreview/text: The first time you place this this in your hand your realize your holding professionally made hair dryer. It's surrounded by this soft to the touch, comfortable rubber housing, so accidentally dropping it off your counter will not hurt it. It doesn't have the feel of a cheap plastic high dryer nor is it to heavy.... It has that...just right feeling and balance, when you hold it in your hand. As for its power, it has an amazing 2000 Watts of hair drying power with a high/low speed. Three heat settings...cool, warm and hot. This baby uses ceramic heat. It felt lighter on the hair and took less time to dry my hair. It also sports a great little blue button called the COLD, it's great for drying your hair or ionizing your hair without any heat. I know my hairdresser uses a similar button on his hair dryer to blow away the tiny pices of hair off my back of my neck, when I am getting my hair trimmed. The chord is an impressive 9 feet long so, it's great for professionals too. The hair dryer is equipment with a (ALCI) or appliance circuit interrupter, it's a saftey feature that renders the hair dryer inoperable if it should become immersed in water...great saftey feature. It has a removable lint filter so, your turbo dryer won't overheat. Hands down, this was worth the $41.49. If you want the best then this is the one for you.
