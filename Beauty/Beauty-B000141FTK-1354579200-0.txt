review/summary: I am amazed at how soft my skin feels 12 hours after my morning showerreview/text: I bought this soap just to have a liquid soap to use. However, there was an amazing side effect I never expected. My skin is aging it looks and feels cracked and dry. 12 hours after my shower my arms and legs are still so soft and they still smell so nice I really am stunned. I usually rub on lotion throughout the day, but no more. I will certainly be buying this for life - I love it!
