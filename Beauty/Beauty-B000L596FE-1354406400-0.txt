review/summary: Nice but wore out quicklyreview/text: I used this brush over the past year, and while I loved it, the little rubber ends came off the bristles so I had to throw it out. For $7 I don't mind replacing it annually but at $20 or more in a salon there is no way I would buy it again. I have thick, long hair and it is much nicer to use than a traditional brush but a wide tooth comb works great too.
