review/summary: Keep your nose cleanreview/text: I know this product is a little gross to write about but anyway, I love Biore Pore Strips. Wet your nose with warm water and let this little paper mache get crispy then pull it off! You can hold it up to the light and see all the clogged pores you have freed. I have used these for years about once every two weeks to keep my nasal area looking clean and neat.
