review/summary: Worked for 8yo nail biterreview/text: My 8-year-old daughter has been biting her nails since she was about three. The only thing that has worked to curb her habit in the least was making her wear gloves all the time. And even then, she has to take them off to eat, use the bathroom, practice the piano, do her homework, and read. Then of course she would forget to put them back on. I had tried a few products that I had heard worked for others - Thum, Bite It, and Barielle. She admitted these products didn't taste good, but they didn't stop her from biting. Mavala Stop worked! After only a day she stopped biting. I asked her what she thought of it after wearing it all day and she looked at me with her big serious eyes and said &#34;It's awful!&#34; I continue to apply Mavala Stop every day if I can (every other day at least), but after a week I have finally been able to trim her nails! I am really happy with this stuff.
