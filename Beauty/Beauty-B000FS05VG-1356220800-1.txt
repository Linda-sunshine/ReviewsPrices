review/summary: You get what you pay for. Not for lefties.review/text: I've had this for nearly 3 years. In that time, almost half of the silver paint has flaked off the handle and nozzle. I had to do a paint check of my hair after each use so it didn't look like I had silver dandruff. Even though the buttons are down the anterior side of the handle I find that if you use your left hand, you will repeatedly change your settings or turn off the unit all together. The unit gets super hot, that can be a plus or a minus - depending on your hair type. I have fine hair, so this dryer burns and fries my hair. The positive is that is is very light. Check my other reviews, I recently replaced this Revlon with a Conair that is superior in every regard except weight
