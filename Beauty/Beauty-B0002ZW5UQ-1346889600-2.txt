review/summary: Toppix Light Brownreview/text: This product was very odd colored, it was almost a yellow/tan. I would not buy it again. It's like a fine dust and does not cling to the hair but sticks to the scalp. And DO NOT let the brush touch your scalp or you'll have streaks!I have used Caboki before and it is a much better product. I tried this because they have more colors and it was cheaper, I guess you get what you pay for!
