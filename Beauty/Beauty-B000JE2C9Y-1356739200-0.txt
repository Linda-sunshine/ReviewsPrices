review/summary: dream zone sleep maskreview/text: The product arrived as described, although it just wasn't for me. I had been having trouble sleeping ever since daylight savings time as I work evenings and the sun would come up very early in the morning. I purchased this to try and help but it is insanely uncomfortable. On the back of the product (the side that faces your eyes) there is a an extra piece of fabric that goes halfway up the mask, the end of this rests very uncomfortably right on my eyes and irritates me.
