review/summary: I feel a little silly, too, but it's a great sleep mask!review/text: To echo a few other reviewers - I feel a bit silly raving about the qualities of something as basic as a sleep mask, but this one is truly wonderful! I have three other sleep masks (mostly freebies) and none work as well or feel as good. The material is soft and it "breathes" -- unlike the synthetic materials I'm accustomed to in my other sleep masks. This one fits well, blocks out all the light, and stays on my head at night. Excellent! And, yes, I'm tossing the other ones.
