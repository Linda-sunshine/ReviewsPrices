review/summary: Versatile and lasts forever!review/text: OK, maybe it doesn't last forever, but a bottle sure does last me a long time! I will admit, I wouldn't use Dr. Bronner's in every recommended category, but there are certain things I love it for. I've had good luck with it for the clothing I hand wash, and it leaves my clothes smelling fresh but not overwhelmingly so. I don't tend to be a fan of strong scents, and Dr. Bronner's scented soaps just smell good (especially the tea tree!) It's also a very mild and gentle soap, which has worked wonders for my sensitive skin.
