review/summary: Awesome for hair!review/text: Almond oil has been doing great things for my hair. Using it as either a hot oil treatment or simply putting it in when my hair has just been washed has made my hair smoother, shinier, less frizzy, and healthier! I also have used avocado oil and have found that it is much too heavy and greasy. The almond oil is light and the perfect consistency.It has also been great for my eyes and eyelashes. I use it as a makeup remover and it does a great job. It congruently makes my eyelashes stronger and has helped my dark circles.Great all around product and a must buy!
