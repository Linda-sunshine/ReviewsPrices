review/summary: Change of heart!!review/text: I originally wrote a great review on this product but after getting a professional manicure and having my nails chip literally hours after has changed my mind!! I'm very disappointed and I have never had this happen, even with no name brand polishes I buy from the 99cent store. The only other option I can think of to have the polish stay on longer is to do a glue manicure...I'm going to try it and update. If the glue manicure doesn't work then this polish is useless to me!! It's very unfortunate because I bought 3 beautiful colors!
