review/summary: Drying time cut in halfreview/text: My husband got me this dryer for christmas and I am overall really satisfied. It dries my hair in half the time of my old dryer. I have less fly aways and my hair seems less dry and damaged. It is also relatively light and easy to handle.The only reason it doesn't get the full 5 Stars is because it tends to suck in my hair quite often. Didn't have that happen with my old dryer.
