review/summary: so far amazing!!review/text: i just got this today. i needed a second dryer for overnights and my first one is theBio-Ionic iDry Nano-i5X Nano-Ionic Conditioning Pro Dryer which i love but didn't want to pay the same amount for another dryer. So i decided to go with revlon and it is amazing so far!! it drys really quickly and my curls look great! i was afraid that i would get a low quality dryer but i think i like this one more! hopefully it lasts me!
