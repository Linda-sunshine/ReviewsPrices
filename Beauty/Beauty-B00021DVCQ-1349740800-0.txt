review/summary: What's all the hype?review/text: I really wanted to love this product. I really did. But I just didn't. I really don't understand all the hype. The reason I'm not a huge fan is for the reason that even though they tell you you only need a small amount, that wasn't the case for me to cover up my redness and dark circles. I still had to use a lot, and even when I did use a lot, it still never covered my dark circles or my red spots from previous acne, not even when I used a green concealer over them first. The only thing I loved about this product is that it didn't even feel like I was wearing foundation. My skin could "breathe". If you have naturally perfect skin that really doesn't need much other than foundation, you'll love this product. If you have serious dark circles, or dark spots, or redness on your face, then this isn't for you.
