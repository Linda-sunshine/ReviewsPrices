review/summary: Does its job, but button placement could be betterreview/text: I got this blowdryer to replace another one I had for a few years. At $20 and pretty good reviews, it was a hard bargain to beat.The dryer gets the job done. It dried my hair faster than my old dryer and I like that it comes with the two attachment pieces, though that seems to come standard nowadays with any dryer.My only comment is that the shape and placement of the buttons are slightly inconvenient. It's smack in the middle of where you'd hold the blowdryer, and since they are just big push buttons, it's very easy to accidentally change settings in the middle of using it. I use this dryer at least 3 times a week and, in the month that I've had it, I've accident turned it off or switched a setting almost every time I've used it. But let's face it -- when you're paying $20 for a blowdryer, you are getting it because it's good at its job and are not expecting any extra bells and whistles.
