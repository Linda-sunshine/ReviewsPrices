review/summary: Worked Immediatelyreview/text: I'm rating this high because I received on a Saturday and we are only almost one week into this product and my 3 year old son has already stopped sucking his thumb. The first day we felt bad for him because I guess that taste was just awful, he kept complaining "my mouth mommy my mouth", a lot of whining. He drool all day Saturday and I will rock and hold him because he was discussed with that taste. We laughed a little because he would think about putting his thumb in his mouth but then shake his head and scream at his thumb. As he sucked his thumb he would dig in whoever was close to him finger nails, it was soothing for him, but now that he has stop with the thumb sucking he no longer plays with our finger nails, like it went hand and hand together. I applied on both thumbs just in case he would try to put the other one in, the negative to this product is it does have a very bitter taste and unfortunately whatever they eat the first couple of times will have a horrible taste and they might not want to eat, but they will catch on if they don't put their fingers in their mouth they won't have that taste, and force them to use a spoon or fork when eating. I reapplied every 2 days.
