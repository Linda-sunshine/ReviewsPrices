review/summary: Loved it until it died!review/text: This iron was great until it died today. I purchased this just 2 years ago and used it maybe once a week. I have other curling irons I've had 10 years that still work - and they were cheaper! I'm am extremely disappointed, given the high ratings and the apppearance of high quality of this product. I am bummed!
