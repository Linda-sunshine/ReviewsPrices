review/summary: Fake Bare Escentials Makeup- Buyers Beware!!!!review/text: I have used bare escentials for years, so I know how the makeup appears on my skin. Once I received this makeup, I tried it and noticed there was no coverage whatsoever and suspected it may be fake. I did some research online and it said that there should be a batch number on the bottom of each bare minerals container and warned of the dangers of fake imitations due to the high levels of copper etc that could be in it. In order to confirm my suspicions, I went and retrieved an old container which I purchased from Sephora, so I knew it was legit. Sure enough the imitation was the same in appearance, but the major difference was that the fact that there was no batch # on the imitation (There was one on the good container) and the font on the bottom label is different.Buyers Beware as there is no telling how this makeup is composed and that in itself is scary!
