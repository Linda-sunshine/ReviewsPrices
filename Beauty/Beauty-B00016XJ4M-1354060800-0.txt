review/summary: Never switiching back!review/text: Previously I had been using Clinque's Clarifying Lotion but it had been very drying to the skin. Seeing as I'm a sucker for organics I gave this a shot, and I'M IN LOVE. It is not drying to my skin and I love the rosewater scent. Leaves my skin feeling clean but not dehydrated.
