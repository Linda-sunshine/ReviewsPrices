review/summary: On sexy scent! If you're a 5th grade teacher...review/text: Think of the smell your Teachers had. Very Grandma-like, kind of a musky funky closet smell. That's what this is. This is that scent. The EXACT scent. Don't believe me? Buy it. One whiff and suddently.. "Mrs. Smitherson...? I turned in my homework, I swear!"That being said, I love Auric blends and just because some of their oils are hit and miss; when it's a hit, it's a HIT!
