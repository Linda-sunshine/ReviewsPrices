review/summary: Works moderately wellreview/text: I've been cycling for a bit, and started noticing how bad the blackheads were getting on and around my nose, even after showering, scrubbing, and/or using facial cleaner. Got this product, have been following the instructions, and I would get some blackhead removal each time (once every three days).It doesn't seem to go in real deep and get all of them in one go, however. Also, it leaves a white adhesive-ish kind of residue in areas that have to be rubbed or washed off. But it works about as well as I expected it to, and my nose looks a lot cleaner than without.
