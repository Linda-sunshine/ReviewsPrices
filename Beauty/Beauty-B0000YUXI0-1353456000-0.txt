review/summary: It was worth a tryreview/text: My 4yr old son doesn't even want to stop and we have tried about everything. I read great reviews and ones that said it didn't help. Figured it was worth a try. He stopped sucking his thumb for 2 days, we applied it morning and night. Then he just didn't care and went back to sucking his thumb. I admit, when I first noticed him sucking it again, I licked his thumbnail and ICK the Mavala Stop was still on as strong as ever...he just sucked it anyways. On to something else I guess.
