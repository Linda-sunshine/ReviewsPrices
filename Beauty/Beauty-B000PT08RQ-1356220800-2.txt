review/summary: Good Valuereview/text: This wet/dry ceramic hair straightener does a fantastic job. I would certainly encourage other people to buy it. The only draw back is it may do too good a job drying the hair, to the point it makes your hair very dry. The solution is to always moisturize your hair and use an extra leave in conditioner when using this iron.
