review/summary: Actually works.review/text: I was skeptical for sure when I bought this, but I brushed my long hair &#34;wet&#34; and &#34;dry&#34; and the result was the same! It untangled my hair like no other brush has, I have no idea why it works the way it does, but it works. I have even tried brushing my nappy morning hair real fast and there is seriously no pain! I put this brush through quite a bit of work and it still does the job.
