review/summary: Keeping my hair straight since 2005review/text: I purchased my CHI 1" ceramic iron in the fall of 2005 (almost 7 years ago to the day!), and my hair still comes out as straight and shiny now as it did then. The only real obvious effect aging has had on it is that it takes a little longer to heat up (I usually turn mine on overnight to straighten the next morning). Every now and then, a few hairs get stuck between the ceramic plate and body and get yanked out, but other then that, I have no complaints!When I purchased this, it was over $100, and even at the price I thought it was a great deal. Now, it is less than $50 (!!), which is a STEAL (IMHO). Sometimes I use a straigtening product first (likeJohn Frieda Frizz-Ease Straight Fixation Smoothing Creme, 5 Ounce) and other times I don't, and never notice a real difference in how straight I can get my hair (so I have pretty much stopped using extra product in it).I have been the owner of many a "cheap" straighteners over the years that you have to run through your hair three times (at least!) to get it straight, and frizz still seems to be present. The CHI straightener takes just one run through a lock (although my hair is really long so I sometimes do two passes) to leave it not only straight, but shiny and smooth too.I knocked one star off because this puppy can get REALLY hot, and there isn't a lot of protection for your hand (keep it as close to the cord end as possible) or your ears (there isn't a lot of space between the sides of the ceramic plates and the body of the straightener).You will NOT regret buying this straightener (especially at this price). If/when mine eventually dies, I will most definitely purchase another one.
