review/summary: Actually Worked!review/text: My niece just turned 3 years old and was an avid thumb sucker. She sucked when tired, when watching tv, walking through the house, constantly. She gave no signs of wanting to ever give it up. I read some reviews about various products and read many positive ones about this product. I ordered some and gave it to my sister for my niece. We told her we were using it to remind her that she is a big girl and doesnt need her thumb. We also gave her a soft stuffed kitty to cuddle. She stopped in 2 days! The first day she tried to switch to her other thumb, but she didnt like that and didnt try it for long. She still puts her thumb to her mouth out of habit, but removes it quickly! AMAZING
