review/summary: Yes, I louve it !review/text: why dont salons use this for extraction instead of the painful extractor instrument !!i was skeptical whether it would work for me cos i dont have large pores and my blackeheads are usually deep set ! but it worked - its not 100% but definitely 80 %!! and that is so cool - coz it is literally zero pain ! it works wonders for people will large pores and pulls out almost 95% of grime ! :Dmake sure to tone ur skin after use with ice or toner and you will be glowing for next 15 days :)
