review/summary: Wow this really does workreview/text: The last brush I was using for brushing my wet hair literally snapped in half but this was after several years of usage so I wasn't upset just surprised. I was looking on Amazon for a new one when I came across these, after reading the reviews I decided to try and and have not been disappointed. This is the best brush I've probably ever used. I have medium length slightly curly hair that after getting highlighted can be very tangly. This brush easily works through the tangles and snags without hurting. My only concern is that some of the bristles are starting to bend already which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.
