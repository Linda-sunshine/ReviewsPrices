review/summary: Just what I neededreview/text: This is a great mask. Yes, it has a small herbal smell right out of the package, but that fades after a day. I love how it's big enough to completely cover my eyes without blocking my nose. The band is nice and wide, and there is plenty of velcro to adjust it to most people's heads.
