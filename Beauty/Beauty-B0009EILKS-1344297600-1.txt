review/summary: part of my weekly beauty routinereview/text: I've been using these for the last couple years now and I they have totally cleaned up and minimized the look of my pores on my nose. I recommend using a strip right after a nice, hot shower. You'll be clean and your pores will be open. It leaves your nose looking a little red, but goes away pretty quickly. No more blackheads after using this just once, it's great!For the rest of my face, I use100% Australian Tea Tree Oil + FREE Blemish Roll-on Stick with Tea Tree Oil. Tea tree oil is an amazing thing in itself. I tend to get pimples in the form of whiteheads and if I can resist popping them till I get home, I will apply some tea tree oil and the next morning they will literally have shrunk back into my skin. Really Good stuff. The blemish stick actually works pretty darn good too.So for blackheads get the pore strips and for white heads, get some tea tree oil. Okay, I think we covered all the different colored heads...good luck!
