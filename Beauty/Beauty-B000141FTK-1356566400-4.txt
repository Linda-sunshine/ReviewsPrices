review/summary: Best castile soapreview/text: I love Dr. Bronners castile soaps, and lavender is my favorite scent! I've tried them all. I use this in almost all of the cleaning products I make for use in my home. It can also be used for almost anything. It is hands-down the most versatile product I own. It can be used as a personal hygiene product, as well (shampoo, body wash, even toothpaste). If you're looking to become a little more eco-friendly, or you just want a very versatile cleaning product, I highly recommend any of the Dr. Bronner's castile soaps!
