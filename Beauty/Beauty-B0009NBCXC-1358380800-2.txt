review/summary: 4ozreview/text: This came packaged perfectly and sooner than excepted.I was mostly concerned about it shipping because my bottle of jojoba oil I bought from a local GNC started leaking out of the bottle so that was my main concern for this but everything came out perfectly. I have eczema and really dry skin and I use this every day when I get out of the shower and it's the perfect cure. It keeps my face moisturized throughout the day!
