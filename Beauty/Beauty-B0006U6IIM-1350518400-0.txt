review/summary: My new staple oil!review/text: Never in life will I go without this oil. I use it for my hair, skin, deep conditioners, body scrubs, shea butter creams, etc. This oil absorbs into the hair and skin very easily and is light, its also lightly reminiscent of that which it came from; sweet almonds. I noticed an immediate difference in my skin and hair after incorporating this into my regimen. Makes a great moisturizer for naturally curly and or kinky hair. Any hair that needs moisture should apply this oil after a shower when hair is damp but not soaking wet. I gifted my sister some of this as a part of a natural skin care kit I made for her for her birthday. She had no idea what it was and told me she wanted money (LMAO!), but called me two weeks later asking what type of oil it was, as she SWEARS her hair grew from this oil. (I also incorporated essential oils). I laughed and told her it was a mix of almond, coconut, jojoba, olive, and essential oils. She said she was going to keep at it because her hair loved it. (Also a natural who has curly kinks). Try this oil, you will not be disappointed.
