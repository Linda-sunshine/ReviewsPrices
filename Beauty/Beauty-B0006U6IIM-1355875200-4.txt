review/summary: This is great stuffreview/text: I use this oil as a moisturizer, especially in the winter, to keep my hands from cracking. It takes a while to soak in, but works great once it does. It lasts far longer than most manufactured moisturizers, but those are generally petroleum or mineral oil based... I prefer something organic, preferably plant based, without the alcohol and other ingredients found in typical moisturizers.NOW Foods makes great stuff and this is no exception. I'm also a big fan their grape seed oil, although it has an odor that some people find offsetting. Some people prefer this since it has little to no odor. That said, both of them are great moisturizers and are worth trying if you're looking for a healthy and long lasting moisturizer.
