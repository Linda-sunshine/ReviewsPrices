review/summary: Working so far..review/text: Started using this a week ago to stop the thumb sucking habit for my 3.5 yr old daughter. So far it seems to be quite effective. The first time I applied it to my daughter's nails she gagged a bit and spit rightaway when she tried to suck her thumbs, but it seems to have had a big effect on her. She has completely stopped thumb sucking for almost a week now, and I only had to apply it one more time after the initial application (2 days after the initial one). So far very happy with the product. The only slight concern I have is about the chemical ingredients in the product even though it hasn't caused any adverse effects in terms of health.
