review/summary: Best I've foundreview/text: After many years of luke-warm curling irons, I finally stepped up to the plate and bought a &#34;professional&#34; curling iron. Definitely worth the money...and this brand works very well. The caveat is that is wears out in about a year. And at the same place...the cord end where it joins the curling iron. I finally wised up and checked Amazon...about half the cost of the beauty supply store...so it doesn't pain me so much that I'll have to replace it in a year.
