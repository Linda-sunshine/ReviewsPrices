review/summary: Auric blends perfume oilreview/text: I'm really impressed by the quality of Auric Blends perfume oils. For being so cheap, they really are great! There's no alcohol or other fillers to dilute the oil, so the fragrance is very strong.Desert Night: in the bottle, the fragrance is very strong and almost has a insect-repellant quality to it. Do not let this deter you though! When I put it on, it mellows out completely and the floral and sandalwood notes become very prominent. After the floral notes fade a bit, I'm left with a very rich sandalwood fragrance that lasts hours. I think it fits summertime nicely.Divine Opium: This is a very sweet, almost heady, scent. It's a mix of spicy and floral at first. I think the ylang ylang and jasmine notes really make this almost too sweet for me. However, once it starts to fade and mellow out, it leaves a nice incense-like scent that will last hours. The spicy notes become more prominent as the floral notes fade, which is nice too.Magik: Smells like Christmas. Very warm, spicy and dark. It's very strong, a unisex scent in my book. I personally don't like it as a perfume, but it makes a good room fragrance.
