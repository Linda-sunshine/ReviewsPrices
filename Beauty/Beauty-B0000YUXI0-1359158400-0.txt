review/summary: It works but we had to do our part!review/text: This product did help our son getting rid of his nail biting habbit, but we had to do our part too. We had to make sure we don't forget painting it every night, gently reminding son of his bad habbit by reading a social story and a lot of support and encouragements throughout the process. It is difinitely not a quick fix or majic. One caution is it has a strong odor while painting.
