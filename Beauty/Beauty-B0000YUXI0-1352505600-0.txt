review/summary: Really works!review/text: Within a week of using this, my 4-y-o daughter stopped sucking her thumb. I was so shocked. She never went back to it, either.One thing I will say: make sure you follow the directions very closely. Also, due to the fact that the thumb-sucking was an automatic thing she did at night without even thinking about it, I had to wrap her thumb up at bedtime. She didn't mind doing that, and it never posed a problem.I'm so thankful for this product and I can't recommend it more.
