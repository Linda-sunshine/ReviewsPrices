review/summary: Love Dr. Bronner's soaps!review/text: We have been using Dr. Bronner's soaps for a long time now and the peppermint has always been our favorite. There is only one store in my area that sells it so it is nice to be able to order it on Amazon. This soap smells great, gives you a refreshing tingling feeling on the skin, and does not dry you out.
