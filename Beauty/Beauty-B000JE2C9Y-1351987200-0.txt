review/summary: Rapid deterioration over time.review/text: I was very happy with the sleep mask initially. I only had one issue: since I have a head on the smaller side, the strap was a bit too loose. The way the velcro is situated made it hard to tighten, but I got it to work good enough.A few months into use, the strap got looser and looser and looser. At this point, with the velcro attached at the loosest position, there is at least a fist-sized space between the strap and my head. My fiance likes to joke about my tiny head, but it really is NOT that much smaller than the average person's head. So this seems like a problem with the product.
