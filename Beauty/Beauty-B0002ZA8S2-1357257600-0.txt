review/summary: A Good Curling Iron but the clamp doesn't always holdreview/text: I like this curling iron in that it gets hot fast. However I'm not convinced it gets as hot as it should. My stylist has the same curler and it seems hotter but then that could just be my imagination. My biggest gripe with this product is that the clamp doesn't always hold the hair, no matter how small a section I pull. The clamp seems loose somehow.That makes it frustrating when I keep having to put the same section of hair back into the iron to curl it. I will continue to try using it, especially given the fact that my stylist swears by it. So some of this issue may be due to &#34;user error&#34;. However, I have since purchased another less expensive one and the clamp works much better so that kind of clinches it for me.
