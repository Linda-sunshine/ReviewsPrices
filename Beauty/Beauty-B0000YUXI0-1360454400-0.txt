review/summary: this stuff worksreview/text: i am 58 years old and my hands were so ugly. i was desperate to find a product that would prevent me from putting my hands in my mouth. this problem was so way beyond just nail bitting and had progressed to cuticles and beyond. i was a nervous wreck that couldn't stop.i researched many products online before making a decision.the mavala stop arrived 4 days after purchase. the fact that i did not have to pay sales tax was a bonus too!i applied the polish immediately to my nails and cuticles and waited for what was next.of course at some point in time, my fingers were in my mouth and my taste buds were instantly assaulted by the most foul, bitter taste ever. do not be fooled and compare this bitter taste to a lemon, lime or bad pickle. this stuff makes you want to run for anything that will get the taste out of your mouth NOW. just a head's up....water won't do it.it has been 5 days since my first application which i reapply everyday to keep the taste as disgusting as possible. in less than 1 weeks time, my nails have improved beyond belief! i actually have white at the end of my nail beds again and the skin on my fingers is starting to heal.i think 1 bottle of this product will be enough. all i have to do is look at the box and cringe!instead of avoiding jewelry that might draw attention to my hands, i am looking forward to a manicure next month.
