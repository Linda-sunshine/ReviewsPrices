review/summary: FAKE!review/text: I have ordered before from different amazon sellers and got the real deal, but this time I didn't get so lucky. This is fake! I didn't return it only because I am still using it. I have three little boys (2 are babies and one in lots of sports) and no time to drive 20 mins to my salon and buy the real thing from my stylist. It is still conditioner and smells similar but completly different (cheap) texture. To bad amazon is turing in to a risky place to get deals!
