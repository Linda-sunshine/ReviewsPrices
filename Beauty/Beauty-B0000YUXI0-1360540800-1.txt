review/summary: It Worksreview/text: You only need a little and it really works.My fingers were in constant pain because I never let the nails grow to a healthy length. This stuff works so well you only need a tiny bit on the end of your nail to be effective. It works so well that I actually cringe when I see someone on TV lick their fingers.Downsides include being unable to floss and not being able to touch my hands to my mouth.Upside = MY HANDS DON'T HURT ANYMORE!
