review/summary: Great hair dryerreview/text: This is a light weight, powerful, not overly noisy model. It does the trick for drying long or short hair quickly. Have not used the diffuser but it otherwise works well. It is not a compact dryer so I don't think I'd pack it for travel but great for home. No problems with the controls as some had mentioned accidentlly turning it off. Good price and I'm glad I chose this one!
