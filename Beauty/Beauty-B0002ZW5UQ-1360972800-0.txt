review/summary: It's pretty goodreview/text: It works better than SuperMillionHair which is what I used before. It goes on easier and clumps less, the color looks more natural but it is still dull. I keep my hair very, very short and close to the scalp so it blends in pretty nicely. The black color for Toppik is more black than any other brand i've tried but it is still kind of dull looking so be careful.
