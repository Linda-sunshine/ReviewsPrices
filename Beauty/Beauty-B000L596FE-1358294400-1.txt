review/summary: Great for long hairreview/text: With this brush I can brush my hair right out of the shower without using detangler or leave-in conditioner. I have very thick, long hair and although it is always difficult to get out some tangles, this brush really helps. I use it everyday and it has lasted a long time. Only a few bristles bent from being shoved in a drawer (on accident) but other than that it still works great and would buy again.
