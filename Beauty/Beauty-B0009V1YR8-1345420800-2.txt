review/summary: MAGIC!review/text: After my Sedu broke (which was pretty good) I had to go back to my backup Remington... until this beauty came in the mail. Having had to use my cheap metal-plated Remington, I am especially appreciative of the Chi. Now I get why the Chi is THE brand salons use. It made my hair salon-perfect in less than 5 minutes.I haven't had my hair this perfectly straight ever before except when having my hair done at a salon (probably with a Chi). I had gotten used to my hair being "acceptably straightened" using my other straighteners and given up on having salon pin-straight hair. I am so psyched I got this product for such an amazing price and that it works so well.I don't care if the warranty is void. For $56 I'll just get a new one if/when this one stops working. I love it!
