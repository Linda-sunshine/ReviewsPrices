review/summary: BEST DRYER EVER USED!review/text: I have used countless dryers in my many years but this one is by far the BEST! My hair has the look and feel of salon styling which I thought was unattainable at home. I used no products on it on purpose and dried my washed hair before going to bed. The next morning it still looked great! THAT has never happened before. It is shiny and smooth and just feels healthy. I will never again waste hundreds of dollars on high end dryers when Revlon puts out unbelievable equipment for under $20.00! OMG! I think I will get another one for my daughters to use as this one is MINE.
