review/summary: A good product but not for the pricereview/text: I was really excited to receive the Beauty Blender and had no problem shelling out $20 for what was touted as being the HG of makeup application. While a very good sponge, and it does apply makeup nicely, it's definitely overpriced and way overhyped. I have had mine for about a month and it already has a rips and tears. Worse, it's impossible to clean unless you buy their BeautyBlender brand cleaner.I'm reluctantly giving this 4 stars because the product itself does apply makeup beautifully, but so does my $34 Sephora foundation brush and that will last me two to three years, not two months.
