review/summary: Love this product!review/text: I don't usually review products but I am so happy with Toppik that I have to speak up. I have tried several things to try and cover my thinning hair - to cover the pink scalp peeking through. This is the easiest and most effective product I've found. Just sprinkle on a little when you see a "needy" spot and amazingly enough, it looks like you have hair there. It also lasts until you wash it out. Doesn't leave any residue on your clothes or give any other indication that you are using a product. I am so happy I found this product and plan to always have it on hand.
