review/summary: Terriblereview/text: I Purchased The Chi & I Plugged It In & Noticed It Felt Very Lightweight Compared To My Sisters' Chi Flat Iron. Then, It Wasn't As Hot As Theirs. Furthermore I Noticed That It Lacked The Chi Symbol. In Conclusion, Me & Other Friends Sat Down To Compare Our Chi Flat Irons & Discovered That The Product I Bought Was A Fake Chi Hair Iron. It Was A Bootleg Version & I Was Enraged. I Returned It & Hopefully I Am Refunded. This Experience Made Me Lose Trust In Buying Things On Amazin. Smh
