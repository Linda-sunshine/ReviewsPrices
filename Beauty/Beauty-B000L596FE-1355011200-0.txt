review/summary: No way to run a businessreview/text: It's the best tool for detangling that I used on my kid. It works somewhat while wet, but I don't think it's a good idea. It's always easier to brush when dry or drying. The "spikes" are very fine so I don't think it will last as long as the usual ones. But that's the price I'm willing to pay. Also, the brush handle is coated with some nice to touch plastic. From experience this softer layer doesn't last as much as simple hard plastic. So it get 4 stars.For hard cases of tangling you should be looking for conditioner. Some very cheap ones will do well if you don't care too much about the look of kids - the perfect silky voluminous look. For that look it gets expensive for adults. For natural alternatives the best so far is whole milk, and egg is better. A little bit of oil help but it doesn't look good. Since egg yolk smells, the best is egg white. Forget about what people tell you about the benefits. The slippery sticky stuff just can detangle hair if you use it as a conditioner. Egg white powder is much easier to handler and cheaper since you don't need to use a whole egg every time.Of course these natural and potential cheaper alternatives are not as good as some chemicals, the chief ingredients of which is soluble in water and oil at the SAME time. Therefore I need help from brush like this.I brought two "assorted color" brush, fully aware that there is no choice. But I ended up with two black brush. The way Amazon deal with multiple sellers is that when I order, I only see 4 non-black colors. Now when I writing the review I see a different picture with the 5th black color. To add insult to injury, the individually package have the words written on it "assorted color for the family".The seller is Discount Infomercial Products. I can't even seem to be able to leave a feedback. It should go back to eBay, or Aliexpress.
