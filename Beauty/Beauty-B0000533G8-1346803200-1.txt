review/summary: Great Product. Tricky Shipment.review/text: Dr. Bronner's is by far the BEST soap. Ever. Best. However, it's tricky to ship a gallon of it ... be prepared for leaks. Multiple attempts to deliver. But, the sender's were apologetic and prompt to send a replacement. Once you get it, it'll last for several months and well worth it!
