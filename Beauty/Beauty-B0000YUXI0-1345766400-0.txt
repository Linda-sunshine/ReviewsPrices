review/summary: Happy customerreview/text: My daughter's pediatrician recommended Mavala Stop to help quit her constant thumb sucking. I tried other products in the past that didn't work and to my surprise this product delivers! While safe, it taste horrible and after five years of thumb sucking she is finally kicking the habit with the help of Mavala Stop. I apply it every few days. I received the order quickly and would recommend this product if you need help to end a thumb sucking habit.
