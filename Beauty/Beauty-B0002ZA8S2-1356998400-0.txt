review/summary: Broke after 3 monthsreview/text: I purchased this curling iron back in September and the power control switch broke after 3 months of use. It is a little switch that you push forward and back to turn on or off and when I try to move it to the on part it just won't activate the curling iron. I use it everyday, but hardly would consider this good enough reason for the most important part of the curling iron to stop working. I would not purchase this item again. Curling irons I have used in the past lasted way longer than 3 months THEY LASTED YEARS....they shouldn't have such a sensitive switch!
