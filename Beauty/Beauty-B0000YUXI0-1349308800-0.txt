review/summary: worked in just 2 days!review/text: I put this on our son who is 6 and was getting picked on because he always had his hands in his mouth. We tried all sorts of methods before resorting to purchasing this product, because other reviewers said that the product transferred to their food- we thought that it was kind of- mean to use this stuff, but we couldn't solve the problem any other way and we were desperate to stop the finger sucking before he ended up one of those kids who are always getting picked on. We put it on him on a Friday after dinner, he actually didn't put his fingers in his mouth at all that evening because he was afraid of the taste- even though he hadn't tasted it yet! He told me the next morning that he put his fingers in his mouth while he as asleep and the horrible taste woke him up and he took his fingers out right away. He said that "my brain remembered that taste for the rest of the night" Well, I re-applied every 2 days like the instructions said, but I don't even think I needed to- he hasn't put his fingers in his mouth since! I only used it for a week and I haven't seen any evidence of him sucking his fingers- even since we have stopped applying!
