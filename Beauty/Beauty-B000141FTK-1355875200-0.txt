review/summary: Caught Up in the Hypereview/text: This soap made me realize how much I like soap lather. I never felt clean using this because it doesn't lather. I would use some with a loofa, and I'd have to add more 2-3 a shower session. I was going through way more of this than I would regular body wash! I'm sure it was cleaning just fine, but I have oily skin and need the &#34;reassurance&#34; soap lather provides.Basically, if you have OCD like me you may want to avoid this soap.
