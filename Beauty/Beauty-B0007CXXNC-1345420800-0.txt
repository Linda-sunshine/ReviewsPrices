review/summary: This stuff is AMAZING!!! Left hair super softreview/text: I just tried this for the first time. I bought a package, since I didn't want to shell out money for a big bottle. In the past I bought soooo much product, but I never was happy with it. I will be buying the big bottle ASAP! I just got done blow drying my hair and love the way my hair feels. It is so soft and healthy feeling. It looks good too! I didnt notice any smell when applying nor now. I used it with the shampoo (didnt care much for the shampoo imho) I didnt even let it sit for the full 7 mins because I got bored. I cant wait to try the other products. My hair feels like I just got out of a salon!!!
