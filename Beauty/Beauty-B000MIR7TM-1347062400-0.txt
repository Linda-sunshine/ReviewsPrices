review/summary: Throw away your brushes!review/text: I admit I was the biggest skeptic about this item. I had always avoided makeup sponges as they sucked up so much product when applying liquid foundation that I wondered why people even bothered to continue using them. I would apply foundation with my fingers but after it got too messy, I discovered brushes and invested in various types - one for powder, one for liquid, and another for concealer. I needed all three to adequately cover imperfections and achieve a finished look. It was a pretty tedious task but I thought this was the way it had to be. No more! I kept hearing about the beauty blender and decided on impulse to try it. I have been using this for about 2 weeks and I am amazed at what it does. It gives a smooth finished look with very little product and my makeup looks flawless and light. I am able to use the sponge tip to press foundation or concealer onto blemished areas and it covers beautifully without looking cakey. I honestly can't believe how well it works. I have used it with both mineral and liquid foundation and the results are the same. I don't know how this works the way it does, but it absolutely does what it says.
