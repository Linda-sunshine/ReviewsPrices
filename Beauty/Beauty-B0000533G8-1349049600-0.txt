review/summary: Good Natural Soap But Liquid Form is a Pain.review/text: I like the ingredients of this soap and it does get your hands clean but it's a pain to use in a soap dispenser. This stuff shoots out like a firehose in my Williams-Sonoma soap dispenser and then after awhile, it would clog up the dispenser pump. I tried diluting it but this didn't help much. I found it works best by just using it out of the container it comes in but then the lid gets all mucked up with soap residue. My recommendation is to go with Dr. Bronner soap bars instead.
