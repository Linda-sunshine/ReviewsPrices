review/summary: Drys my hairreview/text: The hair dryer works for me. Dryer my hair to perfection. The airflow is to my liking and the two heat setting are good for drying and finishing. I didn't think it was too loud and family members and guests sleeping while I dry my hair haven't complained. I would recommend this product.
