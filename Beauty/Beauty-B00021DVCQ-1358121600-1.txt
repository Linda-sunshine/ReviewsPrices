review/summary: Worst foundation ever!!review/text: I'm am 22 with no wrinkles or fine lines and occasionally have a blemish, this foundation gave me awful lines on my face (especially around my eyes) made my pores look large and doesn't coverage blemishes as good as it claims. It also doesnt last, even with the bare mineral primer. Not worth the money!!!!!
