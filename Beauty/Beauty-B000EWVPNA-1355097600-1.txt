review/summary: The Color Not What I Expectedreview/text: After I randomly saw a color I REALLY liked on some girl at the mall, I've been trying to find a similar color for myself and THOUGHT i had found it with Re-Fresh Mint. I looked up images of this color online to be sure, and although it looks like it has a greenish hue on most of the images, IT DOES NOT. If you imagine mixing a light blue color with something to add a SLIGHT HINT of a greyishness to it, then you add a tad of that to just straight up white, this is how I imagine you'd come up with this color. It's very light and has a definite BLUEish hue. I wish it was the green I was looking for, but it's not. And I can't tell if I'm just disappointed that it wasn't the color I was looking for, or if it just doesn't look good on ME, but I added a picture to the review so you can see for yourself. I'm hoping it grows on me...
