review/summary: I Love These Strips!review/text: The pores on my nose don't get that clogged, but I still use these once a week because it is the only way my boyfriend will do them with me. the pores on his nose are large and clogged, and these clean them out real nice!For me, there is usually only one of two little blackheads pulled out, but my boyfriend's strips come out delightfully disgusting and I have found that his nose pores are looking better and less noticeable.I wish I could post pictures!After use, the activated glue does leave a nose slightly red and dry, so it is a good idea to clean and moisturize after every use.
