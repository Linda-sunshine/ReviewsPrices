review/summary: game changerreview/text: This tool has replaced all other makeup brushes I own, which is a ridiculous amount. When you wet this small sponge it expands (make sure to squeeze all excess water out before using) and it blends makeup FLAWLESS. I use it for foundation, concelear, highlighter, etc. Don't second guess buying this- just do it. You won't regret it. (Ps- clean every couple days by purchasing a daily brush/sponge cleanser or baby soap!) It has changed the way I apply makeup (much faster) and so much more natural and flawless looking.
