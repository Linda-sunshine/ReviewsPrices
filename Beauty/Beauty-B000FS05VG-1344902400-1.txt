review/summary: Horrible Productreview/text: After using this hair dryer for a few months, it just overheated and stopped working. It was disappointing considering some of the positive reviews I had read on Amazon. You're better off with something else or simply picking up a $15-$20 hair dryer at your local drugstore like Walgreens. I did and have been using the same reliable one for several years now.
