review/summary: Where is the 10 star button?review/text: Okay..my daughter has curly blonde hair that she claims hurts more to comb than the rest of ours (she is 8 and has added some drama) but this brush is without question unbelievable. No more fights to comb her hair, no more cutting chunks out that she didn't comb. Glides through her hair without any problem and really gets the tangles out. This brush is it...miracle brush in my home. I ordered a spare just in case.
