review/summary: Sleep maskreview/text: This is a really great product, it really helped me to sleep better. It is especially useful because I live in a dorm and my roommate sometimes does homework late into the night and needs the lights on, so I just pop this on and instantly fall asleep. It did smell funny when I opened it out of the package.
