review/summary: Great while it lasted..review/text: I really liked this dryer in the beginning. It's pretty fast, lightweight, and had a great attachment for my curly hair. Last week it started tweaking out on me and would completely shut off. I played with the filter (not the issue), and finally realized it was the cord connection between the cord and the base of the dryer. I have been able to limp through my morning routine by finding an exact pressure and cord location that the dryer likes and trying to use it that way. It's awful! So, now unfortunately, I'm shopping for a new dryer. All I can figure is it is from the cord being wrapped around the dryer during storage? It's only 2 years or so old, so I'm pretty bummed. In all honesty, if you plan on replacing a dryer every 2 years anyway, you can't go wrong with this one, if you're looking for a keeper though...keep looking.
