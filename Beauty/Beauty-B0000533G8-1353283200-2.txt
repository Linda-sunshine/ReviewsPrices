review/summary: Great productreview/text: We are getting weary about the toxic chemicals that are in the commercial soap products. We are making an effort to wean off the toxic products. We tried making our own soap, but we did not like our own product. We found out about Dr. Bronner's soaps and tried the Citrus scented variety. It is great. Like other reviewers have noted most soaps tend to leave the skin dry and this one does not. My 3 year old loves the lemony-orangey scent (her words).
