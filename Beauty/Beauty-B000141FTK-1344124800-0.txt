review/summary: Buy itreview/text: If you're like me you're reading these reviews to see whether or not you should buy the product. Buy it. I bought the 16oz bottle and it is worth your money. IT LASTS FOREVER. For $10 you get a really nice body wash that, if you don't like it, you can use on your dishes. There is no risk here. I bought the Tea Tree and I really like it as a body wash, though I can't attest to its other uses. I will say though, don't get the rose; i haven't personally tried it, but nobody in the world has given it a good review, here or otherwise.
