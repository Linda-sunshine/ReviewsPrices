review/summary: DECENT SCENTreview/text: Was looking to add something new to my cologne collection and came across &#34;Nautica Voyage&#34; on sale at &#34;Amazon&#34;. In a nutshell &#34;Nautica Voyage&#34; is a decent scent for going to work, church, or on a cheap date. Smells okay but won't turn any heads......no &#34;wow&#34; factor.
