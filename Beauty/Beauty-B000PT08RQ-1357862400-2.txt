review/summary: Easy to handlereview/text: I love this product! My straightener broke and I needed to replace it and this is perfect. I'm going through Menopause and my hair is now frizzy, I was using products to take out the frizz but it always left my hair awful to touch and I just wanted to wash it out. I use this straightener when my hair is a little damp and my hair comes out like it was before Menopause and it's so silky to touch.
