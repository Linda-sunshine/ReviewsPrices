review/summary: EHHHHHreview/text: Ok, so this is the thing...sponges are great for applying foundation...but you could you get a pack of disposable ones for less than half the price without jeopardizing your skin. The shape of this sponge is nothing special and the brightly pink dye on it bleeds out. The foundation stains it, and it gives the appearance of being something dirty even though you know it isn't. All in all not saying it doesn't perform, it just isn't worth it in the long run...save your money and keep it fresh and buy makeup sponges at you local drug store and apply accordingly. I also prefer foundation brushes over wasting any change on this obnoxious item.
