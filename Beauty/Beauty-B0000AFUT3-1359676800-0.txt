review/summary: Very harsh, direct light.review/text: The florescent lamps shine directly into the users eyes. Even with the colored filters, my wife was too sensitive to the glare.Seems like a well made product and a good value if the light works for you. We sent ours back for a Conair that will take standard incandescent bulbs (night light size) that we use in place of the colored original ones.
