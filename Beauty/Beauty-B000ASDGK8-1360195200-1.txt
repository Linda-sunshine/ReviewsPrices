review/summary: Magicalreview/text: I spent about 3 weeks researching hairdryers and always ended up coming back to this one based on it's good reviews. I didn't know what to expect to be honest and I've only had this dryer for about a month and some change now but I absolutely love it. It's pretty quiet compared to every other dryer I've ever had and it's powerful too (for me anyway but I have fine hair) It only takes me about 4 or 5 minutes to dry my hair (shoulder length) which is really nice and the heat settings are perfect temperatures. It's really not heavy compared to many other dryers even though people say it is (but maybe I'm just used to big clunky dryers so this is a nice change for me) and the cord is really long so I don't have to feel confined to a small space when drying my hair and I can maneuver around my sister while she is hogging up mirror space. I don't like dryers that are so hot I feel like my hair is fried to a crisp and this one has a good temp to get the job done quickly without feeling like you killed your hair. I'm glad I finally made a decision on a hair dryer and I'm glad it was this one.
