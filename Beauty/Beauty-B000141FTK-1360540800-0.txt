review/summary: Don't read the bottlereview/text: Not sure what Dr. Bronner was smoking when he/she designed the label for this soap, but I'll take whatever she/he had when designing the actual soap. Very &#34;simple,&#34; smells great, lathers well on a loofa/Japanese bathing towel, and leaves your skin with that cool/refreshing tingling feeling. Doesn't get better than this.
