review/summary: Amazingreview/text: I love this item so much. I have a problem with biting my nails whenever I am busy thinking or stressed. This stuff has a bitter taste it can change even the taste if food you eat . My God it is ver bitter that now i think 10 times before daring to bite my nail.Do not try to use it for kids under 3 years old. It is transparent and it can be used alone or under the nail polish. By the way, it does not matter who many times u wash your hands to get rid of it. It takes at least 3 days to disapper. This happens when u always use water , otherwise it will take a week to go.
