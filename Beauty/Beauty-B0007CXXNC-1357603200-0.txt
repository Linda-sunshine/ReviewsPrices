review/summary: THE SCENT IS WAYYYYY TOO STRONG :((((((review/text: This works really well. It is not time-consuming, it's easy, and it works sooo great. It leaves your hair really soft and silky and hydrated than it ever would be. It is a little pricey, but on Amazon it is way cheaper than in Target, and the product seems to be authentic.ONE THING. It smell so, so strong. Looking at the outside of this product, it seems so natural and mild. But the scent it so strong i can smell it even when the jar is closed... Now, I am a very sensitive girl when it comes to scents, but the smell is strong even for someone not as sensitive as I am.It smells like a lot of chemicals.. not natural at all, not fresh, and it's kind of weird. Totally unpleasant. It smells like it tried TOO hard to smell good and then failed.I'm so glad i bought 8.5 oz instead of 16 oz, because that would have been a lot of money wasted.I wanted to love this so much, but turns out that I don't.
