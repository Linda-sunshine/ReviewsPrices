review/summary: GREAT product, AWFUL packagingreview/text: We use Dr. Bronner's soaps for everything- diluted for our bodies and hair in the shower, dishes, cleaning most surfaces. A little bit goes a long way with this product, and it smells lovely. When it is used around the house, everything smells minty fresh.The only drawback to this purchase was - when it arrived it had spilled ALL over the box! There was only about a quarter of the contents left in the bottle. It was so sad! But, we contacted Amazon, and they did right by us. I'm sure that they will adjust their packaging standards for this item in the future, so it is totally worth the investment!
