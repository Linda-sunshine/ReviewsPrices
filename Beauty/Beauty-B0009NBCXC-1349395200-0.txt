review/summary: Love this product!review/text: I was buying the expensive facial oils and mixing it in with my facial lotions for sometime now, but always had sticker shock when it came to buying a tiny little bottle of Suki oil for $30.00 bucks. So I thought I would give this a try and let me tell you this is just as good. In fact I went and looked at the ingredients on my expensive bottles of oil and 4 out 5 had Jojoba as one of its main ingredients. I have extremely dry skin and this leaves my face feeling moisturized and not greasy.
