review/summary: Not a good purchasereview/text: I had a Conair Infiniti hair dryer that was not working so well anymore, so I replaced it with this Revlon hair dryer. I had high hopes for it based on the reviews, and I was looking forward to having a lighter-weight hair dryer. I have slightly wavy, thick hair that I blow dry straight. I used this hair dryer for 3 weeks and every time I did, it made my hair frizzy and dull. I was so disappointed. I have now replaced it with a Conair Infiniti Pro, and my hair looks great again. That hair dryer makes my hair straight, smooth, and shiny. I did give this Revlon hair dryer 2 stars for being lightweight. That was the only nice thing about it.
