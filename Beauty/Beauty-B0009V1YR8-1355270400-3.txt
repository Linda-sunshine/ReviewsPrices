review/summary: The best straightener!!!!review/text: This is by far the best straightener I've ever used. Heats up and cools down quickly. I've had it for over 4 years and it still works great. Has an on/off switch and a pretty long cord. If you're looking for quality and effectiveness, this is the straightener for you!
