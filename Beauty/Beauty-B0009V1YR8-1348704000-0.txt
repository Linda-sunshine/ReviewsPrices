review/summary: Stopped working after 3 monthsreview/text: Do not buy this flat iron. The price is inciting, but it is sure to quit working, just look at the reviews. Plugged it in this morning, and nothing happened. Is this a fake chi? It looks real. Even if it is fake, it should work longer than 3 months. A flat iron from Walmart would have been better than this! Would you rent a flat iron for 17 dollars a month? Might as well have. I see others have had the same experience. Why is Amazon still selling this defective product? Is there no way to hold the company accountable for defective merchandise? Of course it is too late to return it to Amazon and the seller won't compensate you. Is no one accountable?
