review/summary: So many usesreview/text: I bought this for the primary use of a carrier oil for my face washing method, and it works great. I mix it with castor oil and apply it to my face before showering, it does not leave me feeling oily, and it does not have an off-putting odor, or any at all.I also used this oil while I was pregnant and my stretch marks began to itch, massaging a small amount onto my tummy after a shower made the itching much better, even it if did not prevent stretch marks. Lastly I use the oil as an unscented bath oil, which is very enjoyable and leaves my skin feeling moist but not greasy.
