review/summary: terriblereview/text: I normally love China Glaze nail polish but the one i received was terrible. It's thin and watery and wont go on well at all. I think it may have been more to do with the seller filling a half empty used bottle with remover to make it seem full. I am very disappointed with my purchase.
