review/summary: Moisture Geniusreview/text: My wife would always complain about her hair or skin being too rough. I got this for her once last Christmas and she's been in love with it ever since! Seriously this product has made a huge difference. For someone who colors or uses a lot of product in their hair, it can help restore the luster and softness. It clears up dry skin too. It's an all in one oil that's great for the whole house, too.This year I decided since the product worked so well for my wife, I'd share it with some of my other relatives. Not only did I share the Jojoba oil, but I found that the Jojoba oil mixed with Almond oil, another natural genius product, seemed to be even more of a crowd pleasing gift. I found a great deal on it from the same company-NOW Foods Sweet Almond Oil - 16 oz. + FREE Desert Essence Pure Jojoba Oil -- 4 fl oz. The combination use makes it last longer! A bottle would only last 2-3 months before when the girls used it regularly but with the combo deal, it gives you more bang for the buck and at least doubles the time usage! I would recommend these to anyone with dry hair or skin!
