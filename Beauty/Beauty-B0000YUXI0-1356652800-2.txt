review/summary: Failed Attemptreview/text: Unfortunately this did not make me stop biting. It tastes horrible but once you apply it its easily transferable to EVERYTHING! My food and especially when you're washing your face, I hated that! It felt like it was reminding me that I shouldn't bite but it was just too much to lick my lips or my girlfriend kissing me and we taste a horrible taste in our mouths that can't be so easily removed with water and soap. It might work for you but it surely did not work for me.
