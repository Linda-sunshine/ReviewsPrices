review/summary: The only 'soap' we usereview/text: I've been on the Dr. Bronner's train for at least a year now, and I'm not going anywhere soon. As far as a soap/shampoo alternative, Dr. Bronner's does the job better than anything I know of. Smells good, one bottle goes A LONG way (especially in the shower), and if almond isn't yourWe originally started looking for an alternative soap due to my fiance's hyper-sensitive skin (eczema), and long story short, Dr. Bronner's was it. She used to get 'break-outs' all the time, but these days, it's a couple times a year, at most. I believe the Dr. Bronner's helps contribute to the stabilization of whatever it was that was irritating her skin.As far as me, well, I just like the product. It feels like a quality soap, rinses off cleanly, and substitutes great as a shampoo as well.We also use it around the house (cleaning counter tops, mopping floors, etc), as well as on our pets.I also enjoy supporting Fair Trade products - I'm not wealthy, but I try to be intelligent about where/how I spend my money, and when I think of how many 'big box' items this saves me from purchasing, I'm a bit happier with the choice.
