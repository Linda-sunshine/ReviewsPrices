review/summary: As good as it getsreview/text: Wonderful product, lasts forever. I like to use this scent in the summer, but obviously, that's just a personal opinion! That being said, it works great as a shaving cream, and the citrus elements seem to have a sort of 'healing' element for nicks & cuts. Fantastic bonus.
