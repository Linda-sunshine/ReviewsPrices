review/summary: Works but doesn't get them allreview/text: These strips are okay, They do work and get our black heads but just not all of them. Ive tried it a few times and it still won't get everything out. Its says on the box only to use on your nose but I tried it on my forehead anyways and it worked fine. Just like my nose though it didn't get everything out.
