review/summary: Dreamland Maskreview/text: I use these to shut out ambient room light from streetlights and neighbors that like to light up the night, or when my significant other wants to read later and I want to sleep. They have an adjustable strap (velcro closure) that can be tightened to the desired pressure (enough to keep the mask on without causing pressure points that lead to headaches). There is also a small raised oval area on the inside that keeps the mask from putting pressure on the area around the eye. Other masks will butt up against your eyelashes and quickly become uncomfortable to wear.After a few months of continuous use, the elastic band stretches out and does not exert sufficient pressure to remain in place. Therefore, I buy a few at a time and simply discard it. Highly recommended.
