review/summary: Must buy NOW!review/text: I'm sad I've never come across this in my acne prone teenage years, but I'm ECSTATIC that I found this in my acne prone adult years! This stuff is amazing! After the first week, I saw such a difference in my oil production in my face, and then some! I decided that this stuff is the best thing since slice bread, so I'll list the results of using NOW jojoba oil after 3 weeks:1. Face less shiny, no new pimples. (I drop about 3-4 drops of it in my palm at night and slather it on my face, especially my crows feet, which by the way, are noticeably smaller in size. I put a towel over my pillow for the excess oil. In the a.m., I add 2-3 drops to my sunscreen)2. Rubbed some leftover oil on the back of my arms, which have Keratosis Pilaris. Within one night application, 50% of the bumps on my arms went away. Seriously.3. Received a bug bite and immediately put some oil on it last night. When I woke up this morning, the big red bump went down and I'm pretty sure after tonight, it'll go away.4. Put some on the split ends of my hair, and truthfully, not the biggest fan, but hey, if you can use one item for multiple parts of your body, it's a winner.If you have acne, Keratosis Pilaris, dry hair/nails/skin/humor, you HAVE to buy this. You won't regret it.
