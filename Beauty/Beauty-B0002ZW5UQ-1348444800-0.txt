review/summary: Great product at a great pricereview/text: My stylist told me about Toppik when she noticed how thin my hair was getting to be. She purchased the 0.36oz/10.3g for me from the local beauty supply. Even with her discount it was almost $25. But I really liked how Toppik camouflages my thin spots. Only a couple of people have noticed that there is something different with my hair. Only one person realized what the difference was, and only because she'd also used Toppik.Toppik is now a must-have product for me so I started looking for a better bargain and found it here. I get almost more than twice the product for only a few $ more.I would definitely recommend Toppik to anyone.
