review/summary: SO GOOD I'VE BOUGHT MULTIPLE TIMES (NOT due to defects!)review/text: I've been so HAPPY with this hair dryer that I've continued to purchase over and over again. I bought a second for my daughter since she kept using mine. We both have long hair, her's is fine and mine is I guess medium-ish. It works great for us both. Points to make:1. WEIGHT ISN'T AN ISSUE: Daughter started using at age 12 and though the dryer is heavier than her former one, she handles it with no problem and prefers it over her old 'light weight kiddy' dryer if you will.2. REPEAT BUYER: I've bought three now. Number 2 went to my daughter and number 3 was to replace mine ONLY BECAUSE I RUINED IT by plugging it into an extension cord that couldn't handle the heat and melted into the power pack. (The longer explanation for those interested is that I will use it as a bathroom warmer for my dogs. They don't like dryers right on them so I let it run on the counter, very carefully placed because of heat, and warm the room to help them dry faster. I have 3 Cocker Spaniels. Needless to say it can run upwards to an hour sometimes by the time I bathe all 3. So the heat from the power pack melted the VERY cheap extension cord and plastic melted onto the power pack, etc etc. It was TOTALLY MY FAULT!)3. EXTREMELY DURABLE: I have run it probably FAR MORE HOURS THAN MOST over time because I actually use it to warm the bathroom to help my long haired dogs coats dry faster. They won't let me blow dry them directly, so warming the bathroom helps them dry faster, in the colder months. So, it's certainly DURABLE to handle all that!!!!4. FAST: Dries faster and so though it's slightly heavier than most, you don't have to hold it long and so is never an issue.5. GREAT RESULTS: We NO LONGER HAVE ISSUES WITH STATIC ELECTRICITY in our hair! Great shine and body!6. CONVERTED FROM Remington: Another former Remington hair appliances owner now converted.7. COOL SHOT IS FAST: Cool shot button cools down faster than MANY others I've had over the years.As a person with long hair my whole life and I'm 50, this one beats all of them hands down, and I've been through probably DOZENS over the years. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!! Way to go BaByliss!!!!
