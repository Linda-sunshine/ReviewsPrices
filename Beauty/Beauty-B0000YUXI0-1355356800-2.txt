review/summary: Worked for us...year old habit broken in couple of weeksreview/text: We bought this for our 4 year old daughter. She had been biting her nails and sucking the thumb for over an year. We had tried &#34;Thumb Liquid&#34; and puts tapes on her fingers, but it not work. The first day we covered the thumb and fingers nails with the solution. She hated it and was vomiting. We then removed it with the nail polish remover at night. The next morning we just put a drop instead of covering the entire nail. We would put this in the day and remove it in the night for the first 3-4 days. After that we would let it stay. It would last for couple of days. Now after couple of weeks, she has stopped biting our sucking the thumb. She would bring it near to her mouth and then stop there. I believe she will stop doing in another couple of weeks.
