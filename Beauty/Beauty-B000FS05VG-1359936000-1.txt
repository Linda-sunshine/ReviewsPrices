review/summary: Worked great for one yearreview/text: I actually really liked this hair dryer while it worked. It dried my hair relatively quickly. It also came with both a concentrating nozzle to make my hair straighten nicely and with a diffuser that worked really well at drying my hair on cold days that I wanted to leave it curly. While the dryer works, it works well.It started giving me trouble almost exactly one year after I purchased it, right when the warranty ends. It started by sparking once or twice as I was drying my hair. Then it began to stop blowing at random intervals until I tilted the hairdryer in different directions. It wasn't the plug - trying this at different outlets yielded the same result. This was annoying, but it seemed that if I pointed the dryer in a certain direction and didn't move, it would continue to blow. Then, finally, it got so bad that drying my hair was impossible - the blow dryer was stopping more than it was blowing. I expected it to last for longer than a year, so overall, the purchase was a disappointment.
