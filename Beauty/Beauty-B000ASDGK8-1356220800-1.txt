review/summary: Great dryerreview/text: Do not hesitate, just buy it if you need a dryer. I had a fairly new one that they talked me into buying in the store but it is not powerful enough. This one is great and dries my hair in less time. I was always walking around with most of my long thin hair wet even after drying it with the Conair ionic 1875 but not with this one. The ceramic quality and ions and the fact that it actually is 2000 watts really makes a huge difference. I'd get it again.
