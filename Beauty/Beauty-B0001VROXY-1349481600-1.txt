review/summary: It is a pretty color , looks better in pics than real lifereview/text: It is so weird to me that this color looks so different in pictures. Even with my own camera it looks more pretty than in real life. I'm going to upload the picture, but you really won't know what color it is until you see it in person. I can tell you that if you are looking for a Tiffany Blue, this is definitely not it. It's still a pretty color IMO , but in a different way and in a different style.
