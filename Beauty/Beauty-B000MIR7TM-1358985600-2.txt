review/summary: Can't live without them!review/text: I have tried everything to apply foundation. I love Beauty Blenders but they are expensive so I tried other options. I got an expensive professional brush, and even the Sephora sponge but I ended up returning everything. There is nothing like the Beauty Blender. I wet it before applying my foundation so I doesn't go on as thick. There are no brush marks or blotchy spots because it covers so much area at once. I don't think I will ever go back to another application method. No matter how much they charge for the Beauty Blender i will continue to buy it!
