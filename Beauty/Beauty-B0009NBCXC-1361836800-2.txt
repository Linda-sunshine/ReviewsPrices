review/summary: Love it!review/text: I got this to use as a part of a natural/organic lifestyle, eliminating commercial body care products that contain harsh chemicals and known/suspected carcinogens. Jojoba oil was included in some of the shampoo/conditioner recipes I found online, but I found it too oily for this use. It makes a fantastic moisturizer though--I use it as a part of a facial moisturizer and I love that it gives a smooth, matte finish. I also use it alone to moisturize after shaving. Fantastic.
