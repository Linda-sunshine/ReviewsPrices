review/summary: What can't you wash with it??review/text: I was very skeptical of this due to all the "Hype" But I was pleased to be wrong. It works wonderfully.. I got the peppermint which should come with a will "tingle" or even burn sensitive skin.. Tip for ladies, a few drops in a cup of warm water makes a great makeup brush cleaner..Tip for the guys, 10 to 20 drops in a bucket washes the car amazingly.I love it at a face wash that tingles and makes your skin feel so clean. I use it with my clarsonic face brush.
