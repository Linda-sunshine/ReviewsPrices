review/summary: Great Quality. Great Pricereview/text: I just ordered this because I've come to realize that I sleep so much better with an eye mask.I've always know I've been sensitive to light in the room and would have to cover up clocks or rechargers or other things with even the tiniest light glowing a darkened bedroom. But for some reason I'd only used eye masks when I thought to bring them with me when I traveled. Recently I've been staying up way too late in the night and by the time I've gone to bed I thought to myself, if I want to get even a few hours sleep before sunrise, I should wear one of my eye masks. The first time I did I think I slept until 10 am! And I'm someone who would get up, no matter what time I went to bed, between 6 am 7 am. The two fuzzy eye masks I had (which had come with matching neck pillows for plane travel) were nice and did the trick. But I did notice after wearing them pretty consistently for the past few months that some light did leak in around my nose and they were really meant more for use on a plane or train, not moving around on a bed pillow for 7-8 hours.So I read the reviews and ordered this pair. I've worn them for two nights now and they're perfect. Soft, yet hug the face snuggly. Adjustable. Cute. No light leakage. And inexpensive. I'm very pleased. Might order more for gifts. Who wouldn't want a good night's sleep?
