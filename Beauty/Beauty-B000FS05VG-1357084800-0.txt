review/summary: Best option availablereview/text: Over the course of many years we've gone through many different blow dryers. For a long time I scoffed at the idea of there being any difference for this thing called ionic, until I tried it. There is a very noticeable difference. It makes the air coming through the blow dryer much cleaner feeling. I know this may seem strange, but it works. It means that your hair dries faster with less static. This is all we buy anymore for replacements.
