review/summary: If my house was burning down, I would grab this brush.review/text: I am obsessed with the wet brush - I tell people about it all the time. If you have hair that tangles easily, if the thought of washing your hair & not using conditioner gives you nightmares or if you have to brush your hair BEFORE you wash it just so it is as easy to comb through as possible....you NEED the wet brush. I honestly think if my house were burning down & I could only grab a handful of items, this brush would probably be one of them. No lie.
