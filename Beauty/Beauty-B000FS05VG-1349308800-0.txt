review/summary: Liked it until the sparks flew...review/text: I had this dryer a couple of years and it worked well. Kept the filter clean and used it daily. Eventually the dryer started emitting sparks into my hair. I rated it a three because it was a good hair dryer when it wasn't trying to catch my hair on fire.
