review/summary: It cleans everythingreview/text: I'm an avid backpacker and camper. When I learned about this soap, I was excited about all the uses it claims to have, and wanted to try it. So I ordered the tea tree oil version since I've heard tea tree oil can be an antiseptic, and it's nice having that when cleaning out wounds. I took about three ounces on a four day camping trip, and had about 3/4 of the bottle remaining. I used it for everything I could think of:1) Body wash and Shampoo - The soap left my skin and hair clean, and left a faint, earthy scent.2) Toothpaste - It cleaned my teeth and removed my bad breath, but it was still soap and I was tasting that earthy scent for a little while afterward. Still, it works if you can take the taste.3) Worked into a lather it can be a shaving cream.4) Washed out my pots and pans.5) Washed my clothes and fabrics of dirt and removed nasty smells.Anything I needed cleaned I used it and it worked with just a few drops of soap, and water. I've also heard it can be used to clean floors and wash windows, but I've not tried that yet. I was pleasantly surprised at how many toiletries and cleansers it replaced, and how little I used up when I used it so much. 32 ounces of this stuff is going to last months, even with daily use.This stuff is great for outdoorsmen, campers, backpackers, travelers, or people who want to save money by replacing so many things with one.
