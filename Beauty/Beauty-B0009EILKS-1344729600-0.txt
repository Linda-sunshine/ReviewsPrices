review/summary: Work pretty well.review/text: These work pretty well. They don't get all of the pores I thought they would. I can still extract from some pores manually after using these. They do rip off a layer of skin, thus probably why using them not more than once every 3 days is instructed. Avoid air pockets when applying by carefully pressing to skin as you put it on, sort of like rolling wallpaper, to get in the nose crevices.
