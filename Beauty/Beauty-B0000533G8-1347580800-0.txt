review/summary: Nice smell, and it's effective.review/text: I purchased this as an ingredient to a homemade multi-purpose cleaner, and also a possible ant-acne face wash. The smell and effectiveness were great for the cleaner, but the soap dried out my skin more than my moisturizer could handle, so I stopped using it. It would be interesting to try other types.
