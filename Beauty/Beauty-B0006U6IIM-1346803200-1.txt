review/summary: Best Almond Oilreview/text: I have been using this oil for the last 1 year and it has done wonders over the months. My hair was usually dry and I was balding out on the front. Then my granny suggested Alon oil and I started using Now brand. Over the months I have seen a significant improvement in the quality of my hair. I am able to wear it to work mainly because it doent not have an odour unline coconut oil. Also I use it over my face at times and it dries up pretty fast.Would definitely recommend to anyone trying to improve skin and hair condition.
