review/summary: Best Brush I've ever owned!review/text: I got this when it was on sale for a few dollars cheaper than it usually is, and I'm SO glad I got it! I've always struggled with getting tangles in my hair, and it is amazing how this brush gets them out with no pain, even when my hair is dry. I don't think I will ever get another kind of brush. If you have a daughter who cries when you brush her hair, get this !
