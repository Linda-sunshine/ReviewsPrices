review/summary: Good cleaner, but not on my hairreview/text: I use this now as a household cleaner and it is great for that.I it once on my hair. Washed and rinsed twice. Rinsed for 10 minutes and still couldn't get it out of my hair. My hair was as if someone pour wax on it. I couldn't even get a comb through it.Good for cleaning, but it doesn't work well on my hair.
