review/summary: The best make up blender on the market!!review/text: I am a professional make up artist based in Salt Lake City, Utah and this is my second purchase of the BeautyBlenders.I have yet to find a better blender on the market - that includes Pro only products from many many lines.When you use this product - wash it with baby shampoo first - it has some dye that has to come out before you start to use it. If you don't like the dye idea buy it in the white - for my purposes I would never be able to keep the white from staining enough to look clean and I was mine between each client. White just likes to hold pigment.Always use them just damp - get them wet and squeeze out all the water you can. It works best just barely damp.Use soft upward circles with the larger end over your face make up - for the smaller areas like your under eye - roll the egg across the your skin to blend.I also use a pounce method to blend in small amounts in dedicated areas - like the cheekbones. When you pounce you push it onto your skin and slightly twist upward, very fast.Love these!!!
