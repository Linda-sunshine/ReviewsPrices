review/summary: YES it works!review/text: I haven't tried these in many many years so I had forgotten how great these work. They work best when you get out of a hot shower since your pores will be more open. I applied to my wet nose and 15 minutes later removed tons of pore clogging oil. I am only rating it 4 stars since I had to use another strip, cut it in two, and apply on my cheeks just where the original strip ends. It works great but the strips need to be a little longer. After using, apply moisturizer.
