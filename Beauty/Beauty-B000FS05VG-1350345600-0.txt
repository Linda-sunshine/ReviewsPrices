review/summary: Great! (For a year...)review/text: My wife and I used this hair dryer daily for just over a year and we were pleased. Now it turns off unless I hold it a certain way, suggesting a wiring problem. Good while it lasted, but twenty bucks a year is a bit much for hot air. Will not buy again.
