review/summary: Counterfeit from third partyreview/text: I bought the CHI 1 inch ceramic hairstyling iron from a third party on Amazon in March 2012. Stopped working five months later and when I contacted the CHI company for warranty replacement, they determined that this model# GF1001 that I had was a counterfeit, because the one I bought said it was "Made in the USA" while the genuine CHI GF1001 units are either made in China or Korea. So, the CHI irons are great, but be very careful if you buy from the third parties on Amazon. You have to buy it from the regular stores or perhaps directly from Amazon, which may be OK, because the CHI company said that they can easily follow up if they sold counterfeit products but they cannot follow up with the third parties. I gave it a one star rating to draw attention to this issue; otherwise, the genuine product is a five star and I have been using the CHI products for ages.
