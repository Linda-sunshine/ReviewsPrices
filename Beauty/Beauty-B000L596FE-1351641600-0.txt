review/summary: Finally a tear-free morning at our house!review/text: My daughter, 8, has a TON of hair and it tangles horribly. I have bought every brush on the market, even the Knot Genie. But non of them compare to this brush. Finally she can brush her hair by herself! I use it on dry and wet hair and it works great. A local stylist recommended it to me and I am so glad she did. Now we finally have a tear-free morning before school!
