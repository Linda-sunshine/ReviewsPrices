review/summary: Best Choice ... Helps remind me to keep my fingers out of my mouth.review/text: Terrible taste is perfect.It does wash off quickly.I needed something to remind me to keep my fingers out of my mouth and this is perfect. I don't always realize that I am putting my hands in my mouth. It's a very absentminded habit. With the Mavala, I don't pick at the nails, bite them, or use my fingers to pick at my teeth. It helps me be more polite all around.
