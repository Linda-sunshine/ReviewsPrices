review/summary: Stopped serial thumb sucker in 2 weeksreview/text: My son is now 6 and has sucked his thumb for years. He also twirls his hair simultaneously and was developing a bald spot on the top of his head. We decided before he was 6 that we had to get serious. I had bought the glove with the thumb covered several months ago, but that didn't work, his teachers have tried forever, but with just a dab on his thumbnail every other night for 2 weeks (with his agreement, of course - he got a 3DS out of the deal on his birthday), he's no longer sucking or twirling. It must taste truly terrible. Highly recommend, and I NEVER write reviews. Note that I followed the advice of one Mom who said don't put too much on.
