review/summary: Best flat iron I have used.review/text: Surprisingly even though this flat iron is inexpensive it works very well. I own a higher end flat iron I paid over $100 for and it doesn't do as a nice of job on my hair as the Remington. Just be sure to keep the steam holes facing outward away from the head and it'll work beautifully. I just love it.
