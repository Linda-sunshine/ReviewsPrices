review/summary: Worked for my 13 year old chronic nail biterreview/text: I have a 13 year old who has been a nail biter most of her life. I am talking about down-to-the-quick, hurts-to-look-at-her-nails nail biting. She has not bitten her nails since using this product (over six weeks now.) I do not know how much of this was internal motivation, and how much was due to the Mavala Stop, but it has worked. I will say that I tasted the product myself (I would not subject my child to something without knowing how bad it was, and I certainly would not use it without her consent.) I found it very unpleasant, but not as bad as many reviewers have said. It is definitely unpleasant and bitter, and the taste is very long lasting. In fact, the rim of the jar had gotten sticky and I cleaned it myself earlier this week and apparently got some on my fingers. I got the taste in my mouth and it lasts for hours. It certainly would motivate me. So, six weeks in, I would say it is worth every dime and then some.
