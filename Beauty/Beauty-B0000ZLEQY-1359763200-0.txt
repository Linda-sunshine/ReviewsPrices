review/summary: terrible smellreview/text: I don't normally give products one star, but this scent is awful. I ordered black coconut, and it smells like some horrible mix of rubber and chemicals. Maybe with a hint of coconut.So if you want to smell like a car tire that may or may not have run over a coconut, this is perfect!
