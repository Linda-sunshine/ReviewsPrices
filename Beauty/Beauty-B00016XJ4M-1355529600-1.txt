review/summary: Trust the reviews!review/text: I bought this as an alternative to Dickinson's Witch Hazel toner that I saw at the store (has a yellow label, I think) upon reading the excellent reviews on here. To say the least, I'm blown away - this is a product of great quality. I've used it less than a week and my skin is already re-acquiring the glow I had lost since gaining quite a few pounds/ being under stress recently. The smell is divine - but then, Ive always loved the smell of fresh roses. It does not linger on the skin - so don't worry about that. The effect upon using is instant - there is a tingling sensation and the skin feels fresher, cleaner right away. I also bought a little spray bottle on here - and have filled that too with this. A nice mist once or twice a day is most refreshing. Im thinking of buying more bottles and keeping one at the office/ gym bag. Highly recommend this!!!Update: After using this and loving it after several weeks, I just picked up a bottle of Dickinson's witch hazel from the store. While I cannot comment yet on how effective it is for the skin - the smell is just awful compared to this. Its a herb-y, watery smell. I know myself, I like a nice fragrance to things I use (albeit a natural fragrance, nothing artificial or super strong). I stand behind my initial recommendation - go with Thayer's Rose-Petal!
