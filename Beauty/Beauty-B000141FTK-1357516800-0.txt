review/summary: Great for humans. Great for the home. My dog loves it too!review/text: This soap is a wonderful natural all-in-one cleaning product. While the product works well as a body soap, I use it to clean everything around the house - dishes, counters, laundry, floors... I really do mean everything. This soap leaves whatever you wash smelling minty fresh and clean. When used as a shampoo, the soap will thoroughly break down oils - which means you should use a natural conditioner right after. Because it's so gentle, Dr. Bronner's Peppermint soap makes a fantastic dog wash. I feel great knowing I'm not exposing my dog to any synthetic ingredients that might irritate him. If you haven't used this product before, what are you waiting for? You know what they say: once you go Dr. Bronner's, you may never go back.
