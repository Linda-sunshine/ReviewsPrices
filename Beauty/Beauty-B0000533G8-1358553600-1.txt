review/summary: Just look at the ingredients -- only the best stuff (and for such a great price)review/text: I use castile soap for everything: body wash, face wash, shampoo, kids bubble bath (can be eye stingy so watch that), vegetable wash (yes, it's that all natural) and even some house cleaning.Bronner seems like an interesting guy (some really kooky messaging on the bottle, but fun) and he nailed the secret sauce for all natural cleaning!
