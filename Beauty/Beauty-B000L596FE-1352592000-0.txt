review/summary: Caused Breakage on My 4C Natural Hairreview/text: I purchased this product after seeing it suggested by a youtube natural hair vlogger. Firstly, I wish I could have chosen the color of the brush when I purchased this product. I was lucky and received a pretty purple color and think that it's generally a pretty attractive product. I would have liked any color other than the black because when using a brush, I like to be able to see the amount of hair left in the brush after using it.I have tried this brush in two contexts and really did not like it much in either context. While I was transitioning from relaxed to natural hair, I used this brush to see if it would make detangling faster/easier. While it took less time than going through with a shower comb, I found that I experienced lots of breakage on my relaxed ends. My curls mostly stayed in tact but I wanted to hold onto my relaxed ends as long as possible so that I could extend the length of my transition. After 7 months of transitioning, it was time for me to finally "big chop." I loved my new cut and decided that this was a good opportunity to try the wet brush again. For context, I have mostly 4c hair. After trying it on one section of my hair, I knew it was time to give up on this brush for good. Though it detangled, I kept hearing that dreaded snapping sound of breakage. Using this brush caused less breakage than when I was transitioning but I can ensure even less breakage by sticking to my good old wide tooth comb and fingers. While this brush might work for other hair types, I would not suggest it for people with my hair type. For those who it does work for, I am totally jealous! :-) I'll have to keep searching for a product that will make detangling more efficient.
