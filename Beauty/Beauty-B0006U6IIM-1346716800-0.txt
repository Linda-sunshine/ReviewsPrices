review/summary: Natures Moisturizerreview/text: What could be better for the skin than a simple, one ingredient, all natural product? NOW Foods Sweet Almond Moisturizing Oil is fabulous. It's great for all over moisturizing. The best part is that it can be applied all over the face even under the eyes and on the nose. It's not greasy and absorbs into the skin as though it was something the skin had been craving. I prefer it to olive oil as a moisturizer. I'm so glad I found it. I've found it to be a great value and plan to use it from now on.
