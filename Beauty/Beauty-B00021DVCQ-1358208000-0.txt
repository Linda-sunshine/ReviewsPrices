review/summary: Cakey on larger poresreview/text: I so wanted to like this makeup, but it looks the most obvious of any foundation I've worn. My pores are nowhere near invisible, and that might be why it looks cakey on me even though I apply it exactly as taught and wait a few minutes after moisturizing. It is also extremely messy...the powder disperses through the air and gets everywhere. Also, for some reason i don't find it &#34;illuminating&#34; at all...I even thought i must have bought the matte version by mistake.I won't be buying this again.
