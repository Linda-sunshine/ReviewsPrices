review/summary: A Great Flat Iron!review/text: I bought the Chi straightener in 2008 and it is still going strong. I wanted something that would get very hot so that I wouldn't have to spend the 20 minutes it usually took me to straighten my hair. I've read a lot of reviews on here that this stopped working after just a few months or that the product isn't a genuine Chi. I have no idea at this point whether mine is genuine or not, but the only thing I can say is that I've had it for 4 years and I've used it almost daily. I've always made sure to roll up the cord after each use and tie it with the accompanying velcro strap. I also always have it sitting out on my dresser instead of jamming it into a drawer. I have no idea if that has made a difference in terms of longevity.My only complaint is that it is unclear the straightener can be used in Europe with the proper adapters. I read some horror stories about them frying over there despite adapters being used, so I decided not to take the chance. I have since started using a different straightener just because it does the job of a Chi and it is dual voltage (I travel quite frequently). That doesn't take away from my overall satisfaction with this product, however. I absolutely would recommend it.
