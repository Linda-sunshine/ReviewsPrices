review/summary: Even when I have 2 brushes under the sink, I'll spend 5 minutes finding where I left this onereview/text: I thought to myself, how much do I really *NEED* another hairbrush, but after rave reviews from my sister in law who also has long, thick hair, and the fact that I also have toddler girls, I thought I'd get one anyways.For fun, although it really wasn't, I brushed half of my head, post shower, with my normal brush. I then brushed the opposite side with this one. It was literally like I'd prebrused that side too. You really have no idea how pleasant brushing your hair can be without this.The ultimate test though was brushing my 3 1/2 year olds hair after her bath. She has long and thicker hair too. To be absolutely sure, I didn't hold her hair as I brushed it to see if she'd whine. Not a peep!I don't use this in the shower, but rather afterwards when my hair is still wet. The bristles look similar to a traditional brush, but they are softer and flexible. Therefore, when you're brushing, they give and let go of your hair instead of ripping your hair out of your head.
