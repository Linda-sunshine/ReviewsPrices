review/summary: It's an elixir!!!review/text: I found this while browsing online. Absolutely love it!!! My hair is pretty dry so it gets tangled easily. This mask is amazing! The hair is soft, shiny and moisturized . The smell is very fresh and clean. I mix a little bit of the mask with my conditioner, works wonderfully. The consistency is like a lot of conditioners. Highly recommend!
