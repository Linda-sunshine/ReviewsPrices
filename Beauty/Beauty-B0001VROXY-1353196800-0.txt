review/summary: Frostbite &lt;3review/text: I'm usually quite cautious when it comes to picking out nail polish colors but this winter I decided to go on a Blue trend. I wasn't sure what blue to pick but seeing the name " Frostbite " I decided to give it a try. Let me tell you something, this nail polish color is GORGEOUS! I recommend two-three coats to bring out the full color but wowwwwww! I never thought I'd fall in love with a blue nailpolish quite like this!! Now I'm looking for a color from China Glaze to act as an accent for this color. Absolutely recommend all the way!
