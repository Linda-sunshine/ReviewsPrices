review/summary: THE BEST STUFF!review/text: I recently had my hair bleached, which is the process for the ombre hair color. So of course my hair felt really bad after. I have never used a deep mask treatment before so decided to try this because of all the great reviews it got. I absolutely love this stuff. It makes my hair so soft and pretty. I wish I could use it more than twice a week. I usually leave it on for about 7 min. And it smells soooo good. If you have dry/damaged hair issues, definitely give this a try.
