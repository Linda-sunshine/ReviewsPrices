review/summary: best everreview/text: I tried several different kinds in my area...they were cheap &convenient..but just not comfortable &they were hard to adjust to my head so I go to my new & wonderful kindle fire and order about 3different ones....BY FAR THE DREAM ZONE SLEEP MASK was Perfect for me. it was satin soft & felt so so good on my eyes and kept the light out ....really a necessity for a migraine. so please don't ever stop making them !!
