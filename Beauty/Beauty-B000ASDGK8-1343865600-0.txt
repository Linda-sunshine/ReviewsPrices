review/summary: Amazing.review/text: I almost never write reviews but this blow dryer is amazing. I moved to Florida a year ago and my once great hair has been a frizzy mess ever since. I have tried every product my stylist has talked me into, to no avail. I finally bought this dryer (and an anti-static OG round brush), my hair not only looked amazing for the first time in a year but stayed amazing all day. Smooth and full of body. I am really impressed with this product.
