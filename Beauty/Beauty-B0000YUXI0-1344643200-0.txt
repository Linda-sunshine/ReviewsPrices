review/summary: Broke my 40-year habitreview/text: It works. I have been sucking my thumb since I was 3 days old. I am now 40 and needed a change. I didn't want to spend my whole life sucking my thumb. I needed to stop my 8 year-old daughter from sucking hers too. I agree with some of the other reviews where they state that it gets on everything. You can not like your fingers or thumbs with this stuff on it. I have used it for a little over a month and have officially stopped sucking my thumb after all these years. My daughter has stopped as well. It was great to have that buddy system going with her. I needed something safe and harmless but did the job and this is it. I suck on hard candy now when I need that sucking satisfaction.
