review/summary: Great Brush!review/text: My daughter hates to comb out her hair, so, though she's plenty old enough at 10 to comb it out on her own, I often ended up doing it after she got out of the shower. This brush has been wonderful! She can brush out her hair (on her own!) while it's wet and it takes the knots out, yet it is gentle on her hair. She loves how soft it leaves her hair. Great product!
