review/summary: Love it!review/text: I use this oil to combine with Po Sum On Medicated Oil for a massage purpose. Although Po Sum On Medicated Oil has a strong smell of menthol, Sweet Almond Oil does not have smell, which is a perfect combination because my husband is very sensitive to fragrance/smells. It made the massage really great and left skin feeling soft and smooth.Love it!
