review/summary: Straight into the trash can!review/text: I have been growing more and more desperate over my thinning hair, to the point, apparently, of total stupidity. The proof of that is the money I wasted on this product. Reviewers advised me to order a shade lighter than my hair, so I ordered light blonde. Unfortunately, light blonde is the exact same color as my scalp, so the powder did absolutely nothing for me other than rain all over the counter, and my shirt, and make me sneeze! If it weren't so overpriced for what is essentially colored talcum powder, I might be sucker enough to buy a shade or two darker than my light blonde hair and try again. But, times being what they are, I'm going to give it a pass.
