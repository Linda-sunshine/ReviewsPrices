review/summary: Ordered to replace my older, smaller barrel versionreview/text: Just used it for the first time. The barrel is quite large, but for my longer than shoulder length hair it's not a problem. This is my second Hot Tools Pro... never had any issues. I'm far from a professional and only curl my hair on occasion, but I would recommend this item.
