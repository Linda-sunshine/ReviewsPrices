review/summary: magicreview/text: this hairbrush is seriously magic. I don't know what it is that makes it work so well but it's amazing!!I have extremely thick waist-length hair and my hair is typically a nightmare after I shower. But my friend told me to get this brush and I ordered it thinking it would just be another hairbrushI seriously takes the knots out without pulling or anything. it's incredible.it's cheap price-wise but knowing how well it works now I would happily spend a lot more money on this.
