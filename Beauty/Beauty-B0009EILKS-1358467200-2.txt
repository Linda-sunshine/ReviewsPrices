review/summary: Good but not great.review/text: The first time I bought these, I expected them to be like every other product that claimed to magically remove blackheads. But a friend recommended it to me so I thought why not. First, throughly wet the area you want to remove blackheads from and apply the strip. Press down firmly and smooth it out to make sure there are no air bubbles. Wait until the strip is completely dry and peel off. It hurts a bit when you peel it off and to my surprise, it actually worked! It was incredible! I couldn't believe just how much crap was in my pores that I couldn't even see. I've been using these for years and I examine the strips for too long every time.Theres an odd satisfaction that comes from seeing all the gross stuff that isn't in your face anymore.The reason I gave this only three stars is that the formula used to be a lot better. The packaging is different and so is the product. It doesn't work nearly as well now as it used to. Another thing is that it doesn't work at all on the center of your nose or on your chin.
