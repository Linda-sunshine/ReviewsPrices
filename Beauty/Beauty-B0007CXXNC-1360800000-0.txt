review/summary: nervous because of news of fakesreview/text: I've bought this before at an Ulta and was excited that it was cheaper here. although the product smells correct and has a similar texture, it doesn't quite seem to be the color I remember. when I opened the package it seemed like perhaps the product had been opened, as the lid had product in the grooves despite the inside &#34;seal&#34; that comes with the product. I will betaking this home with me this weekend to compare it to the real thing-- until then it WILL NOT touch my hair.I simply don't trust it yet. I'll try to figure out how to update this review when I compare the two.
