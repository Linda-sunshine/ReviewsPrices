review/summary: Great product for a great pricereview/text: Acts as a good make up remover and toner. Does a great job of removing the residue that facial soaps leavebehind. I know Thayer makes other variations of their witch hazel toners, and I'd definitely want to try their lemon or lavender to compare. I feel like my skin feels smoother and appears healthier overall.
