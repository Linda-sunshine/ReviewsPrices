review/summary: A classicreview/text: I feel like this is the mildest of Dr Bronner's liquids, although the almond is also mild. The scent is nice, subtle, and slightly medicinal to me. It's good for the dog (diluted a lot), and for baths when really dirty. Good for camping, and travel, when you want to take only one item (a 3oz travel bottle could be enough for baths and dishes for a couple of days). Works OK on laundry, in a sink. It can be used on hair and as toothpaste in a pinch, although it's a bit harsh for that unless it's an emergency.
