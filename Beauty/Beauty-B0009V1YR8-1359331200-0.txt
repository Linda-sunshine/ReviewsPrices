review/summary: Counterfeit Ironreview/text: This product stopped working 6 months after it was bought. I emailed Amazon to see if there was anythign they could do and they said since it was over 60 days I would have to contact the manufacturer. When I spoke to the manufacturer and gave them the model number they told me that the iron was counterfeit. Very disappointing!! I thought I was getting a good deal by ordering this iron for $60 on Amazon when I was actually taken for.
