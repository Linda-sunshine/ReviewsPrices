review/summary: My favorite shampooreview/text: When I learned that the sodium compounds in shampoos were helping to make my naturally curly hair go straight, I looked for a replacement. This line of products is it. Since using it, people who cut and style my hair are amazed that this is the only product I use. No conditioners, gels, sprays -- just Dr Bronner's soap! It's the only bottle in the shower because it's all that I need. Saves me hundreds of dollars on conventional so-called beauty products. And now my curl is back!
