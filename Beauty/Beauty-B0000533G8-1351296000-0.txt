review/summary: Fantastic Soap--Highly Recommendreview/text: I tried this citric soap last year and use it in the foam pump hand soap containers (watered down about 2:1). It's foamy and strong but not harsh on my hands. I ordered a bottle at the beginning of the year and am just starting to run low. It has so many uses, it's incredible. I just ordered the peppermint to try a different scent, but do enjoy this one (it's a subtle scent, but refreshing) and just wanted to trying a new scent.
