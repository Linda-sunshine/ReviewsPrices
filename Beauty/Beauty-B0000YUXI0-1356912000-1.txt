review/summary: Tasted bad as advertised, but didn't work well for us.review/text: This tastes very bitter, as advertised, but that didn't seem to stop my daughter too much. When we first put it on her she avoided her fingers, but slowly got used to the taste and now it doesn't bother her at all.If your child doesn't get used to the taste this could work very well, but it did not for us.
