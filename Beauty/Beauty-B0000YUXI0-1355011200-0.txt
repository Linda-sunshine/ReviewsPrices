review/summary: nail biter of 10+ yearsreview/text: I have tried SO MANY different methods to stop nail biting and this is the ONLY product that has worked for me! It does not have a smell to it but if you lick your finger, touch your lips with your finger or bite your nail there is an incredibly horrible taste left behind. It is enough to keep me from even placing my hand near my mouth. GREAT PRODUCT!!! As an added bonus it leaves a nice gloss on your nails.
