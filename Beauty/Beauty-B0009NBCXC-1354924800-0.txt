review/summary: FINALLY HAVE FOUND SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY WORKS!review/text: I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff. I refused using those extremely expensive products that have so many chemicals (some of which I have no idea what they are) & just delt with my oily acne prone skin for 10 years. Well not anymore! This stuff has gotten rid of all my blemishes in 3 days of morning & night applications. I use tee tree oil based cleansing pads & 2 drops of Jojoba oil. (a little really does go a long way!) Byebye acne! It makes your face feel oily at first, but once it soaks in, your face is soooo soft. I also use a few drops with my conditioner in my hair every day. No more dry/flat/greasy hair! I've recently started putting drops onto my loufa with my body wash instead of putting it on my skin after a shower. Gets your skin just as soft without wasting as much! I buy the bigger 16oz bottle. Cheaper price per "oz" & lasts FOREVER. I will be buying this again when I DO run out :)
