review/summary: Lease looses after long time usereview/text: I got this eye mask about one and half yeas ago. I have to say this is a good product. However, the lease just keep loosing over time and eventually becomes way to big for my head and I have to get a new one. The lease just worn out. I dont expect things last forever, but I def believe there's way to fix it.
