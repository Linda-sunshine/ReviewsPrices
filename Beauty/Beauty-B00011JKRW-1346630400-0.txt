review/summary: Beautiful Color and Fast Service!review/text: I LOVE this color!!!! I saw it in a nail shop and had to have it. I went to the beauty supply and it was $11. I found it on here for less than $5! I got it in just a few days and it was in great condition. Not thick or old. Its my new favorite polish! Especially now that coral is in!
