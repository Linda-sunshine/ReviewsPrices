review/summary: Love itreview/text: UPDATE!! Ok, so I wasn't sure if I liked this or not when I FIRST got it and used it a few times. My hair was already in good condition so I guess thats why I didn't see much of a difference. I took this product with me to Puerto Rico. While i was there (before I tried this in PR) my hair looked crappy. The curls were ugly, not bouncy and it just looked dull. So I decided to use this..... And I'm glad i did. I left it in my hair for several minutes, rinsed, got out of the shower and styled. BOOM- my curls were back and my hair had LIFE!! Plus it smelled REALLY good. My hair was shiny, the curls were bouncy and I was happy. So was my husband because he loves my curls. I always get compliments on how nice my curls are and how good my hair smells lol. My mother loved the way my hair smelled so much that she went ahead and ordered one for herself. I felt bad for even doubting this product in the beginning. Whether it's fake or not- I don't know. Doesn't matter anymore. All I know is that it works. I even ordered the larger size since I'm all out of the first one i bought. Great product. By the way, I have long, curly, 3a hair.OLD REVIEW: First of all, I'm not sure if I even received the real thing or a fake. I've checked some of the real macadamia natural oil masque reviews on youtube and they were white, mine is beige. It did the same thing my neutrogena deep recovery hair masque does., But I do love the smell! i'lll continue using it until it finishes, but it's Nothing special, i was looking for that wow factor. Didn't get it from this. I'm going to see if I can buy the one ounce packet and compare products, I have a feeling it's a fake. If anyone knows for sure what the real product is supposed to look like please feel free to comment.
