review/summary: The folding areas kind of suck..review/text: Allow me to elaborate: you know those pre-cut slits that allow the strip to flex and adjust to your nose? Well as physics would have it when they fold and overlap each other, they make this little &#34;tent&#34; that doesn't stick to your nose, allowing anything under it to not get pulled out. It also doesn't reach down past the nostrils, which also have a ton of clogged pores.Hope that makes any sense :\As for the effectiveness of the strip itself, it's pretty awesome. The amount of pulled pore debris is astounding, to say the least.A brief note however: as soon as your nose is cleared, expect your nose to be suddenly oily as hell, now that they're given free rein to release oil out of their cleared pores. Make sure you have some facial cleanser!
