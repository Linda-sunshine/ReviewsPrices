review/summary: Smell good but after 4days all smell gone just oil in bottle now...review/text: Review about "Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess" by Day Dream..When I smell this once I got this product, I like smell, it's light and stay about 4hours on my body but on 4th day when I open this bottle and I don't get any scent smell, I thought I got cold but I asked my family members "did you guys smell this??" any scent smell is there? my family members laugh on me so badly, and we realized no more scent smell and it's "just oil now" in mostly above half of the bottle still remains....don't purchase this product by Day Dream.Yes I got Black opium from vendor name "Xtremek", that perfume oil still nice smell but stay only 4 to 5hrs.. but do not buy this "Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess" from Day dream this is the my bad experience of this product.... I tried similar products in India called "Attar from Ratlam Aerochem is company name" its nice one but bad luck that I don't get online so, I try this product....don't waste money on this "Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess".Smell gone after 4days, think if you plan to gift someone this product after 4days???? ugghghhhhh???Smell gone after 4days just oil now... Smell gone after 4days just oil now... Smell gone after 4days just oil now...- Thanks : HP
