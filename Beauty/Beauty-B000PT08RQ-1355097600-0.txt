review/summary: works amazingly, buuut...review/text: so i got this last Christmas as a gift. i was so excited, and i used it, and it is very easy to handle and to control, and it does as it advertises. the only down is that when straightening, the steam from the vents would occasionally burn my scalp. i like to get as close as possible to my roots when straightening, but the prevented me from actually getting as close as id like to. but this is amazing and overall, i would recommend it.
