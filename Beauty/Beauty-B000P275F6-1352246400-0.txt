review/summary: Matter of preferencereview/text: Frangrances are a matter of preference and I did not care much for this fragrance. It's too strong and smells cheap (to me). I was looking for something citrusy and fresh but this just turned out to be overpowering. This fragrance is manufactured/marketed by COTY and the quality is on par with the generic fragrances (also made by COTY) you find in a grocery store. It's cheap so I suppose you get what you pay for but I won't be using this one at all.
