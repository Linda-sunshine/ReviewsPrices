review/summary: Did not like itreview/text: This Egyption Musk oil smells ok, I wore just a dab to work and it made me and others around me sneeze alot. Also i broke out a little with redness and itching where I applied it. So I do not suggest this to someone who thinks they may want to avoid these issues.
