review/summary: A little oilyreview/text: I have used witch hazel on my face for years now and when I saw this one with the rose in it I was really excited. While I have oily skin this will clear it up and last for a little while but I notice my skin going back to really oily more so than I did with the Dickinson's original Witch Hazel. The smell is great but I don't think my skin likes this one.
