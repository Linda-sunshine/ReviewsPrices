review/summary: NOT impressed - pretty sure this is a knock off :( BUYER BEWARE!review/text: I've been using this product for years and thought I found a deal here on Amazon. NOPE! The product is extreamly poor and has no coverage whatsoever. I had to keep using more and more, and it wasn't doing anything for my skin. I should have guessed, this was only $14 vs. the real deal, $27 in my local dept store. I think I'll just pay the extra and get the real product. I will NOT be back.
