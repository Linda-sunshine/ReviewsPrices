review/summary: Perfect Moisturizer for Facereview/text: A little goes a long way! I use this on my face every couple days. You can use this by itself or mix it with your regular moisturizer.Sweet Almond oil also has a long shelf life of about 12 months which should be plenty of time to get through the 4 oz bottle. Doesn't taste or smell like anything, which is a plus for me. This oil has great anti-inflammatory and moisturizing benefits that will make your skin super soft and calm. Get it!
