review/summary: Awesome, and SO many uses!review/text: Like all Dr. Bronner's products, this soap is just awesome. I use it to bathe my baby, and also put a few drops in a little spray bottle with water to use with my reusable wipes. No diaper rash and baby is clean as a whistle.It says "unscented" but it actually smells awesome--very clean.A little bit goes a long way!
