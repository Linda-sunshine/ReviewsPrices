review/summary: I love tea tree!review/text: This is THE best all in one soap I've used. It has cleared up small bumps and redness on my upper arms. It also works great as a shampoo. This leaves you with a actual feel of being squeaky clean. Though you MUST make sure you rinse the product very well, especially if using in hair. It takes a few extra minutes to rinse too. It also smells great! I now use this as twice a week shampoo and daily body wash.
