review/summary: Yes, it worksreview/text: My son is a nail bitter. He does not like sitting still in school and watches the clock until the end of the day, he is 9 yrs old and continually bites his nails in school. Well, I put this on once and problem solved. First time he forgot it was on, he spit for a few seconds, and now he learned a lesson. However, it does only last a certain amount of time, and even though he promised not to bite his nails, he has forgotten so on with the Mavala again.
