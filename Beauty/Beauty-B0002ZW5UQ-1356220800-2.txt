review/summary: Perhapsreview/text: Initially I was thrilled to have temporary fix for my bald spots; but then I noticed that it goes on like a dry black dust (I use the black) thus making my hair seem dusty and dry.I will continue to use sparingly.All in all I like the fact that it hides, but I don't like the resulting dustiness. Any suggestions?
