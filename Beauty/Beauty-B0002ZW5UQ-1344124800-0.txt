review/summary: horrible packaging from this sellerreview/text: Love the product -- have used it in the past. However, the product from this seller came covered in a large barcode sticker which needed to be removed to be able to open the product. This left the container sticky. I tried using a product to remove the sticker residue but that didn't help. I can't wait to use up the product from this seller so I can buy a new one that does not leave my hand sticky every time I use it.
