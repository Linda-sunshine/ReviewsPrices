review/summary: Great productreview/text: This is a great hairdryer. It's powerful enough to be able to style my hair quickly and smoothly which is good as I am aways in a rush getting ready! some other users complained of it being too heavy but in my experience hairdryers which are lighter to hold don't have enough power to do the job to start with. Nice texture to hold and I don't accidentally change the settings in my grip unlike with some other hairdryers
