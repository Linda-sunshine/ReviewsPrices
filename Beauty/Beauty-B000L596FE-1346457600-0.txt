review/summary: GREAT for detangling on natural hairreview/text: I purchased this brush after watching a video review by jcokes7 and was impressed. I've used the Wet Brush with great ease on my kinky, coily hair. It glides through my hair with ease once I've misted it with water and applied conditioner. This is a must-have for any woman with natural hair, as detangling is super easy.
