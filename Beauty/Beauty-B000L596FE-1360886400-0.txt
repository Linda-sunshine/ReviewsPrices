review/summary: We love this brush.review/text: Three women in one house. I have long, baby fine hair. My oldest has straight, long, insanely thick hair. My youngest has kinky, curly, long, ethnic hair. We're all obsessed with hair products, and we're usually disappointed by our hyped purchases. I bought this at the salon b/c the hairstylest swore by it. I wasn't expecting much. I was wrong. Seriously, we couldn't live without it. We all brush the knots out in the shower with conditioner. It has saved time, conditioner and tears. I blow my hair out with it. My fine hair looks smooth and frizz free (a problem) when I'm finished. We've discussed stockpiling this brush in case it gets discontinued. This is probably my second review ever on Amazon. The last one was to complain. I'm a real person. For $8.++, how can you go wrong?
