review/summary: Excellent product for those w/ sensitive skin!review/text: I'm hooked on this product! My skin broke-out with the most horrible cystic acne, I began to use a cream on my face to clear it, and it started drying out my skin a bit. Thankfully I had purchased this product around the same time and used it in my regular daily face wash routine and it made ALL the difference. I recommend using a cotton ball (consisting of the product) and going over your face lightly after your regular face wash/cleanser, or even if your skin is feeling oily, dry...this product softens, and makes you feel fresh!
