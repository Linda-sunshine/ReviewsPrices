review/summary: Amazing repair!review/text: This mask is amazing. After lots of coloring, flat ironing, and curling, my hair has gotten quite damaged over the years. It's become thin, broken, and limp. I've tried various shampoos and serums to try and repair the fray to no avail. My stylist recommended this mask and after my first use, I'll never go back! I used this after washing my hair with the Macadamia Oil shampoo, in cold water since I recently colored my hair with Special Effects. I combed it through my damp hair and put a shower cap over it like a lot of the reviews mentioned. I was nervous that I'd have to use a lot since my hair is long, but a little goes a long way! I let it sit for an hour and a half. I used warmer water to rinse and could immediately feel how much manageable and silky it was going to be, even under the tap! I let it air dry and didn't put any other products in it. My hair is now extremely soft, touchable, light, and it smells great! I can't wait to see how much more it will improve with continued use.I bought this from seller Beauty Bazaar and have never used it before so I can't say whether or not I got a fake. Mine is beige with a little luster. It works amazing though so I have no problems whatsoever with it!
