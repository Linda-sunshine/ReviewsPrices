review/summary: It works.review/text: Honestly I was a little disappointed by this product. After reading the description and reviews I was thrilled and looked forward to a miracle. But of course we all know that perfect skin can't be obtained overnight.I have mild acne and scarring, but what really bothers me are the blackheads on my nose. I have really pale skin so any blemishes show up easily. I have tried scrubs and masks before but none helped. Some of my blackheads are very deep and i can feel bumps when I touch them.These nose strips are very simple. You peel the plastic backing off of the strips and apply it to wet skin. The water on your skin will liquify the gluelike substance on the strips. After the strips dry on you nose you peel it off.While it did pull out some oil and dirt in my blackheads, it wasn't much. And I feel as though the strips only pull out the surface layer of blackheads. So this will not work for deep pore cleansing.
