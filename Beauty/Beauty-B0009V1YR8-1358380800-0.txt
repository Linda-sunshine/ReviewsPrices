review/summary: It's real!!review/text: Well as far as I know. After I got it I looked up how to tell the difference between a real and a fake. From what I found its a real CHI. Or a pretty good fake at least. It works really well too. Makes my hair shiny and extremely straight. I paid $50 total with the shipping and I got a real CHI. So happy with my purchase. I keep telling my husband how happy I am, and I think he's getting a little annoyed. I did notice that the price for this on amazon will fluctuate. So if it seems too expensive, add it to your wish list and the price will probably drop in a few days. Get it, you'll love it!!
