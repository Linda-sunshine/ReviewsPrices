review/summary: This product may not be a good fit for standard soap dispensersreview/text: I was disappointed with the product: I was anticipating to buy liquid soap that I could use in my standard soap dispenser. Presumably because it is so thin (much thinner consistency than that of regular liquid soap), it squarts everywhere when you try to pump.
