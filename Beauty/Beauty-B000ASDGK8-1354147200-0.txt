review/summary: very powerfulreview/text: My previous dryer was a Chi brand. I liked it, however I took at least 20 to 25 minutes to dry my hair. I have a lot of hair and thick, so I was super suprised and happy how quickly my hair was dried with this Babyliss model. I was done in ten minutes! It blows very strongly, and though it comes in cold, hot and warm settings, the hot actually felt &#34;warm&#34; to me. It is quite heavy, too.Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.
