review/summary: Worked within hoursreview/text: WOW! I have a 4 y.o. who sucks his thumb. It is a nasty habit and had to be stopped. I heard a lot about Mavala and ordered it with big hopes he will stop this terrible habit. It took him one time to taste Mavala - and voila, no more sucking. We are talking about hours not days. I still apply it in case he reverses, but so far no sucking. I tried the product - it tastes very bitter. Thank you, Mavala!
