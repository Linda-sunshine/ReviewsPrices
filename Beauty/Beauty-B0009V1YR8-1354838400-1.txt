review/summary: Worked OK for awhile but gets worse with timereview/text: Only worked okay from the start. I had a different Chi before this, which worked wonderfully. I only replaced because that one will no longer shut off unless unplugged (but still gets about twice as hot as this one). I've had this one more than a year now, and it gets worse every month. It doesn't get as hot as it should and only does a mediocre job straightening my hair.
