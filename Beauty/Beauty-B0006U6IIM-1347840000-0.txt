review/summary: Moisturized but not greasy = PERFECT!review/text: I would recommend this product to someone with dry skin and/or scar. It is a very good source of Vitamin E which heals those problems. I put it on right after I took shower, the oil absorbs quickly, leaves no residue on my cloths or bed sheet and have no smell (like some other type of vitamin E out there. After only few uses my knees and elbows are now silky smooth.Try it!
