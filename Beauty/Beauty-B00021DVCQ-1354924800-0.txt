review/summary: Bare Minerals, headaches, eye drynessreview/text: Hi, I bought first start kit of Bare Minerals in Aug 2008. Every time I put Bare Minerals makeup on, I sneeze, eventually tension headaches and stuffy nose. I had documented time/date with Bare Minerals makeup... on/off like the switch. When I don't wear Bare Minerals, no tension headaches...use other makeup, nothing. On/off for 4 years till I learned more and more women come forward complaining about the side effects wearing BM makeup. I learned Dr.Oz said mineral loosen powder are not good for our lungs. I researched on them for few weeks and realized BM is not good. When I dumped total 8 of containers of BM makeup. I saw how much powders in and fly all over the air in small bathroom. Oh lordy, I put 8 plastic containers away in the recycle bin and trash powders. I'm back to liquid or tinted cream and no more loosen powders of any kind anymore. No tension headaches, no sneezing, no stuffy nose, no sinus aches, no eye dryness, all are gone and I am happy using Neutrogena and Almay makeups now.
