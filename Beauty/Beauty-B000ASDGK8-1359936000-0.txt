review/summary: I don't hate it but I wouldn't buy it againreview/text: There are a few design flaws in this dryer that aren't so annoying that I returned it, but are bad enough that I wouldn't buy it again.Firstly, the temperature and on/off switches are not raised at all so it's difficult to move them--especially when you are right out of the shower and have lotion and/or hair gel on your hands. I usually have to wrap my hand in a t-shirt to switch between hot and cool. Another thing that annoys me is that the handle vibrates when it's on. This is the first hair dryer I've bought that is any fancier than a $20 one from Target, so maybe all these higher powered ones do that--but the constant tingling when I dry my hair bugs me.The dryer has a ton of power, but I find that when I use the highest power setting, it just blows my hair around like crazy and gets it all tangled. I usually have to stop mid-dry to brush all the tangles out. And even though it's so powerful, I don't feel like my actual dry time is shortened.
