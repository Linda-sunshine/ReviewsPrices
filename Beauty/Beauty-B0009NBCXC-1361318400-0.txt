review/summary: lovereview/text: I mix this in my shampoos, conditioners and oil mixes for my hair. It helps my hair become nice and soft. I have coarse hair and highly recommend to people who may also experience shedding and breakage. Also add some pure olive oil in your mixes and it work hand and hand to hydrate and soften your hair. Don't use too much, Just maybe a quarter size per section of each oil.My hair is more manageable and have no breakage nor shedding excessively.
