review/summary: I love this straightener :)review/text: I have impossibly thick hair and it used to take me about 30 minutes to straighten my hair. Now I can straighten it in almost 10 minutes! It takes longer to straighten wet hair and it's a little poofy but it still works great. Definitely my favorite straightener.
