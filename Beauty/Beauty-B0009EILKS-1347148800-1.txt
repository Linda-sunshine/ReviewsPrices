review/summary: Work pretty wellreview/text: These work pretty well. You do have to get your face really wet in order for them to really stick. Pulling them off hurts a little, but not too much. However, I've used the nose ones for my upper cheeks and it really hurts to take them off there. The nose is fine, though. When you pull them off, it feels great to see all the black heads on the strip. The wetter you got your face, the better it will stick and the more that will come off. It doesn't get rid of everything, but it definitely helps.
