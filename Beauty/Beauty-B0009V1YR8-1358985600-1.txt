review/summary: Gets the job done, well worth the price and more.review/text: I bought this gift for my daughter. I asked her opinion because I was worried about all the review of the fake Chi's. She told me it was not exactly like her last Chi but got the job done on her hair and was well worth the price and more. I did spend a lot of time studying about the fake Chi's and I did find that the seller Abzoo sells their Chi's to Sears and Sears sells them in their stores. I thought this was good information even though I ordered the product without studying the information ahead of time. I was very worried but after doing my research and listening to my daughter I feel much more confident. I really hope it is the real thing.
