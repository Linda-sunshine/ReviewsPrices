review/summary: Like it!review/text: The mask is great for the price and has a nice aroma. I generally don't like scented items like perfumes etc. but the scent of this mask is more natural and not too strong (seems to be eucalyptus). The mask is lightweight so is good for travel and not too heavy on the face. The fabric is silky, a nice color and it's washable.
