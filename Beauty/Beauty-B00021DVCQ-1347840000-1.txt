review/summary: So good!review/text: I've been using bare minerals for over 5 years. In the beginning, it did make my skin a little irritated but that's because I have really sensitive skin. It took me a couple of days to get used to it and I don't use the primer. I think it works great and I also like the new cream concealer. It is awesome paired with the powder foundation.
