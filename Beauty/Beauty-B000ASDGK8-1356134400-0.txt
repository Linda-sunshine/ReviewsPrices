review/summary: quiet, relatively; never Conair againreview/text: This one is relatively quiet. Not muffled but a dull lower sound. It is impossible to have a quiet one that is also powerful.I had one of the Conair gun type dryers and it was a high pitched loud and it felt really plasticky and cheap. On the basis of this dryer, I would never, ever buy anything from Conair again.This Babyliss has a understated look, it is not trying to look rich, no decorative trim, no imitation steel or chrome, no stupid logo that starts to chip and fade away. It feels solid but not unduly heavy. Unlike Conair, it feels like it is meant to last a while.
