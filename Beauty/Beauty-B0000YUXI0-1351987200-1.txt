review/summary: WONDERFUL PRODUCT!review/text: My son sucked his finger. His dentist had mentioned twice that we really should get him to stop sucking his finger as it was moving his front tooth forward (you could see it and it was getting worse). Then my son got a scratch on his nose. As he would suck his finger he would also rub this scratch, which in turn got bigger and bigger and since he was rubbing it all the time it would not go away. I finally got so annoyed I started looking for something to put on his finger. I saw this product and the great reviews so I thought I would try it. I first put it on only his nail. It worked for a little while but not long enough. I then decided to put it on half his finger...it worked WONDERS. Almost immediately he wasn't sucking his finger anymore. I still put it on every once in a while to make sure he doesn't suck his finder anymore. THANK YOU for this product.
