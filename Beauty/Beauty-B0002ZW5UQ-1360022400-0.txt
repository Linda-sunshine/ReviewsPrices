review/summary: life saverreview/text: It really works for what it is intended to do. I only don't like how the fibers fly everywhere during application. They would leave a thin film on every surface near me whenever I applied it to my hair. I realized I had been breathing them in as well. This is probably why it felt like the product ran out too quickly.
