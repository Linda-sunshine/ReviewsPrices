review/summary: Make up Mirrorreview/text: I put on make-up everyday. I am one of those people who, WITHOUT A DOUBT, needs a make up mirror that not only magnifies my face ENOUGH, but also gives me enough LIGHT to see what I am doing. I went on the search for the "perfect mirror" about 2 years ago after my "CLAIROL" died and was no longer manufactured. I bought and tossed three mirrors before landing on the Jerdon. I have since purchased 5: One for my home, one for my summer home, one for my RV, and one for each of my daughters. IT IS AWESOME! BUY!BUY!BUY! You will love it.
