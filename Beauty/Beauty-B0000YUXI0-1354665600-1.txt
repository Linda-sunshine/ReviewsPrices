review/summary: It works!review/text: My son sucked his thumb and bit his nails for 5 years until we began using this product. We had tried everything including the bar across his upper palate. But this did it! He started remembering to stop all on his own. He used about half the bottle and it took about two weeks to reduce and two more to quit. Very very happy! We recommended this product to the dentist. We also gave the other half to his Kinder teacher who bites her nails. Totally worth the purchase!!!
