review/summary: Just like all the othersreview/text: If you look at the back of this mirror, you will see the metal stand....that holds the mirror up,... is held onto the back by 2 pieces of plastic. If you leave your mirror in the upright position all the time, this does not create a problem. I, however, need to fold the mirror and put it away when not in use.The plastic that holds the stand part on breaks very quickly, making the mirror useless. We have tried taping, hot gluing, and epoxying brackets onto the back of the mirror to hold the stand on, but nothing sticks to the plastic for long. If you leave the mirror in place, a nice mirror. If you need to move it or put it away after use, then this is not the best mirror for you.
