review/summary: Did a great jobreview/text: Actually this is my second time to use mavala stop,first with my older daughter and now with the second one both of them are thumb sucking,first time i use it when she is around 18 month(after asking her doctor)coz it says not recommend for less than 3 years but the doc said if u used once a week it should be ok,i used it once and she stopped immediately it was like a miracle,with my second i put for her twice,at the first time coz she kept trying to suck she throw out a little and she was very stubborn she keeps trying for 5 or 7 days but once she put it in her mouth she remember and stop trying until she completely stopped...
