review/summary: BAD investmentreview/text: This straightener was faulty from the first day of use - it wouldn't stay on long enough to finish straightening. Pressing the re-set button only worked for a few minutes, and then it was back off again. I found out the warranty for the product was not worth anything if the product was purchased online. Good information to know - wish that information had been disclosed BEFORE purchase. So I went to an authorized dealer and bought an authentic Chi with a 4-year warranty that I can actually use if it breaks.
