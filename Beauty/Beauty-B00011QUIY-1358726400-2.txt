review/summary: BEST CURLING IRONreview/text: I had many curling irons through the years and think this is the best one yet!! The cord is extra long and it doesn't get kinked like the others did. The heat settings are very versatile and the barrel is very smooth on the hair (not like some that are sticky). I love this new curling iron and would never hesitate to buy it again!
