review/summary: Not what I was expectedreview/text: I ordered this product based on the reviews that I read, makes me feel finally I found magic for my hair. I am look for product makes my hair moisturize soft look healthy, but this product do NOTHING to my hair. Since I have very dry fizzy and curly hair,I use it now twice a week on my hair but nothing change my hair as it still dry and fizzy. I'm very disappointing it doesn't worth the money.
