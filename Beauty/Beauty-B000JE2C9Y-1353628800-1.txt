review/summary: good sleep aidereview/text: I'm an RN that has to switch from nights to days every 2-4 months so I always try to find ways to help me sleep better through the day. I decided to try this sleep mask for the heck of it, it had good reviews and was very reasonably priced. I had read that it had a bit of a "scent" to it, which I did notice. It was a pleasant lavender-ish scent, but it only lasted a couple of days. I ordered two because my significant other and I both work nights; he didn't like the way it fit on his head. I however, don't notice it once I've started to drift off. Totally worth it, definitely helps me sleep a little sounder during the day.
