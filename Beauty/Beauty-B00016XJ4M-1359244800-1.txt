review/summary: Love it!review/text: My 24 year old daughter insisted I try this stuff. I have different issues with my skin than she does. It use it even under my eyes on fine lines - it is that gentle! I really became a believer after a couple of days use when I would wash my face and it felt so smooth and silky. It tightens and tones without drying. So whether you are in your twenties or fifties - give it a try!
