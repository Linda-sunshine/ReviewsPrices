review/summary: GREAT!review/text: This is such a great product! Before finding this, my makeup would sometimes look cakey and not smooth. From my first use, I knew this little sponge would work wonders for my skin. My skin look natural, and not heavily made up. Usually when I wear makeup you can sort of tell that I am wearing it, but not with this! After the first time I used this product, my mom actually noticed the difference enough to ask me what had changed in my makeup regimen.I also like how I do not have to use those little white triangle sponges that aren't reusable like this one. Also I found that I use A LOT less makeup than before when I used makeup brushes. This is great, because I can make each bottle of foundation last longer and longer than before.
