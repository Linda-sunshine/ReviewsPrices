review/summary: Oily and Not fast absorvingreview/text: Big disapointment after reading all the positive reviews. This thing is oily and does not absorve quickly feels like kicthen oil. I orignaly used Kama Sutra sweet almond oil which is impressive how the skin feels good. I tought I would be saving money by purchasing Now pure almond oil and have same effect as Kama Sutra oil. But I was wrong. This is a lower grade oil and very poor quality.
