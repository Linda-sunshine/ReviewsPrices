review/summary: Pretty Good Productreview/text: Dr. Bronner's soap is a great product for natural cleaning. I am used to the Whole Foods brand of castile soap, which is a lot thicker than Dr. Bronner's, but Dr. Bronner's works just as well. I fill a spray bottle with water, a few squirts of castile soap, and tea tree and lavender essential oils, which makes a great kitchen counter cleaner!
