review/summary: Keeps the chicken skin away!review/text: I have Keratosis Pilaris and this is the only soap I use because it really helps keep my skin clearer. I'm not sure if is the lack of sulfates or the acid in the orange/tangerine essential oils, but I know my skin does so much better using this vs. standard soap. I usually add a couple drops of patchouli or ylang ylang to even out the citrus and it's yummy!
