review/summary: Jojoba Testreview/text: This was my first test of Jojoba oil for my hair. I found it to be decent moisturizer, but for all the positive reviews I expected silky, soft hair, I did not get that. In fact, my hair felt oily, as if the jojoba rested on top of my hair shaft instead of being absorbed. I have used less than a quarter of the bottle in over a month, so I know I don't need to use a lot per try so I suppose there is value for money.
