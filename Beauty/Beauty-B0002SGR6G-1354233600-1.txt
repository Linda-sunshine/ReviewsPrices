review/summary: Love all China Glaze I have gotten from Amazonreview/text: The colors and longevity are wonderful especially when using base and top coat (Butter London is what I already had for base and top and it seems to work well). I love each and every color I have purchased but am new to colors other than neutrals and light pink and China Glaze is totally addictive. I am having WAY too much fun. Amazon has amazing colors and prices in sets.
