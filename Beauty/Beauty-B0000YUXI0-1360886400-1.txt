review/summary: No more chewing nailsreview/text: My daughter is 5, I haven't cut her nails for almost A YEAR since she chewed ALL of her fingernails - and toe nails (yuck!) off.So I finally stumbled across this on Amazon. I red the reviews and thought it was worth a try.And it worked - I have been cutting nails for two months now!!! The first time we put it on and she didn't think about it and tried to chew on her nails she was horrified!!! She gagged and kept whining for hours that she couldn't get the yucky taste out of her mouth. (She tried everything - candy, brushing teeth). I felt horrible, I thought I had scared her for life. However, two days later she proudly announced that she hadn't chewed on her nails in a full day. And now two months later we are still putting it on, just in case. She actually comes herself and reminds me to put it on her fingernails and toe nails. And sometimes she asks me if she can do it herself, and that is totally fine with me. :) She was so bad about biting her nails and I thought it would be impossible to get her to stop it, but with this it took about 2 days...... Thank you Mavala!!!!
