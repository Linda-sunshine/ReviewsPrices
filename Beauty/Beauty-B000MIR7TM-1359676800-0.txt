review/summary: not my best purchasereview/text: I purchased this item over the summer because of hearing good reviews on you tube, delivery was prompt but the product didn't really make much of a difference to me. I have used wedges, brushes and sponges in the past and the beauty blender doesn't apply foundation better than any other sponge or brush i've used. I do not have alot of scars/blemishes on my face but i love using full coverage foundation to hide those scars that i do have and i've found that my revelon concealer brush or a round brush applies foundation most wonderfully, the look is natural and never cakey. After purchasing and using this item it just went into the basket i store my other sponges in - i gave this item a two because delivery was good and it's my favorite color - pink! I would recommend if you're looking to buy a good sponge but in my opinion it's not the best one out there
