review/summary: Pressure against eyesreview/text: Like only one other reviewer, I too, dislike the slight pressure against my eyes when the Velcro band is tightened enough to prevent slippage. Loosening the Velcro strap to lift the mask a bit then allows light in (maybe only a problem for us light sensitive sleepers?) On the Plus Side, the mask is very soft. Also, after use for over a year, the elastic is loosing its stretch.
