review/summary: greatreview/text: I used this product to make homemade lotion bars for my sons horrible eczema. I found this very easy to work with and it worked well for what I intended. I did think that it would smell better (it had almost no smell) because it said &#34;sweet&#34; in the title. But the scent really isn't something that mattered to me for what I needed it for. It's very moisturizing and I'm happy with it.
