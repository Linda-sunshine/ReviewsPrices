review/summary: Ver poor lightreview/text: I would recommend that you heed the other reviews that complain about the lack of good lighting with this mirror. I had a Remington and I broke the mirror. The Remington is no longer available, so purchased this as a replacement. I liked the idea of the fluorescent bulbs, and was used to holding the button for a bit for them to warm up as I had to do that with the Remington. The light is so poor -for me anyway and compared to what I was used to.I would not recommend this product.
