review/summary: Super hotreview/text: This is the second time I bought this iron. Works great, variable temperatures, nice fat barrel. Use this to make big chunky curls. Just don't hurl it to the ground tip down, I broke the tip off....but totally my fault, it's not put together cheaply or anything.
