review/summary: Best Bang for your Buck!review/text: A &#34;best bang for your buck&#34; fragrance, Nautica Voyage is easily worth the 20 dollars or so that you'd spend to buy a large bottle. The apple, lotus, and mimosa notes blend very nicely to create a perfect casual summer cologne. Voyage goes on a little scratchy at first, but after 15 minutes or so it settles in and creates a beautiful scent trail. It's citrusy, with just enough sweetness to take the edge off, and the right kind of florals to round it out. What I like most about Voyage is that there's this root-beer like fizz in the mix of it all as well. What you ultimately get is an appealing and addictive accord that persists for several hours before settling into a skin scent around the 3 to 5 hour mark. Projection is average. Voyage is appropriate for any age and best suited for Spring and Summer.
