review/summary: favorite summer neonreview/text: I love, love, love this color for the summer time! It shows off your tan really well and is a nice neon without being unattractively bright. The only reason that I don't give it five stars is that it doesn't stay on nearly as well as my other China Glaze polishes. Even after using a base coat and Seche Vite, I still have a problem with it chipping after a few days. I've had this problem with every neon I've ever owned, so I don't know if it's something to do with the color, but it is frustrating. Other than that, I am thrilled with this polish and highly recommend this color!
