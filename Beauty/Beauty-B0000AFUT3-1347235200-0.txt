review/summary: Could be betterreview/text: In theory this is a great product, however the only part of the mirror that magnifiyes and moves is the small center part. The stand is somewhat limited and you have to have it on the right stand to be able to use the mirror. It's sad to me that they can't make the product as they advertise the product to be.Jerdon Classic JGL9W Lighted Tri-fold Mirror, 5x Magnification
