review/summary: A life saverreview/text: Thank god for this temporary concealer, without it I wouldn't be able to leave the house without feeling self-conscious about my thinning hair. I use a combination of the medium brown and dark brown. It takes a little practice, but you can make it really blend with the hair you have.I changed my review from 4 to 5 stars because this is the only temporary solution I can find to conceal thinning hair that actually works. Hair systems at salons that specialize in thinning hair are available, but if you are not ready to spend the money/time per year, and if you still have hair, this stuff really helps and works for men and women (I am a 33 year old female).
