review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: I got this to use as a part of body care for a natural, organic lifestyle--eliminating commercial body care products that contain harsh chemicals and carcinogens. I had hoped to use this as part of a shampoo mix, but I find it too oily for that use. It does make a fantastic body wash and shaving cream though. I love the scent and the lathering action.
