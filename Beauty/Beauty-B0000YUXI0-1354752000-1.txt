review/summary: Tastes terrible, easy to put on, stops thumb sucking/fingernail biting coldreview/text: This is the best stuff on the market to stop fingernail biting or thumb sucking. I have been a fingernail biter for a long time. You won't do it more than a couple of times if you put this on your fingernails.The taste is bitter and long lasting. It's meant to stop you in your tracks and leave a lingering reminder to not be stupid and try and put your finger or thumb in your mouth again. It takes a while to get the taste out for good reason.I used this on my son to stop his finger sucking. Two coats work better than one and it lasts about 3-4 days with full "flavor". Reapply afterwards. It only takes a few weeks if you stick with it and the thumb sucking/fingernail biting goes away.
