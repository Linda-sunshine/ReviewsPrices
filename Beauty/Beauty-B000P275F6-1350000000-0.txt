review/summary: Better than Expectedreview/text: Ive bought several types of name brand colognes through amazon that turned out to be watered down fakes in the name brand bottles, but this one was completely legitimate. Its a really nice aquatic summery fragrance with hints of cucumber, melon, and seaweed to start, then the scent changes to a more fresh smelling musk after a couple hours. The scent sticks on you all day, which is more than i can say about some of the disappointing fakes ive bought off amazon in the past... Trust me, you cant go wrong with this one. People will make excuses to stand near you just so they can smell it, very nice smell.
