review/summary: NOT worth the moneyreview/text: I bought this item on April 17, 2012. This item broke on December 23rd. I use this product maybe 3 times a week and there is no reason it should be broken. There is no manufacturer warranty by buying this product on amazon and there is only a 30 day warranty replacement as provided by amazon through this seller. This product hasn't even lasted a year! I am extremely disappointed and there was also not even a response from this seller about my complaint. Do not buy this on amazon or from this seller. .
