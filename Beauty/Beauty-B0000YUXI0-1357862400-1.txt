review/summary: So far its workingreview/text: I have the horrible habit of biting my nails. Been doing it for 15+ years and I got worse at it when I was pregnant. I have been doing this for just a week now but so far I have not bit one. The taste is pretty bad. You have to watch how you eat thing with your hands or you get that wonderful taste in your mouth on accident. I put nail hardener on first then apply this to the top of that every 2 days.
