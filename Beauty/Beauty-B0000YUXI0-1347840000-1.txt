review/summary: mavalareview/text: This helped very much! I tried everything OTC and even hot sauces but my daughter still kept sucking her 2 fingers so her doctor said to try this and OMFG IT WORKED! Just put on a very tiny amount! It is very strong! I tried it my self and it tastes nasty. It took my daughter 1 week to stop but I still put a little every other day just in case she might want to start up again. I swear by this product and I highly recommend it!
