review/summary: IT WORKSreview/text: I have tried just about everything to help me stop biting my nails and this is the only thing that I have found that actually works. I am a male so I was initially hesitant to try this, however the polish is clear and not very noticeable so I have no problem wearing this in public. I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and my nails already look better than they ever have. I will occasionally still try to bite my nails but the taste of this stuff is just bad enough to remind me to stop but not so bad that I'm gagging.
