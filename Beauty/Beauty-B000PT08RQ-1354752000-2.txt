review/summary: Didn't save time, but my hair looked great!review/text: I bought this to save some time, but it takes about the same amount of time that it did to blow dry first and then flat iron my hair--that could just be me. Also, my best friend is a hairdresser and she told me that it's not the best thing for your hair. It's not generally a good thing when your hair sizzles... That said, the results were awesome. I had a few flyaways on top, but it was smooth, silky, and looked nice.
