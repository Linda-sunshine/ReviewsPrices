review/summary: Flawlessreview/text: If you want a flawless look with no streaks and bumps then this is it. I find it is best to damp the beauty blender before applying the foundation. And then just pat the foundation onto your face until its all blended in.i only gave it 4 stars because i think beauty blenders are a little overpriced.
