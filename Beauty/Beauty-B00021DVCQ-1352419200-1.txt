review/summary: Does not cover as well as newer bare minerals.review/text: It's really a good quantity for the price. The only thing is that it doesn't cover blemishes as well as the newer bare mineral foundation. Therefore, I must use my new &#34;fairly light&#34; to cover blemishes then use this to cover all over.Overall, not bad.
