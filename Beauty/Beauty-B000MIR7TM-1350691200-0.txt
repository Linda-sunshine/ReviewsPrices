review/summary: What did I do before this??review/text: There is no cheap duplicate. I have expensive Chanel and MAC brushes. For an evening out when I want flawless makeup, this is THE TOOL. this is one item the makeup gurus on YouTube all agree on and I agree with them. I'm not a makeup artist. I just want to look like someone &#34;did my makeup&#34; when I have an important event, know I will be photographed, or need that confidence boost nothing like full makeup can give a girl immediately.This makes foundation application effortless and truly airbrushed. The only place I could find it was on Amazon. I ordered more as stocking stuffer-ish gifts for my mom next door friends who immediately noticed how amazing my makeup looked.The best part is that you can sheer your makeup down and actually save product with this.It's amazing. Love it! Seems pricey, but you get 2 in the pack and its pretty indestructible.Hope this helps!
