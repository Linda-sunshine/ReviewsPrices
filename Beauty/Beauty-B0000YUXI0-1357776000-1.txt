review/summary: Good stuffreview/text: Tastes disgusting, perfect. Most of the time I don't even have to apply it, my 5 year will not put his hands near his mouth just to avoid having to have it put on. The only down fall is when he puts his hands to his mouth to eat, he can taste it and then he loses his appetite.
