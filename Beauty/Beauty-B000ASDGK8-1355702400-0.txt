review/summary: The only brand of hair dryer I will own from now on!review/text: My daughter has the kind of hair everyone wants - full, thick, full-bodied and long. That being said, her hair is extremely difficult to manage. I bought this hair dryer because we've burned up several in the past several years and needed to find something more substantial to handle her hair. This dryer dries her hair in about 2 minutes (usually took 7-8 minutes) and it doesn't blow it around so much that it becomes more &#34;poofy&#34; after drying it. It takes me less than a minute to dry mine.The hot setting isn't super hot, like most other dryers I've owned and this could be why the hair isn't frizzed out at the end of drying. The air flow is strong enough that we leave it on the medium setting.Also worth mentioning is the fact that I found this exact same dryer at at BB&Beyond; for $25 more. I buy everything I can from Amazon these days!!
