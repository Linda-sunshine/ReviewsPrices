review/summary: Sold Fake Productreview/text: I am very unsatisfied with my purchase for the following reason.On September 15, 2012 I purchased what I believed at the time to be a Farouk CHI 1 inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron from this seller. This morning (January 4, 2013) I plugged the tool in to heat and shortly after it smelled of burning. When I examined the product, I realized that something must have short circuited with it as it was no longer working. This afternoon I contacted to manufacturing company to request a replacement. Upon speaking to the worker, I was asked to give the tool's model number and where it was made. When I read the information to the woman over the phone, she revealed to me that this the tool I purchased was a counterfeit product.I feel extremely deceived by this seller as they &#34;claim&#34; to be selling merchandise that is &#34;authentic&#34; when in fact it it not. While the price I purchased it for was lower than other prices I have seen, I am frustrated with this seller, as they are fraudulently advertising merchandise that is not what they claim it is. I would not recommend anyone purchase merchandise from this seller.
