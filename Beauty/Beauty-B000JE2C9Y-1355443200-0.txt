review/summary: Great sleep mask, no scent detected for mereview/text: Everything I could want in a sleep mask: big enough to block light out, but comfortable enough that I don't notice it when I go to sleep. Unlike some other reviews, I didn't detect any sort of scent (which is a good thing in my opinion). Also, I have quite a large head and the adjustable strap definitely helps with that. Would definitely recommend.
