review/summary: Works awesome for young children but use cautiously....review/text: Just as many other reviewers I bought this from my child's dentist to stop him from sucking his thumb. He is 3 1/2 and has sucked his thumb his whole life. I applied it one time and he has never sucked his thumb again....and I really mean never even put it in his mouth. His dentist told him that three year olds thumbs start tasting bad. We talked about that for a couple of days then I painted it on his thumb while he was sleeping, which sounds really mean but I honestly didn't want him to associate me with this horrible tasting stuff! He woke up a few hours later gagging and screaming and no matter how many times we brushed his teeth and gave him water it still seemed to taste badly. It was an awful hour to calm him down but it worked. Now I say to use caution because you don't need to apply that much, to the nail is plenty. Do not put it on their finger at all it is very very strong. My only concerns now that he doesn't suck his thumb (it's been about three weeks) is he has stopped napping even though I really think he still needs the nap. This could just be his age because I know a lot of three year olds don't nap but it seems to be coinciding with not sucking his thumb. His other issue he has now started biting his nails. I haven't resorted to painting this on for that habit but I might if it continues!
