review/summary: Great Dryerreview/text: This is definitely a good upgrade from a drugstore brand for not a lot more money, which is great. It packs a lot of power and has varied settings, although I typically stick to high heat for my long, thick hair.I have only one small complaint, but it is enough that I would knock a star because it's annoying- the concentrator nozzle does not fit tightly enough. If I touch the dryer to my hair while I am drying, it spins. This causes the "aim" to be off and I have to pause and fix it. Often. Further, it gets so hot that I can't touch it with my hands so instead I have to tap it on the counter top to realign the nozzle. I don't think the nozzle has ever fallen off in use, but it does pop off really easily if I am setting the dryer down. It's not the end of the world but it's kind of a pain. The overall quality of the dryer is definitely worth purchasing again, so I hope my nozzle was just a fluke. I already have my eye on a BaByliss ion dryer when this one kicks the bucket (it's been going strong for a few years now).
