review/summary: It's good stuff for frizzy hairreview/text: I color my hair (sshhh, don't tell anyone). And coloring it dries it out. Like, frizzy electric-shock-lookin' dried out. Tried store products - meh at best. Searched online for a cure. Found this product. Read reviews, felt hopeful. Bought it. Tried it. Loved it. Buying more.Other reviews suggested leaving the product on much longer than the directions, and I found that to be a good thing. Have left it on for over an hour, and find my hair really soaks up the conditioner. Hair was pretty flat the next day but soft and stays soft for several days. I use it 1-2 times a week (leaving it on for about 10 minutes) then do a longer leave-on about once a month.Found that macadamia nut shampoo is really good for frizzy hair, too.Update: been using this product for about 6 months. It's still one of the better products I've found but my hair is still a little frizzy and dry, but just a little. Have found a couple of products that are as good, but none that are better. So, I'd still recommend the mask.
