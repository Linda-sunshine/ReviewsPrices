review/summary: Not what I thought.review/text: I used to use Dr Bronners soaps years ago as a full body soap and I was looking for a more natural soap product thinking it might be better for my skin. I didn't get very good results, my skin felt dry and soapy even with good rinsing. Maybe my skin has changed since I have gotten older. It would not likely be the water hardness since I still live in the same area with same water supply. It also created a soapy scum in my shower that was hard to clean. On the plus side, he fragrance is wonderful! I use it as a liquid hand soap instead of a full body soap and my guests always compliment the fragrance.
