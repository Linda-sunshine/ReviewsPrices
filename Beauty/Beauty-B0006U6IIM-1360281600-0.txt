review/summary: Great moisturizer and all naturalreview/text: I had been using coconut oil on my skin as a moisturizer, make up remover, hair cream, you name it, I used coconut oil for it, but I have not tried any other natural oils, except for sweet almond oil which I tried a while back but the one I tried had a strong smell to it, so I'm so glad this one is unscented so I can add essential oils of me liking. I use this oil for body and face care and also for my hair, I love it!
