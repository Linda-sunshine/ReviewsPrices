review/summary: Wonderful under make upreview/text: This is a wonderful product that I apply on my face either at night or day and I have stopped using any other face creams. I am very happy with this product, it does moisturize wonderfully and it works great under make up - it does not clog pores, and I have a combination skin type. I highly recommend it. It can last for a very long time as you only need few drops if you use it on your face. I also use it to put on my hair roots to prevent from frizziness (but not too much or else your hair will look oily).
