review/summary: Peppermint Castile Soapreview/text: Used this product before Amazon purchase, but price value couldn't beat. I ordered the 64 oz instead received two 32 oz bottles that was my only disappointment. This product is excellent for people who have oily skin the fragrance is great for my husband. It helps shower stay cleaner than normal shower gel.
