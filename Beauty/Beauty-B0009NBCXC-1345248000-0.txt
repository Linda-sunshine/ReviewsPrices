review/summary: great multi-use oilreview/text: I like this oil for my face- however I have not used it enough to say whether or not it exercebates break-outs. But my favorite way to use tis is to make my own perfume oils out of essential oil with jojoba as the carrier oil. Works great, great price! Can also be used as a deep conditioner for hair. I like to put it through my ends and leave it there for a couple of hours before I wash my hair.
