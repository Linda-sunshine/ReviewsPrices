review/summary: Breaks Easily / Meh :(review/text: I don't flatiron often, so I wanted something that would be a long-term investment and when I first bought this iron, I was really impressed. But, after only a few months, I noticed the plates were cracked and the cord connection was damaged- and for a higher-end/pricier iron, it was kind of a let down (not to mention safety hazard). I've been using the old standby (Jilbere Ceramic-Tools 1-inch from Way Way BACK-IN-THE-DAY -- Now simply sold as Ceramic Hot Tools I think)and I think I'll stick to that for now, although I am considering purchasing a Solia in the future as/if the feedback is positive.
