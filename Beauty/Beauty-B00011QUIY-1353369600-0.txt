review/summary: Great Curling Ironreview/text: This curling Iron is great for getting that curl to stay. I got the 1.5inch to leave some bigger, loser curls. The curl stays in all day for the most part. I have yet to fing another curling Iron better than hottools. I gave it 4 stars because I do often get creases the clip on the barrel. This may just take some time to learn how to over come it.
