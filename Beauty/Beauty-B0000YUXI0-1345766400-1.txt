review/summary: the best out there for nail bitingreview/text: This is the absolute WORST tasting stuff there is...I've tried them all...every possible brand. This is the only stuff that worked for me and I am a life-long nail biter. It only about a minute for me to keep my fingernails away from my mouth. You have to watch out, though. If you eat any finger food the taste WILL transfer to whatever you're eating. But, again, worth it to stop the habit. This stuff is GREAT!!!
