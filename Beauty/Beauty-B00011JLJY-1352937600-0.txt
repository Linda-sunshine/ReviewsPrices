review/summary: its allrightreview/text: I do like the nail polish but the color is SO metallic it ends up looking a bit grey. The formula is also very very thin, but I like it. I prefer it to something to thick. the coats will dry fast so nothing to worry about. its a nice color, I just wish it was more black rather than grey. A good buy. I would recommend it, but not for a black nail polish. maybe for a dark metallic grey.
