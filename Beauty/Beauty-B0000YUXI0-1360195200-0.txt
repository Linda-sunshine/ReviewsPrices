review/summary: Well.. It does make you regret puting your hand anywhere near your mouthreview/text: I purchases this for myself to help me stop biting my nails. It does taste very bad, so it prevents me from mindlessly gnawing away while studying. The main downside is that you have to eat and if you touch your food with this on then your food will taste bad too. Even if you're not digging around in your food or licking your fingers, for some reason the bad taste doesn't seem to restrict itself to my fingernail where I painted it on. For some reason my whole fingertips tasted bitter too (maybe from touching my nails after they dried or rubbing them together during hand washing? b/c I was very careful when they were wet) and this transfers to food. I finally gave up using it because I became so frustrated trying to eat and prepare meals without making things taste poisonous. I was pretty careful to let them dry thoroughly and not touch them when wet but somehow the taste still was all over my fingers.
