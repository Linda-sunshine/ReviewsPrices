review/summary: Pleasantly Suprisedreview/text: Years ago, I saw Dr Bronner's soap for the first time. It was in a bulk container at a 'hippie store', and one look at the manifesto all over the bottle and I made the mistake of thinking it was more hype and label and not really good soap. Then a few months ago, my husband and I watched Dr Bronner's Magic Soapbox on DVD (and thoroughly enjoyed the documentary) and we had to try the soap. We started with the original peppermint. I LOVE the peppermint, but it's strong. If you aren't careful, it will burn your bits off. You also don't want to get it in your eyes! But if you need an exhilarating shower, that will do it for you! The peppermint is very soothing and great for when I have a headache, or if my allergies are acting up. We also bought the lavender, and are also very happy with it. It leaves a very clean feeling, with no residue. The bottle is expensive, but it lasts much longer than a regular bottle of body wash, PLUS there are no chemicals or additives that will adversely pollute the water. The product is good, the company is great, and I'm a happy consumer!Do watch the DVD if you like documentaries. It's nice to see a 'small business' stick to their roots, and it's very inspiring to see the passion that the family has to keep this company going and growing.
