review/summary: Four Leaf Clover.. Worth It!review/text: First, I'll have to admit, China Glaze is now my favorite brand of nail polish out there.. But Four Leaf Clover is by far the best green color I own, now it does have a blueish tint but it's a very good color and it only take a couple coats to be opaque.
