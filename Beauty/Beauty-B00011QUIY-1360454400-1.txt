review/summary: Decided to buy because of a suggest-did not disappointreview/text: I decided to purchase this curling iron based on the suggestion by Cara at maskcara.com. She uses the Hot Tools brand in all her tutorials. This product arrived quickly and is excellent. It heats up fast and stays hot. The black tip at the end of the iron is great to hold onto while curling hair. I would recommend this product.
