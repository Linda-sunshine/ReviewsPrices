review/summary: Works well but will only last 1-2 yearsreview/text: After using other irons, I loved that this one had a longer barrel to hold more hair (and long hair) as well as a larger area at the tip to keep you safe from burns. But that's where the good review ends.After using this for about 2 years, the clip is extremely squeaky (but I think this can be replaced). However, like a few of the reviewers say, the swivel technology of the tangle-free cord eventually causes the power connection to break and render the curling iron useless since the connection becomes very intermittent. At this point, I am just looking for a new iron that will last me longer than 1-2 years.
