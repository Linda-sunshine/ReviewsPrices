review/summary: NOT A REAL CHI, KNOCKOFF!!!review/text: Terrible Product. Tricked into thinking it was a real CHI. It looked completely authentic and I would have believed it expect the first time we turned it on it would not heat up. You could hold it in your hand and it would not ge any warmer. I thought it simply might be defective so I looked at the instructions. It was written in the worst broken English I have ever seen, most of the words were spelt wrong and commas were used where there should have been periods, ect. Do not buy this product!!!!
