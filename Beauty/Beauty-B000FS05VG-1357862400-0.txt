review/summary: Amazing!review/text: I never thought that just a hair dryer could make such a difference until I tried this one! I have been looking around for a good ionic dryer to speed up my styling time and provide better results (less frizz, shiny, more body).... almost purchased a $200 hair dryer until I came across the reviews for this Revlon. Had it shipped next day air because I was so anxious to try it. Let me tell you, the reviews definitely prevailed on this one! Hands down the best blow out I have ever had in my entire life, including salon visits! Usually takes me about 45 minutes to blow dry and style my short bob haircut, with this little gem it took 15 minutes!! I didn't even need to use my straightener to smooth out the ends. Super lightweight too! Can't beat the quality and price. Seriously best purchase I have ever made on Amazon!
