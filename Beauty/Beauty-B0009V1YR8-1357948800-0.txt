review/summary: Got a fake onereview/text: I got a horrible fake one!!!! The very first time that I turned it on ...the letters on the handle rubbed off !!!! This was a xmas present and it was so embarrassing to see that it was a horrible fake one. I will never buy something like this online ever again. I would just say pay the additional 30 or 40 and get it from Ulta or another legit beauty supply store.
