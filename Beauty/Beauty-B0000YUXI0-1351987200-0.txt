review/summary: Worked like a charm!!review/text: I bought this product because my daughter was sucking the skin off her thumb. She was about a year and a half. I know it says 3 and up, but, like I said, the skin was coming off. I applied it right to her thumb nail. She did not like the taste of it at all. But at 1 1/2, she would forget that it tasted gross and stick her thumb back in. Even though it says every two days, with the way she kept putting her thumb in her mouth, I ended up having to put it on a few times a day. After about a week, she stopped sucking her thumb during the day, but I continued putting it on her thumb at bedtime, just in case. Withing two more weeks, she stopped sucking at night as well.I definitely recommend this. :)
