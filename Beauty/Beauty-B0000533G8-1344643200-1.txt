review/summary: Great Product!review/text: I love this stuff! I use it every day and it doesn't dry out my extra sensitive skin. I also use it to clean my shower which I wasn't planning on when I ordered it, but it does a fabulous job. Dr. Bronner's Castile soaps are great, especially if you have sensitive skin that easily breaks out in rashes or it irritated by soaps/laundry detergents/etc.
