review/summary: Tastes nasty, seems to be workingreview/text: I bought this for my boyfriend to try to kick his nail-biting habit. So far, the stuff seems to be working great. He says it is disgusting and made me try it; I agree, it tastes horrible. A very bitter sort of taste. I would just say that you have to make sure to paint every 2 days. Sometimes he says he doesn't need it and it still tastes bad, but then I'll catch him biting. If we paint him every 2 days, he doesn't bite. Highly recommend.
