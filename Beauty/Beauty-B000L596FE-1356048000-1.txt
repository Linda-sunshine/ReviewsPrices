review/summary: First two were great, third smelled awfulreview/text: I have ordered two of these brushes in the past and both were fantastic, but the third that I just ordered smelled like someone smoked a pack of cigarettes over it. I can't believe how horrible it smells and it is currently sitting in its original wrapping in the box unusable. If yours comes wrapped in a plastic bag check the smell inside of it before gifting it to anyone!
