review/summary: Contains palm oil which is driving orangutans to extinction.review/text: I used to use this soap until I found out the company uses palm oil. Palm oil production is pushing orangutans to near extinction in violent and painful ways. I'd like to use this product if they would use an oil that isn't harmful to wildlife. Sidenote: "sustainable" palm oil is a green washing term. If you go to my profile, I advise where to get more info.
