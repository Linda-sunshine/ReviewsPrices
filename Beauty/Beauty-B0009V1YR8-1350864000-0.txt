review/summary: Only lasted 6 monthsreview/text: I bought this for my daughter because one of her freinds had one and said it was great. The one I bought for her only lasted 6 months. It will turn on for a second then it turns off. It started doing this about a month ago, now it won't turn on at all. I would not spend the money on another one. I definately would never pay over 100.00 for a chi if they only last 6 months. Maybe I was just unlucky and got a bad one.
