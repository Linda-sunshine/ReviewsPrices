review/summary: Smooth and Shiny Resultsreview/text: Much better than the cheaper models -- it's terrific at minimizing the frizzies. Not exactly a salon stylist blow-out, but not bad! The unit is well balanced and has nice quality control switches. A little heavier than the less expensive drug store driers, but well worth the performance (and cost) tradeoff.
