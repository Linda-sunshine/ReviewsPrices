review/summary: Seems to be working so far...review/text: The Mavala Stop product seems to be working. My daughter has constantly commented on how "icky" the stuff tastes, and has not sucked her thumb is 2 days. Will keep applying and working to stop! I recommend the product. It's easy to use (like applying nail polish) and we've not yet noticed any change in her diet (due to transfer of the taste to her food).
