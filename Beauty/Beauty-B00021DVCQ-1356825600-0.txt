review/summary: Quality Pure Makeup!review/text: I have very sensitive and allergic reaction prone sking - especially on my face. This light makeup is a good solution for me because it doesn't make me break out and it looks nice and natural with the right shade. It helps smooth and diminish the appearance of redness and dark circles. I always finish the look by applying the dark shade/bronzer as a blush and sometimes putting the mineral veil on top of the foundation and before the blush for longer lasting wear. I don't do this everyday, but whenever I have an outing or special occasion it looks nice.
