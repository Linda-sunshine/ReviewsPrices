review/summary: Hot Tools forever!review/text: Recommended by a friend of mine who happens to be a celebrity hair stylist (Cold Play, Julia Roberts, many undisclosed), I own two Hot Tools curling irons now and they're the BEST thing I've EVER used to curl my hair.I have very fine, stick straight, long blonde hair with zero volume. There is nothing much I can do to actually hold a curl for a whole day, especially not in the Pacific North West constant dampness.I've tried hot rollers, steam rollers, products, other curling and flat irons. And (see above) the best hair cut for me possible. Nothing. Half the time the first part I curl is flat again by the time I'm done with the rest of my hair. The rest of the times it looks nice for 2-3 hours and then goes flat again.EXCEPT with these curling irons!!! I use the 3/4 inch one for all over (lower layer curls up all the way to the roots, I leave the top layer straight from the roots half way down and curl the lower half from my ears down. Comes out really nice!). And I have a 1 1/2 inch one for my bangs to softly frame the face. I use it on the hottest setting and hold it quite long, for about 15 seconds.It's perfect, the curls come out soft, springy, shiny and they last even through the next day! And yes, I do use a conditioner (Its a 10 miracle leave in, best thing in the world btw). Still holds the curls amazing!I love love love these. They're the best thing that ever happened to me :)
