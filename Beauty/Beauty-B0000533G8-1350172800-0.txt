review/summary: Dr Bronners *magic* soap(s)review/text: Love Dr Bonnets soaps! I use 3 different scents depending on the time of the year. Leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean without dryness.Peppermint: I use this in the shower during the hot and humid summer months. Cooling tip: Don't towel off after you rinse. Just stand in front or below a fan and air dry. Brrrrrrr! With or without air conditioning.Rose: The first time I used this was my first shower after my daughter was born. I will forever associate the pure woods rose scent with this special time in my life. So glad I chose to pack the little 4oz bottle in my hospital bag. Highly recommended and had no concerns about nursing baby(exposure to chemicals) after bathing. I use the Rose regularly.Almond: I find the almond scent comforting in the cooler months.
