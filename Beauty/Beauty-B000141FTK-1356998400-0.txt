review/summary: The best stuff since sliced bread!!review/text: I bought this based on the recommendation of a girl friend to mix in with my usual soap and &#34;freshen&#34; up. Well, after receiving and reading the bottle -- I decided to make use the &#34;18&#34; other uses. We use this soap for many things - such as supplementing shampoo (feels terrific as a scalp massage!), cleaning my mom's bathroom (all old tile) and it removed all kinds soap scum and grout stains, I could go on but you get this point. This soap is the best! Wish I knew about it years ago!
