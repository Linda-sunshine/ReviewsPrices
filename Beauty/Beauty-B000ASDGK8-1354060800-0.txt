review/summary: Excellent Hairdryer but frustrating on/off switchreview/text: The drying power of this hairdryer is excellent! It takes me half the time to dry my hair (I was using a conair dryer previously). It also feels more durable and I really like the finish on the dryer. Some reviewers complained about how heavy it is but I don't find that to be a problem. I do notice that it's a heavier dryer but it's also a much better made product than the lighter cheaper plastic dryers. My only complaint is that the switches are almost flush on the handle. This makes it very hard to turn the dryer on and off when I dry my hair after getting out of the shower. I have trouble with my thumb slipping on the switch so I often have to use a towel to get enough &#34;traction&#34; to turn it on and off. This complaint is definitely not enough of a reason not to get the dryer, but it is enough of an annoyance to take one star off of the review.
