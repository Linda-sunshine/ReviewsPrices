review/summary: destroy my facereview/text: I bought this toner based on its high rating score. The first time I used it, it caused me a little breakout. I thought it's my allergic reactions to new product. The second time I used it, still breakout and a little allergic rash on my cheek. After the rash almost gone in a week, I used it the third time. Large area of allergic rash......itchy, ugly looking, and dryout. It's been over two weeks and still not get better. Not the right toner for me.
