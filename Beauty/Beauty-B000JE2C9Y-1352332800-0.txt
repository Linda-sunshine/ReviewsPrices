review/summary: Silky softreview/text: This is the second time I buy it, as I lost the first one and have missed it since. It is silky and soft against the skin, and great to sleep with even when you sleep on the side. They have build in something to stem the light by the nose, but depending on the nose form then there comes a bit light in still, but if I move the mask around a bit, I can almost remove it completely, so it doesn't bother me.
