review/summary: Loved It!review/text: Loved it. This is the second one of the same kind of curling Iron I have had. They do a great job. Just be careful not to put it too hot....I used the middle of the heat settings. I have fine and colored hair and don't want to damage it. Also be careful not to let it touch your skin. One can roll it right out of your hair without it catching and I even use it to straighten my hair as little.
