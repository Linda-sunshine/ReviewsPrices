review/summary: totally worth buyingreview/text: I was recommended to try this product by my cousin whose son quit biting his nails. After we tried applying Mavala Stop to my son nails he immediately realized how nasty his nails taste when he tried biting them again, but he continued returning to his habit as soon as the product effect would wear off. My son is 8 years old. He would continuously realize that product had to be reapplied again in order for him not to bite his nails and he would tell me himself to reapply it again. So once again it has to be applied at least twice a week in order to be effective.
