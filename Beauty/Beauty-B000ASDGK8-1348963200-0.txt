review/summary: LOVEreview/text: I bought this because my old hair dryer caught on fire in my hand - no joke. I wish I had upgraded sooner. This literally dries my hair in half the time, leaving me about ten extra precious morning minutes to get ready. It gets super hot and works well with a round brush to get my hair smooth. Only complaints - it is a bit on the heavy side (I personally don't mind because I am not drying forever, but if you have thick hair you might) and the "cool" button is RIGHT where my hand goes. Going to take some getting used to so I stop accidentally hitting it. Otherwise, perfect, makes me love my hair so that's priceless.
