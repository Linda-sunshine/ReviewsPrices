review/summary: YESSS!!review/text: This is my first time buying China Glaze and i was pleasantly surprised by the amazing color and how long it lasts. I was a little skeptical buying this color due to some of the reviews but in the end I am thrilled with this purchase. Some people mentioned a problem with the color itself, not being true to the bottle color and having to use a million coats. Well first I must say that person was a little dramatic and then I would agree that at first glance it seems that way. When I first got it and painted it on my bare nails I found myself to be disappointed but after playing around a little I found that if you put a single coat of white nail polish on before using this nail polish the color will be true to the bottle. You'll still need to use about three coats of this but trust me it's worth it. This nail polish is super fast drying which is great if you're in a hurry but I will mention that it has a matte like finish, if you're not into that don't let that stop you from buying this! Just add a top coat and you'll be good to go.
