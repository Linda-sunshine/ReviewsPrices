review/summary: A life saver!review/text: This has been the most helpful thing I have gotten all year. I have a kid whose hair is super curly. She is 4 so I had never used a blow dryer on her hair, as she has super dry hair, and I did not want to make it super frizzy. I started doing research on curly hair, and we started using these hair products called shea moisture, you can find on here but they are expensive. They sell them at walgreens for $10 cheaper. Also spraying her hair with water before brushing, to not rip the curls out, which happens if you brush it dry.Anyways, people were saying to use a tourmaline ionic blow dryer, and figured I would give it a try, and with the diffuser attachment its absolutely amazing! I can finally brush her hair in the middle of winter, and not worry about her getting sick from going outside with wet hair.I am very pleased with this blow dryer. It also reduces the static in my straight fine hair. Takes longer, but with the diffuser I don't have a static head!
