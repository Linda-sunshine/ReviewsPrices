review/summary: Your Choice..review/text: It's a great product; for those that are thinning at the top, I used it and it works. I knew if I chose not to get it or did not have confidence in myself, that this product may not be for me.I thought why not try hair plugs, but for someone like me that changes styles all the time, it's great...I can tell that this product has been tested and tried before distribution.It is TEMPORARY, it is not hair in a salt shaker. I have not lost any hair that I wasn't already losing.So now that you have my testimony it's now your choice. Good Luck
