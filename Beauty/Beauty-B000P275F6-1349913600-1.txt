review/summary: I should've listenedreview/text: With so many high reviews that this product got, I completely ignored the handful of them that warned of theories that it may be a tampered with product. I mean, how can something with 100+ reviews that mostly ships directly from Amazon be a knockoff. Well, a week in to owning this, and I'm 90% sure this is not a legit bottle of Nautica Voyage cologne.The first day or two was amazing. The cologne smells extremely fresh and aquatic and lasted all the way through the day without issue. I was actually able to smell it clearly on my shirt at the end of the day. That all changed by the 3rd use. The smell was still good, but seemed not as potent and dissipated drastically about 15 minutes after application, at least compared to how it was the first few times. This morning came as shock. Out of curiosity, I sprayed it on at took a deep whiff. The smell was pure alcohol, a sort of vodka smell, and then only a slight hint of the actual cologne. It's now a few hours later, and I do smell the cologne on my shirt, but it's a fraction of what it should be.Essentially, I think I got what I paid for: a $15 bottle of cologne. It truly does seem that the spray and tube did indeed have the actual cologne in it when I first got it, but the liquid in the bottle has been watered down with some alcohol. I'll continue to use this for work, because in it's preset form, it's extremely subtle and not intrusive. However, I can't wear it for special occasions or nights out. It's nothing more to me than a decent knockoff. It unfortunately is worth it's discounted price and not a penny more. Do yourself a favor, pony up a few more bucks and buy your cologne from a reliable brick and mortar store, lest you run the risk of getting a tampered with bottle like me.
