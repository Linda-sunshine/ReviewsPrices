review/summary: THIS WORKS!review/text: My 5-year old had a horrible nail biting problem- couldn't stop putting his fingers in his mouth, biting his nails as soon as they grew long enough, etc. It was difficult to watch. I had tried other products like this, but nothing worked. Within a WEEK of our first application his nails were growing and he was no longer putting his fingers in his mouth! Now a month later, we're just about ready to cut his nails for the first time ever. Of course, we used a lot of encouragement and positive feedback as well...but he is now so proud of himself that he was able to get this habit under control. Definitely recommend this product FULLY!
