review/summary: Less Product Left on Hair Shaft - Silkier Smoother Naturalreview/text: This Remington is amazing! It works better than my $90 Babyliss. I'm so happy with the results. I will always buy this brand of straightener... I'm not wasting another penny on so called high end straighteners! Sick to death of it, and not getting results that this little Remington gave me! Great Straightener!!For those who are upset that it didn't work as they thought, well, for only a small number does wet to straight straighteners actually work. The rest of us can only have a small amount of moisture in our hair, or none at all. And especially people who have extremely porous hair. This is what I read somewhere - can't remember where. Well, I'm porous wavy on the verge of curly in some areas.However, what keeps me, personally, coming back to the wet to dry despite it doesn't work is the ventilation plates which allows the steam to escape, rather than further concentrate on the hair. When using a plate without vents, the hair is crispier feeling, and product is left behind. With the wet to dry, the product evaporates as it straightens, leaving behind an extremely smooth strand with little- to- no product left on the hair. The hair is smooth and natural, and has a nice airy feel.Personally, the main thing is this will work well on hair after it's dry. For my hair type, which is very wavy - and worse it waves against my scalp, the hair drier method really doesn't work well. I'll be blowing for hours and won't get good results. So it's really a waste of time. I'd rather save myself from the added heat damage, and go straight for the iron after my hair has dried.So for this reason, it's important to have a hair straightener that will work with product directly applied to dry hair, and leave the hair feeling as if no product was applied at all. The wet to dry does that.
