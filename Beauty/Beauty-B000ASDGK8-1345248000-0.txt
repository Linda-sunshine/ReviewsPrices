review/summary: good dryer but is broken after 1 1/2 yearsreview/text: I really like this dryer which I purchased in March of 2010. It has been taken care of and used everyday by only me. The price has gone up almost 10 bucks and now I need another one because it's not working. Is less than 2 years all we can expect from this? I would give it 5 stars as it's wonderful- but 1 star for durability.
