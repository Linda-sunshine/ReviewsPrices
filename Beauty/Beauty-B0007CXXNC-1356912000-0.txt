I don't think it worked well with my hair! when I read other people reviews I was like wow that's it the magic treatment, but no that was not the case. I had curly highlighted hair. Now let me explain my hair is not super curly or dry its simply damaged of the sun and all the highlights, and etc.I try to use this product as direction, including using it twice a week only, still I can't really see the difference. again I highlight my hair and use hair straightener a lot.
