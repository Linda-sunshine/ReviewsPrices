review/summary: Refreshing shower scrub and so much morereview/text: This is a terific soap if you want to lower your carbon footprint. It's particularly great for camping: biodegradeable, multi-use (wash your gear, yourself, and I even know someone who brushes their teeth with it!). Highly concentrated, a thirty-two ounce bottle of soap goes pretty far. The company recommends their liquid soap in various dilutions for specific uses; you might have to get a feel for what ratio of soap-to-water suits you.The peppermint soap is a terrific a body wash -- especially refreshing on sticky summer days. If you use it for shampoo (I prefer something else, as the Dr. Bronner's builds up on my hair), you'll probably want to alternate with a favorite clarifying shampoo.It looks like a few people have tried it in pump dispensers for hand soap -- the soap is very liquid because there are no thickeners added to it and that might be why it didn't work so well. I've seen the same soap in many sizes -- a two-, four-, or eight-ounce pourable bottle or the bar soap might work better.Aside from the peppermint zing, my heart's fondness is for the Dr. Bronner's labels, because when you're bored out of your mind, the enthusiastically positive labels on the bottles make for fun and optimistic reading.
