review/summary: Usually I'm not into natural products, but I love Dr. Bronner's Castille soapreview/text: Usually I don't really care about natural products and am daunted by their price, but Dr. Bronner's castille soaps are worth it. Although the almond liquid castille soap is not as sweet as I was expecting, it's still a very pleasant scent and is very moisturizing. I've tried the rose scent in the solid soap form and loved it. I've read a lot of negative reviews about the rose liquid castille soap, but having never tried it in liquid form I don't know how much the scent differs. I've tried the peppermint, which is wonderful when there's warmer weather (it makes your skin very tingly, so I wouldn't recommend it for colder months). I tried the lavender liquid castille soap and it was too strong for me to use in the shower, but it was wonderful for cleaning. The nice thing about the liquid castille soaps is that if you don't particularly like the scent for showering, you can use them for house cleaning or laundry, so they never go to waste.
