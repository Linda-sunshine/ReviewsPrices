review/summary: Helped my 4 year old daughter stop sucking her thumbreview/text: This stuff works. We couldn't get my 4 yr old daughter to stop sucking her thumb. She was beginning to get a large overbite, and her dentist recommended Mavala Stop. I purchased it on Amazon right there in his office. Just before bed time, I painted it on your thumb nail only, and when she tried to suck her thumb, she complained of an awful taste in her mouth. She cried for the first few days, but when we explained to her that Dr. B (her dentist) said this would help her to stop sucking her thumb and give her pretty teeth, she seemed to begin to understand. Here we are about a month later, and no more thumb sucking. It works!--Justin (Dad)
