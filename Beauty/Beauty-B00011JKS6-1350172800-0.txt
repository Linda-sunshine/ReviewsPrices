review/summary: Just as expectedreview/text: I bought this product because my mom has one and I just love it! So I decided to get one. I have searched everywhere online and the cheapest one I could find was this one (total price including shipping). So I give it five stars :)For those who are wondering what it looks like on the nail, it is NOT a solid color. It's an iridescent, slightly pearly coat with shades of fuchsia. If you wear it over any nailpolish, you will be fascinated with what it will do! Last time I wore it over an orange nail polish and it turned to iridescent hot pink! It is amazing! It was one of the most beautiful colors I have seen so I truly recommend this. I believe any kind of iridescent nail polish has this effect but I've only tried it with the Chine Glaze Rainbow. By the way, Chine Glaze has sooo many beautiful and unique nail polishes, I love it.
