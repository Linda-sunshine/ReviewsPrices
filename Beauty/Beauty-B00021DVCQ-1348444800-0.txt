review/summary: BareMinerals all the way, from someone who's shopped aroundreview/text: After using BareMinerals along side other face powders, I was very pleased with the product. It has a pearly quality that makes skin luminous, the same way highlights do for hair, and it feels light and doesn't cause acne.It is however, a bit more than I usually spend on cosmetics. After running out of the basic foundation, I decided to buy a drug store knock-off (Neturogena, I think) to see if it would produce the same results at a reduced cost ($10). It didn't: the feel of the powder was heavier and greasier, it made my skin look a monotone flesh color that made it seem unnatural, and worst of all, lead to break outs, meaning I had more flaws to cover.Now I am a complete BareMinerals covert, and luckily, through Amazon, the price of this superior product is within a few bucks of the knock-off.
