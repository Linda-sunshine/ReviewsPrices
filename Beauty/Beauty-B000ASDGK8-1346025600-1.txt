review/summary: All the bells and whistlesreview/text: This hair drier is hot, has a nice stream of air, a long cord, isn't too too too loud and dries my hair quickly with a little less frizz than the average drugstore drier. My hair VERY frizzy though. If you live in a humid climate, like I do, it is unreasonable to expect a blow drier, on its own, to solve your lion's mane problem.Because the hot setting is so hot, I have slightly changed my hair drying routine. I now use the medium heat setting to get it mostly dry and then use the hot setting to zap away any remaining frizz. I finally finish off with a blast of cool air using the cool jet button. I feel like this leaves my hair slightly softer and less dry.My one complaint is that, yes, it is a bit heavy, but not so heavy that my arm cramps or anything. It is manageable.
