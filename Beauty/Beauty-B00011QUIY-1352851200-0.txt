review/summary: Great bang for the buckreview/text: I saw this advertised as the "best curling iron of 2011" on thebeautydepartment.com and decided to give it a try since it was also very reasonably priced. There are four heat settings from 280 deg to 430 deg, which is a great range. I have thin/fine hair, so the directions advised using a lower heat seating. I did an all-over curl/wave at 6am, and by 9pm the curls were still holding. My hair is naturally stick straight and has trouble holding curls, so I did use a little product to help. But the iron itself is a great improvement over my old 1/2 in. one. The 1-1/4 in. barrel probably works better for longer hair. I also like the longer (8 ft) chord. If you're looking for an inexpensive tool that delivers, this is it!
