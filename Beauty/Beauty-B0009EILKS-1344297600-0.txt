review/summary: Different box, same quality.review/text: I've been using these for a few years now and I've grown to love them.So when I found the sale, I jumped right on them.I use 3 strips every month during summer, and during winter my skin seems to be a bit better.The reason and how I use my 3 strips.Unfortunately, it is not a perfect item. (doesn't mean it deserves a less of a star though)I use 1 1/2 strip every 2 weeks during summer.The reason for the 1/2 is that the tip of your nose towards the bottom is not covered at all.I cut one of them in half (quarter did not work for me) and stick it on the from the bottom up and it takes care of the part I need it to.It does the job for me and I will continue to use these until they fail me.
