review/summary: It is pretty good.review/text: I bought this brush on the recommendation of my daughter in law. She bought it for my granddaughter who has very thin, long hair and complains when mommy brushes her hair that "it hurts". They are very happy there are no more tears when getting ready for school. I bought one for my other granddaughter to use and she seems to love it, too. As for myself, I still love my wide tooth comb.
