review/summary: It's... OKreview/text: I bought this dryer to replace the Revlon RV484 Ion 1875 Watt Hair Dryer, which died by electrical surge. This one is serviceable. I have thick, curly hair, and I don't like the diffuser that comes with it at all. The holes are too large, compared to other diffusers, and made my hair very frizzy. I bought a revlon diffuser attachment instead (Revlon RV480 Professional Ceramic Universal Finger Diffuser). That diffuser fit just fine on the original dryer (the RV484) but after a minute or so of using it with the RV544, it would shoot off - smacking me in the head, and usually scaring the crap out of me. It's an annoying problem, but one that I can usually deal with, once I realized that this mostly only happens when using the &#34;Hot&#34; setting (on low - I only ever use the low setting anyway). So I use this dryer on Warm, Low, and my diffuser might pop off once or twice in the 15 minutes of drying, and I can deal with that.My daughter has stick-straight, thin hair (the opposite of mine) and I really, really like the straightening attachment for her hair.
