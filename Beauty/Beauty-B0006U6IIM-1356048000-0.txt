review/summary: Great carrier oilreview/text: Everyone will have their own preferences. I've bought various oils- castor oil, grapeseed oil, etc... and find that almond oil and coconut oil are the two I feel most comfortable in. Everyone's bodies and hair work differently, so experiment and find the oil that works for you and one you find that you will be able to consistently use. For me almond oil is a relatively safe pick- not too heavy and not too strong.
