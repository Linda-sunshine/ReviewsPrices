review/summary: Excellent quality oil, lousy bottlereview/text: Having read about the benefits of jojoba oil, I purchased the 1 ounce size of this product to test it out.For the most part, I've had the best results when using this oil to "fortify" my facial and body moisturizers. It makes my skin that much softer and gives me a more glowy look. I also use it alone underneath my eyes before bed and have noticed a slight lightening of my dark circles. Now and then I'll smooth a few drops through my hair to tame frizz and condition the dry ends.My only qualm is the bottle. Making it into a squeeze bottle or including a dropper would be great for not only for portioning oil (a little goes a long way), but for preventing spillage.
