review/summary: I Have problem skinreview/text: I suffer from cyst all over my body an so that means i get cyst on my face as well. It sucks but anyway proactive, actutane, dicloxine all those dont work for me. So i sough out to at least cover them up. I tried Fx cover up first which is a HEAVY DUTY COVER UP.and sure it worked, matched my skin but goodness when u looked at me it looked like i had more that what i did on. So after returning that i went to bare essentuls. Yes u must clense your face, and yes you MUST moitureize!!! But let me tell you, i use the conceler from BM and it works great!! I use it on cyst and peeling areas anddd red areas. After that i cover it with foundation, a lil bronzer and the veil. It looks great! I mean super great. Okay fine it looks great but i decided to test that theory out that its so pure you can sleep in it. I figured since i already have problem skin i had nothing to lose. I slept in it. Yes i did. And i tell you what.. I woke up and i noticed that my areas of redness wernt red and on fire. My cyst were small and no longer in flamed. After two weeks of using it Every day..even if i put it on before i went to sleep..i have no had a new break out. So ME personally im sticking with BM, it not only covers up what i need it too but also helps heal. I went from proactive to their cleanser because it made such a big difference to me. No gimmick here for me. Cover fx was 42 dollars just for the foundation. I got the kit with brushes foundation, bronzer and veil, and primer for 62bucks in store. im a customer for life.
