review/summary: Great for all hair typesreview/text: Great for thick curly (My hair) or fine straight hair (my 3 year old's). It used to be the battle of the hair in my house. I have long frizzy, curly, crazy red hair, and my 3 year old has fine, blond, long hair. Both of us used to struggle with tangles. The wet brush enables me to brush my daughter's hair without tears while she brushes her teeth. Brushing hair is almost a non- issue now! ( for both of us). Do not press down on your scalp as the tips of the brush are pretty sharp/small to allow it to glide through the hair. I dab on a little conditioner on dry hair and start at the ends. Hold the brush loosely so that you can make gentle corrections to the brush when you encounter a tangle.
