review/summary: Exactly what I wantedreview/text: I bought 2 mirrors, one for each of my teenage daughters. They both love them and so do I. I will be ordering another one for myself and one for my sister. There have been no issues with the light needing to warm up. These are fantastic for make-up, eyebrow shaping, and for bedroom use instead of messy counters in the bathroom. It is true that this is the mirror that gives you true lighting and magnification yet makes you look like a model instead of the mirrors that cause you to feel bad about yourself. I am so glad I ordered this on Amazon and did not just pick up one at the store because I would have been disappointed. Fast delivery and one of my daughters favorite Christmas presents. It has also saved me money on professional facial waxing because I can see so perfectly.
