review/summary: the first iron that has ever worked for mereview/text: i have a lot of very fine hair with a mind of it's own. my old conair curling irons would take forever to curl my hair and then the curls fell out right away. the bed head did a pretty good job getting me curled i could get my hair done in under a half an hour, but by lunch the waves would be back and the curls gone. this is great! 20 minutes and i'm done! looks better than ever and after a 12 hour shift my hair is still perfect. I do use it on the highest setting, don't tell my hair dresser, but i haven't seen any damage. now i'm going to try a blow drier not fould on sale at Walgreens.
