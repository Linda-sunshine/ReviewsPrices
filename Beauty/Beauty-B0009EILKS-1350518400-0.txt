review/summary: Pretty good with multiple applications!review/text: These are like magic, in fact its kinda freaky the first time you do it because you can see the stuff that came out of your pores and they stand up due to the glue. These things are so much easier than sitting there for hours picking at blackheads. All you do is wet it, place it on your nose, wait 15 mins for it to dry then rip it off for your "surprise". I also recommendOxy Maximum Daily Cleansing Pads, 90 padsthese will keep those pores clean after removing them with this product.
