review/summary: Christmas Giftreview/text: Bought this product to replace my wife's current flat iron. My wife really likes the product. She tells me that it being smaller makes it easier to manage the way she style's her hair and it heats up quickly. She did tell me that she doesn't like the on switch being on the inside but that isn't a deal breaker. From my wifes reaction and her compliments about that product I would recommend it.
