review/summary: Best money spent on a makeup tool!!!! Must have for a makeup artist!!!review/text: I ordered the beauty blend finally after I kept hearing all this hype about it. I'm a makeup artist and have put so much money into my tools and brushes that I giggled at the fact that a sponge was supposed to work better than a brush! Was I ever wrong!!! The beauty blender is amazing when using for creams and liquids. I use it for my concealer,contour,highlight & foundation. It gives the most beautiful look to the skin! You will not be let down! Just stipple all over your face and "pat" in your concealer and you'll be looking airbrushed in no time! Utterly obsessed!!!
