review/summary: good stuffreview/text: This makes my skin softer than lotion does. I purchased this and jojoba oil for the ends of my hair/scalp and its not too greasy. It keeps my hair moisturized longer than the olive oil I have been using. btw I have curly thick course hair texture that I keep straightened.
