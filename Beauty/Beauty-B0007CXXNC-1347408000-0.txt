review/summary: Hair crackreview/text: This is the most best mask I've use in my hair. It's so silky smooth n shiny soft my boyfriend has noticed a change in my hair. It's not only repaired my hair but helped it grow a lot quicker than normal. I use this every other day I would really recommend this if u have dry damaged hair or just want to grow ur hair. It smells great n I just bought my second one and the shampoo I absolutely love this stuff &lt;3 and it's a really good price u can find this at ulta but it's really expensive there I would just purchase this from amazon to save some money :)
