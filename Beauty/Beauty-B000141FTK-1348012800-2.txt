review/summary: A must havereview/text: The Dr. Bronner's line of soaps are the best for multiple uses. We use the peppermint variety, the tea tea variety and the lavender. The initial Castile smell may be a little off putting but the results of these washes makes that a non-issue overall. This soap can be used for laundry, dishes, hair and body wash. I especially love an evening bath/shower with the lavender to help me relax for sleep and in the morning the peppermint is so great and revitalizing. I do not recommend daily washing for your hair, it does make my hair dull but I do not wash my hair but twice a week anyway. My son uses the peppermint to brush his teeth. Lotion and or moisturizers after washing I find necessary because I tend to have dry skin but for my youngest who has oily skin the wash is perfect. If you give this a try and find the little tweaks to make it work for you it is a product I can highly recommend. Netflix has a great documentary about Dr. Bronner.
