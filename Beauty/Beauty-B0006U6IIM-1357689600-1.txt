review/summary: I like itreview/text: This oil is not as thick as the castor oil, but i like it. It's not heavy, it's a light moisturizer. This bottle will probably last me all year. I use it on my hair, nose, under eye, etc. I mix it with castor oil, both products seem to make my hair really soft. I really like that it doesn't have a scent, so nothing to irritate your face.
