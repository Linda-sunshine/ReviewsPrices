review/summary: Best foundation for my skin.review/text: I've been using this foundation for almost ten years. It still works just as well for me. It isn't heavy, I can't feel it on me, but it still makes my skin looks smooth and perfect. That being said, I've never had any big skin problems, so I don't need a lot of coverage, just a foundation that will smooth and even where needed.I do hate the newer containers, though. You can't remove the sifter part when it starts getting low, which makes it hard to get the makeup out. I've taken to jamming a screwdriver into the holes to break up when I'm getting low -- there's always some left down there.Overall, though, I love BareMinerals. I won't use any other foundation.
