review/summary: SCAM DO NOT BUY!review/text: I'm 31 years old and I'm sadly receding and my hair is becoming thinner. I hate it so much because it feels like my youth is being taken away. The good reviews on here are wrong. It really looked like I had build up of dust on my head. You could see my scalp covered with this dust. It looked awful. The worst part is I did it at work and I took it off with water and it smeared off. I looked ridiculous. I feel stupid and I have lost more hope. This product is $24.99 and it should be banned for sale because of false advertising. Don't believe the videos they show. If your really curious just try it. It's not worth the time and money. You'll feel stupid in the end for falling for this SCAM. I'm getting my money back by returning it.
