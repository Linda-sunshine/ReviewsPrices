review/summary: sweet rainreview/text: i had recently looked up what was in these perfumes on an official site. i was looking forward to smelling sweet rain because it said hyacinth was a part of it. I barely smell that....if one wants to smell like dish soap they should purchase this smell. other than that it arrived earlier than the estimated arrival.
