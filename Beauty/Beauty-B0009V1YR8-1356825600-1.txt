review/summary: FAKE! DO NOT BUY!review/text: I spent a lot of time researching flat irons and had finally decided on investing in a CHI. I ordered from this seller after reading a few reviews and being surprised at the price of the 1' CHI flat iron. I received the item and used it only twice because the second time, IT BURNED MY HAIR and the plates melted the plastic that it was set it. I emailed the seller and had no reply. I finally contacted CHI themselves and gave them some information on the flat iron. They told me that it was COUNTERFEIT and could not help me.ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. IT IS A FAKE ITEM.
