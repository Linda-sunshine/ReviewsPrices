review/summary: Great Productreview/text: We had tried EVERYTHING in an attempt to get my 7yr old daughter to stop sucking her thumb. Her habit was starting to effect the roof of her mouth. The dentist had suggested an ace bandage at her elbow...didn't work...a glove on her hand...she pulled it off in the middle of the night.. I also tried finger splints, band aids..you name it, we probably tried it. When discussing the problem at an orthodontist's office, he suggested this product. Within 2-1/2 weeks, she was done. It has been 2 years and no looking back. Recently, a friend of mine was telling me that her daughter was having difficulty giving up thumb sucking. I still had a lot of the nail polish left, so I let her use it. Within 2-3 wks, she had also stopped. Thumb sucking and nail biting are difficult habits to break. This product seems to give a person that added reminder to help break the unwanted habit.
