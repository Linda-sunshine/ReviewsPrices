review/summary: Great product!review/text: This was my first time using sweet almond oil as a moisturizer. I can say I am extremely pleased. I was worried at first that the oil would be heavy and leave a greasy feel. Once the oil absorbed which to my surprise didn't take long there was no greasy residue and leaves my skin feeling soft.I also, have been putting a small amount of this product in my hair and I'm happy with those results as well. I would recommend this product the price is good and the product satisfactory.
