review/summary: Toppixreview/text: I can see how this might work for someone with a minor bald spot in the back of the head. The fibers do stick to the hair and give the appearance of more hair. It's not really meant for someone with a short or buzz cut. Also, be very careful in the rain or you can be easily embarrassed - especially if you touch your hair and your hand turns brown, along with everything else you happen to touch.
