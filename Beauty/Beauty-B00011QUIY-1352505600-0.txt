review/summary: Ehhhhhreview/text: My daughter was really excited when she recieved the curler. But she had trouble using it. My daughter has very long hair and it's very silky so it was hard for her to curl it by herself. When her friend came over, her friend was able to curl it, but the curls were thin and frizzy and it lasted for like a minute. I am dissapointed because my daughter really wanted to curl her hair for graduation pictures but was unable to because of the curler. Overall, the shipping was amazing and the curler actually works but probably not on very silky hair, unless I am missing something.
