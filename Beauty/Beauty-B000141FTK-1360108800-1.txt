review/summary: Smells great!review/text: I like this product, and the fact that it is organic and not harsh additives. It seems to have many uses for washing a variety of materials and surfaces. I think it could be used as a hand soap, but I haven't tried it for that. I like it, and the other Dr. Bronner products as well.
