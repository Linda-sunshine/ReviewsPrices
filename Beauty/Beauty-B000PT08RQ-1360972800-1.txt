review/summary: I like it, for the most partreview/text: the only issue I have with this product is when I straighten my bangs, it gets kinky? I have tried it on all of the heating settings, and still my bangs end up looking like a kinked up weird mess. I'm not a novice when it comes to straightening my hair, and I have never had any issue with any other straighteners doing this. It's just kind of strange.
