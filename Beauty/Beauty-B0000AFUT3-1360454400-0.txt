review/summary: Always Wanted One!review/text: I simply love my mirror. It was a gift card from my children for Christmas. Something I had always wanted, but was too cheap to purchase one.I am able to apply my makeup with great ease.Recommending to all who want to be able to see where to put enhancements where they are not.
