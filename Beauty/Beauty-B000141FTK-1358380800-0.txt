review/summary: Not what I expectedreview/text: I love the Peppermint (Peppermint/Spearment Shikai) and ordered this thinking with the citrus that it might be equally as crisp and refreshing. It's not. There's little discernable citrus and nothing that leaves my body with that refreshed, awake feeling. It is gentle and non-drying so perhaps it would be good for an infant's bath or those with skin highly sensitive to fragrance. Or maybe I just received an old batch. I was looking for an expiration date on the bottle but could not find one so I'm assuming that shelf life is not applicable to this type of product. If anyone knows, please leave a comment for me. Thanks in advance.
