review/summary: Good quality polish, color is offreview/text: The polish is good quality, goes on just as smooth as OPI. The color is not as bright as it seems in photos- it faded and turned slightly more green after a day of wear. It's a cute polish but I wish it was more true to the actual Tiffany blue color. I use it mostly as an accent color when making nail designs and it looks really nice. If you paint all your nails just that color, the fading looks strange and unflattering, though.
