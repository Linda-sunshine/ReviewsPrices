review/summary: HO, JUST WOWreview/text: I don't write reviews on Amazon, but I had to say a couple things about this product.I am a not even 30 and started to have thinning hair in the frontal area (worse thing ever right ha ha), anyways-I have looked into rogaine and what not-but stumbled upon this product on a YouTube ad actually. It just looked like magic. I was definitely skeptical because it basically looked like a 1-3 minute process... and what do you know-it actually is that quick and simple. I received the product very fast like in 1-2 days, put on the product and was definitely content with the results. Of course you need some hair to keep the balance of the product in, but once its on it is remarkable. Looks like I have a full head of hair again! I even went to the gym that day and most of it stayed in place even with sweat. Just don't run your hands vigorously through or I assume it will come out eventually. With all the science in the world you think they would have solved the problem of hair loss... anyways for the time being, this will do. I recommend this product all the way!
