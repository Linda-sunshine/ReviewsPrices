review/summary: add it to dry hair endsreview/text: I use a little on the ends of my hair while wet and it keeps my curls bouncy, as well as leaving my hair feeling overall moisturizing. I also use this in sugar scrubs, baby wipes solution, nighttime moisturizer or just a quick spot moisturizer. Very versatile!
