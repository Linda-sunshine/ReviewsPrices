review/summary: Scents are a bit on the weak sidereview/text: Purchased 5 roll-on fragrances in 1/3 oz bottle size: Majic (ok), Africian Musk (better), Forbidden Desire (ok), Egyptian Goddess (weak, not ok), Black Coconut (ok). Not particularly impressed. Too much carrier oil and not enough of the perfume scent. So, you have to use more of the fragrance (1/3 oz won't last long). The shipment was fast, was wrapped well, and the bottle/dispensers work very well. I just wish the scents were more powerful. Maybe I should try a few different scents...
