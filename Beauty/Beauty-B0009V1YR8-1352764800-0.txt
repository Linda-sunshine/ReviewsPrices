review/summary: Chi stopped workingreview/text: Loved my Chi, but after using it for just less than a year, the on/off switch no longer works, and I can't get it to turn on. This happened to my previous Chi as well, which I bought from an actual salon. I contacted the seller but have not yet heard back. good Chi for the price, but I wouldn't expect it to last too long.
