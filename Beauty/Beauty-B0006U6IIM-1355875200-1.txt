review/summary: I love this product!review/text: I love this product! I have sensitive, itchy skin and lately every perfume and lotion I use has been causing inflammation on my skin. I have switched to a lotion that has no scent and no dyes, but it was still not moisturizing enough. This almond oil will benefit you even if you use regular lotion with no problems. Squeeze your lotion into your hand like you always do, then add about ten drop of this oil, mix, and apply to your skin. Ahh! So soft! Even my husband has made comments on how soft my skin is! When my face is feeling especially dry, I will press some of the oil onto my face and it feels much better. It does not break me out, and almost anything will. I even use it on my eyes, no irritation at all. Put a few drops in your shampoo to give your hair a moisture boost without a greasy feel. It really doesn't have much of a scent. I love it and will continue to use this product faithfully. The cost is more than reasonable, its expeller pressed and the bottle contains uv light protectant to protect the quality of the oil. Fantastic. I can't say enough about it!
