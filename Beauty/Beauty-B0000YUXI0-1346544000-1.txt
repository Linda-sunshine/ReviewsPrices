review/summary: Workedreview/text: Mavala did the trick. My 6 year old no longer sucks his two fingers. Took about a week for him to stop the habit. He was on board with the decision to stop and I think that helped. Lost one star because the taste can rub off on food. Yuck. Just be sure to put on nails only and let it dry.
