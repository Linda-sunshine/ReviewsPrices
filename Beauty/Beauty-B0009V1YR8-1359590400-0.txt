review/summary: PLEASE LISTEN TO ME THIS IS A FAKEreview/text: Okay so I made the mistake most of you are about to; I bought this Farouk Chi 1inch hair straightener from this seller. I have worked in the beauty industry for years and and I know my products. PLEASE LISTEN TO ME THIS IS A FAKE CHI! The seller tries to get you to believe/trust them by showing pictures of fake, a real and a 10 year old CHI, and insisting that they only sell the real ones. However the moment I got mine I knew it was a fake.Now if you insist on buying it anyways please once you get your inspect it. I will now give you the the difference between a real CHI and the one I just ordered from this seller.Real CHI has: .....Fake CHI has:The cord is round ..... The cord is flat10 foot heavy duty electrical cord ..... 8 foot cord (or anything shorter then 10")Has a good hefty weight to it (2 pounds) ..... Is extremely lightThe warning label has a little cute baby on it white shirt ..... Has an Asian like baby with black eyes and a stripped shirtOn the FRONT of the plug it should say warning ..... On the plug it says Boomster (or anything other then warning)The plates will bend from side to side when pushed on ..... Will bend but feels like it will brake; not sturdyI hope this was helpful!
