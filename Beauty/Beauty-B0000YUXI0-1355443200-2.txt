review/summary: Works pretty well at the beginning....review/text: I initially reviewed this and gave it 5 stars after about a week as my 3 year old son had virtually stopped sucking his thumb about 90% of the time. But, he quickly learned how to suck through the smell/taste and now does it all the time. So we've stopped putting it on him and will try again in a few months. We may resort to the clear cast thing for night time. I have no idea what we'll do for daytime if this stuff doesn't work.
