review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I am very disappointed in this product. I have very very thick, coarse and wavy hair. Making it very hard and time-consuming to blow dry. I had an old straightening iron that I bought at walmart for like $15 a few years ago (I don't even remember the brand). It worked perfectly, but I only used it when my hair was dry. So styling my hair became very inconvenient. Well when that one finally broke, It didn't quite working, it just physically broke, I decided to see about getting an even better one. When I saw this one I though "PERFECT!" I don't have to worry about drying my hair first. Most of the reviews were very good and it was a great price. I was so excited. But it has failed miserably. It does dry my hair mostly (about 80%, not too shabby) but it does not straighten it. I mean, it makes it look slightly better than it would without it, but it's definitely not worth the time it takes. I am very unsatisfied with this. I think it might work for someone with thinner and finer hair, so I will be giving it to someone else and purchasing something different for myself.
