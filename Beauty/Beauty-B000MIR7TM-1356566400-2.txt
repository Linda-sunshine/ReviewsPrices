review/summary: OMG!review/text: Why didnt I buy this sooner? I love my BB sponge! I use make up almost daily and I love the way my face looks now when I apply liquid make up with this amazing sponge! I use it wet and it gives me the airbrushed finish I like yet my make up feels so much lighter compared to when I used to apply it with a stippling brush. It does not cake up, stays on my face all day long and doesnt give me any dry spots...LOVE IT! Perfect for touch ups! Yay!
