review/summary: Practical but not amazingreview/text: I bought this straightener as a temporary replacement on a trip. I must say you get what you pay for. I have to use a liberal amount of John Freida Secret Weapon and Chi Silk Infusion when I use this straightener (using it wet or dry, it always needs a good amount of product to look well).The plates are somewhat cheap and are more ceramic than tourmaline, It might scratch up your hair.The plates WILL scratch up against each other at a minimum.The plates also have tiny gaps in the slots the are in so at a certain angle your hair might get snagged in them.Not bad for 20ish bucks though.Just a good temporary replacement or perhaps "daughter's first straightener".
