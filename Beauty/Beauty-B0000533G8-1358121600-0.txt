review/summary: I love Dr. Bronner's soaps!review/text: I was interested in trying out the various scented versions of Bronner's well-known &#34;Pure Castile Soap,&#34; so I ordered the hemp almond. It smells a little more &#34;Bath & Bodyworks&#34; than I had anticipated; it's got a decidedly girl-ish (as in the type of young teen who buys that fake vanilla scent at the mall - bleh) scent to it straight out of the bottle, but it mellows out and the scent doesn't linger. Despite that, I won't be using it as a body wash -- this bottle will be delegated to dish duty and the like.I think I will try the Lavender scent next -- I hear that it smells more like the actual Lavender plant, as opposed to the chemically-formed, mall-bought version.
