review/summary: Really worksreview/text: I found this on amazon just before we were planning to get a 600 dollar device put in my 7 year olds mouth to stop thumb sucking. We had tried everything! Just went to the orthodontist and dentist and they were both amazed and were sure to write down the name of the product. Her teeth have moved back a bit in the 3 months since she stopped! I think the fact that it makes one gag really associates with the habit and helps break it. It may seem harsh but my daughter is really proud of herself.
