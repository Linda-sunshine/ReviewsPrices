review/summary: Great dryerreview/text: I like this dryer a lot! I originally bought it for my sister for Christmas because her old dryer was sparking, but I used it when I was over for Christmas break and fell in love! I've since bought one for myself. This dryer leaves my hair shiny and soft, when most dryers leave it frazzled at the ends and feeling straw-like. I was even able to blow dry my curly hair when it was DRY with a round brush into perfectly straight, shiny hair, which is truly amazing (and probably bad for my hair, but I was in a pinch). It is a little heavy, but I tend to like parts of my daily routine that put physical stress on my body... exercise, right? Haha.
