review/summary: Works Wonders!review/text: My hair have never felt smoother! The first time I've applied it to my hair I felt a major difference. Instead of dry and brittle hair, its very soft and smooth! Using it on my skin leaves it feeling incredibly smooth. It also helps with the bags under my eyes as well!The only thing to note is that if you use it on your hair, it does leave behind a bit of an oily feeling if you touch your hair. But its so smooth and soft how can I argue!
