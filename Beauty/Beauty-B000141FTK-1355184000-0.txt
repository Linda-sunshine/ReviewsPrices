review/summary: Great soap, interesting label...review/text: We have heard wonderful things about Dr. Bronners soap for a very long time now and I finally ran out of my commercial soap. I started using this as soon as it arrived and it's fantastic; put 10 drops in a foaming hand soap container and filled the rest of the way with water and it works great for me and the kids! BUT, the packaging is downright...weird. The bottle is covered top to bottom, front to back, with Arab poems, doctrine, sayings, etc. All I wanted was the soap, but wish the packaging wasn't so...forceful? Weird? I don't even know how to describe it. Interesting.
