review/summary: Good on scalp, bad on body of sensitive toddlerreview/text: Can't explain why this was helpful in soothing my daughters scalp, but for some reason when I began to apply to other areas of her body, she broke out into an itchy rash tht was quite uncomfortable. It was all over her bad, shoulder's belly and some on her face. She's always had sensitive scalp so we can only use hypoallergenic products, but the dermatologist recommended jojoba oil as an alternative to the prescription Dermasmoothe. I will use, but will no longer use on my four year old. Back to Dove Sensitive body wash and lotion.
