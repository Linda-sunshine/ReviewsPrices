review/summary: not the product i've used for yearsreview/text: i've been buying bare minerals from a leading makeup retailer for years. i decided to buy on amazon for the lower price and the fast, free prime shipping. this is not the same product i'm used to using. the font on the jar and the packaging materials are slightly different and the product consistency and coverage are not the same at all. i think it was either an old batch, old formula or total knock off. in any event i returned it and will continue to buy this product from the source.
