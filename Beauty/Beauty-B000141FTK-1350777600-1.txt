review/summary: Excellent One-Bottle Solutionreview/text: Since I discovered I am allergic to formaldehyde and its many cousins in personal care products (body wash, hand soap, dish soap, shampoo, clothes detergents) I needed to find something else to use in the shower. A friend recommended Dr Bronner's - she was using peppermint - so I checked it out and tried it. I have used the baby soap, the almond, the peppermint and the tea tree oil. This is great as shampoo and body wash. A little goes a long way. I like the almond or this baby unscented for body wash; peppermint for an invigorating shampoo; and tea tree for hand-washing because of the antibacterial properties. Also use the peppermint or tea tree for making creamy liquid cleanser to clean the bathroom and the kitchen sink. All the Dr Bronner liquid castile soap products I have tried - baby, almond, peppermint and tea tree - have been excellent.
