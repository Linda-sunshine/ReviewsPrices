review/summary: Cord shorted outreview/text: Power cord started to shore out a year and a half into use. I only use this at home and am not a stylist so it wasn't heavy use. I called the company and the product is only warranted for a year. The replacement cost was $21 but buy the time you pay for shipping both ways what's the point? My revlon brand iron lasted many years longer. Needless to say I'm disappointed since it's suppose to be a professional item that it died after light home use.
