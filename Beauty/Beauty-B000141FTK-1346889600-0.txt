review/summary: Shampoo Alternativereview/text: I used this product as an alternative to shampoo. I love it! It left my hair with moisture and my hair was clean. I diluted it with water half and half. I conditioned afterwords with my favorite condtioner and I have no complaints. My scalp felt tingly, not dry like when I use regular shampoo or the so called "natural shampoos" and I have natural hair with highlights!
