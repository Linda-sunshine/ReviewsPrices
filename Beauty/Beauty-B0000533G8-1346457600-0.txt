review/summary: Another Dr. Bronner's Fanaticreview/text: I discovered Dr. Bronner's soap pin my local food co-op when I was a student- more years ago than I care to admit. I can only echo what others say: It's the perfect all around hand soap, bath soap and dish soap. I buy it in gallon jugs, attach a pump (available at any good hardware store) and transfer it into quart containers for the bath, pint containers for travel, and hand dispensers for the bathroom and kitchen sink. A gallon lasts close to a year in my household- just remember, as the Doctor says: Dilute! Dilute! Dilute! ;-)
