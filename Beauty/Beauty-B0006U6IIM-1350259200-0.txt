review/summary: Good, simple almond oilreview/text: I bought this product because the ingredients read only almond oil (no tocopherols etc), which is what I wanted.It doesn't have any smell at all (an almond smell would have not bothered me), and that's why I removed 1 star.Overall is a good product.
