review/summary: Amazingreview/text: This product is awesome. My 5 year old son has been sucking his 2 fingers practically since birth, and we never thought we could get him to stop. We got Mavala Stop 3 weeks ago and other than the first time he &#34;tried it&#34; and one more accidental taste he has not sucked them since. My 3 year old sucked her thumb at night and we figured what the heck and used it on her too - now she no longer sucks her thumb. My 7 year old had a rather gross habit of picking her nose and eating her...you get the idea. End result - she doesn't do it anymore either. I recommend this to anyone that is trying to get their kid to break the habit. It tastes truly disgusting to them, and it is not water soluble so they can't wash it off immediately. Best 12 bucks I ever spent.
