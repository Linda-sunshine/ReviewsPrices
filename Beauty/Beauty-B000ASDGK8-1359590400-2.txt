review/summary: A little heavy, but a great price for a powerful dryerreview/text: My current hair dryer has been dying (just a Conair) and so I have been looking for a new one. I was willing to spend a little more, but I didn't want to spend over $100 for just a hair dryer. So I decided on this one and I'm glad I did. It's a little heavy, but very powerful. It gets pretty hot, too, so I made sure to keep it moving when I was drying (which you should do, anyway). It definitely took less time to dry my hair.I'm glad I saved some money, but still got a nice hair dryer. I would recommend this to anyone, especially if you have thick hair like mine.
