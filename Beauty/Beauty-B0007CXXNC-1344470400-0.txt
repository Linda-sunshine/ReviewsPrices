review/summary: Love!review/text: I definitely am a fan of this product! I have been debating whether to buy it or not but after dying the bottom half of my hair twice this summer, along with bleaching it this product was much needed! I finally broke down and bought it and don't regret it what so ever! It is so moisturizing and soft and the smell is absolutely wonderful! The price is great and it will definitely be a repurchase for me!
