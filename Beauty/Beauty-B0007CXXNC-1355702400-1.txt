review/summary: Smells amazing and makes hair feel like silkreview/text: I've been using this product about once a week for the past month in conjunction with the macadamia healing oil and curl reviving cream. I love all of the product. My hair is long (12+ inches from the nape of my neck) and naturally curly. I would not sleep with it down because it would take so long to brush out in the morning. Between these products my hair is so soft and manageable I no longer fear my brush. The longer I use it the better the effect. It won't eliminate tangles over night but I could see an improvement after my first use.
