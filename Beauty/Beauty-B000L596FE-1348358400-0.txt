review/summary: Great for 2 years and their Mom's!review/text: Got this brush because both my 2 year old's hair and my hair were getting long enough to need a brush that could de-tangle. The brush works great for both of us. And my daughter likes the bright color (yellow in her case, and blue in mine). You don't get to pick the color, but that didn't matter to us, and nice that we got two so I could let my daughter pick. Now I can brush my hair in 1/3rd the time and with barely any pain. And my daughter likes having her hair brushed as well.
