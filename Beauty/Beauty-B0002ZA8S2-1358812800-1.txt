review/summary: Great curling iron, but NOT for THIN hair!review/text: Don't get me wrong, this is a great and solid curling iron that will give you nice waves and last you lifetime, but it's simply not for people with thin hair. Every time I clip my hair to curl, it slips off since my hair is so thin. I have thin, long Asian hair and I even tried to put more hair onto the clip, but when I do that, the curls are not as defined and even. If you have thin hair like mine, opt for Babybliss' Pro Ceramic Tools curling iron. They clip even my baby hairs and holds well when I curl and this is the only iron I've even bought EVER that could do this! Also, it's cheaper, too! :-)
