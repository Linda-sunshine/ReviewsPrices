review/summary: Awesome!review/text: I have A LOT of thick hair, but I got this comb after I got it cut and thinned out a lot, so my hair is easier to brush with anything. However, this brush works a lot better than a comb (which was the only thing I could use on my wet hair before I cut it). It's got a nice grip and feels nice.
