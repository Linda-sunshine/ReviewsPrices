review/summary: Disappointing experience...broken after 2 uses.review/text: I bought my CHI after reading mixed reviews as I wanted to be optimistic. I received my new CHI and the first 2 uses were OUTSTANDING...I was very happy with the product. Then, when I went to use the CHI for the 3rd time, it would not turn on. I tried multiple power outlets, hitting the reset button, etc. I returned it immediately and am very disappointed. I would not buy another from this seller.
