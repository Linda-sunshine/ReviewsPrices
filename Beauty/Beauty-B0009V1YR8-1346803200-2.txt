review/summary: Waste of moneyreview/text: I had high hopes for this CHI... waste of money purchased June 22, 1012... stopped working September 4, 2012! I am a 47 year old woman who did not drop or miss use this item. Read the fine print on warranty (wish I had). "The CHI Hairstyling Iron is only under warranty if purchased from a Professional Salon. The purchase of the CHI Hairstyling Iron will not be guaranteed if purchased through any other outlets including the internet."
