review/summary: Won't heat up! BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryerreview/text: With all of the rave reviews, I figured this was THE hair dryer to buy. How could 300+ people be wrong? Well, from my experience, it isn't. Not only was the heating element dead right out of the box so all it blows is room temperature air but it's WAY heavy and unbalanced. They should call it the BaByliss POS!
