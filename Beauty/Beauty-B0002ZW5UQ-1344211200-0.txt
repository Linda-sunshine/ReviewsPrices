review/summary: Caboki is 10 times betterreview/text: I've used Caboki for months now and I thought I would try this product to compare. Thankfully I only bought the small size.First of all, Toppik smells somewhat like cat urine... not sure what is in it that would cause that.Second of all, the blond color is waaaay too light for most shades of blond and looks ridiculous in my ashy blond hair. The lighter the color, the thinner the hair appears.Third of all, it is a lot dustier and does not stick as well as Caboki.
