review/summary: Great price and equivalent to the big bucks brandsreview/text: I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she didn't seem completely thrilled when she opened it. I think she was hoping for something that was the 'big bucks' item that you see advertised. I asked her to try it and if it didn't meet her expectations than I would send it back and get something better. Well it was just perfect for her and it has most of the bells and whistles that she wanted. Very lightweight, gentle airflow, quiet, tourmaline ionic and lots of power. Don't buy the big expensive dryer until you try this one!
