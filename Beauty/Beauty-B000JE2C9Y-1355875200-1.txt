review/summary: Silk, NOT Polyester.review/text: Advertised as made of "silk & cotton", the attached tag says "Content: Polyester Fibres" which refers to the interior padding, I'm sure. I overlooked the interior tag which states that both sides are silk and the binding around them is polyester. There appears to be NO cotton anywhere. Not sure how that polyester binding will feel when the weather changes, but for now, I love this mask!
