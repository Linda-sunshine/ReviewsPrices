review/summary: Gets out every smell!!Ureview/text: I saw a review on yyou tube and decided to give it a try. First , I tried the peppermint bar, it was fabulous. It got all of the deodorant off without scrubbing. When my husband adds the liquid to his bath the tub gets disgusting! !! It cuts all dirt and smells. I am hooked we are on or third bottle and we are not looking back. Plus it last a long time
