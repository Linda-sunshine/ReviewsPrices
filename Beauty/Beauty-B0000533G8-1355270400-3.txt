review/summary: Bummedreview/text: I purchased this product to use for cleaning my cookie sheets. It didn't work like I thought it would, which is fine, but what I really didn't like is that it made everything it touched turn orange and rusty. I got it on my nice stovetop griddle, and the thing now looks like I left it out in the rain for 3 years. Now I treat this stuff like acid. If it's open, I have gloves and won't touch anything with it.
