review/summary: Evens out skin and doesn't look like you're wearing makeupreview/text: This is great as a light foundation. It evens out skin tone, and does not look like you're wearing makeup. It is not good at covering up pimples or other more prominent blemishes, however it is not made for that. It is good at setting cover up though. Right after I started using it, I got many compliments on how nice my skin was looking recently.
