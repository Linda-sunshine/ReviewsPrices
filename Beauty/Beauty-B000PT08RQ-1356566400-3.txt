review/summary: Very Satisfiedreview/text: After searching for a wet 2 straight iron I was going to purchase one over $100 dollars. I was waiting until I could save up that amount. After seeing this one for $25 I was skeptical about how well it would work but, it was more in my price range. I really wanted one bad so I decided to go for it. This iron works very well on my hair!!!!! Saving me time on not having to blow dry and then straighten. I do have to blow dry the top of my head after I'm done because my hair takes a lot to dry completely, but, just a little so I don't mind. I highly recommend it and I am so glad I bought it.
