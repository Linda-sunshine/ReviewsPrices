review/summary: Dont be fooled by the bottlereview/text: Fake,cheap imposter, not the real deal,Not even close.... I am upset with Amazon for allowing this product to be sold under what I had viewed to be a reputable website to buy from until now. Poor excuse for what a very good cologne when you buy the real thing.I was reluctant to buy this since I normally pay $65.00 for this cologne. I guess I got what I paid for this time, if that means a nice bottle of clear liquid that very slightly smells like the real thing for about five minutes. Anyone that has had the real thing will smell the difference. The one star that I gave was only for the nice glass bottle that was able to fool me into buying it.
