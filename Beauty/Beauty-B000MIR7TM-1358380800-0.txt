review/summary: If you have any love for makeup/foundation, you NEED this product.review/text: After all this time I finally gave in (two for the price of one, come on!) and I am SO pleased with my Beauty Blender. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and it blends my Revlon Colorstay foundation on like a dream -- a seamless and most importantly, a finish that is NOT cakey! I also use it to blend concealer if I decide to highlight with my Maybelline Age Rewind with the same great results. The shape and size is perfect for widespread blending or reaching points around the nose. So good, so far feels very durable, so in love.
