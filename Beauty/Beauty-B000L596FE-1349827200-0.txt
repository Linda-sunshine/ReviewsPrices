review/summary: Great for detanglingreview/text: My hair is highlighted and when I shower, no matter how much conditioner I use, my hair is always super tangled and it's quite painful to detangle. I have to use leave in conditioners so that I can brush through my wet hair - that is, until I found this brush! I am not sure why this brush is so much more effective and efficient and pain free than my other brushes and I am not sure why it works so well, but it really does. I detangle my wet hair without using leave in conditioners, no problem. It is pain free and so much less hair gets stuck in the brush. I love this brush and would really recommend it to anyone that has a hard time detangling their hair. It's really painless and I feel like there is relatively no breakage of my hair at all compared to other brushes. I would even go as far as saying that I find this brush better than a comb to detangle hair. LOVE IT & so happy I got this brush!
