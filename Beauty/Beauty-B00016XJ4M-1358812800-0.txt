review/summary: Great toner!review/text: I use this after every workout. It cleans my face and neck without leaving my skin dry. My skin feels so smooth and supple and the scent is very pleasing to me. I have been keeping it in a zip-lock in my gym bag, just in case the top comes loose, and I have had no spills. Even though I use this stuff every time I work out (about 8-10 times a week), I can tell that this is going to last me a long time! I highly recommend this product and will buy again in the future.
