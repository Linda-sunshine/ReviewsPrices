review/summary: wonderful!review/text: I sucked my fingers till I was 12 so when my son started sucking his fingers we tried to get him to stop but nothing worked. He would suck "thum" off and not even flinch so with him being in 1st grade we need him to stop immediately. This product stopped it the first day! It has also helped with the booger eating issue too. Great product!!!!
