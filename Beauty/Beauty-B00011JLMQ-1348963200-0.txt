review/summary: terriblereview/text: I love China Glaze's nail polishes but this one is terrible. I bought it because it is a very unique color and thought it would look great for summer. It took 5 coats for it to actually be seen on my nails but it was still extremely streaky. It also looked very dry and matte even after applying a top coat. I immediatley took it off and threw it away. It's horrible. Do not waste you money.
