review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I don't normally leave reviews but in this I will because the reviews that I read did help me decide to make this purchase (pay it forward concept:) I have used acrylic nails for about 10+ years and decided to remove them once and for all. My nails are weak and on top of that whenever I get nervous my fingers end up in my mouth. I have used this product for 2 weeks now and it is just as advertised. I have not chewed on my nails since!! I apply it once a week and it lasts!! The taste is horrible which serves its purpose. I would definitely recommend!!
