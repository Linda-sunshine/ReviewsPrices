review/summary: good smell + non-toxic = fantastic!review/text: I really love the smell of this soap and knowing that there are no toxic ingredients in it is the best part. It does NOT dry my skin. I use a lot of it every time I bathe but it still lasts a long time. It's worth the price! Note: it has a citrus smell which not a lot of people like, so make sure you enjoy citrus smells. I do!
