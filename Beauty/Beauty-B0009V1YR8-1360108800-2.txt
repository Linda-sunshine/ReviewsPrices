review/summary: What a piece of junk!!review/text: I have had this flat iron for less than a year and it is already useless. I turned it on one morning and when I came back fifteen minutes later to get ready for work I found my almost hot flat iron turned off and I haven't been able to get it to work since that day. I really expected it to last longer than 8 months and I'm really disappointed with this product. Don't waste your money, they really don't make them like they used to.
