review/summary: This stuff is the best!!review/text: This toner is the best I have ever used. Not only does it have no alcohol, it is incredibly soothing and moisturizing. I love it! It's great at night when I don't feel up to a whole beauty routine and I just want to wash my face then apply this, this works as a moisturizer for me. I have very very fussy, easily irritated acne prone skin, and this does not irritate my skin at all, nor does it cause break outs. My skin always looks wonderful when I use it regularly, and I feel like I could use it at any time of the day to freshen up without over irritating my face. I am in love with this toner and want to sing it at the top of the world. It is a completely wonderful product with no irritants for me, and it has helped prevent the occasional pimple or zit.
