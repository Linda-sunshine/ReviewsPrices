review/summary: It works!review/text: I never thought my husband would stop biting his nails, but this stuff is working amazingly well! It tastes horrible and lasts for quite a while before it needs to be reapplied. It also arrived in a timely manner, which I very much appreciate. Since nail biting (and thumb sucking) can be subconscious habits, this helps remind the nail-biter/ thumb-sucker of what they are doing. I highly recommend it.
