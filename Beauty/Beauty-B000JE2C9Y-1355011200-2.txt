review/summary: Good.review/text: I go on a night shift every two month so I needed a sleeping mask for the tight sleeping during the daytime.I was thinking of getting thick curtain but that is just too much of money and work. Also, I did not want to have thick and dark-colored curtain in my bedroom. All I wanted is juat to block the sun out of my sight while sleeping.Instead of changing curtains to the ones that I might nor like, I decided to get a little curtain over my eye lids.It perfectly blocks the sulight and I love it! The texture is soft and it does not give you any marks on your face.Goooooood!
