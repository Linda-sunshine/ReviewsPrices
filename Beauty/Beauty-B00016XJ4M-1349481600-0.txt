review/summary: Great, but if you're allergic to bees...review/text: I use witch hazel as a toner because it works. When I saw that there was a rose petal based one I thought it might smell pretty and work just as well. So far I like it and it works. The rose scent is strong and might cause a problem if you're allergic to bees.The first time I used it I went outside to run errands with my son. I noticed something crawling on my hand (the hand I used to apply the toner) it was a wasp. I tried blowing it off, but it stayed on. Finally I brushed it off with my keys and ran.Next I went to the park with my son and I felt something crawling on my face. I swiped it off and saw that it was a bumblebee. It was a beautiful sunny day so maybe they were just out in full force.When I went home I was taking my son out of the car and I felt something crawling on my hand again. It was another bumblebee. I usually don't attract bees. They avoid me and I them for the most part. I thought it was a little odd that I had these experiences.It won't stop me from using the toner, but I just wanted to warn others in case you're allergic to bees.
