review/summary: great find!!review/text: I love this brush! i have straight, long hair, but there is a lot so i always get the worst tangles! i have had this problem all my life and i use heavier conditioner, etc. but have always had a lot of trouble brushing out my hair **even with detangler** once out of the shower! i would delay washing my hair until i had a lot of time and patience.this brush made my morning routine SO much better as i am able to brush out my hair in a fraction of the time (not to mention it's PAINLESS). i have a sensitive scalp - heairdressers are always frustrated - not my fault! this brush is a savior! i will definitely be bringing it to my next hair appointment and will continue to use it every day!great great find!
