review/summary: Good dealreview/text: My daughter had been asking for a "real" hair straightener for about a year. Knowing that, "real", meant big bucks I was hesitant to purchase one.This past Christmas I was determined to find one at a great deal, so I logged on to amazon.com and was able to find the Farouk Chi for less than $100.She says it heats up fast and works great! That's all I needed to hear to be satisfied with my purchase.
