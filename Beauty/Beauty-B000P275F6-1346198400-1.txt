review/summary: Surprised!!review/text: I thought at the price it was worth the risk right? So what if I get a knock off at least I took a shot at it. So it was a little worry some when the tracking number was not working on the DHL web site. That was explained by the fact that it arrived in my mailbox. DHL does not track standard mail items, only packages sent UPS style. (at far as I know)Arrived in my mailbox, product unopened still sealed in plastic wrap! Fantastic, this stuff costs me usually about $70 bucks. I am ordering one more possibly two simply due to the price and the successful delivery of product.Great Job guys!ctompkins
