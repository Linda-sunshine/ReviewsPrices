review/summary: Just Got it. Tired it. And it is amazing.review/text: My boyfriend actually broke my other flat iron that I was using which was a pro tools flat iron. Somehow he seemed to step on it even though it wasn't on the floor. I was in need of a flat iron because I can not go a day without one or else my hair looks bad. I looked around on here for a good deal, and I also had some gift certificates on hand as well. I noticed there was a two dollar coupon on it, and I looked at it too see if I wanted to get it. I looked at all of the reviews on it and thought that maybe I shouldn't get it because some of them weren't that great. But since my hair is damaged, I need a flat iron with tourmaline and ceramic so it wont damage my hair too bad than it already is. Well, I just got this flat iron today. Literally I just flat ironed my hair with it and it is a really good flat iron. I've had like four flat irons since I was 12 years old. This flat iron really heats up quick, and I really love how I can change the temperature of the flat iron. My last one didn't do this, so I have no clue how high the heat was on it. But this one actually took about a lot of the frizz that I sometimes get after flattening my hair. My hair is really wavy, and it took out my waves just flattening a piece one time. I still have to keep trying it out to make sure that I really want it, but I do believe that it may just stay at my house. I also noticed while flattening my hair that it didn't snag/ break my hair at all. My old one used to do that soo much that I would loose three or four hairs because it snagged so badly. I will re-write at the end of next week in case if I come into that I don't like at all.
