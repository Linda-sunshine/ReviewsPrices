review/summary: Where have you been all my life??review/text: Bought this at my local salon and I loooove it. I have long, dry, thinning hair that gets easily knotted after showering and my heart breaks every time I have to comb through it. With this brush and a lil bit of leave-in conditioner, I can comb thru my hair effortlessly. I've even tried the brush on my wet hair without the use of a leave-in and I still experienced a smooth comb-through. That just doesn't happen with my hair! I will never use any other tool from here on out.
