review/summary: Great Smellreview/text: After so many failed attempts to find a subtle, yet sultry scent I have finally found the perfect one! This particular brand is consistent with all other Egyptian Musk oils that I have used in the past. It is a scented roll-on oil, however, so if you're looking for a spray-on or traditional perfume, this product is probably not for you.
