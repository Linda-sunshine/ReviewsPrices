review/summary: Best Soap Everreview/text: I remember my parents had this soap in the house when I was growing up. It doesn't take much at all to get the job done. You can use it for anything and it works great. Anything from washing your hands, hair, using in shower, to washing dishes in the sink. It lasts a long time and lathers up great. I personally love to shower with it as it leaves your skin feeling cool and refreshed. Just stay away from the Tea Tree version of this soap. It smells horrible. Peppermint is the way to go.
