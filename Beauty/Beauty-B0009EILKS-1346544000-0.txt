review/summary: Pretty Good!review/text: I have a fairly clear complexion with the exception of my nose. I bought these in the hopes that it would help, and it did. I find that they are more effective when you leave them on longer, so I left mine on for 40 minutes instead of 20. Taking it off, however much you wet the strip will hurt, so I rip it off very quickly. I DO NOT recommend this product for sensitive/dry skin. I always moisturize before and after, or else it rips at my skin.Overall, this is a good product.
