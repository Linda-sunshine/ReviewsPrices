review/summary: Very nice!review/text: I bought this as a replacement mirror for my old Conair mirror which stopped working. This mirror is bright and works almost as good as the old style light up make-up mirrors to which I'm accustomed. If you are seeking something with adequate lighting and a good close-up, this is your mirror! My vision is poor, and I need lighting to enable me to see well, and this mirror fits the bill. You'll like it. Trust me! :)
