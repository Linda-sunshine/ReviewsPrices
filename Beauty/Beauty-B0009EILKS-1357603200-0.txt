review/summary: Not sure how to feel about these...review/text: I usually use these after a warm shower or steaming my face, so I can be sure my pores are nice and open. However I've never had any results like they show in the advertisements/other reviewer's photos! I follow all the directions so I don't understand why.When I'm done, my blackheads are slightly less prominent, but I only have a few of those gross yellowy dots on the strip. Hm. I would probably only repurchase if it was on sale or I wasn't paying so much.
