review/summary: Stopped working after 1 monthreview/text: I had this dryer for a month and liked it. The only thing I didn't like was that I kept accidentally shutting it off because of how the buttons are placed but put up with it. Then after 1 month of use, it started blowing cold air and I returned it.
