review/summary: I would definately recommend to othersreview/text: It's by far the best blow dryer that i've ever purchased. It has alot of power and that is what I like out of of a blow dryer. It does not take long at all to blow dry my hair. I don't have long hair, but it's thick. The only con about the blow dryer is that it is &#34;heavy&#34;, however you really do get used to it. The price was very reasonable. I'm thinking about buying one for my daughter. Oh, and my husband uses a blow dryer to dry his body off after his showers, and I heard him say &#34;that's a nice blow dryer&#34; ...so even from a mans perspective it's nice.
