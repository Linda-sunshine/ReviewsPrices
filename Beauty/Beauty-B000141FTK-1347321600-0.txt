review/summary: great product, wonderful scentreview/text: I tried liquid castile soap on the recommendation of a friend to make my own hand soap and cleaning products. Dr Bronner soaps seem to be the best value, so I tried the Baby Mild first. It worked fine but the smell just didn't do anything for me. I wasn't quite ready to give up on castile soap yet, so the next time I ordered this Citrus scent, and I love it! I put about 2 tablespoons of this in a foaming pump dispenser, and fill it up with warm water, and it's the nicest hand soap I've ever used. It smells fantastic even watered down so much. It also dissolves better and doesn't clog the pump. Plus this large bottle lasts for months! I can't wait to make this into cleaning spray.
