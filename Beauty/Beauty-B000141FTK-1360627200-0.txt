review/summary: Love this productreview/text: I love Bronner's peppermint castile soap. I washed my laminate floors, dogs, car dashboard, leather sofa and kitchen counters with it. They all came out so clean and smelling great. I can now get rid of a lot of cleaning products that are bad for the environment. I will definitely keep Bronner's castile soap as a staple cleanser in my household. It will be interesting to see what else Bronner's soap will clean.
