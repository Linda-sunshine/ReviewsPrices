review/summary: Absolutely Awesomereview/text: "Skeptical" "Critic" is my name. However, this product has definitely exceeded my expectations. At first, I wasn't quite sure whether I should buy it or not - and I'm so glad I did! I have INCREDIBLY thick, long hair - just a few inches above my bum. Although it isn't very curly, because I have wavy-straight hair, it is VERY fluffy and tends to get extremely frizzy and hard to manage at times.Normally by myself, it would take me 3+ hours to straighten my hair when dry, even more if wet. I tried this right when I got out the shower with damp hair at 420 degrees; in about an hour and a half, my hair was done! Although wet at the scalp, there's not much you CAN do unless you use a blow dryer beforehand. Which really isn't all that necessary. With my scalp dry the next day, I just went over it and my hair was pin-straight, shiny, and beautiful in about 45 minutes.I have no real cons about this. I love that it has a swivel cord so it's not likely going to snap or tear at the base of the flat iron. I also really like the fact that it has a digital screen. One thing I will mention, as a precautionary, is that it DOES get real hot. 420 degrees is no joke. I have accidentally yet briefly touched the ceramic plates when they were hot and it leaves you with lingering pain, no blisters yet, though. However, with all appliances, you must be extra careful as to not hurt yourself.I would definitely without a doubt recommend this product to anyone who is a skeptic. Take it from a skeptic, this truly does work wonders! And at the price, it was well worth it. Great investment, you won't regret it!Thank you for taking the time to read my review! :)
