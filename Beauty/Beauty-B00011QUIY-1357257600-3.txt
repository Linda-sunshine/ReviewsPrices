review/summary: Finally had to replace my 25 year old curling ironreview/text: and this one is great! You can adjust the temperature for the length or thickness of your hair. I'm trying to let my hair grow out a little bit, and this works exceptionally well for putting enough of a curl in my hair to keep it out of my eyes.
