review/summary: Great Makeup!review/text: I love Bare Minerals makeup. It goes on so smooth you can hardly tell your wearing makeup. Its light and great in the warmer weather. My old makeup form years ago would make me sweat and my makeup run. This is really good makeup and does not do that. The only thing I dont like is the lock lid. It makes the last bit of makeup not come out of the container. I like the older lids Bare Minerals used to have.
