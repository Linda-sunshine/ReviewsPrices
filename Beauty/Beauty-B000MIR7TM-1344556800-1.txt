review/summary: This product is amazing though expensivereview/text: This product does work better than cheaper alternatives - much better. Youtube for use instructions. I do use this but I found a faster way to get a similar effect (with Korean sponges with vibrators, for lack of a better description) so now I use it less. If you don't mind spending some extra time on your makeup than applying foundation by hand (though less than a stippling brush for me), the beautyblender is worth a try. It really makes your makeup look natural but with that extra airbrushed look/glow. When I used this the first time, my husband asked me if I got new makeup and said I was glowing. He rarely ever notices my makeup. If you use foundation and want a natural look that makes you look like you have perfect skin and don't mind spending a little too much on a sponge and a few extra minutes, give it a try.
