review/summary: Other reviewers were rightreview/text: These make-up sponges are pricey but really worth the money. The egg shape makes them perfect to get around the eye and nose area. The only con, is when I went to clean them it takes longer to get the old make-up out than the other make-up sponges that I have used.
