review/summary: Heating mechanism stopped working after 3 monthsreview/text: I purchased this hair dryer a little over 3 months ago and the heating element is already broken. It only blows cold air regardless of the heat setting that it is on. I purchased this hair dryer based on the positive reviews that it had received, and I am very disappointed. I will not be purchasing a Revlon hair dryer again. I have an old Conair hair dryer that I have had for almost 10 years that still works like a charm.
