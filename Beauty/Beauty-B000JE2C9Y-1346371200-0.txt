review/summary: Dark, Soft, and Perfect!review/text: Before I bought this I was looking for a good sleep mask for my husband and I. I searched all over Amazon looking for the perfect one. I looked for the highest rated sleep mask and found this one. I read some of the reviews and was convinced to buy it.When it came in the mail, my husband and I were excited at the quality and softness of it. We have been using it every night since with no problems. It blocks out light better than any sleep mask we have had in the past and I love that the bands attached are made with velcro, I have had no problems with those stretching out or becoming too big like I have had with other sleep masks in the past.Now, I don't wake up until I'm supposed to, unlike before when even just a little light would wake me up or keep me awake!
