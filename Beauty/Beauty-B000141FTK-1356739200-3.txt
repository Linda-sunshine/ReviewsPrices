review/summary: Love the citrusreview/text: I have used Bronners for a long time. Usually the Peppermint or Lavender but we tried this and its now our favorite. Citrus scent is powerful. Also we used it to clean our shower curtain which had a mildew problem and now it hasnt come back in weeks. Awesome!
