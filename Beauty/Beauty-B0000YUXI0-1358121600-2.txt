review/summary: did the job 1st time - 4 1/2 yr old - FYI child needs to be 3+review/text: my daughter has been sucking her thumb since 3 mths old. as she got older it was rarely at school or activities. mostly at night and when she was tired. she is now 4 1/2 and it is impacting her speech as we have heard changes in some of her words so I bought this. she was sad about it - "my thumb taste so good mommy", but we talked about it, and I put it on the next morning after breakfast. she put her thumb in her mouth a few times that 1st hr or 2, and she did get upset, some tears, because the taste is bad, but lost of water and spitting it out and she was fine. that is all it took. at night, she didn't put her thumb in her mouth and she slept thru the night like normal and that was the end of that. we did offer her a treat if she was successful and didn't complain too much and the next day she got ice cream. clearly she was ready to let it go and just needed that little push.wanted to add that the bottle/instructions state the child should be 3 or old as the taste buds of younger children are not developed and may not work for them. hope this helps.
