review/summary: perfect for those who can't use normal heat stylingreview/text: I am biracial and my hair is like a mix between my mom's baby fine hair and my dad's coarse/dry hair. For me it means having to be wary of using any heat on it - I can't even blow dry it without causing damage. I've wanted to try flat ironing it for a long time, but I've always been scared that the combination of blow drying and then ironing it would ruin its texture. I saw this flat iron in a store and after seeing its claim that its better for hair than blow drying and flat ironing I decided to give it a shot. I'm really glad I did! When using it on towel dried hair with a heat protectant and oil moisturizer, it causes absolutely no damage at all to my hair. It dries it out but doesn't dry it out too much, and leaves it silky and smooth. I don't really understand the negative reviews that say it burned/ruined their hair... I wonder if they used heat protectant and if they used a low enough heat setting for their hair type. I actually used too low of a heat setting on my first try because I was so nervous about frying my hair, LOL. Anyways, this is definitely a product I would recommend to anyone that has issues with normal blow drying/flat ironing damaging their hair. Because it works with your hair while it's wet there's less risk of it drying it out too much and damaging it.
