review/summary: Perfect!review/text: The Conair I've had since the dawn of time finally died on me. Decided to step it up a bit and gave this a try and it's awesome! heats up super fast, holds great and makes great waves/curls. As some have said, start with the temp at the lowest setting and work UP! The heat on this thing reaches high high temps, so be carfeul,find the right temp. for your hair and you'll be happy!
