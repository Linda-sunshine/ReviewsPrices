review/summary: Gave me Contact Dermatitisreview/text: This sleep mask is decently made for the price, but it's been scented with something that broke everything it touched on my face out in itchy, stinging welts. My eyes were almost swollen closed when I woke up after wearing it overnight. Dermatologist diagnosed irritant contact dermatitis and put me on Prednisone for 6 days as well as a cortisone cream...not to mention the fact that I looked horrible for several days. I do not ordinarily have sensitive skin, nor do I suffer any allergies. Ugh.
