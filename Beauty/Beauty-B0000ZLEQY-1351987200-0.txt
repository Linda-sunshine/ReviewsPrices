review/summary: Doesn't smell like vanillareview/text: I ordered this because of the other positive reviews. On my skin this smells like baby powder, and not in a good way. I put this on and when my boyfriend came home he immediately asks what that smell was. When I told him it was the perfume he said it was awful and and making him gag.
