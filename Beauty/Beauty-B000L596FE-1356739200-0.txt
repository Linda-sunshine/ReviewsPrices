review/summary: Astoundingreview/text: I have absurdly thick, long, exceedingly tangle-prone hair. I seriously spent late November of 2011 through February of 2012 with a ginormous impenetrable tangle that would slowly engulf my hair until my sister started calling me hermione granger :/ ever since then it's been a battle requiring excessive amounts of detangler and conditioner with little success. I got this brush for Christmas and it BLEW MY MIND. It has been YEARS since I've been able to run a brush through my hair without bracing for the scalp pain that will inevitably follow. If you have long hair that's prone to tangles, get this brush!!!! You will not be disappointed!!! I have no idea how it works but it really really does.its a Christmas miracle!!!
