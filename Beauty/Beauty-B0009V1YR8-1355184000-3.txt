review/summary: Great straightener until it stopped workingreview/text: My mom has always been a CHI lover so I bought her this for Mother's Day. It worked great for a few weeks and her only complaint was that the on/off switch was a little too easy to move. This product comes with a 30-day warranty, unfortunately, a few days after the warranty was up, the straightener stopped working. It worked great one morning then that night just wouldn't turn on. Very disappointing because she's always had great experiences with CHIs but not this one.
