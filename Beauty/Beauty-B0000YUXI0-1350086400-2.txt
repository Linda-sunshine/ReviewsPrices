review/summary: Worked Perfect!!!review/text: My son has sucked his 2 fingers his entire life until the age of 3-1/2, we started with a baseball glove, which worked only at night time, we then bought a product similar to Mavala Stop called Thums, this product did not work at all, has hardly any taste, I quickly ordered Mavala Stop after reading many good reviews, tested it out my self, then tried with just a small dab on one of his fingers, he stopped finger sucking within a day. Its been 2 weeks now, and he doesn't even attempt to suck anymore. Great product!
