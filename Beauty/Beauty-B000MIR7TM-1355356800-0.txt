review/summary: Great productreview/text: I've seen so much about the beauty blender. I finally brought myself to spend $19 on 2 sponges, which I thought was too much. I do like them, foundation looks flawless and gives great coverage. Does not leave streaks like with a foundation brush. I have been using the beauty blender ever since.
