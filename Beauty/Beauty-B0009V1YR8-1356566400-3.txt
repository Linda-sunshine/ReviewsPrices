review/summary: skepticalreview/text: I bought this flat iron because I left my old one in the hotel while vacationing in Florida. Same make and model bought from an official beauty supply store. I was being frugle and went for this thinking I was saving money. I opened it and immediately thought the plastic wrapping looked old and dirty. The flat iron itself has the CHI name written in bright red on the hinge. On this iron, the logo looked half worn off and it's printed on crooked. The flatiron itself seems to work okay but I don't think it is new as advertised. I got what I paid for.
