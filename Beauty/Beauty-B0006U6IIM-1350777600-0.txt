review/summary: To be used in everything skin and hair!review/text: Now foods Sweet Almond Oil is best when mixed with your current products. I put a tsp in each of the hand and body lotions and a tblsp or two into each 20 oz bottle of shampoo & Conditioner. It has a very light scent and deep moisturizing properties. When mixed with your body regimen, it boosts the power of your products by far and lasts longer since less is needed. If your hair and skin isn't the best in the quickest time ever then I would try new products to add to.
