review/summary: Absolutely love!review/text: I bought this based on reviews and I'm glad I did. At first my skin had some reaction to it, but then it was fine after several uses. My skin feels fresh and tight. I'm 31 years old and I stopped using my anti wrinkle creams months ago when I became pregnant. I wanted to use something more natural, and I think this helps my skin keep young. I don't have any wrinkles yet :)
