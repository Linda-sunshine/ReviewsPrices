review/summary: Good productreview/text: I bought this for my 3 year old daughter after seeing a dentist and he told me that I needed to get her to stop sucking her thumb. She was developing a cross bite and if she continued to suck her thumb it could cause permanent damage. The first night I put this on her thumbs she tried to suck her thumb but immediately started to spit and said she needed to brush her teeth. The taste is pretty bad (Yes, I had to taste it after seeing her reaction). Its been almost a month and she hasnt been sucking her thumb. For the first few weeks she asked me every night if her thumb was still yucking and when I said yes she would just so okay and didnt suck on it. She doesnt ask at all about her thumb anymore. The only issue I would have with this product is that when she would eat things with her fingers she would taste it and think the food tasted bad and wouldnt eat it. I had to explain to her that she needed to always eat with her fork or spoon or the yucky stuff on her thumbs would get in her mouth.
