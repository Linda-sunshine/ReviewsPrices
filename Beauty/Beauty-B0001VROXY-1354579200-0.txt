review/summary: Really looks like Dorothy's Ruby Pumps!review/text: I love this color for winter! I found it at the salon and almost paid $10 for it, but fortunately for me they were sold out. Buying it here was much cheaper, showed up on time, was exactly what I expected! it doesn't peel off in one swoop like some polishes do. This is my new favorite color!
