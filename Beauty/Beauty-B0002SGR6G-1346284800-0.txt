review/summary: Love this color!review/text: I LOVE this color! I have different shades of purple because that's my favorite color, but this is the shade I've been trying to look for for a really long time! I've been using it a lot and I will be trying to get more in the future. Before it is discontinued! It's actually very similar to the shade Sir Planks A Lot from OPI (from the Pirates of the Caribbean collection).
