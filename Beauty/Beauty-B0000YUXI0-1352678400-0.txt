review/summary: Nasty taste = Effective Productreview/text: This stuff tastes NASTY, which is, of course, the whole point of the product. It is the only thing I have found that prevents me from biting my nails.A couple of warnings. Even though it dries quickly, for a day or two you can transfer some of it's effects from your nails to items that may end up in someone's mouth. They will not be pleased! For example, reaching into a bag of disposable dental flossers may cause some of the stuff to rub off onto other flossers in the bag. Also, you may end up with some on your fingers as well as nails, so unscrewing the top of a water bottle may transfer some of it onto the bottle itself. The other thing is, the disgusting taste can stay in your mouth for a long time, maybe an hour or more, and brushing your teeth won't do much to diminish the effect. It may be a bit much for a child to endure if you put it on their entire thumbnails.
