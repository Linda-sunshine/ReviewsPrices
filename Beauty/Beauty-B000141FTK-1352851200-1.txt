review/summary: Love this soap!review/text: Among other things, this soap makes great laundry detergent. I've been using it for several months and it does a fabulous job. It's nice to move the clothes from the washer to the dryer and have the peppermint smell sneak out into the house. But, the smell goes away after drying. I highly recommend this soap for all your cleaning needs, including your body! I've gotten rid of every other cleaning product and use Dr. Bronner's exclusively. Throw away the chemical laden cleaning products and get Dr. Bronner's, you'll be healthier and so will the environment.
