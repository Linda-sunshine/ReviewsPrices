review/summary: It's ALREADY broken!!review/text: I have had the straightener for barely four months now and it literally fell apart! I keep them in a case and am very careful when using and storing them because I know how expensive they are... I am so upset that I have to buy another straightener when I usually keep them for well over a year before having to replace! I would love a refund or a brand new product.. But I am not sure how likely that is! I will NOT be buying from this seller again!!!!!!
