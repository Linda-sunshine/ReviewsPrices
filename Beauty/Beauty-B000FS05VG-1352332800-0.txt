review/summary: Still in shock from the size of this monster!review/text: I haven't managed to use it yet, since I'm having to save up a couple of thousand dollars to expand my bathroom to accommodate the HUGENESS of this hair dryer!! It's about 4 times bigger than my old hair dryer that it is replacing And that was an entirely normal sized portable hair dryer. This on would take up half a suitcase, so no travelling for this baby. It is at least a foot long from end to end with the diffuser in place. The handle is another 8" going at right angles to the blower part, so you can get some idea of how much space it takes up. I frankly don't know where I can put it when not in use. My old one I could hang on the wall near my mirror and it was discreet in appearance and proportion. This one's a MONSTER!! And I can't believe that it is superior in performance in proportion to its great size.I held it in my hand and pretended that I was trying to dry my hair. And because of its great distance from handle to the blower tip, I felt no control of it. And to move it around my head to reach all parts of my hair, requred flexing muscles I'm not used to extending so far.It may work like a charm , but it is an absolutely HORRIBLE design. It is so unwieldy that I am considering returning it.
