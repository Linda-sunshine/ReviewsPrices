review/summary: Great eye maskreview/text: I've been looking for a good sleep mask for a while. This is ideal. I had tried an earlier, lighter one that had no adjustable strap and let through the light; then I tried one that put too much pressure on my eyes and I'd wake up with blurry vision. This is ideal - it's dark-colored and weighty enough to screen out light, and the strap is adjustable. I instantly started getting a better night's sleep.Some reviewers noticed the herbal smell. I did too the first night, but after that it vanished. It wasn't too bothersome when it was noticeable, either.
