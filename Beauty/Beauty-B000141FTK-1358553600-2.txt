review/summary: Took a little while to warm up toreview/text: 1st off this stuff is amazing the feel it leave when washed off takes a little getting used to but once I dry off my skin feels soft and smoothI suffer from eczema and finding something that doesn't dry my skin out or make me itch uncontrollably is hard to do but this stuff has done wonders for my skin as well as Dr Bronners lotionIve used it as a body wash, face wash and shampoo. And it has yet to disappoint fair warning when used as a shampoo you'll want to have a detangling brush on hand it takes a little work to comb through but the result is worth it and try to find a silicone free conditioner. You will defiantly want to condition you hair after washing. So far John Frieda's Root Awakening (has silicone but still works) and Organix which is my new favoriteBottom line Great product, Great Price and so many uses
