review/summary: Bought it August 2010, still have 1/4 left!review/text: What a bargain! It's $50 upfront, which seems like a lot for soap, but it can last you years depending on usage. I didn't want to use any artificial soaps with anti-bacterials or other chemical goop. I love that I can feel good about using this soap. As soon as I use up this gallon, which I'd guess has 6 more months in it, I'm going to buy another!
