review/summary: if you're baldingreview/text: For us women who are menopausal, this product helps to cover the balding areas. Just shake the powder onto the area to cover them up. Simple enough to use, but sometimes leaves a powdery mess. I usually shake it on to cover my sparse areas, comb my hair over that part, and then shake more onto the next area and then comb the hair back over so it has a nice, natural look.
