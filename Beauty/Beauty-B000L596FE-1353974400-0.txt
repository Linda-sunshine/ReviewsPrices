review/summary: Works, but not in way intendedreview/text: Nice brush, but doesn't work on my thick curly hair. I can imagine that if you have straight hair that this would be a better brush. The dogs just love the feel as I brush them after their bath. It is a fantastic dog brush and that is why I gave it 4 stars.
