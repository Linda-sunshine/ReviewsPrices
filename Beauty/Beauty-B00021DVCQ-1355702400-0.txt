review/summary: Is this even the real thing?review/text: I ordered this thinking I was getting a good deal on bare minerals foundation that usually costs $27 in stores. When it arrived, the color didn't look quite right and it didn't cover very well. And after using it for a few weeks, my skin was blotchy and was constantly breaking out. I started wondering if i was using real bare minerals because in my 3 years of using it, i had never experienced this problem. Then this weekend I went to sephora and bought the bare minerals there to see if it did the same thing. After one use I realized that what I had bought from amazon was either not the real thing or something that was mispackaged. Maybe this supplier has worked for you, but my recommendation is just to bite the bullet and pay a little bit more at sephora or ulta. Otherwise, this cheap bare minerals gets a lot more expensive when you have to spend $30 on the real thing.
