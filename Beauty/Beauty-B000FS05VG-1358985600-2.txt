review/summary: Disappointing & Frustratingreview/text: I actually bought this hair dryer from another site, but thought I would share my experience here now that I'm looking for a new hair dryer...again... I was pretty happy with the power, heat, and weight of the dryer at first use. My hair is chin length and straight, so only takes about 10-15 minutes to style from start to finish. Within the first week I started to notice that the dryer nozzle was starting to melt around the rim. I only use the concentrator attachment for the last few minutes of styling, and noticed that it also started bubbling and quickly burnt big holes on either side of the attachment. The dryer doesn't get as hot as a lot of them out there, so I'm kinda baffled by this. It's actually the first time I've ever seen it happen on any dryer I've ever used. Long story short, I expected the dryer to last longer than just under two months. If I had it to do over I would put the $20 towards another good quality hair dryer that won't end up looking like some weird melted mess. Very poor quality and not worth $20.
