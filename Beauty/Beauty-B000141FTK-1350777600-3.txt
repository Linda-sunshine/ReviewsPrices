review/summary: saves water because there are no excess sudsreview/text: I have used Dr. B's peppermint soap for twenty years. I will touch on two things. 1) my husband and I travel to the tropics from time to time. One day we realized that the bugs ate him and not me. Coincidentally, someone commented that I smelled good just after a bath. I realized that the peppermint soap was a protection. 2) The soaps does not suds up extravagantly. As we are discovering with our shampoos, lather does not clean. This is the best soap available. I have not used it for a shampoo. I think I will try it.
