review/summary: Versatile quality ironreview/text: I have the oldest version of this iron - lasted over 5 years already. I love that I can use it to help dry my hair; usually blow dry for a few moments, then proceed right to using the iron. The temperature control is also good - I use it at the default "15" setting (I assume that's about 350 degrees), and only go up to the 400 degrees when using home straightening products that require the high heat.I also like that the hot plates do not stick over the edges, like some irons do. Granted this means you can't use it to add a touch of curl at the ends of your hair when straightening, but I also have never burned my scalp with this iron - and I have many times with other irons, because their plates stick out beyond the base holder part.
