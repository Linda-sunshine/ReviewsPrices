review/summary: Quick arrival, highly satisfied!review/text: I have never tried out the bareMinerals product line before, but everyone spoke so highly of it, so I thought it'd be worth a try. I used the color match images provided by the seller to find my right color. The product looks great for the most part, however, I picked a color a little too light for me, so next time, I would go with the shade a little darker so it also will work when I'm tan. The package came quickly and it perfect condition. Would definitely work with this seller again!
