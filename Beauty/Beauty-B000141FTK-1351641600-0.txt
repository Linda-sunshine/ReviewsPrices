review/summary: A Work of Genius...review/text: I used to pickup Dr. Bronner's for a co-op in San Diego County back in the '60s. It's as good now as ever. You have to dilute it for best use. 3:1 for dishes and cookware, 4:1 or so for shower and hand soap. If you use the right loofah or frilly thingy you'll have suds on the walls and curtain. Never dries your skin. Feels good, smells great. I don't use it as a shampoo though regardless what the good Doctor recommends. It strips too much out of your hair IMHO.
