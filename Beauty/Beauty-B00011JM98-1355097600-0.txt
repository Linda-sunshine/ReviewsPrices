review/summary: Love the color, but it chips too quickly...review/text: I absolutely love the color of this polish! I usually use OPI nail polish and have noticed a big difference between the quality of this polish and OPI. The OPI polish goes on much more thin and smooth. This applied thick and goopy. Also, it started to chip after only a few days of wear. I can go a full week with OPI polish with only slight wear to the tips of my nails. Overall, I love the color, but wish I would have gotten OPI instead of China Glaze.
