review/summary: Excellent!review/text: I really like this product. Some of the ingredients it contains are: undistiled witch hazel, aloe vera, and rose water. I do have pure Lebanese rose water that I add to the bottle to give it a more robust scent. The scent is mild, in my opinion--if you are familiar with rose absolute essential oil, it is definitely not that &#34;breathtaking.&#34; I highly recommend adding Cortas rose water--it has no additives--and I highly reccommend this product, as well.
