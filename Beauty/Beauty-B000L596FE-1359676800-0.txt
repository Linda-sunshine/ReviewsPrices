review/summary: game changerreview/text: I have long, long, long hair that gets tangled five seconds after brushing. I'm so happy to find a brush that's gentle and doesn't rip all my hair out. But I have no misgivings that it's actually brushing through ALL the tangles. It's more like a superficial detangler for the outer layers of hair. Works in a pinch.Only real complaint is that you can't choose the color. I hate the color purple, so naturally that's what I got when I ordered. Would've liked the option to choose!
