review/summary: Perfect Hairdryer for me!review/text: The hairdryer that I have owned for 6+ years finally died on me and I needed a very comparable product but without the price tag. This hairdryer was just perfect. It's not too heavy, gets really hot and allows me to take my naturally curly frizzy hair to straight and smooth without using a flat iron!!! I love it!
