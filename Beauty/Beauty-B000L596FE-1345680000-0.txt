review/summary: Works for us!review/text: I bought this in hopes that I could actually brush through my 2 and 6 year old daughters' hair with out it being a huge deal. I really didn't expect it to work and the fight to brush hair would continue, but I was pleasantly surprised. My 2 year old has thin curly knot prone hair and my 6 year old has really think long straight hair, it works for both. Here are my thoughts 1) The bristles are soft and bend, for that reason I find combing on top and then from underneath works great. So, yes, it may be a little more work to get knots out, but it was actually less time because no one was screaming and crying. 2) I've used it with their hair wet and dry with the same results. 3) I used it on my hair (very thick) and while I personally wouldn't say it's the best brush for myself, I don't have a sensitive scalp, it has been the best brush I've found for my girls. Both my daughters love it and even want to brush their hair by themselves.
