review/summary: Smells okreview/text: I really like the smell of sandalwood so I bought this perfume oil. The smells takes a while to settle, meaning, the smell softens the longer you have it on. I discovered this after putting some on my wrist, and didn't like the initial pungent odor. I kept smelling it for about a half an hour, and was pleasantly surprised how the smell had changed.
