review/summary: Dries Fast! Nice colorreview/text: I've never used China Glaze nail polish before, but I've decided to start trying the more expensive brands to see how they compare to say Sally Hanson or the cheap $1-$2 polishes. I tried Bahama Mama from Essie and quite liked it, but I think I like the China Glaze better. This pink is neon, but it's beautiful and not too corally or orange. It was a bit translucent, so I had to do a few more coats than the Essie polish, but it dried more smoothly and it dried much quicker than Essie. The polish feels so smooth on my nails. I love it. I just painted them, so I can't say much about staying power. Essie stayed on for several days with minor chipping, and I was very impressed. Normally, I have chipping after one day, and almost all the polish is gone after a week. I'm hoping that China Glaze will surprise me and have the same lasting power as Essie. I'll update with results.
