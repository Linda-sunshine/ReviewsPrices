review/summary: Great product!review/text: Like that I was able to mix it with baking soda and be able to clean my bathroom and it's non-toxic and clean. Weird that it can cut through so much grime. I've used it on my hair and body, and not positive if I will continue doing so. Do like the ability to clean with it and price is comparable to going to a big box store.
