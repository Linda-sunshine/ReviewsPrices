review/summary: It Worked!!!review/text: This product is what I have been searching for these last few years. The only thing that stopped me from biting my cuticles were band-aids and that only lasted a short time. I was even embarassed to get a manicure, but not anymore. This stuff tastes so nasty and is so strong, you really think twice before putting your fingers in your mouth. So glad I bought it!!
