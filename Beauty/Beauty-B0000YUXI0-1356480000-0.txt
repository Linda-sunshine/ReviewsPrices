review/summary: seems to be workingreview/text: I'm a little scared this stuff is toxic, but it is working for my child. He asked for help to stop biting his nails and he is happy with the results now that he's been using it for 3 weeks. I don't put it on every other day, but whenever he or I thinks of it, probably twice a week. He hasn't completely broken the habit but we are seeing definite improvement, may even need to clip a few of his nails soon they've grown so much.
