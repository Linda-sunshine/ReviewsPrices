review/summary: it worksreview/text: This works well, tastes awful, and is a good aid in relieving thumb-sucking and nail biting. We let our child paint it on his own thumbs to have more ownership of his choices about sucking his thumb. If you are looking for an aid in the finger sucking battle this is a good one.
