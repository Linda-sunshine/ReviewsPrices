review/summary: Best curling iron I have owned yet...review/text: Granted I had not replaced my curling iron in many years, when I finally did, I went with this one. I find this to be a great buy. The various heat settings really help each person determine how much is required to accomplish their curls, without overdoing the heat and causing damage. The barrel size is nice and the swivel chord is heavy sent as it does not get tangled during use. Love this!
