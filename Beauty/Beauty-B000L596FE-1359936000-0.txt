review/summary: We had to LIMIT "preening" time.review/text: My kid ALWAYS complained that she would get knots in her hair, all the time. She hated coming them out, and she hated MY combing them out of HER hair. Then i bought the Wet Brush. Knots are NO LONGER A PROBLEM. Her hair is &#34;silky&#34; now with the new brush. Now she LOVES brushing her hair out. She now understands why Princesses in fairy tales had to brush their hair 100 strokes a night. With her, though it was closer to 1000 strokes a night. She loved the new brush so much it was never out of her hand, even during dinner. We had a pet bird a few years ago, who &#34;preened.&#34; Birds do this to maintain their feathers. I started thinking that the kid was &#34;preening&#34; with her glorious, new brush every single chance she got.So we set &#34;preening limits.&#34; She may preen after she showers, when she gets up in the morning, and when she comes home from school. Preening is NOT ALLOWED between forkfulls of dinner!
