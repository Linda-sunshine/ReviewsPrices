review/summary: Defectivereview/text: Honestly, you can tell it's a nice-smelling perfume because of the occasional hints of fragrance that come out of the bottle, but they're so rare that you're really left with what some other reviewers described as car oil smell, which I guess is like the basis oil the perfume uses. I don't know, I threw it out. Not buying any more Auric Blends.
