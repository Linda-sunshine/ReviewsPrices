review/summary: My curling Iron of choicereview/text: This isn't my first Hot Tool...love that they get hot enough to work wonders with my thick straight hair. I have three different sizes. This brand comes with an extra spring but so far I haven't needed it.If there is any drawback, it's that they get HOT...watch any skin that you don't want to brand.
