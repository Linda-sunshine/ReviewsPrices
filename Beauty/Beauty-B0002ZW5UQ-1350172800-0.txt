review/summary: Buyer be aware, this produce can cause loss more hairreview/text: 4 months ago, I purchased 2 bottles of TOPPIK hair fiber based on all the good reviews that I read from others. After using it for 2 months I noticed my hair loss getting worsen especially on the hairline area. I immediately suspected it had to do with TOPPIK. Then, I went online did an intensive search and found a few blogs that mentioned this produce can actually cause you loss more hair when using it for some people. I immediately stopped using it and my hair loss slowly back to normal pace not as intense as it was when i was using Toppik. Currently, I am on a laser treatment. It seems to maintain my existing hair. BUYER BE AWARE TOPPIK CAN CAUSE MORE HAIR LOSS FOR SOME PEOPLE WHEN USING IT.
