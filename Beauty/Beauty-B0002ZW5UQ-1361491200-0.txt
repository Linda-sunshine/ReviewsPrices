review/summary: This really works for hiding balding spots.review/text: I tried this product for thinning baldness. I am not bald, but have signs of beginning male pattern baldness where the white scalp is beginning to show through. I followed the directions and sprinkled it on the back of my head where my hair is getting very thin. I then patted it down and used regular hair spray to hold it in place. The next day it still looked good. Family members noticed the improvement immediately, but didn't know exactly what I had done until I told them. My grown daughter also used it on a wide hair part, and it made it look much better as well. I won't use this every day (because I'm not that vain), but for the days I want to disguise the inevitable balding, I'll pull it out and use it. (Warning -- it isn't water proof -- so if you get caught in the rain your secret won't be a secret anymore! LOL).
