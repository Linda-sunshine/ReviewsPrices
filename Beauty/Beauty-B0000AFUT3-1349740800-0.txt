review/summary: You've got to be kidding me!review/text: Bought the Jerdon Classic JGL9W Lighted Tri-fold Mirror for my daughter for Christmas 2010. It worked well for about a year, and has been spotty since early spring 2012. Now the lights only come on sporadically, and only if you spin the mirror, jump up and down, clap your hands and pray. Then, if we're lucky, the lights MIGHT grace us with their so-called presence. It's so pathetic that Amazon knows that half of these mirrors are defective (I mean, have they actually READ the reviews???) and yet they still sell them. If they wanted to make some money, they could make the lights replaceable and sell the bulbs.Of course, my Amazon warranty was only good for 30 days, and the Jerdon warranty for 1 year, so I'm SOL. Fun stuff.
