review/summary: Loved this Product!review/text: My daughter-in-law and granddaughter have long, thick, curly hair. We have tried so many products. I saw this product rated in a newspaper and tried it. They both loved it. It did not pull on the hair and also there was hardly any hair left in the brush after using. My granddaughter is young and it took hours to detangle her hair so this is a time saver!! Definitely recommend this product.
