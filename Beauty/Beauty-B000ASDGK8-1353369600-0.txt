review/summary: IN LOVE!review/text: There is now way you could have convinced me to buy a "professional" hair dryer... as luck would have it, my old one died and I had the time to read product reviews and find a good bargain. I figured for an extra $20 I would take a gamble and I am very happy I did!This hair dryer dries my hair in a fraction of the time my old one did. I have very THICK hair and have to dry then straighten my hair... not with this dryer. I haven't had to use my straightener since I started using this. Saves me over 45 minutes every morning, which pays for itself.I wish the buttons were a little easier to maneuver, but I'm thankful that they don't slip off the settings while I'm doing my hair. I only have to use warm and the "cold" button works awesome.Very impressed. Very pleased. Would definitely purchase again!
