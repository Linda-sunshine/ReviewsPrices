review/summary: Great moisturizerreview/text: I ordered this because I have not been able to find a moisturising natural lotion that I like and my skin was really becoming dry lately. This solved my problem. It is a light oil that absorb quickly without being oily. It also has no scent, which for me is great because I can add my own. I put this on after I shower and my skin is still moisturized hours later. For those who have sensitive skin,like me, I have not had any irritation from this product. This was a good buy!
