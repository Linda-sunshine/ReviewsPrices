review/summary: Excellentreview/text: I was actually looking for another hairdryer when I came across this one and the excellent reviews. I have very thick hair, although not long. Finding a hairdryer that dried quick was what I wanted. This product does a great job and I only used it on low. My hairdresser said there is a problem with the Ionic dryers in that they can burn your hair, so be careful.It was delivered in two days, the box was damaged on the outside but the dryer was in good condition.
