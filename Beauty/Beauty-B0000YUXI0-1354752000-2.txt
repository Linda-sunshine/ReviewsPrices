review/summary: Better than the rest!review/text: This product is so much better than any of the others. It must really stay on there, because my 6.5 year old says he can taste it for a day or two after I paint it on--even after washing his hands. We have used it in conjunction with the Stop Finger Sucking with Finger Guard Kit (Size Medium/Ages 5-6) to kick a 6.5 year finger-sucking habit.
