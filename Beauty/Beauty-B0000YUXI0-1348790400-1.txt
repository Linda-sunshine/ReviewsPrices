review/summary: Has broken my 20 year old nail biting habit!review/text: Before I begin my review, a little bit of background of who was using it: I'm 23 years old now, but when I was very young I noticed my mother biting her own nails, and in my toddler mind, I thought I was supposed to mimic her, which resulted in a very fierce nail biting habit from my early childhood. I love my mother, but she had instilled within me with something of a curse.It was psychological for me. I've read those addicted to cigarettes have a similar issue, the "hand-to-mouth" movement. I had to bite my nails. If they were even a little long, it was too long. Obviously, I knew I had to stop, but after trying a number of products nothing ever broke the cycle. Then I found Mavala Stop.This was just what I needed. From the moment I put it on, I never once bit my nails again. The bitter taste it has is so incredibly intense that it outweighs even my strong urge to bite. And the worst part about it is that it lingers in your mouth for 30-60 seconds, and to me, that made me more or less think about my actions and not do it again.I'm proud to announce I have not bitten a nail in 4 weeks, and I've lost almost all urges to at this point.As for the appearance of the stuff, it dries on very shiny and I thought it looked nice. The instructions say you can paint it over nail polish.Bottom line: If you're looking for a fantastic non-toxic deterrent for nail biting, this is the stuff! However, user be warned. Your fingers will be BITTER. Be careful when eating finger foods! Several times I accidentally either grazed by nail on the food or touched it to my lip when I was eating and found a nasty surprise! After a while you learn how to avoid it though. The most obvious tip I can offer is to eat finger foods with a fork.
