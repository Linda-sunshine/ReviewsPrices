review/summary: Kind of makes me shiny after a whilereview/text: I think I got the wrong color. lol. It's just a little lighter than I expected so I didn't rate based on that. For me, a person with oily combination skin, this foundation made me look a little too shiny after a few hours of wearing it. I guess I should have tried the matte foundation instead
