review/summary: Perfectreview/text: No issues, wrapped properly and I bought it for only $18. This cologne retails for almost 3x times that amount. It's a must buy for any teenager - 30 + years old. It has a soft, &#34;fruity&#34; ( in a good way ) smell to it. Hard for anyone to not like this product.
