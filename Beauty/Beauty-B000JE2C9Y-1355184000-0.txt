review/summary: Just a heads up...review/text: I like this mask a lot, its the first eye mask i've ever purchased and its great. That being said, i feel like i should write my FIRST product review to warn people that...**the colors bleed and stain your pillow!!! So WASH it first, in hot water and soap in your sink, i washed it three or four times until the water washed clean.**Other than that, love it.
