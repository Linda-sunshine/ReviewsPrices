review/summary: Love itreview/text: I was skeptical, especially because of the price, but I did some research online, watched some YouTube video and bit the bullet. I have to say: I'm in love. I started wearing liquid foundation again because of the Beautyblender, it gives some a nice finish and it looks so natural. I'm recommending it to all my friends/family. Hopefully I can convert some folks. Whatever they've done to make this different than the imitations is working. I'm a forever user!
