review/summary: Cheaper than Sephora.review/text: This is perfect, and exactly the same as what I purchased at Sephora a year ago and cheaper than what I remember from buying my last product at Sephora. I have been using it for a few years and does a wonderful job and looks natural. It also comes in a cute pink bag :).
