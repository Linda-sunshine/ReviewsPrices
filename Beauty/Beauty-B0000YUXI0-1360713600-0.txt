review/summary: Worked For My 4 Year Oldreview/text: My daughter started sucking her thumb in the womb. Her father also sucked his thumb. Her father is also a dentist and begged me to start teaching her to stop sucking her thumb and recommended this stuff. It was how he stopped sucking his thumb.She sucked it whenever she was nervous or when trying to fall asleep. She sucked her thumb a lot! In addition, every time she sucked her thumb she twirled her hair with the other hand.The product goes on like nail polish. It's clear. I just put a dab on (thanks to other comments on here). I put it on a few hours before bed and we talked about it. I told her it wouldn't taste very good if she sucked her thumb. She understood and refrained from sucking her thumb up until bedtime. She fussed a little in frustration and cried a bit. Eventually she fell asleep with out sucking her thumb. However, when she half-woke up during the middle of the night she subconsciously started sucking her thumb (full force) and immediately started sticking her tongue out and fussing. Still half asleep and feeling stressed she stuck her thumb in her mouth again and sucked and got another big taste. This woke her up immediately in full tears. And then she started gagging. And then she threw up a little. I was prepared for this because of past reviews so I had a towel ready and could quickly cover her mouth and keep things clean. After a hug and a kiss and a little time sitting together talking about it she was ready to sleep again. No other problems that night. The following night pretty much the exact same thing happened. However, that was the last time. She hasn't sucked her thumb since and as an added bonus, she stopped twirling her hair! Yeah! No more knots in her hair!So for effectiveness: 5 starsFor this item working on a type of shock therapy: 4 starsI don't know how &#34;moral&#34; this way of getting a child to stop is, but it worked. And rather quickly.
