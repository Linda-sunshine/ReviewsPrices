review/summary: Fake Chireview/text: I am almost positive this is a fake. And it's nothing better than my old and cheap flat iron... I went to a salon to compare to the ones they sell, and they look completely different... first, the real ones are called I.Chi, not Chi, and the real one's name is written in little gemstones... this is not a bad product, but not a real I.Chi either... and I don't like that you cannot control the temperature... I hope I can return it since I'm not impressed with it at all.
