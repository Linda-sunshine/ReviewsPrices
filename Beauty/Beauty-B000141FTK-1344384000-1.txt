review/summary: Great soap, if somewhat idiosyncratic stuffreview/text: Try this soap, you'll probably like it a lot. There are many smells to choose from, and they are all a little weird, so order small quantities initially and judge for yourself. My take on the versions:Eucalyptus - Favorite for bathing. Somewhat musky/masculine.Hemp Tea Tree - Also good for bathing. Also somewhat musky/masculine.Hemp Lavender - Probably best his-her compromise of masculine/feminine perfume for bathing.Almond Oil - Very sweet smelling - too much perfume for bathing. Good for hand basin.Rose - Sweet smelling, OK for bathing, overall a feminine perfume.Peppermint - Smells like candy cane, good for bathing, doesn't leave much perfume after a shower. Somewhat tingly sensation on skin.Citrus - Strong, lemon candy smell - too much for bathing. Good for kitchen.My main beef with this soap overall is that it doesn't work well in a plunger bottle: as you are fairly warned on the label, it will clog up. So, you probably need to buy a small bottle for convenience and refill it with a big one for economy. No big deal, but if they figured out how to package it in a plunger bottle, it would be perfect.
