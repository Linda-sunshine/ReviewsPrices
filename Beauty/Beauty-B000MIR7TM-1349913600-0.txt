review/summary: All honestyreview/text: I still ended up using more foundation than I would using the blender than when I use my foundation brush, and that's with using a primer as well. I did like the way it blended, almost flawless but if you naturally have a good hand at applying makeup then I suppose you could achieve that with any tool. The blender also does soak up way less product than your average makeup sponge does, but it's still a sponge and it still soaks up. I guess I was just expecting a miracle of sorts since most magazines and celeb makeup artists swear by it but there's still improvements to be made. Overall, I think it's a bit over priced for what it's worth. I'll continue to use the one I have until it inusable anymore but I don't think I'll be rushing to purchase another one anytime soon. I'll start looking for a good quality foundation brush for now.
