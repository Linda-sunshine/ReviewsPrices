review/summary: This brush does not work on wet wavy or curly hairreview/text: My daughter's really do no like having their wavy hair brushed when wet. I bought this brush thinking that it would help make the process easier and a little less painless. I WAS WRONG. This brush does not make brushing wet hair easier, in fact, it appears to cause a lot of discomfort and breakage. Great concept but not practical. I do not recommend this brush.
