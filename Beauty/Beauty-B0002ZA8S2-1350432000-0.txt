review/summary: Super HOT and easy to usereview/text: This curling iron is superb. Only takes a few seconds to curl and the curls hold for hours. Definitely recommend for those who want tighter curls or those with shorter hair. Also has a really long cord for easy use and a replacement spring, if ever it breaks.
