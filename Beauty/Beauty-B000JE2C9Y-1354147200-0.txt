review/summary: Almost perfectreview/text: I bought this because the apartment I live in has crap blinds and I can't rely on the worthless apartment management to fix this so I decided to but this mask.Pros:-Soft-blocks out light completely-inexpensiveCons:-Velcro can get annoying in the back, I worry about the Velcro ruining my pillow cover-the mask is so lush it's like wearing a blanket on your face this makes me a little bit too warm-I use it so regularly I'm not sure how long the fabric will keep up because it is so OrnateOverall if you are having trouble sleeping due to the sun buy this you won't be disappointed.
