review/summary: Fancy baby powder?review/text: I recently ordered a small sampling of Auric Blends fragrances, and this one was a disappointment. It started out nice and smelled nice in the roller, a fresh rosy-jasmine smell. However, it quickly changed to an unpleasant nursing home smell, finally drying down to a baby powder smell. The smell is giving me a slight headache, lasting forever and I will never, ever wear this again. It might work on somebody else's chemistry, but I can't imagine many people wanting to smell like either an old lady or a baby's bottom. I love other scents by this brand (Love, Sweet Rain), but this was a miss for me.
