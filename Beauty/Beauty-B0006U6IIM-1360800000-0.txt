review/summary: I am delighted!!!!review/text: My husband has been purchasing this item from WHole Foods for a while, but it was a quarter of the size and at a higher price than Amazon almond oil. I was delighted to find a 16oz version for about $9 bucks. I am going to use this almond oil to mix with a unrefined ivory shea butter to make the shea butter easier to apply.
