review/summary: Hides your "Eye Sour" Hair Line Instantly!review/text: I am a huge fan of beauty secrets and this one makes it in my Beauty Book! I was using Xfusion for a while. I then ran out and tried Toppix. I like this one better! It covers my hair line much better, and stays on better. So ladies if you have a large part in your hair that shows your scalp--Get this product it works! You don't have to worry about people noticing your thining hair. You also don't need to spend money on products like &#34;Rogaine&#34;,Hair Transplanting or Hair Weaving. It comes in different shades to match your hair too.This product is affordable and provides instant natural looking coverage for that embarrasing hair line that you need to cover up. I highly recommend this product.
