review/summary: My New Beauty HGreview/text: I have been moving to using natural beauty products for the past year or so, and I decided to try this oil because I found that the application of coconut oil after a shower was a bit too complicated, because coconut oil is solid at room temperature. I also found coconut oil to be a bit too heavy to put in my hair. I love the way that this oil feels on my skin; it just drinks it up. I have very very sensitive skin, so I apply oil after I shower to avoid dry/itchy skin. I also put a few drops in my hair, once a week, in order to seal the ends. It isn't too heavy for my fine curly hair, and it has no odor at all. My skin/hair really likes this oil, and I will certainly be purchasing again. What a great find :)
