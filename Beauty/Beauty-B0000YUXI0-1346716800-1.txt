review/summary: Thumb sucking is over!!!!review/text: This product is amazing, my 6 year old son has been sucking his thumb since he was 3 months old. We constantly would tell him to take his thumb out of his mouth. He wanted to stop but it's such a bad habit that he just couldn't. He was ready to stop so I told him I was getting his some stuff that will help him. I painting Mavala on both thumbs just in case he would revert to the other thumb and within a few days he has completely stopped sucking his thumb. I probably didn't need to buy two bottles, but I'm painting it on his thumbs every day and night until I know for sure he has kicked the thumb sucking habit for good! Thanks Mavala I will recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing this problem.
