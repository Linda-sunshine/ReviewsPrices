review/summary: Pair with similar shampoo/conditioner for best resultsreview/text: I have naturally thin hair so I encounter a lot of breakage. I've tried so many treatments to resolve it that it's not even funny or capable of being tracked at this point. The macadamia oil was a refreshing surprise. It had a very small impact when I paired it with my regular shampoo/conditioner(Aussie brand). After about a month(using it 2-3 times per week) I noticed my hair was stronger- less would break off when brushing/combing after a shower. It was a nice surprise.What gave the oil an even better effect was swapping my Aussie out for natural based cleansing agents. I picked up some tea tree oil based hair products and began using those instead of the Aussie and continued to use the oil mask regularly. The change was noticable within 10 days. The tea tree oil shampoo and conditioner (Organic Health Invigorating Tea Tree Oil Shampoo & Conditioner + FREE Tea Tree Oil Soap Bars by Herbal Authority) actually improved my scalp and eliminated a lot of dry and flaking skin I'd experienced and gave my hair a healthier look. Now, 6 weeks into this, my hair is breaking even less and it feels thicker. I don't feel like I can't style my hair anymore for fear of it coming out in chunks. The combination has really given me a better, fuller head of hair.
