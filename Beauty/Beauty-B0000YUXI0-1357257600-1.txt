review/summary: Thumb sucking NO MORE!!review/text: We have been using this product on our 3 year old son since December 8, 2012. Once we put it on, just a little bit, he tasted it once and has not sucked his thumb since that day. It took a few nights for him to get adjusted to falling asleep without sucking his thumb, but it really wasn't too bad. It may have also worked because I discussed with him that he needed to stop sucking his thumb and that we were going to buy something to help him. He kept asking me when we were going to buy this product, so he was ready to stop sucking his thumb and just needed some help. We haven't stopped yet, because we fear that if we stop too soon, he might revert. I think we will do this for another month. Overall I am very please so far and this was way less expensive and cumbersome than those thumb guard contraptions. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to help their child to stop sucking their thumb. It's a good first step rather than going straight to the thumb guard contraptions. Good luck!
