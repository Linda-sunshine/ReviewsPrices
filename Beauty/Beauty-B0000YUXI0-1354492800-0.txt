review/summary: Worked like a charm!review/text: My son's 7th birthday was fast approaching, he had permanent teeth coming in and there was no sign that his thumb sucking was slowing down. I ordered this product and showed him pictures of people who were never stopped sucking their thumbs and he agreed to try. Our only mistake was not covering his hand that first night. He put his thumb in his mouth while sleeping and the taste woke him up (it really is awful). After that, he put a sock on his hand before bed and we had no problems. After about a week, he stopped using the sock and has never looked back.
