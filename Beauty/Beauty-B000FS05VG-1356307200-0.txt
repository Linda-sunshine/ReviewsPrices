review/summary: RV544review/text: Who would've thunk it!!!! This $20 blow dryer is fantastic. Warm setting is actually warm...and stays warm. Can hold barrel with my hands. Diffuser is just the right size. Very high air flow. One review complains it went out after 10 months, who cares it was $20, I spend more than that on lunch most days.
