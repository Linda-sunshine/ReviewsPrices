review/summary: works wonders for acnereview/text: My teenage son gets acne on his back. We wanted to try something natural to treat it, after trying so many of the typical acne products out there. I saw some reviews for this that talked about helping acne, so decided to give it a try. This has worked much better than the acne products he's tried, and best of all it's not full of chemicals. We've begun using it in our household cleaning as well.
