review/summary: Sweet!!!!!review/text: I have tried emu oil, olive oil, castor oil, grape seed oil, coconut oil, and jojoba oil. This oil tops them all. I have added it to my arsenal. It is very light, odorless, and sinks right into skin and hair. Because it is so economical, you can use it all over everyday. I use it straight from the bottle after taking a shower and I use it in my homemade hair mixes. I spritz my hair with water and rub a few drops into my hair and it keeps it soft all day. I don't know how I managed to do without this oil for so long. I am a convert and will always purchase sweet almond oil from Amazon.
