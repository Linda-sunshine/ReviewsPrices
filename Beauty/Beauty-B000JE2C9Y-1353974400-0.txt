review/summary: Much better than expected!review/text: I passed over this sleep mask the first time I saw it due to the reviews about the peppermint smell. I don't particularly like peppermint and my skin can be sensitive at times, so I was worried about that. I went back to it again and decided to give it a try. The peppermint smell is almost non-existent and it was gone after the first night's use. In addition to that, it is very soft and comfortable. I've never used a sleep mask before, but my husband insists on watching TV while falling asleep which makes it so much harder for me to fall asleep. This one is perfect and a lot more comfortable than I thought it would be. I do take it off if I wake up in the middle of the night. If you're not going to purchase this due to the peppermint smell, buy it anyway! Its definitely bearable and goes away quickly.
