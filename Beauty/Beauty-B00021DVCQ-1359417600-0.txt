review/summary: My favorite foundationreview/text: This is my favorite foundation. I have sensitive skin and I am very acne prone but this foundation helps keep my breakouts away by wearing it. I never use to wear makeup because of hour I break out but this really helps. I haven't tried much else of bare minerals but I am slowing trying new things. This color is perfect for my winter complextion. its very light but it makes me feel like I am not a ghost!
