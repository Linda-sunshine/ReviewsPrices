review/summary: Love this stuff!review/text: My husband and I recently switched from conventional soaps, etc. to more eco-friendly soaps. This is a switch we made - we both love it! We use it for body wash (and he sometimes uses it instead of shampoo). I even bought foaming hand soap dispensers to use this in - it's great! i love how concentrated it is - a little really does go a long way. And I've really become fond of the smell of tea tree oil.
