review/summary: You won't be disappointed.review/text: I also have several Chi curling irons and I prefer the Hot Tools Professional series. I just purchased the Hot Tools Professional 1102 Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control, Big Bumper 1-1/2", and it makes taming my hair a breeze. It's too large to create ringlet-type curls, but if you're like me and would rather sleep than play with your hair in the morning, this is a must-have. It cut my hair time down to 5 minutes. A couple quick curls on each side lasts at least 24 hours. I have long, thick, coarse hair and this gets plenty hot, but also has temperature control for those with finer hair. The only downside would be that I thought it was suppose to come with extra springs, which I did not receive, but I think the company is pretty generous about providing those to customers who need replacements.
