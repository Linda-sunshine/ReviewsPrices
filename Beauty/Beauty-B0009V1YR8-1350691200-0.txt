review/summary: Perfect so farreview/text: It was not a fake. I checked. I love it so far. If that ever changes I will update, since I have only had it for almost a month now. It heats up in 78seconds for me. Yes, I timed it. I read a lot of bad reviews and I wanted to post what I found too, and this was it. It straightens my hair really well. My hair is not that curly, just a little thick and wavy, plus random. It takes a me a total of 10 mins to straighten my hair and most of the time I do not need to straighten it for a 2-3 days. I would recommend this straightener.
