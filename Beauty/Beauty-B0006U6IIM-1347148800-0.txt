review/summary: Soothing light oil to irritable sensitive skinreview/text: To make it short and sweet the customer service is top quality. I received my order about 3 days after ordering, free. The oil I superb. Everyhing I expected plus. No odor, blends well with other essential oil such as tea tree or lavender. I have extremely dry skin and suffer from eczema and nickel allergy and this oil is by far the best remedy to soothe my irritable skin. No need for lotions with synthetic fragrances and other sorts of junk. All I need is this oil! I will be purchasing more soon. I am very pleased.
