review/summary: lock doesnt workreview/text: unfortuneately, the last three bare minerals products i have bought, all have a flaw in the locking mechanism. Where in my makeup bag, it will unlock and dump alot of product in the top. Then when you open it, powder goes everywhere. If it happens to you with the &#34;warmth&#34;...be prepared to live with that stain. I love bare minerals and thought it was a wonderful idea to put the lock on there, to avoid loss or stain. When it first changed they used to stay locked, seemed to work well. But now, why put it on there if it doesnt stay locked? I am living with a stain now, when you wet it...try to clean it...it gets worse.
