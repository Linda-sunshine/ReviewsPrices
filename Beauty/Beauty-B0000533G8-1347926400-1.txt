review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: I loved this stuff so much, I purchased the lavender as well. I suffer from keratosis pilaris, which is virtually impossible to get rid of completely, and after using this stuff consistently in addition to my usual lotion, I have seen a huge improvement. I think the oils must make my skin softer and thereby making is easier to exfoliate. I don't care for it as a shampoo, it left my hair feeling kind of dry. I also used this on my two year old as a body wash (he suffers from the same skin condition) and his skin was so much softer after his bath. The peppermint is strong but delicious smelling and if you are sick or congested, this is a wonderful way to temporarily relieve your congestion in the shower.
