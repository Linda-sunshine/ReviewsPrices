review/summary: Without a doubt the best hair dryer I've ownedreview/text: I'm really not into beauty routines and I typically don't get excited over many products- but I couldn't stop gushing to my boyfriend about how efficient this hair dryer is and what a great price it was.I have very long hair that is thick, yet fine. I used to have to wash my hair in the evening because there was absolutely no time to dry my hair before work in the morning. This dryer is so powerful that it dries my hair in a fraction of the time, yet doesn't leave it scorched, dry, and dull. The air is just warm and strong.There is weight to the dryer, but it's not heavy- it just feels like a quality product that isn't made of cheap material. The cord is also extremely long- much longer than any cords I've had before (which is very much appreciated).I'd buy this hair dryer over and over again.
