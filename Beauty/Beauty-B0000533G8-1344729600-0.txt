review/summary: LOVE Dr. Bronner's!review/text: I LOVE this soap! I use it for shampoo, shaving, body wash/soap, laundry, cleaning, and hand soap. I bought foaming soap dispensers and it works great! For shampoo I use it full strength but I don't need much at all! I am happy that the ingredients are organic and I LOVE that I am supporting an AWESOME company! I have other Dr. Bronner's products (chapstick, leave in hair cream, hair conditioner, other scents of the Castile soaps) and I LOVE them ALL!
