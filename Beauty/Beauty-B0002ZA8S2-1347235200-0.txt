review/summary: Great Product!review/text: For all those burning your hair off, turn down the temperature!Great product, it's not as sturdy as I'd like but it gets the job done. Really like that the temperature goes from really low to super high, great for saving time, just rack it up to the max and then bring it down.It's a little on the slippery side and while I wish I had gotten the 1 1/2 (was it 2 in?), it still works great for tight or large curls.Would recommend!
