review/summary: Love itreview/text: Love this blow dryer! The power is wonderful and it heats up very nicely. Couple of minor low points...it is pretty heavy, compared to the cheap blow dryers I was used to using. Also, you slide the controls up or down instead of pushing buttons and they are kind of difficult to slide, especially when hands are wet or recently lotion-ed up. These however, are by no means, deal breakers. I have very long and thick hair and the dryer dries my whole head in about 5 minutes, as opposed to the 8-10 minutes that it used to take, with the cheap, drug-store blow dryers.
