review/summary: Natural hair galreview/text: Ok.. So I recently decided to start taking care of my care.. I was miserable and didn't know what to do. If you have kinky natural hair, then you know what the deal is with our hair. Ughhh.. lots of work and time. Watched a few you tube videos and everyone said you need to have Jojoba oil as one of your products. So here I am per orders of you tubers.. I like it. It makes my hair soft.
