review/summary: Great Curlerreview/text: I love the heat settings, I have not had to turn it up very high. My last curler I turned all the way up and was holding my curls for over 30 seconds and getting so-so results. This one I use on 3 and hold for 10-15 seconds and have great curls! I also love the rotating cord, it makes it very easy to maneuver this curler. I am very glad I bought it.
