review/summary: One of my favorite nail polishesreview/text: I love the subdued sparkle that this gives my fingers or toes, it really looks like you'd imagine Dorothy's &#34;Ruby Pumps&#34; would look like. A bit difficult to get off as any &#34;glitter nail polish&#34; but not as bad as some. Stays on (at least my toes) remarkably well.
