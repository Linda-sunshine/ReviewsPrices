review/summary: Ordered and paid for a 1'' curling iron and got a 3/8'' onereview/text: That's it, I ordered a 1'' curling iron but I got a 3/8'' and I can't return it because it's already out of the US so it isn't under guarantee anymore. I didn't knew they sent me the wrong size until it was in my hands here, in my country.Nevertheless, the thing works perfectly. I already bought a 1 1/2'' and it is amazing, I love it!!Those 2 stars are because now I have to wait for another chance that some acquaintance goes to the US, so as I will buy another curling iron (hoping they send me the right one this time...) and this person will bring it to me when they are back in the country... but only God knows when will that be... Damn you, Hot Tools people and thank you, by the way!SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH!! :S
