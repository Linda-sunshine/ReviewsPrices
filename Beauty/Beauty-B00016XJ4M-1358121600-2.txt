review/summary: Rashesreview/text: I have never had a reaction to any facial products until now. The smell was okay, and I have been using it for about 2.5 weeks. I randomly get pimples. However, I now have little patches that are dime sized on my face. This is the onyl new thing introduced to my face, as nothing in my diet or anything else has changed. I don't know if it's old or what. I know Witch Hazel is fine, so it's some other ingredient that doesn't agree with me. Not a product I'll be using again.
