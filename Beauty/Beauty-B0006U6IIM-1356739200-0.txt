review/summary: Good just like the rest of NOW foods oilsreview/text: Good oil, great price. I am happy with all of the oils I've purchased from now foods. High quality. I use this oil with some great fruit essential oil to use as a moisturizer on my legs. It's not too greasy and gives a slight pretty shine. I keep it in the fridge to stay fresh in my warm climate.
