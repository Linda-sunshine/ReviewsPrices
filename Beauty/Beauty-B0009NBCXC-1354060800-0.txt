review/summary: Amazing moisturizer!breview/text: I purchased this product in my search to find the best moisturizer. I love the fact that Jojoba oil is natural. I only use the Jojoba oil for my face, since it's rather expensive, and use almond oil for the rest of my body. My skin is naturally oily so it would seem counterintuitive to put an oil (actually it's a wax) on my skin. However since jojoba oil is so similar to the natural oils in human skin, my skin actually produces less! I usually apply it in the morning after showering, letting my skin absorb as much as it wants, then blotting off the excess. (A little goes a long way.)
