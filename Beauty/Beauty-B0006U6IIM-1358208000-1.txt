review/summary: Best Price I Could Findreview/text: I make my own soap for personal use. The recipe I use calls for 16oz of almond oil among several other ingredients. Beware that fluid ounces do not equate to weight in ounces. Using my digital scale, the almond oil in the bottle weighed approximately 14.9 ounces.
