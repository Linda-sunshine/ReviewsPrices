review/summary: A Perfect Natural, Responsibly-Produced Soapreview/text: I love Dr. Bronner's! Its oils are organic and Fair Trade. It can be used for almost anything, and you never have to worry about what's in it. There are no drawbacks to this product. The peppermint scent brings with it a tingly feeling.
