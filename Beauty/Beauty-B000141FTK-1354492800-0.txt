review/summary: Wonderful discoveryreview/text: I've seen this line at stores previously, but never paid much attention. Out of curiosity and based on issues with incredibly sensitive and dry skin, I read some of the reviews here on amazon. I decided to purchase it, and am so glad I did. I dilute it 50/50 with water and use it as a hand soap and body wash. My skin is in its glory! I also use it as a household cleaner in our bathrooms and to wash our dishes, love love love this stuff!
