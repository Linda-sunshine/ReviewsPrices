review/summary: Love these!review/text: I used to use these all the time when Biore first brought these nose strips out but then they got a little on the pricey side and I eventually stopped using them.However, I forgot how well they do work. They are so easy to use too. Just cleanse your face first, then make sure your nose is wet, apply the nose strip, wait 15 minutes, peel the strip off, and if you're like me, look at the strip to see what it pulled. I know it sounds gross and improper to talk about but half of the fun of these strips is seeing what is on the strip once you're done with it. And be glad that your face is now cleaner because you used the Biore nose strips.Also, make sure that if your skin can dry out easily to put on some mosturizer after using the strips as they can dry out your skin a bit.
