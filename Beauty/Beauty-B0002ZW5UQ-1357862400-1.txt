review/summary: worked for mereview/text: I have had thin hair for a few years now and have tried many different products in attempt to make my hair fuller. When I was pregnant I started taking prenatal vitamins and my hair looked wonderful. After having my daughter I noticed my hair was starting to shed. Though I have had thin hair I never experienced shedding like this! I was devastated and embarrassed that my scalp was starting to become more visible. I started searching for a long term and quick fix for my hair. I found amazing vitamins and started taking them and then I found Toppik. It is easy to use, slightly messy but worth it in the end. I am able to hide my scalp and I am no longer embarrassed. I wish I could post a picture of before and after. There is a great difference without looking fake or odd!
