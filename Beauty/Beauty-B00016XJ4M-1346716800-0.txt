review/summary: Miracle Worker!review/text: About a month ago, I was on what felt like a neverending search for skincare products that would help my sensitive combination skin. My skin tends to be dry, and because of that dryness, it overcompensates with oil production. I purchased many lotions, some of which made me break out horribly, and eventually decided to take a chance on Thayers. The first day I used it was horrible! I thought I would have to return it. About 30 minutes after the initial application, my skin was more oily than it has ever been in my life. I stuck with it, however, and within a few days my skin had adjusted. Now my face stays soft and moisturized without getting shiny, and stays that way throughout the day. My complexion tends to be ruddy from years battling acne in my teens, but I have noticed the discoloration evening out. Because I was used to applying lotions to moisturize my skin, I thought I would have to use a lotion in tandem with this product, but Thayers surprised me with its hydrating properties and I often use it alone. My husband uses it when he gets razor burn and feels it helps soothe the irritation. I am extremely pleased and will most likely be using Thayers for the rest of my life!
