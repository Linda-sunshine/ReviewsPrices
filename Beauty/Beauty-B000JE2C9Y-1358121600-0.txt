review/summary: The BEST mask ever!!review/text: These are the softest, easiest to use masks I've ever had. They make a migraine easier to get through and on cold nights they keep your sinuses comfortable for sleeping. I will be ordering more. I ordered 6 and gave them to all the family that gets migraines.
