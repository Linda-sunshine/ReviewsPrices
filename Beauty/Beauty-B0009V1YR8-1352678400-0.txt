review/summary: Quits working in less than 6 monthsreview/text: It was a great product for a great price, until it quit working less than 6 months later. And because I purchased it through Amazon, it wasn't covered under the manufacturer warranty, so I have to buy a new flat iron. This is the second flat iron purchased through Amazon to quit working in less than year, so I absolutely do not recommend buying this item. Buy a better quality flat iron from the manufacturer, so it's covered under their warranty.
