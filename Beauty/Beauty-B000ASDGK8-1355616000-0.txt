review/summary: Love this hairdryerreview/text: I received my first one as a gift several years ago. Was forced to replace it and could not imagine going back to those sold &#34;over the counter&#34; at local retail stores. It's powerful & relatively quiet, which is important to me as I hate loud noise. I feel like my hair feels silkier vs. that fried/dried feeling my hair used to have with other dryers. I can't see how anyone would regret this purchase.
