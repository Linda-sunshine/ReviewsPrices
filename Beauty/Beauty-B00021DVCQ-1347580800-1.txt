review/summary: Sent wrong colorreview/text: I was happy to receive it as I was out and needed to take some along on vacation only to find out the wrong color was sent and it did not work with my complextion. I didn't look at it closely upon receiving it as I took for granted that the right color was sent, thus throwing out all of the packaging it came with so I was unable to return it.Next time, I will be sure to look closely to make sure the correct color was sent. Only for that reason....I was dissappointed.
