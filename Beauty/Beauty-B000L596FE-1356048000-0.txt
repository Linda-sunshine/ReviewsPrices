review/summary: Wife loves it!review/text: Simple, yet highly effective for brushing wet hair!My wife primarily uses this at our cottage when she gets out of the lake - and it makes brushing her long hair a breeze. Can't quite figure out what makes this so different from other brushes, but for the price it is an excellent buy!
