review/summary: Great pricereview/text: I use this as a leave in conditioner. I put a glob on, comb it through and put a shower cap on and leave on for about 10-15 minutes. My hair is considerably damaged, because of highlights and its pretty soft after this treatment. This is a great price compared to comparable products of this sort.
