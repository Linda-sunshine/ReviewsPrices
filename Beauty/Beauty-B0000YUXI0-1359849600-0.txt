review/summary: Worked for us!review/text: My son is about to turn four and has sucked his thumb since he was a baby. This product was my last resort to get him to stop before moving onto the thumb guard contraption. I had little faith, thinking it similar to another "paint on" product that had no effect, but the reviews were good, so I tried it. He vomited the first time he placed his thumb in his mouth, and didn't try again until the morning when, out of habit, he did it again. Only a gag that time around. The next day, no thumb at bed time or in the morning! I just applied it to his nail again tonight (per instructions to wait two days then reapply) and no attempts to suck his thumb again. No complaints...nothing! This is way too good to be true! I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but I am on cloud nine thinking his thumb sucking days might be over. So, be wary of a little sickness especially if your kid can't make it to the toilet fast enough yet. We found out ours can...well mostly.
