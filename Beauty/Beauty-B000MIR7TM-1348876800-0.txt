review/summary: Ripped but still worksreview/text: It's a sponge so naturally its going to rip after repeated use. I think it ripped fairly quickly though even though I moisten it prior to use. The price has increased since it's popularity has soared, way too pricey now. Okay product if you want to even and smooth out your makeup, 3 1/2 stars for me.
