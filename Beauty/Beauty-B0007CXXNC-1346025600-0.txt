review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I have long hair with damaged ends, always have but never will again! I use this product everytime i wash my hair.. it somehow keeps my hair moist but not greasy, it doesn't tangle when i brush it even when it's wet, plus it smells great!I don't have split ends anymore and it added some shine to my hair. i got the leave in conditioner as well but i didn't like it..it made my hair feel heavy. i think this product is enough if you use it as a subtitute to your conditioner.
