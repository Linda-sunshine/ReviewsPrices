review/summary: Softer hair but lacking in strengthreview/text: Compared to some of the other drugstore brand hairdryers out there, this one fails to meet my pretty high standards. Don't get me wrong, it's an alright product for when you're in a pinch and someone else is hogging the other dryer. I wouldn't go for this on a daily basis though. Reason being that even when you're on the high level, the air still comes out lackluster, medium-force, and it takes me a lot longer in drying my medium-length, thick-ish 'do. I'm usually a sleeping in kind of girl, so I tend to rush in the mornings, and this just doesn't cut it for me. What I will give this props for is the verity of its claims in achieving "ultimate shine, volume, and healthier looking styles". That's the truth! My hair is softer, bouncier, and shinier as stated, it just takes awhile to get there with this Revlon product.
