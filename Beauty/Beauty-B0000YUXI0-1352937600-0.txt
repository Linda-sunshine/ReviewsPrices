review/summary: Great for nail biters!review/text: I've been biting my nails for about 15 years now and have never been able to stop. Applying this to your nails definitely stops you! My issue why I have not broken the habit yet though is I don't always apply it so I can wane off it, and I so far have failed. But when it is applied it absolutely does its purpose! I've tried polishes like this where I would still bite my nails despite the bitter taste because it was tolerable enough. THIS one is not! Who would've thought that saying something tastes awful in a review means it gets 5 stars! It lasts a long time as well, and it dries in minutes and is clear, so men (like me) can use it and not be worried :p
