review/summary: I swear by this product!review/text: As someone with acne prone skin, the use of harsh salicylic acid-containing products causes my skin to become very dry, especially during the winter. Jojoba oil alleviates that problem while simultaneously clearing my complexion (far more than any moisturizer has ever done for my skin). If you have problems with dry yet blemish-prone skin, I'd absolutely recommend purchasing this product.
