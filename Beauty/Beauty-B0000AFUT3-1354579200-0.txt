review/summary: Good mirrorreview/text: I am pleased with the mirror. It gives off a good light and is easy to use. It is not as tall as the former mirror that I had, but I do like the side mirrors. It is difficult to find make up mirrors in stores. I like to look at the merchandise prior to buying it . I was pleased with the tri-fold mirror that I purchased and would recommend it to others.
