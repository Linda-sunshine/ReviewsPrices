review/summary: Ouch!!!review/text: I bought this straightener after my old one, that I'd been using for years, cracked and started pulling my hair out. I only use it for my bangs, so I didn't want to spend a lot. My old straightener was another cheap model (I got it from WalMart for about $15), so I was expecting this one to suffice. The problem is that there is little insulation between the hot plates and the outside of the device. Because the plates don't meet all the way down (only at the very tip), you have to try to force it down by hand for equal heating. The lack of insulation can easily cause burns. I've burned my fingers multiple times. I only gave it 1 star because I would never buy it again. I would also urge others not to buy it.
