review/summary: This is how the gods bathe.review/text: Dr. Bronner is a mad genius. His soap washes away even the most sinful residue of my daily existence. Oil, dirt, grease, sweat, tears, you name it . . . . the highpoint of any day is lathering with these magical suds.But keep it out of your eyes . . . it stings, yo. That, and it's difficult to read the inspirational madness scribbled in 4pt font on the bottle.
