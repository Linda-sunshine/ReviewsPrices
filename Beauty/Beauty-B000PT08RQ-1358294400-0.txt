review/summary: Great hair tool!review/text: I bought it for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loved it. It has a digital feature that she says,'Sounds Futuristic mom.&#34; Great to use on wet hair to style straight and dry. She even used it on me once and for having curly hair, it did the job of straightening it. Great buy for the money.
