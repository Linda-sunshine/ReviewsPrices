review/summary: Great summer scentreview/text: To anyone who reads this: I have ordered 6 bottles of Cologne from Amazon and all have been authentic. Please, please, make sure your cologne choice is &#34;BOUGHT FROM AND SHIPS FROM AMAZON!&#34; If you are ordering any cologne from a Beauty or specialty shop you will get burned.At $13 I figured it was worth a shot and ordered 2 bottles. I don't regret my purchase at all...describing scents is nearly impossible for me, but I will say that this is light and would be best used in summer. I'm wearing it now as I drink my coffee, I sprayed it on last night so it has decent staying power. Recommended over Nautica Blue.
