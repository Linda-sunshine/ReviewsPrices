review/summary: Not a Great Hairdryerreview/text: This is the worst hairdryer I have ever purchased. Neither of the settings are low enough to not tangle my hair into knots, which I have never seen a hairdryer do before. Its heavy, and my hair is a wreck by the time I use it for only 5 minutes. I will never buy this brand again.
