review/summary: fake Chi! Burned my hairs!!!review/text: I would give negative starts if I could. I had it for 4 months now. This morning when I was using it, I smelled something awful, then I see some brown color stuff sticked on my hairs. When I touched it, a good portion of my hairs broken down!!! I then noticed there were hot glue leaking out form the cemeric plate. I can't image what would happen if it gets on my skin. FAKE FAKE FAKE CHI!
