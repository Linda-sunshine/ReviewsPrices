review/summary: Good, not greatreview/text: I had used a friend's BaByliss hairdryer while staying at her house, and it was awesome! It made my hair look the best it had ever looked, dried it so quickly, and it was so stinkin' shiny! Of course, I immediately came home and went on amazon and found this hairdryer. I saw the price and was so excited! So I bought it.I'm not sure if it's not the correct hairdryer, is a different model or a different year, but the other dryer was way better. Don't get me wrong, this is a very nice product. But it's pretty heavy, not quite as powerful, and is just overall more like a drugstore hairdryer rather than a salon one. It does the job, but is definitely not the best hairdryer I've ever used.
