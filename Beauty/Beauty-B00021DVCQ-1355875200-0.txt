review/summary: Not the real thing?review/text: I have used Bare Minerals for 7 years and had no issues. I started using this from Amazon on Sunday and was not happy with it. The foundation does not cover as it has previously and the color is off. I supposedly received the correct color. I bought another foundation from Sephora yesterday and will compare the two. I will not buy from Amazon again due to this past experience.UPDATE - I received my foundation from Sephore and IT WAS EXACTLY AS EXPECTED. The foundation covered exactly how it and how I expected. I will NEVER buy Bare Minerals from Amazon due to this experience. It is a shame that the quality of the foundation cannot be guaranteed. Since it was fulfilled by Amazon, I thought there would be no quality issues.
