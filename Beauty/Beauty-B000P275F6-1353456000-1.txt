review/summary: Freakin ridiculous price!review/text: Smell isn't bad at all for the price. I went out and bought one of those Ralph Lauren polo shirts, you know, the one with the big ass logo on the front...some moccasins without socks and went out searching for a yacht while watching my death grip on my starbucks Venti. As a matter of fact I smell amazing.
