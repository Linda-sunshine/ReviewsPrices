review/summary: Smells completely different from the original scentreview/text: I have been using Egyptian Goddess for at least about 7 years and I thought I would order from amazon rather than the auric blends site because it was free shipping and a little cheaper.. So disappointed!! The scent is somehow different and even when I opened the package it had a different oiled scent as if one spilled over it? It just so happened to also smell like patchouli which I can't stand!!I will no longer order from this site for that I KNOW what it should smell like and I don't know if it's old or what but that is not the Egyptian goddess I have been getting I will spend the extra few dollars and go to the real site!
