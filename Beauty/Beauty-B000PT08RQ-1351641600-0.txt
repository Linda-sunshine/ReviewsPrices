review/summary: Good but not as much promisedreview/text: I have been using this for a month. It works amazingly on dry (or a little moist) hair. I did try on my hair (medium length and thickness) when wet (without blow drying; i.e. just towel dry hair)but it did not work. It took me quite long, however the end results were not even near perfect. However I'll refer this as worth the price, if you are looking for a normal hair straighter with no magical powers.
