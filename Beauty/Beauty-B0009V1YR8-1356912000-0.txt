review/summary: Awesomereview/text: I am really happy with this hair iron. It heats up fast and gets really hot. I have been extremely picky about hair irons and this one gets my hair really straight and does not take too long to get the job done- i have very kinky frizzy hair. I do couple it with a spray and blow-dry my hair first, but I think the iron in regards to others I have used is excellent.
