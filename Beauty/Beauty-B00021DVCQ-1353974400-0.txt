review/summary: Best Foundation I've Ever Usedreview/text: I've been using this makeup for about two years now. This is the best foundation I've ever used. It gives great full coverage without looking like I'm wearing makeup. I started out with the starter kit from Sephora and really appreciated the tutorial DVD that came with it.
