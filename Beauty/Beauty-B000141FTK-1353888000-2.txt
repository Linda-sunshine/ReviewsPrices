review/summary: I have used this soap for 34 years approximation!!review/text: This is good soap I use it for many things including my animals that have skin issues, peppermint is my favorite. This soap is a must for people that camp or outdoors use. This soap is much better for the environment than most soaps in today's market. Preserve what attracted you to the environment leave it cleaner than you found it.Get a small bottle to keep in the bathtub especially if you have kids and buy the larger refill your small bottle with a preferred dilution ratio. Otherwise you will go through a years worth in a week !!
