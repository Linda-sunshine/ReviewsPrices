review/summary: I didn't like it at firstreview/text: But now I've grown to like it. You have to paint in thin coats and do 2-3 coats of it for it to look good. It's streaky at first but after the second coat, it gets better. Also, give it time to dry. It's an interesting color but I would probably pick something else over it if looking for a cute minty color. It's a little too weird.
