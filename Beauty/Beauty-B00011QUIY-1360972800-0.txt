review/summary: not what i expectedreview/text: This iron is a bit on the heavy side and snagged and pulled my hair and left it dry dull and lifeless, i actually had parts that looked burnt and crumbled to the touch and i was not even to the extremely hot setting , this is just a metal barrel the gold blah blah is non sense, i have a paul mitchell straightner which is soo smooth and adds shine to my hair probably i ll try the curling iron from same brand.
