review/summary: Great Dryer for the Pricereview/text: This blow dryer gives the feel and results of a salon dryer at a much more reasonable price. It dries my hair more quickly and leaves my hair much softer than any other dryer I have owned. Some of the other reviews mentioned that it was heavy. It felt that way to me at first, too, but within days I didn't even notice. I highly recommend this dryer.
