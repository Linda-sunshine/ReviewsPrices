review/summary: Worst product ever!!review/text: All I truly want to know is, "What are these other reviewers smoking?!!?!?" This product is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!! We received it in the mail on Tuesday (Oct 22, 2012) and I was STOKED based on all the positive reviews. I took it out of the package and started combing my daughter's hair (she just turned 3, she has medium hair with a TON of curls!!) and the brush was just pulling and tugging at her hair, WORSE than if I would have just used a wide tooth comb. So, I sprayed her hair with water so it was wet (after all, this apparently is a "wet" brush), and that didn't matter at all. She wanted me to stop combing her hair immediately. I have NEVER had a problem combing her hair, she even sits there while I have to pull and tug the tangles out of her curls! But she wanted me to stop and wouldn't let this brush go back to her head.So, I thought I would give it a try. I have super THICK wavy/curly hair and O M G...what a JOKE! I, by NO means have a sensitive scalp, but I was almost crying using this brush. The bristles basically SCRAPE your scalp....nothing "massaging" or comforting about that. Let alone, it didn't do crap for my hair. Pulled and tugged at my hair. After I got all the tangles out of the top of my hair, I had to take the brush and brush underneath to get the tangles out. THEN I had to go back to the top because I had tangles AGAIN!!!Needless to say, we knew within 5 minutes this product was a joke and we were sending it back!! I wouldn't even give it one star.
