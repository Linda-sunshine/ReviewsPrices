review/summary: Buying Cologne Online?review/text: At first I was skeptical to buy a cologne that I had never actually smelled in person. However, the reviews were good, the product had a good price, and I had a gift card :-). The item arrived in a few days and I was very satisfied with the purchase. The smell is very good and stays on for hours without it being to overpowering. It is a good casual scent that anyone can pull off.
