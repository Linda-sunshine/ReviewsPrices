review/summary: works well and didn't notice a weird smellreview/text: I bought this product despite some other reviewers saying that it had a bad odor. I admit, it smelled like something for the first day or two. The smell wasn't really good or bad, but it went away and haven't noticed it since. It does a great job of keeping the light out and is adjustable to fit with Velcro. It takes some getting used to, but I think that would be true for any sleep mask.
