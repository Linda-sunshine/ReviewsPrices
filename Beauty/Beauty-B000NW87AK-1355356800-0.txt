review/summary: Does what it promises but the smell = (:'-O)review/text: It's wayyyyy to floral for me. Sharply so. This doesnt smell very sexy in my opinion; it's a nice smell but way too sweet & flowery- Even after I rubbed it into skin & let it sit. I even put it on my armpits lol (that was the best smelling option :X) long lasting & noticeable but not overpowering.
