review/summary: Best stuff around for dry skinreview/text: I have very dry skin - especially during the colder months. When a friend suggested jojoba oil, I was doubtful. I've always used Aveeno or similar products. But I gave it a go, especially since this oil was not very expensive. Wow--best stuff I've ever used for dry skin! I've noticed that between showers, if I've used the oil, my skin doesn't flake like it used to - even with Aveeno. After showering, I just rub the stuff in all over my skin so it doesn't stain my shirts. Never had a problem.I'm hooked.
