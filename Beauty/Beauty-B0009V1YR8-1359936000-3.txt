review/summary: FAKE. PERIOD.review/text: This is NOT an authentic CHI. I'm pretty impressed with the extent they took to make it look real. I used this iron once, and my inexpensive Wal-Mart iron does a better job. Also, I was very suspicious by the packaging. One look at the instructions and I knew it was fake. There are so many grammar and spelling mistakes. SO I went through Misikko online and ordered the exact same CHI iron. It's amazing the difference, the packaging is much more professional and the product is the real thing. This is my first bad review to write on Amazon, and I'm very disappointed that they continue to sell these under false pretenses. I will be very guarded in the future, and reluctant to buy from Amazon.
