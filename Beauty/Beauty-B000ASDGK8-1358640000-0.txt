review/summary: Great hair dryer!review/text: ProsLeaves my long/ wavy/normal-to-fine hair smooth and shinyStrong air flow, but not too strong that it instantly tangles hairThe option for hot air is actually hot without being scaldingThe switches for temperature control and speed don't accidentally switchNice designCuts down drying timeGreat priceConsA little heavier than I'd likeHandle can be a little slippery due to the smooth texture of the dryer- kind of hard to holdThe shaft of the dryer (where the air comes out) is a little longer than I'd likeOverall, I recommend!
