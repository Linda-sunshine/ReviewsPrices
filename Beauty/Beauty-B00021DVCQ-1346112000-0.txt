review/summary: Terrible productreview/text: I have been using BareMinerals for the past 5 years and have purchased it from different stores and never had a problem with it. However when I purchased it from this company on Amazon, I found it was of poor quality. It appears to be imitation and not an authentic product. It does not cover like the real one, even the texture is different. I was very disappointed with the product and the Company. I do not recommend this company for makeup Products.
