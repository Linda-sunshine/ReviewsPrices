review/summary: Summit Rx Inc./Starotc -- FAKE CHI'Sreview/text: 0 STARS!After reading some of the reviews for this product I began to second guess my purchase. I went to JCPenney and purchased an AUTHENTIC pair of Chi flat irons and then I tried to cancel my order. I knew the Chi's from JCP would be real because I purchased my previous pair, which were stolen, from it. Anyway, thankfully, I was not allowed to cancel the purchase so I was able to compare the two flat irons. Future buyers...STAROTC/SUMMIT RX INC., is scamming people. These flat irons are not authentic. FYI...even if you don't have the money to buy a real pair to compare just go to a salon that sells them and pick the box up. Real Chi's weigh more than fake ones. Also JCP salons have every Chi it sells on display so yea...go have a look.
