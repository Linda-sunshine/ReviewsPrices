review/summary: Finally got my hands on this little gemreview/text: I'm a little embarrased to admit that Ingrid is the first CG Polish I've ever owned.... despite being a lover of all things polish. being a single mom on a budget, i originally set a pretty low limit on the amout im allowed to spend on a bottle of polish. But after a while I realized it was worth it once in a while. I may be the queen of drugstore cosmetics, but I certainly see the value in buying a good brand like CG. You get what you pay for, and I do think my beloved ingrid was worth it. The color is beautiful, the formula is great, and its wearability is awesome. In person, the color is different to me than the swatches...as most bloggers will tell you. But, unlike some, I love the color in person. Kinda muddy, in a good way, with gold micro shimmer. This may just be the beginning of a love affair between me and China Glaze
