review/summary: Inexpensive and effective while still being light on skinreview/text: I've gotten about halfway through my bottle, so I figure now's as good a time as any to leave a review.I never used a toner before, but apparently there's a bit of debate as to whether or not they're even worth it. The basic premise is that they can help clean out those last lingering bits of dirt and oil after cleansing your face (some people going so far as to argue that it "restores the pH balance of your skin" but I'm not so sure on that).After each cleansing, I dampen a cotton ball with this and pat/rub it on my face and neck. Sometimes it's a little tingly, but usually it's very refreshing! I'm a big fan of witch hazel, so I really like that this product is witch hazel based instead of alcohol.I don't have any miraculous claims about this product working wonders on my skin, but I don't really have any huge skin issues to begin with. I don't feel quite so oily, and I admit I like the cleansing feeling.However, I did have a nasty batch of ingrown hairs on my legs--the really awful sort with red, painful bumps and whatnot. On a whim I put a bit of this toner on, and while they weren't GONE, they were drastically reduced the next morning.
