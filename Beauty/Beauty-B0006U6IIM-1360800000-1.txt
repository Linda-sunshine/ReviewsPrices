review/summary: Great for fixing frizz!review/text: I usually don't write product reviews but I saw this oil on Dr Oz. He recommended putting it on your hair and wrap with a towel for 1 hour, then shampoo and condition. It really works for dry damaged hair. Ladies I would definitely buy this oil for dry, damaged and frizzy hair. It's a very noticeable difference. Conditioner wasn't working, but this oil worked great.
