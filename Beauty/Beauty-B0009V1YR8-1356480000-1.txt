review/summary: You get what you pay forreview/text: I've had this since April and it burnt out in October as well as burnt my natural hair. I should have spend the money to get the real product because I messed my hair up trying to save money. Please read the reviews prior to buying this product if you don't want heat damage. I would not recommend this to my family or friends at all.
