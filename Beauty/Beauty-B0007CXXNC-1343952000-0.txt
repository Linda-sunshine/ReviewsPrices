review/summary: One of the better deep treatments I've triedreview/text: I've been trying to improve the condition of my overprocessed hair for about a month now. I had it dyed a medium blonde at my usual salon, but I guess the hair color didn't agree with me as it washed right out with 4 shampoos that WERE color protecting, and normally held up my color for months. I dyed it myself, but the color didn't take and it ended up taking me 3 tries of coloring to finally get the color I wanted. Between those colorings I was deep conditioning and doing protein treatments like crazy and this is the one that helped a lot, my other favorite being the Matrix Biolage Intensive Strengthening Masque. I didn't get the jar as I didn't want to try product that was $35 only to end up hating it, so when I saw the store had a travel size bottle I got that. I am very impressed with this, it was moisturizing and smells fantastic. My hair is much softer and little less frizzy than normal. When my little bottle runs out, I'll definitely be buying the big jar!
