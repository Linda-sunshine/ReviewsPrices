review/summary: Good While It Lastedreview/text: I purchased this dryer less than a year ago and I loved it. As the other reviewers note, the high setting is seriously high, and I've been able to dry my hair more quickly with this dryer than with any other. Unfortunately, in the last several weeks it's begun to act up: when I slide the switch to high, the dryer shuts off rather than kicking into the high setting. I contacted Conair (the actual makers of this dryer) and was told that I will receive a replacement for the dryer, as long as I am willing to pay to ship it back, pay for the return shipping of a new dryer, and wait two to three weeks (AFTER they receive my dryer) for the replacement. As I told the customer service rep, that's a long time to be without a hair dryer. I'm giving this item two stars because it's great when it works, but the durability is questionable and the warranty is far less than stellar.
