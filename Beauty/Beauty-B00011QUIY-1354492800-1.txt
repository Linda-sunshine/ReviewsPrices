review/summary: Hot Tools HT1109 Midi Professional Curling Iron 5/8&#34;review/text: I have purchased several Hot Tools curling irons over the past 15 years and have been very pleased with the performance and quality of them. In the past, I have purchased the 1/2&#34; because that is typically the smallest barrel carried in stock at cosmetic/beauty supply stores. I wanted to try the smaller barrel as I have very straight, short hair and wanted to see if that would give me a longer lasting lift. For some reason, this unit does not seem to get as hot as my previous Hot Tools curling irons, but other than that, I am very satisfied.
