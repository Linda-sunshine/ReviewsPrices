review/summary: A Monster!review/text: I've never owned a hairdryer this hot, this strong and this effective! Even the 'Warm' and 'Low' Speed settings are stronger than any other hairdryer I've owned.This is perfect for people who know how to work a hairdryer and want to go from wet to dry, fast. If you're slow and meticulous with your hair this might be a little bit too hot and too strong for your liking.Amazing value for money. I'm thoroughly impressed.
