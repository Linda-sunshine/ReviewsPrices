review/summary: Awfulreview/text: This is a terrible product. It doesn't have a way to adjust the temperature and it doesn't get very hot. You can tell that it is some kind of knock-off, there are typos on the printed text on the box. The body is rickety, it feels like the two irons are going to come apart. There's a reason this product is so cheap...it's cheap!
