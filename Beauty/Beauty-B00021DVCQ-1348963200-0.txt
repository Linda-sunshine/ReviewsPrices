review/summary: Counterfeit?review/text: I've been a Bare Escentuals BareMinerals user for about a decade. I usually buy direct, either from the store or online through the store's website. The last time I was out, I decided to check Amazon and ended up buying this. Unfortunately, the product I received through Amazon did not have the right consistency nor the right coverage that I've come to expect of the real BareMinerals.Recently, the real Bare Escentuals had a no shipping fee special so I ordered a container direct from them to compare. Right away, I became even more suspicious of the Amazon sold makeup. There are subtle marking differences between the two containers; the kinds of things you might expect a counterfeiter to get wrong. Also, when I shook out the two out side by side, the makeup in the Amazon container is significantly drier and lighter.If this is not the real BareMinerals, and truthfully I don't think it is, then I worry about what I was putting on my face for those few weeks. :-(Caveat emptor. If you want the real BareMinerals, I suggest buying direct from Bare Escentuals or via one of their stores. If you want a fake, your local drugstore has several knock-off mineral brands that are properly labeled (and even cheaper).
