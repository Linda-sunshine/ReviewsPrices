review/summary: SIMPLY THE BEST!review/text: The ABSOLUTE BEST curling iron that Ive come across!I have been trying to get nice CURLS on my ends for some time now, and Ive tried a lot of things.I went to the salon and my stylist used this iron, and NO HAIRSPRAY, GEL, MOUSE, OR whatever else makes curls stay, and my curls stayed in for like 3 days! I did not want to wash my hair, just because I was so amazed by the beautiful curls and waves that I woke up to! So I decided to buy it to see if I can do it myself.This curling iron out does my name brand curling irons without a doubt! I have one that goes for about 3 to 4 times as much as this one, and then I have a set that goes for a few hundred dollars, yet this is the ONE that actually works!The curls actually stay in my hair (unlike with the other curling irons), and because of how effective it is, I dont have to keep trying, and trying, and trying... all while buring my hair and damaging it!I spray my hair with a heat protector, curl small parts at a time (counting to 5 with each strand) and when I'm done I spray lightly with a flexible hold hairspray, then with a sheen spray. I run my fingers through, gently working the curls apart...and voila! I've got beautifully curled hair!
