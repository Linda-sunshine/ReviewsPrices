review/summary: Very Pretty, Good for the Holidaysreview/text: I bought this a few weeks before Christmas. The polish is a perfect color and style for Christmas. The polish is just the right amount of shimmer to look pretty at a party.As with most China Glaze products, this polish is nice and thick and doesn't require a ton of coats to get a good paint job.
