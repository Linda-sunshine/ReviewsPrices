review/summary: Great hairbrush!review/text: My daughters both have long, thick, wavy hair that cannot be brushed easily at the best of times, so I purchased these brushes based on the reviews. Both girls LOVE them! Whether brushing their hair while conditioning, or when using with a detangling spray, there is virtually no pulling or breakage, and, best of all, no complaining!Highly recommended!
