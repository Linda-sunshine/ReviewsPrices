review/summary: Works if I can remember to put it on several times a dayreview/text: My daughter is 4, and as active as she is it tends to rub off if not applied at least 2 times a day. It dries quickly which is a plus. Some reviews have said they threw up... Wow, way over the top. It's a taste that stays in your mouth for an hour most, to remind your brain chewing your nails is disgusting. I have used this for 3 weeks straight and she is still biting her nails. Product works like its supposed to, expensive in my opinion, but maybe she's not ready to stop? I'll use all of the bottle and hopefully it will work over time.
