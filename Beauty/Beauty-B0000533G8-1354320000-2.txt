review/summary: I love this soap!review/text: It is an inexpensive alternative to body wash, shaving cream, and face wash- I use it for all of the above! It smells nice, doesn't irritate or dry out my sensitive skin, and gives a refreshing almost tingling sensation. I don't use it much around the house, but I love it as a body wash and to clean my makeup brushes.
