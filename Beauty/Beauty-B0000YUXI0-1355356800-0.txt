review/summary: Worked on daughter, not on son.review/text: I have twins, both age 4, 1 boy and 1 girl. My girl likes to suck on her middle fingers, while my boy is addicted to sucking his thumb. We bought this as a last resort and it worked wonders with my daughter! SHE HATES THE TASTE!!! First few nights she woke up crying because of the nasty taste, and now, a week later she is finger sucking free.My boy, hates the taste.... but when he's asleep he doesn't even notice it and sucks his thumb as usual. We tried double coating his thumb and that didn't work either... we finally gave up and are just putting socks on his hands at bedtime. That has worked wonders so far. Will report back later on that!
