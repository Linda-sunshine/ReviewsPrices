review/summary: Disappointed with sellerreview/text: I've always been a fan of this hair mask but unfortunately I had to give it 1 star since the jar I got in the mail is either fake or defective. The stuff made my hair really really dry and tangled. I noticed right away because everytime after I put this hair mask on, I always touched my ends and they felt really soft and smooth; this time however they dont. I am returning this jar and probably wont never buy it from Amazon! BEWARE
