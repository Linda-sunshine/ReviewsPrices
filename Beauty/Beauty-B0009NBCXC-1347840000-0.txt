review/summary: NOW Foods Jojoba Oil Pure, 4 ouncereview/text: In the past, I had been using jojoba oil by Carol's Daughter. Although it was a great product, it was VERY expensive and it wasn't all organic. The jojoba oil from NOW Foods is even BETTER because it is 100% organic and pure. I have definitely been more cautious lately of the ingredients I use on my hair and skin. For my naturally curly hair (type 3b), I use this product to oil/moisturize my scalp and to seal/protect my ends. I also use this product on my body and face (not too much on the face though). I like to think of this product as an all-purpose product because it can be used for almost anything! And I am so glad it is not expensive to purchase!*For more information, visit my Youtube channel: Dpayne8 ([...]).
