review/summary: Stopped our 4yr-old thumb sucking immediatelyreview/text: Our 4yr old daughter stopped sucking her thumb in one day -- no joke. She was constantly sucking her thumb, when she was tired, bored, scared, hungry, and all through the night. We tried everything else like bandages, gloves, positive and negative reinforcement. But nothing was going to come between her and her thumb. One taste of the Mavala Stop on her thumb and she never wanted to put her thumb in her mouth again. A week later we've stopped using it and the habit is broken, no more sucking. I know this product won't work for every child, but it was the perfect solution for our child.
