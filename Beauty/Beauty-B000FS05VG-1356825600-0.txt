review/summary: ok--like it, especially diffuserreview/text: I'm not in love with this thing and I don't hate it. It takes longer to dry my hair, but maybe that's a good think, kwim? Love the diffuser tho. It's big so you can't travel w it, but it's a good quality good for curly hair home staple piece. good purchase
