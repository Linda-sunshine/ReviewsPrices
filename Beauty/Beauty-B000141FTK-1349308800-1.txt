review/summary: Shampoo and Hand Soapreview/text: What this does to your hair, you'll love it or hate it depending on how you like your hair and probably the nature of your hair.I have limp, long, thin, black hair (Asian type). I chose Tea Tree with hopes of soothing my scalp. With just two drops of this stuff I'm able to rub it into a foamy mousse to apply to my scalp. The results: my hair feels thicker, looks more lustrous (in a silky not slick way), it's less tangled, and has an interesting texture. I LIKE IT. Some may get the same results as me and be appalled. My hair feels weighed down, each strand feels like it's coated with oil- Some would say greasy but I say it feels protected. I haven't worked up to using this regularly yet because after a couple days in a row (yeah yeah yeah I shouldn't wash it everyday) the build up can make my hair a bit too stringy looking.I also use this as a handsoap. Great value.
