review/summary: Dr bronners tea tree soapreview/text: My sister recommended this to me and I was skeptical. I am nt a hippie and I don't camp. Turns out we love this stuff, it has a nice scent and cleans well. I mostly use it as hand soap in a foaming dispenser, and in a spray bottle to clean the kitchen counters. Tried it in the shower and was not impressed as body wash or shampoo. God soap and seems like a good value.
