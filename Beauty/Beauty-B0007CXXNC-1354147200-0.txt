review/summary: At first highly dissapointingreview/text: After all the reviews, I purchased the large jar and was expecting great results. That is far from the truth. At first my hair was very dry after using this product and that was very disappointing. After that I started using it in large quantities per treatment (just to get rid of it) and it started working quite well. To this day I am not sure if it just takes a bunch of applications before the results are evident or just need to use large quantities at a time. Either way I highly doubt I will ever purchase this product again. There are so many more to try and this is not a keeper so far for me.
