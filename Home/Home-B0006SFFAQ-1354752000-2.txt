review/summary: just as good as the reviews sayreview/text: Very, very pleased after two mornings. Setting up this unit for brewing is so intuitive I didn't have to refer to the booklet to get it programmed. I did read it, after all was set up, to see if I missed anything, and then decided to follow the directions and flush it out by running a cycle (I did two, actually) with no coffee. I used the gold filter basket without a paper filter, after reading reviews that mentioned paper filters filtering out the flavorful oils. The coffee was excellent, and I'm pretty much a coffee snob. I ground my coffee, btw, the night before, and programmed it for first thing in the morning. The soft beeps at the end of the cycle are not objectionable at all. It even has a knob to choose L, M, or H for the carafe hot plate temperature, which is new to me, and a GREAT idea. The little filters for the water are made with minimal materials, and are inexpensive. I assume you could just use filtered water if you didn't like replacing the filter (what I do at work). I used the "1-4 c" extra hot water push button both mornings. I can't imagine a better coffee pot! It fits fine under my cabinet. I chose this one over a unit that has an insulated carafe, as I "like" to see how much coffee is left in the pot, and we drink it so fast the insulated carafe is unnecessary. Hope this review is helpful; the ones I read were very helpful in the decision-making process.
