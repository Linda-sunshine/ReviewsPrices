review/summary: Great pot.review/text: This pot is great. You fill it with water, sit it on its base, push the switch down and wait a couple of minutes for a pot of boiling water. Couldn't be simpler. If you pour a glass of tea and walk away it will eventually cool down, though it holds its heat for a long time. Just walk by and flip the switch down to heat back up in a few seconds. I wouldn't let the water level get below half full doing it this way. Just for safety's sake.Overall, a great pot.
