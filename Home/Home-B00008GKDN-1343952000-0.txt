review/summary: Great price/performance ratioreview/text: I bought this for a friend. I personally use an All-clad 12" coated pan with a long cool hangable handle and light compared to iron, but it's pricey at $70. I really had to toss a coin between the two. The only downside to iron is weight and ease of cleaning, but the upside is that, imho, iron is the best for cooking and you can't really beat the price. I bought this for a friend to make pancakes, french toast, omelettes, but bacon and eggs, as well as just hamburger (or anything you have to flip) makes this type of pan a real must in any kitchen. Weren't these around when I was growing up as a kid? The traditional pans with higher sides were always a nemesis to me. I highly recommend this type of pan for everyone's kitchen. Splatter, you get splatter with any pan and the low edges make it so much easier to get that spatula to slide under to make great omelettes rolled as good or better than Perkins or Ihop, (depending on your personal culinary skills).
