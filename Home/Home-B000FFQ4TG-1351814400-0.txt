review/summary: Bunn's the Bestreview/text: I've owned the Bunn NHBB Velocity Brew 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, Black for just shy of 1 year - and it's delivered consistent great tasting coffee.Coming from a prior Bunn, I knew of their quality; IMO they make the best coffee makers in the market.The 3 year warranty is great and after reading some reviews, I found you can call customer service and get a Restricted Flow Spray Head for stronger coffee.I called customer service was directed to a representative within a minute and it's on it's way! Their customer service was great and says a lot about the company.
