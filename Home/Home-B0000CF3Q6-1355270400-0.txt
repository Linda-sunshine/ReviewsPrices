review/summary: 4.5 Starsreview/text: I really love my stovetop espresso maker. Only problem I have is that some of the coffee grinds seep up to the liquid container, even if I don't grind it finely. I solved this problem by cutting out some round pieces of filters from what I had left over when I used the drip coffee machine (takes only a couple of minutes to do about 100. It works great and isn't a hassle for me to do because of how great my espresso tastes now!
