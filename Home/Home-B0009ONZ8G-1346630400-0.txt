review/summary: Nice simple vacuum!review/text: I love this vacuum. In this age of space age vacuums, this one holds firm as a "good-old" vacuum. I hate the bagless ones that make such a mess when you try to change them. The Dyson ones are ridiculously overpriced. This is just a simple, sturdy vacuum that does what it is supposed to do: suck up dirt.
