review/summary: Love it!review/text: We love this skillet because it is so easy to clean it. The see- through lid is a plus. No need to remove lid to check food. This is our second one The first one was lent to son & family. They did not want to part with it. So, we gifted it to them & found this deal hard to beat. More expensive in retail stores.
