review/summary: Warning warningreview/text: I purchased this as a gift for my mom.She lives in Joplin,Mo.The tornado of May 22 2011 miss her house by 3 blocks.I had the radio shipped to me in Illinois so I could program radio stations 3 each AM / FM along with batteries so if necessary she could unplug it and take it with her if she had to run for cover.The night before shipping it to her about 4:20 AM the alarm went off to warn me of a incoming Winter stormin the Milwaukee area.My dogs and I jumped up and went running to check it out.IT WORKS GREAT and best of all my 87 year old mom loves it.
