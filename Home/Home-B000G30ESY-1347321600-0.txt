review/summary: Best Wedding Presentreview/text: I was absolutely thrilled when someone bought this from our wedding registry. It is easy to use and makes really great rice. It is rather expensive and I probably wouldn't have bought it for myself because of it. Since someone else was nice enough to buy it for us, I have fallen in love with it. Now that I have used it so many times, I realize that its worth every penny.
