review/summary: Stiff and rough after two washings. Too short.review/text: These sheets look okay but they're so stiff and rough I haven't used them yet. I've washed them twice in hot water and will do so again and see how they do. I don't know whether it's the fabric or the amount of sizing, but so far I can't recommend them. I'm going to find the ones I've ordered before and get another set.It's now February and I've finally put them on the bed. They never got softer. They come out of the dryer very wrinkled and stay that way. My husband had to help put the fitted sheet on because it's a little too short, and our mattress is only 9 inches deep. This sheet would never go on a deep pocket mattress. The top sheet barely tucks in at the bottom. I'm going to accept the loss and give these sheets to Goodwill. I do not recommend them.
