review/summary: Bought for travel...been perfect for every day!review/text: I originally purchased this electric kettle to take with us when we travel. We participate in a lot of athletic events out of town, and not every hotel room has a microwave and/or breakfast amenities the day of that are open before we leave for our event. We figured this would be a great, compact kettle with which we could heat water for our tea, oatmeal etc. It has worked great for that, and then some! I now use this at home to cook all of my tea water. It is small, compact and makes the perfect amount of water for a few cups of tea. I am sure it is not large enough for larger families, but it works great for my hubby and I. Would definitely recommend!
