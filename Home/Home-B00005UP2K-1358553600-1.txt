review/summary: Get the tilt optionreview/text: This is a powerful counter top mixer that has the very recognizable look of a Kitchen Aid mixer. The only complaint is more my fault than the manufactures and that is I wish that I had spent a little more money and got a model that the mixer tilts back for access to the bowl.
