review/summary: Flour Storagereview/text: I vacuum seal half-gallon mason jars with this attachment. Before this attachment I would buy a bag of flour and only use a couple of cups before throwing the rest away. I don't feel like cooking anymore when I find that my old bag of flour is enriched with fresh insect protein. Now with this attachment a five pound bag of flour will fill two half-gallon jars and store indefinitely.Normally if you try and vacuum seal a jar of flour it will not hold the vacuum for more than a day. During vacuum sealing the flour rises in the middle as trapped air escapes. The very fine flour-dust gets embedded in the rubber gasket of the jar lid. The trick I find that works reliably is to wipe down the insides of the jar, wash the jar lid and place an unused coffee filter inside the jar on top of the flour before sealing. The filter helps hold the particulates down inside during vacuuming.It is a good idea to check your freshly sealed flour jars for a couple of days until you are sure it is holding a seal. My jar of flour has been holding tight for several months now. I find that I cook more since I am not discouraged by the fear of unused ingredients going to waste.
