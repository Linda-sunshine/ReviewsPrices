review/summary: Great design and very sturdyreview/text: Great product. It really added extra storage space and makes it so much easier to locate the plastic wrap. I used another rack to hold my DVD player under the TV that sits on my bookcase. A word of caution, be sure your shelves are deep enough to accommodate this rack (12.5&#34; or more). It works better on solid shelves rather than wire shelves. I would definitely recommend it.
