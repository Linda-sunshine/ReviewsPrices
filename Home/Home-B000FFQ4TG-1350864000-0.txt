review/summary: QUICK BREW COFFEEreview/text: THIS IS MY SECOND BREWER. IT TOOK ME NEARLY 5 YEARS TO GO THROUGH MY FIRST ONE. I MAKE ABOUT 4 TO 5 BREWS OF 6 TO 8 CUPS EVERY DAY. THE BREWER IS GREAT. IT IS SO FAST. IF FREINDS COME OVER I HAVE A FRESH FULL POT OF COFFE IN ABOUT 3 MINUTES. MY FRIENDS ARE AMAZED. ALTHOUGH YOU CAN'T "STEAL" A CUP WHILE IT IS BREWING, AFTER ABOUT ONE MINUTE YOU CAN PUT A CUP WHERE THE POT GOES AND POUR FROM THE POT. WHEN WE GO OUT OF TOWN WE CAN TURN OFF THE HEATED RESEVOIR TO SAVE ENERGY. THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR THOSE OF US THAT DRINK A LOT OF COFFEE AND WANT IT NOW. IF YOU ARE A CASUAL COFFEE DRINKER IT MAY BE MORE OF A COFFEE MAKER THAN YOU NEED.
