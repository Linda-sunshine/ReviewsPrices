review/summary: Small and Powerful. Light and easy to stow away.review/text: This is the 2nd Might Mite I have purchased. The first was about 30 years ago and it still works! But the old one seemed kinda tired so now I just use it for the car. This new one is great. No frills, lots of suction. And a great value! It is a little louder than the last floor vacuum I had (A sears vacuum). But I like it and it is more maneuverable than the last Sears cannister model I had.I looked at more expensive models at vacuum stores, but this was such a good deal and works great.
