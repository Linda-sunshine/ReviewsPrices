review/summary: Cuisinart does it againreview/text: It's powerful, stylish, easy to use and quick to clean. A very quick and dirty way to blend without getting into a major mess with major appliances and the price is reasonable. The quality seems to be mid to good and it's a name brand product which hopefully counts for something.
