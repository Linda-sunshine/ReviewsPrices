review/summary: Not worth the price!review/text: We have owned this coffee maker for just over 1 year now and use it every day. The entire idea of the maker grinding the beans and depositing them into the filter with the push of a button seems good. But the grinder sometimes clogs up, you have to place beans in it every day and clean it constantly and it became such a hassle, we just stopped using the internal grinder and went back to our separate coffee grinder. The gold filter cone is OK but does leave a lot more residue (fine grinds) in the bottom of the pot and thence your cup.It also started leaking about 4 months ago. I noticed a puddle of water underneath the unit and thought at first perhaps someone had missed the fill area with the water. But then I personally made a pot and was very careful to pour the water in the proper spot and not overfill or drip, and low and behold, another large puddle of water under the pot. This happens regularly. I completely cleaned the unit and checked everything over, but cannot figure out why it leaks.Just really disappointed with this unit after all the reviews I had read prior to purchasing. Does not live up to its purchase price and frankly my coffee press makes better coffee.
