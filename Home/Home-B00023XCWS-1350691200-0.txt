review/summary: Awesome Electric Kettle!review/text: I have used this kettle nearly twice a day for the past two weeks and it has performed extremely well. The water at my current residence has a funny taste, albeit it is only subtle, I find that supplementing the water with a rather strong black tea or aromatic green tea negates the taste and one is left with delicious tea. The water boils very quickly, and is also useful in making Raman noodles. I have not noticed any plasticy smell or taste with the water, which I guess for a small number of people was an issue. One thing that I wish was added to the kettle was a better notification system to let one know that the water was completely finished boiling. The auto shutoff feature is very handy and you can sometimes hear the little click the switch makes going back to the off position, albeit I wish there was a more commanding sound that would indicate the water is boiling hot. However, these are minor, and I am greatly pleased with the kettle in the grand scheme of things.If one is in the market for an electric kettle that works very well and shows great build quality, then one needs to look no further because this is the one to get.
