review/summary: Garbagereview/text: I bought one of these hoping for the $100 price it would do better than my $25 juicer. Gave me the same exact results with twice the mess. What is worse, on thick items like oranges or lemons, or even carrots, the motor jitters, and eventually wastes and spits big chunk of fruit.If you are buying one of these because of the documented, do yourself a favor and get a lower price, higher quality juicer.BTW. Does not juice wheatgrass or ginger.
