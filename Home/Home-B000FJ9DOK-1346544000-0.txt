review/summary: good thermosreview/text: Good insulation, right size of the bottle, good grip. Perfect drink bottle! I make fresh juices at home and need a bottle that would keep them fresh for a while. This thermos seems to do a good job at keeping my juices fresh. The taste of the juice doesn't change even after 6 hours of keeping it in the thermos.
