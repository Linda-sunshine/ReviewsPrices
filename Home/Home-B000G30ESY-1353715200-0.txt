review/summary: Heavenly Rice Cooked to Perfection!review/text: Yes, the Zojirushi is an expensive rice cooker. It's worth it. This 3-cup cooker is more appropriate for smaller families and it is extremely well made. The Japanese are serious about their rice and high quality rice cookers like this one are as a common as a toaster in their households.I love cooking Jasmine rice on the "Sushi" setting with this cooker. Two measured cups from the included measuring device plus water takes about 40 minutes until done and then the warmer kicks in and keeps the rice at its peak flavor. You'll find yourself eating "Asian style" with rice as a core food component for many of your meals once you have this beautiful and well made appliance in your kitchen.
