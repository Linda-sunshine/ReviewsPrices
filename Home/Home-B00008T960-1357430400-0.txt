review/summary: Especially good for baking cookiesreview/text: My oven bakes hot but I haven't burned a thing since using the silpat. Things get brown but never black. Absolutely nothing sticks and clean up is easy. I've had a silpat for 5 years. Makes a great gift for the people in your life who like to bake
