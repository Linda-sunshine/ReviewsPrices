review/summary: So good!review/text: This is an awesome product. Was skeptical of how well people rated it, but I see why everyone is so happy with this. It is so quiet, I can use it while my baby is napping. The blades are super sharp and both the hard and soft veggies and fruit are sliced and chopped consistently. I have not yet used the dough blade though. It will not work to grind grains(like cornmeal) finer--I tried it--but then, it never said it would, so I don't hold that against it. All slicing us done within 2 seconds. Chopping takes a few seconds and pureeing can take a 45 seconds to a minute depending on how fine you want your pur&eacute;e. The DVD is really a cooking demonstration that shows how to use it easily for different types of meals. Honestly, a great product!
