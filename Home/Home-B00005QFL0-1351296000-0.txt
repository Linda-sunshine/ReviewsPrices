review/summary: Panasonic Bread Makerreview/text: Very easy to use! I make bread almost every day and every loaf turns out perfectly. My next door neighbor has put on about 10lbs since she started eating my bread!! These comments are from Nancy my wife.......I'm not allowed anywhere near the thing.
