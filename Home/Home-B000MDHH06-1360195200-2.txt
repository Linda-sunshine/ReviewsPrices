review/summary: Dry Pulp = happy customerreview/text: I recently became interested in juicing after having many delicious juices on a family vacation to Europe. I was surprised by the vast price range of juicers. I was inclined to go with a sturdy $29 juicer but the reviews were all over the place and I wasn't in the mood to have to return a product bought offline. The Breville had great reviews and I read over and over again that the pulp was dry, a big plus.It was super easy to assemble and clean. We juiced oranges, ginger and apples the first night. No spillage. No Leaking. And dry pulp! Couldn't be happier. All the parts are machine washable and easy to clean in the sink as well. We use it nightly and it's ... to not sound corny, but heck, I'll say it, it's part of the family :)
