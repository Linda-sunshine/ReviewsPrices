review/summary: Okay, but ....review/text: While I love the humidifier and it is a "whole house" (I have a 1700 sq ft ranch), it is really ackward to fill. First off, the cap is really wide and I have a small hand. I had to go out and buy a rubber square "gizzy" to aid in unscrewing the cap. Additionally, when you turn the plastic container upside down to refill, because of the handle it does not sit level on the ground, floor, tub or whatever you use. You have to prop it with the cap so it sits level. It definitely needs some improvement. Would I recommend? Yes, with hesitations .....
