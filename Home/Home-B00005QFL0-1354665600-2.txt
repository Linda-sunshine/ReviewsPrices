review/summary: Weak Motor?review/text: It seems to me that the motor is very weak. I've baked several loaves now and every time the motor labors quite a bit until the paddle stops moving and all that is heard is the whine of the motor. The first time I just assumed that I had not put in enough water, so I added more. But since then I've measured very carefully - even switching to measuring the flour by weight instead of trusting the measuring cup. Same result. So I'm confident that my measurements are accurate and it's unlikely that the supplied recipes are all wrong (14.75 oz whole wheat flour to 1.25 cups water).By the way, the machine arrived dented, but I let it pass. However if the motor is weak then I feel really disappointed with this purchase. From my experience with motors, a motor that is held back and not allowed to rotate will have a very short life.
