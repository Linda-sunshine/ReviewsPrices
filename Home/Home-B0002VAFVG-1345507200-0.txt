review/summary: Breville Juicer-Excellentreview/text: I have had another brand juicer for several years, but the blade was getting worn and it is no longer available. I looked at various mid-priced juicers and settled on the Breville. It is excellent! I used to cut up ingredients for each glass separately, but the Breville comes with a pitcher and the feed tube is wide enough to put whole tomatoes, carrots, etc, so I just wash and juice! It is so easy - and so is clean-up! I love it!
