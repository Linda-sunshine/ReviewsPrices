review/summary: Overall Great Productreview/text: This filter works very well. We live in town and the water tastes terrible so we bought this filter and it takes all of the chlorine taste out of the water. It filters very well. One time it seemed to stop filtering but started working again in a couple hours and has worked perfectly since. I would purchase it again.
