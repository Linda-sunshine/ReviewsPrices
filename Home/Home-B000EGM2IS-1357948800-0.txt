review/summary: Mediocre compared to past Hot Shotsreview/text: I had one of these several years ago after falling in love with my Aunt's. The previous Hot Shot was sturdy and there was plenty of room to slide a coffee mug under the flow. I knew from reading reviews that the quality of this one was not what past Hot Shots have been, but this is ridiculous. It feels like it's going to fall apart if you put too much force on the button, and some of my regular sized coffee mugs won't fit under the spout. That's crazy! I'll hang on to it because it will do for now, but I will definitely reconsider buying Sunbeam again. Is every product (not exclusive to Sunbeam) turning into junk? Every company sacrificing quality for quantity? SMH
