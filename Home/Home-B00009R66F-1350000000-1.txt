review/summary: Hoover Steam Vac F5914-900review/text: I am so pleased with my Hoover steam vac. I was originally planning on buying a Bissell and while I was reading the comments from other owners I came across someone that used to own a Hoover. So I decided to look into the Hoover steam vac and found someone that really liked the F5914-900 model. This lead me to that model and all the commets about it. Most of them owned dogs and this is why I was looking for a steam vac. Ordered & received and used this Hoover steam vac and I am so pleased with it. Had read someones advice when setting it up to make sure your machine did not leak to squeeze the trigger and push the Clean-Surge button to lock a rod into place. My husband did that and I have not had any problems with my machine leaking. I've use it 3 times and can not tell you how well it has performed. I used to pay to have my carpets clean and now I wished I would have bought a Hoover long time ago. I could have saved us a lot of money. It is a little on the heavy side thus the reason I've used it 3 times. I would only do a part of my carpet at a time. It is so easy to use and I really like the 2 seperate tanks. One for clean water and one for the dirty water. On the Bissell it had one unit for both the clean and dirty water. In my opinion you can not go wrong with this model of the Hoover steam vac.
