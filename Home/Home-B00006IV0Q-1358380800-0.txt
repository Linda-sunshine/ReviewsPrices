review/summary: I love it!review/text: This met all my expectations. Perks fast, keeps the coffee hot and looks good all at the same time. (I keep it out on my counter all day.)There are lines inside the pot itself to mark the number of cups you wish to make.One thing-it comes with a few 'starter' filters; you will need to order some (Amazon has them!) and I think I paid less than 3.00 for 100 of them. Since not too many people percolate their coffee anymore, you might not find them in the store.Overall, I love it! Percolated coffee just tastes So much better!
