review/summary: The box says BPA Free!review/text: So far this processor is an absolute powerhouse. The base is pretty much a plastic box with a switch on the front, but there's really no wasted space inside because its filled with 10Lbs of motor... The interesting thing about this massive motor is that its actually very quiet. i can use it in the kitchen without waking anyone in the house.After a bit of confusing online investigation to find out whether or not this processor is BPA free or not, i consulted the box. It says on the bottom of the box *All surfaces that contact food or liquid are BPA Free."
