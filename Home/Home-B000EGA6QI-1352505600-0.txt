review/summary: Best Product Ever!!review/text: I love this Immersion Blender! I bought it to use for my modernist cooking (molecular gastronomy), and it has never let me down. Then, I decided to make a smoothie one day, and it also works for that. I use it for all sorts of things now. All my friends think that it is such a neat tool, and love when I take it out to make things. It is very convenient to store since it comes apart into two halves. It is also very simple to clean. I love it and you should buy one too. Besides, how could you say no to the awesome green color. It looks great. I recommend getting a colored one.
