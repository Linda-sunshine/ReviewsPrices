review/summary: Some tweeking to get great icecreamreview/text: I made sweet cream ice cream (cream, milk, and sugar) with this machine, but it took a little work to get it right. I recommend partially freezing the ingredients before starting and also covering up the top spout to minimize cold loss. The ice cream didn't have large ice crystals, but it wasn't the creamiest ice cream. It is still delicious and you can customize your ice cream. Don't expect to be able to eat it in 30 minutes though. After it comes out of the machine, it is soupy and must be frozen first.
