review/summary: Wonderful productreview/text: It has been 10 years since I bought this product and continue to use it. Over the years I have used it for making dough, slicing, making puree, grinding semi-liquid stuff and what not. It has held up well. No cracks. Cleaning is a bit messy specially after making dough, but if you clean it immediately, its much easier than letting the dough dry, but overall I'm very happy.
