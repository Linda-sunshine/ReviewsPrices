review/summary: Permanent Filter - hmmmmreview/text: The product I received is NOT what is pictured. there is no handle and it is very messy to remove this basket from the coffee maker. Also, a lot of silt passes through and you get a mud puddle in the bottom of your mug. I have to use a paper filter as well just to keep my coffee drinkable.
