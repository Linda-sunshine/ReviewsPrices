review/summary: Use it daily, works perfectlyreview/text: Shipment arrived fast, perfectly packaged. Been using it daily since and couldn't be happier. We use it to make tea mostly, but it is great for getting water ready for pasta or other cooking. Instead of waiting for the pan to boil water, we just boil it in this first and add it to the pot. saves a lot of time.Also good for hot chocolate and such.The power cord is short, but you just pull it out of the kettle when done and transport the kettle wherever you want.I would recommend this to anyone looking at it. The only reason I would not recommend is if you wanted a larger capacity kettle... then just buy the bigger one lol.
