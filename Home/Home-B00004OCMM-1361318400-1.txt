review/summary: At lastreview/text: At last a can opener you can rely on. We've been using the Oxo for more than 6 months. I kid you not ... every time I use it I smile. It is just that good. We don't like electric openers. We had purchased two different hand held prior to the Oxo only to have them rapidly become a useless pile of crap. But not the Oxo! It feels good in your hand ... has heft. It performs it's task flawlessly every time. What more can you ask?sincerely Hugo in Cedar Rapids
