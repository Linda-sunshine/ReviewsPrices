review/summary: Perfectreview/text: This is an amazing product. It is super quiet- ie I can actually prepare meals and dishes while my baby is sleeping. It chops, slices, and just works great. It takes a little getting used to, but I would recommend this to anyone. My previous Food Processor would leave HUGE chunks of food mixed in with my shredded/chopped foods, and it was so frustrating that I finally got this as a gift from my husband. Well worth the money.
