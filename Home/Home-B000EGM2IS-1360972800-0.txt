review/summary: Dispense Lever failedreview/text: Unlike other low-star reviews, mine worked for awhile before breaking. In my case, the plastic "dispense" lever failed when it got fatigued through use. I too had one of the previous versions that worked forever. The new ones are more cheaply made and seem to fail at a higher rate. I'll buy from a seller who will easily accept a return, and I'll keep my receipt. I'm hoping someone builds a competing product that will remind Sunbeam to include some quality in the mix.
