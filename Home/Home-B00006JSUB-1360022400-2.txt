review/summary: Great cookware.review/text: I bought this as a replacement for a Griswold that had belonged to our family for generations and inadvertently tossed out. I knew I wanted a cast iron skillet made in the U.S.A. since it is my opinion (many other people feel the same) that ones made elsewhere are truly interior in quality. Why, I have no idea but you just know when you pick one up and feel the weight, the quality, etc. When I received the Lodge skillet I was quite happy....grateful, too, that it was pre-seasoned. It is everything I expected....a quality piece of 'art'. I know it will last forever.
