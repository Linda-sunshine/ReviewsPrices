review/summary: Don't buy thisreview/text: I failed to read any reviews of this product. It was reasonably priced and had a year warranty. I thought &#34;How can I go wrong?&#34; I used it to check temperature of the water I add to the home brew beer I make to get it to the proper temperature for the yeast. On my second use the probe read 162 degrees when sitting just in air. I tried it a week later. It worked for about 10 minutes then the temperature was replaced by &#34;Lo&#34;. The instructions told me that &#34;Hi&#34; or &#34;Lo&#34; indicate the probe was damaged. It also told me that the probe was not included under the warranty. So now I have a nice egg timer but nothing else. Do yourself a favor....BUY SOMETHING ELSE!
