review/summary: So disappointed.review/text: I read reviews everywhere about this machine before I decided to go ahead and throw away money on it. This thing is absolute trash! Out of the box instant tragedy, as I received a metallic splinter. Ouch! The machine vibrates so violently that the cup/cups have to be held in place so they don't fall off the tray. I performed a side by side comparison with my much older, on its way out Krupps machine and now I have a new found love and respect for a machine I was just looking to replace after7-8 years. Wish I could get my money back.
