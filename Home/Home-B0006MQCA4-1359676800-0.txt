review/summary: Bought this for workreview/text: Rather than investing in a water cooler and dealing with water deliveries, we bought this for use at our office of about 8 people. It holds quite a bit (we fill it every morning), does not take up a lot of room in the fridge, and the filtering system works beautifully. The dispenser is much easier for everyone wanting to fill their water bottles up. Nice item
