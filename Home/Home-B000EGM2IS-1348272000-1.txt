review/summary: Positives & Negativesreview/text: I used the old style "original" Hot Shot for many years and loved it. The new style is nicer looking "but" slower to heat & not tall enough to fit some of my typical mugs under, plus it dispenses way too slow. Needs improvement, but still better than pulling out a pot or tea kettle.
