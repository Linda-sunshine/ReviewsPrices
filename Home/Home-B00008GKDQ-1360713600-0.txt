review/summary: Best Kitchen Purchase in Years!review/text: I purchased this a week ago and after a minor tweek, I love it. It comes &#34;preseasoned&#34;, but I found that food still stuck to it. So I applied a thin layer of grapeseed oil on both sides then placed in a 400 degree oven for 1 hr then let it cool in the oven until it was cool enough to handle. After 3 such passes, it looked just like grandma's old cast iron skillet! I've cooked eggs, bacon, steak, and pancakes. Best purchase in years!
