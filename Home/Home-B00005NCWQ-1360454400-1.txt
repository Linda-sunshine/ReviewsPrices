review/summary: Better than Starbucks coffe?review/text: I bought this coffee maker since I wanted to go back to a percolator type coffee maker. I remember when I was a kid my parents would make coffee before work and me going to school. They used an electric one though then switched to a drip coffee maker. I am a picky coffee drinker, so with that in mind, I usually stop by my local Starbucks and get my Venti Pikes Place. This is the type of coffee I like and I drink mine black with no sweetener. I have made coffee using many different brands and the best brand so far has been Yuban coffee which you can get at your local supermarket. My wife has tried my coffee with this coffee pot and says "It's better than Starbucks". Some things should not be changed for the sake of change and this coffee making technology is still the best way to make coffee. The wheel still works great as well until someone puts corners on it to make it "better". There is a spring that you can lose very easily. I just made coffee without it so it doesn't seem to be a big deal. Other than that, if you want a coffee maker to work great and last forever, then this is the one to buy. Enjoy your quite time and a great cup of coffee!
