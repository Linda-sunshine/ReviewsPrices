review/summary: Great product at a very low pricereview/text: I bought this product after reading a lot of reviews for different brands and bread makers and I think I made no mistake. The only problem with this machine is that you will love to make your own bread and eat a lot.My advice is to buy a recipes book because the included ones are not so good. I recommend The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook by Beth Hensperger.
