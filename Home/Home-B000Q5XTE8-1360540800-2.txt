review/summary: Need a chair?review/text: It's so hard to find a good chair.I needed a new one, desperately. I went to nearby furniture stores, and nearly all of them were leather-ish fabric that just made me feel like I was going to slip off of it, and made my back feel all slimy.It wasn't long before I decided on a mesh-back chair. And I had heard people recommend Aeron chairs.After looking around and reading reviews on Amazon, I decided the Lorell chair was the best bet, since I can't afford some crazy $600 chair.Chair arrived in parts in a big box, with instructions. Got it put together relatively quickly. And I've been using it for about a month now.No complaints from me.It's very adjustable to match however I'm sitting at the time. I don't usually like arm rests, so it's awesome that I can either keep them at a low level, or completely remove them from the chair easily.Very comfortable, great back support.Only thing is that it seems the back will get loose, and wiggle around a bit. It's easy enough though to tighten it, so I'm not really complaining. Just need to tighten it every 2 weeks, I guess.
