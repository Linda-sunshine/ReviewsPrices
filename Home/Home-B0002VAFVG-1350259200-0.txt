review/summary: Great Juicer, Easy clean-up!review/text: I Love this Juicer. Many will tell you that you need another style to juice leafy greens but if you sandwich them between hard vegetables, this is accomplished. Have your items ready to go so that when you load it you can immediately cover with feed-tube so that nothing is wasted by spinning in between. I also place a plastic bag in the waste tub for easy clean-up. The machine is well built and simple to use. I keep it on the counter for daily use.
