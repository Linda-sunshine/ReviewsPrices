review/summary: Brewing on ...review/text: We had an older model for years of enjoyment as we drink coffee frequently throughout the day. Operation is similar to the previous model so there was no learning curve. Only difference is that the older model had a water level indicator we could see from the outside but this doesn't -- need to look in from the top to see where the water is. We did that once and then started using a measuring cup to fill with the right amount of water and then dump into the cofee maker versus stretching our necks over the top. Otherwise -- great product for the price.
