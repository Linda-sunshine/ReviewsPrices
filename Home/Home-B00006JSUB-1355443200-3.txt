review/summary: Cast Iron pans are the best, Lodge is a great choicereview/text: We use this particular pan on a daily basis and have done so for years. As we eat real breakfasts (not sugary processed crap like cereal or pastries) most of the time, this pan is essentially a breakfast pan. We keep the bacon grease from cooking bacon in it for a week or so at a time, which obviously keeps it well-seasoned and lets us cook fried eggs in it easy as pie. If you eat real food for breakfast I would definitely recommend having a Lodge cast iron pan dedicated to just this task. If you don't have a lid then tuck this pan into the oven when not in use, to keep anything from getting into the bacon grease.I'm sure I'll just echo everyone else when I see Lodge cast iron is excellent quality and the price is outstanding for what you're getting (a pan that will last forever, instead of a non-stick pan that is bad for your health and will only last a couple of years). This pan is HEAVY so be prepared for that.
