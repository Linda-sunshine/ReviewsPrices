review/summary: Bought 2review/text: I bought 2 for the truck camper because the husband doesn't want holes drilled; works great. We only needed 1 so the other 1 got mounted in the eatting area as a catch all for the wallet, keys, maps, etc. Might end up buying another one due to limited space, mount quick, hold great.
