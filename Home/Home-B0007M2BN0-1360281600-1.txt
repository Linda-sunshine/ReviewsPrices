review/summary: Great Time Saverreview/text: Handy gadget for boiled eggs from the microwave. It took four cooking trials to get the right amount of time needed to boil the eggs for our microwave, but it was definitely worth the small effort. Now we can have our eggs anytime without the added trouble and expense of using the electric stove in only eleven minutes.
