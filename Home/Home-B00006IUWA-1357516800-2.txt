review/summary: Wish it had an on/off switchreview/text: We already have one hot-air popper that we've had for long time and it makes great popcorn. We bought this one to have as an extra (and to make as the primary if there has been any improvement in hot air popping somehow). This machine makes popcorn just as well as the old one. Nothing has changed.This machine lacks the metal butter melting tray that the old one had but we just melt butter in the microwave now anyway (there's a huge and messy learning curve right there!) so the lack of tray is okay.It is noisy and fast and pops almost all of the kernels so that's pretty much the same as the old one.If this will be your first hot air popper, BUY IT! If you've been eating microwave popcorn (yecch! do you know what's in that?) or popping in oil, you may no idea how much better hot air popcorn tastes. Hot air is all upsides and no downsides (unless the noise bothers you). And this particular popper does a great job. Just be sure to follow the directions, especially about turning the machine on before dumping the popcorn in.The only downside to this machine is it has no on/off switch. How much would that have added to the cost, really? The old machine had a switch. This machine draws full load as you plug it into the wall. I don't know why it doesn't arc the plug more but it seems like it's just a matter of time before the plug or the socket gets crispied. If I buy another hot air popper in the future, I will pay more attention to getting one with a switch.
