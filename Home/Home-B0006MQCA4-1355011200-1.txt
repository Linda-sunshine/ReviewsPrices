review/summary: Easy to clean and fillreview/text: Pros:- Easy to clean with a sponge- Easy to insert filter- Easy to remove cover (as there is nothing clamping it down) and fill the water in the top compartment.Nice to Have:- If you're more accident prone, this product may benefit to have some kind of clamping mechanism to keep the top more secure when transporting it around (i.e. from fridge to sink for refill). Otherwise, this product works well and I haven't had any problems with it.
