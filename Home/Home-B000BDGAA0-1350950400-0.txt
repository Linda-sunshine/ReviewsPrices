review/summary: Husband likes it.review/text: My husband apprehensively purchased this pillow to replace his old one that was giving him morning headaches daily. He never bought a micro-bead pillow before so wasn't really sure about it. However, the price was right and he decided to give it a go. So far, after about a month, he really likes it. It hasn't ripped open like some other reviewers have stated about theirs.I'm actually thinking of getting one for myself now. I haven't slept a whole night on it, but I have laid on it and it was a lot more supportive than I imagined.If anything should changed within a year, then I will update my review.
