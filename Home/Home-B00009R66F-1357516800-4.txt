review/summary: Works the way it should.review/text: Shipped slowly, but it was packaged in a way that kept it from getting damaged in shipping.The cleaner works well for it's price. I thought it would not work well because it really isn't heavy like the commercial grade cleaners are. The rotating brushes do a good job.I have not used the hand tools or hose yet.... hoping they work as well.Rinsing of the dirty bucket was very easy. I didn't clean the base unit or the solution bucket after the job.... they didn't look like they needed any attention.A 12x12 room took 3 solution buckets for me.I will bargain hunt for cleaning solution bottles..... no need to buy the first one that appears on the screen. Any brand will work.
