review/summary: The Hamilton is merciless!!review/text: I love this machine!! It makes juice mercilessly!!!The body is solid and the design is good. The first day, I made juice with all the fruits and veggies I had at home and I loved the way it effortlessly made juice. I don't put any whole fruits, I cut them up in quarters instead, just don't want to mess up the machine. I am sure it can handle it with ease.I think it's a nice product for it's money.
