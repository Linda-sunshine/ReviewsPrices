review/summary: Golden crusted foods await youreview/text: Steaks, bone-in chicken breasts, peppers- there are so many foods I love preparing in a cast iron skillet. Its heat retention allows you to create a golden crust on chicken like you've only dreamed of until now. How do they get those black grill marks on vegetables without using a grill? Cast iron. A 12&#34; pan is large enough to cook two chicken breasts at once, or two small steaks. The pan is very heavy and does require special cleaning (brush out residue, wipe clean and apply oil) . I have used this for over a year and the original seasoning is still in good shape.
