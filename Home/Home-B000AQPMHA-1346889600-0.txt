review/summary: this is our third unitreview/text: The first one, which was a B60 series, gave up the ghost after about one year. We bought a replacement for that and it is still working great. The B40 is for our motorhome. It also works fine, and we don't miss the extra features offered by the B60. We never use the timer, or temperature settings anyway.
