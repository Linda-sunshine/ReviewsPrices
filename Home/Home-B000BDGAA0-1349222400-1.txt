review/summary: HARD!!!review/text: I got this for my husband. This pillow is hard as a rock! I do believe when you put a pillow case on, it makes it so the beads can't move, my husband could not sleep on this pillow. So I took it, thinking I will take the pillow case off and use the pillow between my legs, it was still too hard! If you like rock hard pillows this is for you, if not, this is not for you. Even without the pillow case, this pillow is hard!!!
