review/summary: Delicious coffee and fun to makereview/text: This little coffee pot is soooo cute, and it makes good strong coffee, the way I like it. I got it for Christmas, and the design makes me feel like it was made by Santa's elves. At first I thought it might be a hassle to use, because I was accustomed to a single-serve pod coffee-maker, but it is actually fun to make coffee this way, and the ritual of filling it with water and coffee, putting it together, and waiting for it to percolate has added to the enjoyment of the coffee.
