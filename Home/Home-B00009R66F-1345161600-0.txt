review/summary: was good in the first 6 months,broke down after 1.5 yearreview/text: I really loved this product when I first got it. It picked up tons of dirt from the carpet . We have 2 cats so we use it quit often. Today I used it again, it got smoky and died. I called hoover, passed warranty date. will give me 20% off for a new one.. disappointed!
