review/summary: My favorite sheetsreview/text: Ordered queen size for a full size bed with pillow top. We use sheet straps to snug up the fit a little and it works perfectly. These are the softest, most comfortable sheets we have ever owned. Not too hot for cool Denver winter nights. Probably too hot for muggy Minnesota summers, though. Love these. Would buy them again.
