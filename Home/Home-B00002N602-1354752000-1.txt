review/summary: VERY NICE PRESSURE COOKERreview/text: I had to replace an ancient pressure cooker that was passed down to me many years ago. This one is much smaller but, since I don't do any canning and only cook for three people, it is the perfect size for me. With all the warnings now about the dangers of too much aluminum in our diets, I love that it is stainless steel. It will make the toughest cut of meat so tender that it falls apart.
