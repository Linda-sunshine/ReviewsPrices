review/summary: Stopped working after one yearreview/text: I bought this humidifier an year ago from amazon. On the 13th month it stopped working, I bought it because of its attractive penguin shape. The product has good build quality outwardly, but made of poor electronic components. This is my second humidifier from Crane. The first one was 'sponge bob square pant', which worked for about two years, then stopped working. It looks like the crane products are not durable. The one star is for its appearance.
