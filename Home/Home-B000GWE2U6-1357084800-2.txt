review/summary: Cute idea but...review/text: Our kids love Spongebob, so we thought this would be a great humidifier to have when they are not feeling well. It was great for about 6 months...then it stopped working. For $40+, that is not something I want to replace every 6 months. Back to the boring humidifiers! These are apparently just for looks. We should have known better than to buy based on the cuteness factor.I agree with others comments - I wish people would come back to update their original comments after the long haul. Don't waste your money on these!
