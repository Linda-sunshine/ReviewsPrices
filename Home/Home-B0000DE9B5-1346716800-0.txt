review/summary: Super Pitcher!!review/text: I read some reviews of other pitchers and this one had the fewest complaints of the typical drips from the pour spout. This one is the best and it doesn't drip. We use it to keep coffee in the fridge and after a few months, the seal and top haven't stained and it doesn't leak. I ordered another larger one and expect it any day!
