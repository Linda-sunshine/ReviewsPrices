review/summary: Just buy it.....review/text: Yes...just but it....you can't go wrong with this Griddle. I got mine on 01.31.2013 and I immediately made some paratha on it. It's easy to clean and moreover it's get hot very quickly including the handle so be very careful.For under $15 bucks with free shipping and made in USA, man I don't know what you're waiting for. Trust me, it's worth every penny to own this Griddle.Thank you
