review/summary: The static is unbelievablereview/text: Yeah, it grinds coffee, but you have to clean your entire countertop after using it. I have never, ever in my life seen so much static come from a coffee grinder with grinds going everywhere. It's impossible to remove the cup from the grinder without all of the grinds ending up on the grinder itself, the coffee machine and the countertop. It's too much of a hassle to deal with every day...I need to find another grinder.
