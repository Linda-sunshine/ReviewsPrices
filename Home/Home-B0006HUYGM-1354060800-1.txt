review/summary: Too heavyreview/text: I was hoping this would take the place of my regular large upright because I don't have too much carpet to clean. However, I returned it after a few days because it was just way too heavy to use as a handheld when cleaning a large rug. It was also ungainly and didn't feel balanced in my hand. It had nice suction though, but the negatives outweighed that positive.
