review/summary: I bought this for our house, butreview/text: My wife decided these would make great Christmas gifts for her two sisters and our two daughters, so now I have to order more for our house. I like the various sizes in this set and I like the stacking feature they offer. I prefer the glass containers to the plastic ones for convenience in transferring from the fridge to the microwave.
