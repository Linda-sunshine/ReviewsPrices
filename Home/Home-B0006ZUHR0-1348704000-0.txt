review/summary: Feature loaded, well made iron.review/text: First, I should say that I help my wife with the ironing; I do mine, she does hers.We have several Black & Decker products (toaster oven, 12-cup and single cup coffee makers), and we have been impressed with the quality of B&D; appliances. When our last iron went South, I decided to purchase the D2030 model based on reviews of the D2020, and we haven't been disappointed.The controls are easy to use, easy to read, total simplicity. Of its many features, our favorite is that it uses tap water; no more buying distilled water.This is an iron I highly recommend, more than worth the price.
