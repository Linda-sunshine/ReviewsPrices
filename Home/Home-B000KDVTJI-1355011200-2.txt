review/summary: COULD BE A LIFE SAVERreview/text: This kettle could be a life saver.An elderly parent was having trouble remembering to turn off her stove when boiling water.Old habits at age 90 are hard to break and burning pots and blaring smoke alarms had red danger flags waving.This little kettle solved the problem. It works as advertised. it's safe, very simple to use and mama loves it.That's all that matters.
