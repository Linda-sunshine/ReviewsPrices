review/summary: Great coffee makerreview/text: I was first introduced to this style coffee maker by an ex-girlfriend. After the first cup I knew that I had been having coffee all wrong before.So, as soon as the money situation was right I bought it! Make sure you run at least 3 tanks of water through this machine before you attempt to enjoy a cup of coffee, if you do not you will be tasting plastic and that is no fun.. Ask me how I know.. Go on, ask me.Anyhoo, takes about 3-4 minutes to get ready to brew and less than a minute to get your cup brewed. I know it takes 3-4 minutes because this Gangster ass coffee maker has a digital clock on it! Talk about multitasking! You are standing around waiting for coffee (I have that kind of free time..) and some person who doesn't have a watch or a phone asks you what time it is, you don't even need to search for the time! The time is saying "Look at me! I am right here telling you already!" It has buttons you can press (the girlfriend hates when I push buttons because I always change her settings...maybe that is why she broke up with me.. hmm) Needless to say, after buying my own, I have no need for button pressing. But I do kind of feel like an astronaut when I press buttons.. Especially the garage door button. Like being granted a wizards power.. but not really.and to conclude, I really have no idea on what the proper use of punctuation is and I like coffee. Plus my job gives me a computer and internet access and I have an office.. So I get pretty bored. Coffee + boredom + work = a combination that no one should have to endure. We need recess as adults. With Coffee.oh yeah! If you are recently broken up as I am, this coffee maker (because of the high price) encourages you to not give up on life completely. By that I mean you just spent 180.00 on a coffee maker, life can't be all that bad if you can waste 180 bucks on something that makes coffee.At least it wasn't prostitutes..
