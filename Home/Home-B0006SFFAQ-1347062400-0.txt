review/summary: Ray, Willowsreview/text: Coffeemaker was listed/advertised as having a brushed stainless finish. Delivered item is called "brushed metal" which looks like a painted surface finish. Very disappointed, nowhere near the finish/color of our other appliances. But, I'm suffering from coffee with-drawals, so I guess we'll keep it.
