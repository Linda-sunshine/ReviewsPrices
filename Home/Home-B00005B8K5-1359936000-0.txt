review/summary: Pretty good.review/text: This is a good set for the price. They were much smaller than I thought but nice looking, so make sure to look at the dimensions. The one thing that was not perfect was that the lid for the small rectangular pyrex was loose. So I called Amazon.com and they sent me a new box to exchange it. Unfortunately, it was still not fitting perfectly, although it fits better than before. So, what can I say, it is a cheap set and that is what it is. It works well though.
