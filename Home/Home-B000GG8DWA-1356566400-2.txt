review/summary: It works great and it's warmreview/text: It works excellent. Keeps me and my kids warm. It warms up real fast and you have 2 settings: the 400watts setting will light up the top beam and the 800watts will light up both beams inside and keeps you real toasty. My only wish is that it blew warm air. That would've made it more perfect, but at $20 what more can I ask for?
