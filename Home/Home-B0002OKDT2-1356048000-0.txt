review/summary: Good productreview/text: Great juicer, but the tiny chute found on most if not all these masticating juicers is a major downfall for a first time juicer. I should have listened and bought a centriifigul juicer.I'm a college student with two jobs, have slowly changed my life habits to consume more raw or fresh food. It took me about half an hour to set up my juicer and get my veggies clean and trimmed to be juiced. The pulp was still fairly moist, but it did a good job with all but the softest of veggies/fruit. The container was quite small for the amount of juice I made. I ended up making a mess by letting juice drip out during container changes and had vegetable trimmings everywhere because you have to cut size.I returned the juicer to get a new centrifigul juicer one day. Hopefully with a bigger chute, faster operating time and a large container so I dont have to replace often and make a mess.
