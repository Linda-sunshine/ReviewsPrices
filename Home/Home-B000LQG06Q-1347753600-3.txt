review/summary: Bait and Switch- Not same Mattress Padreview/text: I bought 2 of these "identical" pads.One was a Queen and one a Cali King.1st -- Both arrived in utterly beaten up boxes (both wide open upon delivery -- not very comforting when you're planning on sleeping on the contents...)2nd -- They were COMPLETELY different mattresses.The Queen was real memory foam (with a tear from shipping.The Cali King was a piece of cheap foam. NO memory quality whatsoever.Night and day difference between the exact "same" product in different sizes.Amazon-- busted.Refunds will hopefully be processed fast.
