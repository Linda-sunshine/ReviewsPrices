review/summary: It was usedreview/text: I ordered this from the super saver deal from amazon. It arrived in a box that was unsealed and obviously had been opened before it got to me. When I removed it the plastic bag had obviously been opened and replaced. the cord was just wrapped around the center and the silver had scratches and fingerprints on it. It looked used. Or it was a return item from someone else.Now I am trying to return it to Amazon and printed out the forms and put it back in the box. Except UPS has not shown up to pick it up. So it sits in a box in my hallway waiting for a refund. I am disappointed to say the least.
