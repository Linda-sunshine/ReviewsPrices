review/summary: We loved it so much we bought a secondreview/text: We got this garbage can as a gift for our nursery. We cloth diaper and this garbage can is perfect for that. The motion detector makes it easy to put the diapers in the trash can without having to touch anything and it keeps the orders from taking over the nursery. We were so happy with it that we bought one for our kitchen trash. It looks great, functions well, and keeps orders locked inside.
