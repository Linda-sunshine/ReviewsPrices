review/summary: I love it!review/text: This thing seems to get mixed reviews, but I love mine. Here's what I'll say to those complaining about it. If you pump it up less than about 20 times, you'll get a stream, not a mist. Pump it up more. Mine hasn't clogged as of yet. All I've had in it is EVOO, and I do release the pressure after using it. That said, it's perfect for frying, waffle irons, grills, salads, whatever. I like knowing what I'm spraying on since I put it in there, and it's not coming out of an aerosol can!
