review/summary: Aluminum Flakes Yes - Makes great coffee Yesreview/text: First of all never ever wash this in the dish washer it causes the bright finish to dissolve. I have an OCD wife who found it on the counter drying and thought it should go through the dish washer. (Big Sigh). So much for being being pretty. Yes, their was aluminum residue in the bottom after the first 10 or 15 uses! Some of the corrosion appeared to come from the flux used to weld the bottom on. I always wipe this out extremely well with a paper towel or 2. Yes, heavy metal in amounts you can see is not good for you! Some of this problem was caused by senior moments and not checking to see if it was done and running the bottom part dry. Not a good thing to do. I did this several times and threw out the coffee.My pot is now well seasoned and has no more aluminum residue in it. See above.So, how to use.Fill little basket thing with 2 spoon fulls of coffee about the size you would eat cereal with - not heaping.Wet white gasket with finger and screw back together.Heat on low heat because it makes much better coffee and it tends to prevent "melt downs" YECK -see above.This might take 10 min as opposed to 3 min fullflame melt down method. :-)It's kinda fun to watch the coffee perk out the top of the tower thing under the lid. The tower thing makes the coffee come out side ways so it does not shoot boiling hot coffee into to your face. Besides if you are using the slow method it just oozes out. Did I mention you have to remove it from heat AS SOON AS it is finished or you will have VERY bad coffee.Makes great coffee AFTER the pot is seasoned.I'm still a little nervous about the aluminum so I only use it once a week.I'm going to rate this a one due to all the aluminum flakes that it had on the bottom for the first 15 brews.
