review/summary: The best juicer I have ever owned.review/text: Okay, maybe I've only owned one other juicer and it was by a guy named Jack L.This juicer is easy to use, very powerful and simple to clean. I really enjoy the variable speed setting that lists the speed by the type of fruit, it's makes it so simple to use to get the most out of the type of fruit you are juicing. It is important to use the correct speed as to not damage the enzymes in the fruit.To clean, I simply dismantle the juicer and rinse off the parts in the sink. It comes with a brush for cleaning the blade/filter. Overall, it takes about 1 minute to clean the entire machine, something which was much more involved with my last juicer. It also juicer much quicker and is constructed very well.I have a feeling I will be using this everyday for a very long time.
