review/summary: Wow! Wow wow wow. Its better than I expected.review/text: Sorry if this sounds like bragging, but I am thoroughly pleased with myself at the moment. I just made a rather fabulous Pumpkin Spice Latte and I'm in heaven. This press is amazing! So stinking simple to use and clean. I didn't expect the grinds to pop out, but you just untwist the filter at the bottom, and then continue to press the grinds over the trash (or compost bucket). My hubby is at our new house installing our InstaHot Water Dispenser and I cannot wait to add further simplicity to this process, which really wasn't that long...maybe 3 minutes which included getting the water near boiling and warming the milk. FYI- I used regular coffee grinds, Torani's Pumpkin Syrup and some whipped cream (real cream in the can) with a dash of cinnamon. I used just one scoop of the grinds and filled the water line to #2. If you wanted a stronger coffee flavor, go for either more grinds or a bit less water.
