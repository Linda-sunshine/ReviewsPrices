review/summary: Made for Tea, but great for any beverage you want to keep hot or cold.review/text: This is a wonderful tumbler and includes an infuser for tea. It really keeps your beverage hot or cold.I left my tea in the car and came back after work and it was still warm after 9 hours.Have given this and other thermos products as gifts.My only complaint is the infuser needs to be finer, loose tea does seep thru.
