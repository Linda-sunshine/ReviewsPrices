review/summary: Major Dissapointmentreview/text: The product is cheap cheap cheap. It's also bulky. I used it once after my purchase sometime in May/June of 2012. I used it again in November, or tried to use it, and it won't suck up the water. It completely soaked my carpet. I watched all the troubleshooting YouTube videos, and did a lot of research on line, but I can't fix it. Unfortunately the warranty expired a month from date of purchase.I'm going back to my reliable spot bot, but it's not a great tool for a large space.
