review/summary: does the jobreview/text: have canned with it 4 or 5 times now and it has worked very well - best time is sipping a beer and watching that pressure dial - &#34;sorry hon, I gotta keep an eye on this guage - you'll have to go to the store yourself.&#34; Everything we've canned tastes way better than store bought and no strange chemicals in our food
