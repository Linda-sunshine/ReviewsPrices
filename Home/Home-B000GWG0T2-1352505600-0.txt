review/summary: Very good skillet!!review/text: This is a very well made skillet. It's very big and deep enough for anything I want to prepare. My previous skillet was a 12" and not as deep and things kept going over the edge to my stove top. Plus, the bottom was uneven and didn't sit flat on my burner. This skillet is flat and stays flat on my burner. This one keeps everything inside while I'm turning. It heats evenly even on my electric stove that's hard to regulate (I'm used to gas). I love it and will be using it almost every day. Highly recommended.
