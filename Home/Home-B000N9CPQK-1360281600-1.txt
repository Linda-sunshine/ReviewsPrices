review/summary: The Trueness if Air..review/text: This has been a heaven sent. My kids suffer with allergies and when they catch a cold well the two generally does not mix. So I was told a purifier (true hepa) would help. And we needed help fast. Was not sure which one to get so had to do some research. Great choice. Permanent filter, cleans very easily and removes a good amount of dust. I have three of these so far. Looking to purchase another one. I also recommended this particular purifier to family and friends. Thanks Amazon.
