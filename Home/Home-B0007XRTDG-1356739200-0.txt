review/summary: Worst electric skillet we ever boughtreview/text: We had high hopes for this skillet, because of the positive reviews we had seen online, as well as previous experience with this brand. What a disappointment!! The non-stick coating wears off in about a year of NORMAL use, not even once a week. Now, even when we also use a non-stick spray first, as well as plenty of oil etc., we still have to scrape off the stuck food, from eggs to veggies. Please learn from our mistake, and DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!! I really don't know what's happened, if it's environmental standards that allow less of the non-stick coating or if the company is cutting corners to save money - but this consumer will never buy a Presto product ever again, and I'm spreading the word of our experience, to friends and family.
