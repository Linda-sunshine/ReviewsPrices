review/summary: Great Coffee Grinder!!!review/text: I've had my current Proctor-Silex grinder for 12 years so far. The lid became cracked when a thief dropped the grinder in his haste, but it still works great! I'm purchasing this grinder tonight, just in case the lid on my current grinder does not last due to it's damage. If you need a finer grind, rock it back and forth a couple times and it will grind finer. You just can't beat the price and I highly recommend this grinder to everyone!
