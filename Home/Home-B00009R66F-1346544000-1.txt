review/summary: HELP! Loose part under dirty water tank!review/text: Upon setting the machine up, we looked underneath the dirty water tank and there was a loose steel flat gasket (about 2" X 1") just sitting under the tank. it was not affixed to the machine in any way (via a screw or anything), it looks like there should have been a screw on one end. does any one know what this piece is for, whether we need to take it out and discard, or screw it down ourselves?
