review/summary: Cuisinart DBM-8 Grinderreview/text: I purchased this grinder in June 2011 for use with a french press. I was satisfied with the grind produced using the coarsest setting, although as other reviewers have noted, the grinder does produce some dust. The unit burned out after 13 months. I may perform an autopsy to see what failed, but am sure it is not fixable as it put out a considerable amount of (nasty) smoke when going through it's death throes.
