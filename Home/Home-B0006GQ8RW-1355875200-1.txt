review/summary: Dirty filters - need better packaging/shippingreview/text: These arrived in an old beat up Brita box, and each filter was completely covered in carbon dust - all black!! I was afraid to use them, but was able to rinse them off enough to give them a try and they do filter fine and the water tastes enough like previous Brita filters.
