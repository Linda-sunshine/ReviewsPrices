review/summary: much better than a water bottlereview/text: I had been using the bottom of a plastic water bottle before getting this. That's probably all I need to say. This was the cheapest tamper on Amazon and for all I can tell, it works just as good as any other one. It has a very firm, heavy, quality feel.
