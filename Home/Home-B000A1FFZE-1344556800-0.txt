review/summary: Just like expectedreview/text: I read a few reviews when I purchased this toaster. I was worried about uneven toasting. So far it actually has been working good (I had the toaster for the past 2 weeks). I am having no issues with uneven toasting. And I actually like the idea that the crumbs fall on a tray in the main oven. Makes it easy to clean.The bottom oven is just a regular oven with no timer. So you just need to pay attention when you put anything in there.This toaster allows you to toast not only toast bread and bagels but other types of bread such as pita pockets.So far, I am satisfied.
