review/summary: A great and convenient mandolinreview/text: This is a great mandolin, I started using it almost as soon as I got it. It only takes up a very small space, about 2-1/2&#34; x 5&#34; on my counter top so it is always there ready to use. It is very quick and easy to change the blades, clean them and store them. I only wish it had been offered with a container to fit the mandolin although putting it over a bowl is easy.
