review/summary: Worked well for me, until my wife broke it :Preview/text: This tie organizer worked well for me. I found that it was spaced evenly enough so that ties didn't rub together. The hook is very sturdy and stayed on much to my avail. Apparently, it can't handle a strong tug, as my wife snapped the hook off in the end. During my ownership, it did what it was supposed to well, and at a great price!
