review/summary: Overall OK, but great for the pricereview/text: The grinder works well, not very noisy and does not take too much space. I think that for the price, this is a great deal. But this price comes with caveats. The French press coarse settings are good in terms of the resulting grain size, but they are not very consistent. Also, there is some dust and removing ground coffee can leave a bit of a mess. But overall, these are minor points, given the price. If the price were $200+, I would definitely return the item, but at $50 it's an excellent value.
