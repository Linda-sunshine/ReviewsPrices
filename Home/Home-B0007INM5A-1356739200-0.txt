review/summary: Ecopad.review/text: It's okay, if you put to much coffee in the pod it causes the machine to break seal and then waters and coffee is all over the place. It takes to much time to load and like I said before to much coffee and you have a problem. One pod will make a weak 8 oz cup so for me I need to use two pods to get the coffee like I want it. One cup setting twice.
