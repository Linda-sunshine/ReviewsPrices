review/summary: Solves all my chopping needsreview/text: This is even better than I expected. I thought I'd just use it to chop onions and garlic. Turns out this is good for making anything that you want diced, or even made into a pulp. I've even made smoothies with this. Small, simple, convenient, low price.Cons:- if you're trying to get something very smooth, it sometimes leaves some pieces that no matter how much you &#34;blended&#34; somehow escaped- for making smoothies, it doesn't have capacity for more than a cup
