review/summary: Great for Cars w/ Dog Hairreview/text: After reading many other reviews, I decided to get this bad boy to help clean the dog hair out of my car.My dog sheds. A lot. A whole lot. Lots of bright, white fur all over my dark car seats and carpet. Nothing ever came close to getting the hair out of the car except my Dyson animal vac, but its lack of maneuverability made cleaning the car next to impossible.This guy does the trick. The hose could be a bit more flexible, but it does have great suction, and the rotating brush gets the dog hair out of the carpet with relative ease.
