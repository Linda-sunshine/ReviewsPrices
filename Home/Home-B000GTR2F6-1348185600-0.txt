review/summary: Needs a 2 year Warrantyreview/text: I am giving this Keurig four stars simply because I did like it when it functioned properly. But, what I don't like is the fact that I paid well over 100 bucks for this Keurig and it's dead already. I've only had it a little over a year and it has stop pumping a full cup of water in my cup. I challenge Keurig to stand behind there product and add a 2 year warranty. But, you know they won't do it because they know exactly how long each unit will last. Go ahead and call there customer service and ask why don't they offer a 2 year warranty. Anyway, if you want to buy this I strongly recommend that you purchase an extended warranty. I don't know if Amazon offers an extended warranty. I bought aBlack & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mugto replace my dead Keurig. It only cost 20 bucks and it works like a charm. Hey, i just need something that is going to make me a decent cup of coffee.
