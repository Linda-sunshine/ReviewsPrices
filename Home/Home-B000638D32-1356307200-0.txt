review/summary: Perfectionreview/text: After reading the fantastic reviews of this knife in cooks illustrated, I decided to get this lovely, cheap knife instead of the far more expensive Global knife. This knife is really, really sharp and holds an edge well. It went through my finger skin very well too lol. Take care when removing it from it's included sheath. The handle has a comfortably rough texture that makes me feel like my hands will never slide down the blade even when they are greasy or wet. I was leery about buying such a cheap knife but I have been very pleasantly surprised. You cannot go wrong with this knife. It fits my hand perfectly - I am 5'2&#34; and it also fits my husband who is 6'5&#34;. It feels like an extension of my arm when I am using it. For lack of a better term, it feels &#34;balanced&#34; if that makes sense. It cut through everything I put under it as if it were nothing. I am so impressed with this knife. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone!
