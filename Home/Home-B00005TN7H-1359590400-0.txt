review/summary: Works greatreview/text: I have been using this to put cut Romaine lettuce in canning jars so that it stays fresh for the week. I open the a jar every morning and dump it in my salad container and add other salad ingredients. For me, making a slad daily seems like such a chore to chop the dang lettuce. This makes my much more likely to pack a salad. Silly as it may seem. But seeing the jars also reminds me to pack a salad. Although the first week I put my jars on the bottom shelf and had a mixture of Romaine and and Kale. The romaine froze. But the past 2 weeks have been much better.
