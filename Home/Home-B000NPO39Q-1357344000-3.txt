review/summary: Willow Tree Creche Animalsreview/text: I bought these as an addition to my other creche figures from Willow Tree - They are a nice addition and of course they &#34;match&#34; the rest of the set. I hadn't seen them before (my mom bought me my original pieces - just the basics - a number of years ago and I've been adding a piece or 2 each year).
