review/summary: Great Go-To Panreview/text: This is a very nice pan. The non-stick surface works very well (As most new pans do) but also lasts quite a bit longer than most other non-stick pans I have tried. It won't last forever, it will begin to warp on the bottom over time. Also, you must be careful as always with the coating and what kind of utensils to use on it. Plan to stay with plastic and wood utensils to maximize the life of the coating. Overall, very nice pan.
