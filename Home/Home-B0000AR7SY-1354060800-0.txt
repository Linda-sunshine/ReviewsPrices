review/summary: Cheap Plastic - not die cast zinc! Updatedreview/text: Shame on Amazon. Their description of this item is incorrect. It is made of plastic NOT die cast zinc as stated by Amazon. It probably makes sense to buy a cheaper model that will work as well. I may return this if I can find a conical burr grinder with a metal housing in this price range.Update 12/19/2012: Apparently the silver/stainless colored model has a die cast housing, but be aware the Amazon listing for the black model still states the black version has a die cast housing which is not true. It is plastic. Unfortunately I have already used this black model so I will not return it in order to get a zinc housing model.Please note I did not accuse Amazon of "false advertising" merely of being incorrect.
