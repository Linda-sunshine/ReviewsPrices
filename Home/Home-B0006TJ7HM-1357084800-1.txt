review/summary: Worst knives ever...seriouslyreview/text: Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural are the biggest pieces of crap I have ever seen. I read the reviews before ordering and most people favor these knives. Not me. I knew they were cheap but I was hoping that they would slice better than my mid range current knives. Nope. I literally used every knife in the block in the past two days and each experience was awful. The worst part...I decided that since I bought new knives I wouldn't wash them in the dishwasher. So I placed them in the sink to handwash. Two days of sitting in the sink with other dirty dishes (don't judge)they had already rusted. I am not even kidding you. Rusted. It wasn't like they were soaking in water they were simply in the sink with other dishes that I intended to wash by hand. These are going back. They are crap. Don't waste your time or your money on these.Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, Natural
