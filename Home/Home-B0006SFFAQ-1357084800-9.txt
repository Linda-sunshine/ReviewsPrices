review/summary: Very good coffee makerreview/text: I upgraded from Mr. Coffees and Black & Decker coffee makers. It makes a really nice cup of coffee. What I love the most - it doesn't drip/dribble when you pour the coffee! Two things I am not wild about: first, the lid has to be removed to fill it, it doesn't have a hinge-like attachment so it can be flipped up. Not a big deal, but I did forget to attach the lid to the pot several times when I was still getting used to it. Second, I wish there were a window on the side to see the measurement of water rather than having to look down from above the coffeepot which is difficult when it's on a counter (unless you're over six feet, maybe). I rely solely on the lines of measurement on the pot itself. Not a big deal at all, but I would change the design. Overall, though, very happy with it.
