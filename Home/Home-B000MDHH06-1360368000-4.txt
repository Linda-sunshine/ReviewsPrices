review/summary: Easy to use and easy to CLEAN!review/text: I love BREVILLE! I once had another juicer, I don't remember the brand, that I received as a gift several years ago. It took forever to prep the fruits and then an additional eternity to clean the machine. I used that thing twice and then sold it at a garage sale. I bought the Breville BJE200XL because I recently saw it on sale at a brick and mortar store and then saw the amazing reviews on Amazon. In the few weeks that I've gotten it, I've used it several times and have been amazed at how well designed it is. It actually even looks nice and modern on our countertop. From the moment that I took carrots, apples and celery from the fridge, rinsed them, cut them into large pieces, fed them through the juicer, disassembled and completely cleaned up the Breville parts, it took a grand total of 15 minutes! I'm so happy with it that I've already bought another one to give as a gift!
