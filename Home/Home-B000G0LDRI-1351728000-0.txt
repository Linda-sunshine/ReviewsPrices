review/summary: It's OK, but misnamed "quiet care"review/text: This is a fine machine that does its job as a humidifier. I bought it to supplement an Essick evaporative console (http://www.amazon.com/H12-400-3-Speed-Evaporative-Console-Humidifier/dp/B0000D8EJU/ref=pd_sbs_hg_10). I find the two roughly comparable, as follows:1) the Essick is MUCH quieter. On low, it is nearly silent, yet effective for humidity maintenance. The Honeywell has a rather loud fan, but worse, the plastic housing rattles. This I seem to have fixed by lining the contact point with duct tape. But, why should this be necessary on a unit called "QuietCare"?!2) The Honeywell tanks are easier to fill (no tube/funnel required) and it is nice to have two. Also, Honeywell does not ask for bacteriological solution, though it may need it: we'll see.3) The "footprint" of both units is about the same, though the Essick is better looking.4) the wicks of the Honeywell seem cheaper, though I have not yet observed how long they last.5) I have taken to taping coarse cheesecloth on the intake of the Essick, to catch lint before it clogs/corrupts the wick. The Honeywell has its own built in filter. Though I suspect accumulation of dust/lint may shorten the life of the wick.So, they're about the same. I think I'd incline to the Essick, though I kind of like having two different machines, to break up the winter monotony of fill, fill, fill the tanks....
