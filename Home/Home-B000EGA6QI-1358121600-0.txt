review/summary: How did I live without this gadget?review/text: I love this tool. Scrambled eggs come out so much better. I also use it to foam my hot milk for my homemade lattes. It is very easy to keep clean and also easy to store since the blade detaches from the handle. I have had it for a year and not had any problems with it at all. Love it!
