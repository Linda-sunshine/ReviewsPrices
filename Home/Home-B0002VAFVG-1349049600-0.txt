review/summary: FINALLY found the right juicer!review/text: After buying, trying and returning three previous juicers, I finally decided to take a chance and spend the money for this juicer. After using it a couple of times, I am elated to say I finally found a juicer worth keeping! It's powerful, efficient, easy to clean and assemble and the stainless steel construction is a BEAUTIFUL addition to the kitchen counter! It looks like a work of art! With a similar price, by the way, but, in my opinion, WORTH EVERY CENT! Don't waste your time if you are a serious juice person, bite the bullet and buy it..you won't regret it!
