review/summary: Not goodreview/text: Bought this for my wife for Christmas and we ended up returning it. It takes way too long to heat up. There is a &#34;shortcut&#34; method, but even this is too time consuming. We are not heavy duty latte drinkers - only make a couple a week but the time it takes to heat up and brew was unacceptable. The one time we did make coffee it was pretty tasty so I guess if you don't mind the wait, go for it. Otherwise, go for a different model that won't take as long.
