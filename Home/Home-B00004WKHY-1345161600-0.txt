review/summary: love this product!review/text: The Cuisinart Food processor is very easy to use. I watched the CD first, and that explained things well since I'm more of a visual person. I've used it several times and so far have had no problems, easy to clean. I would recommend it to anyone. It's attractive, and well made. It's worth every penney.
