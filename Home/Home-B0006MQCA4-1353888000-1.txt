review/summary: Water tastes greatreview/text: This filter works well and does not take up too much room in the fridge. I have well water and it has not tasted quite right lately. That was why I purchased this filter, needless to say it works well. The water tastes noticeably different and the filters last about 2-3 months. Great product for the price!
