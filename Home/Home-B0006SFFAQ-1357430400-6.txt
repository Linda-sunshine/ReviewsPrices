review/summary: Cuisinart DCC-1200MGreview/text: I absolutely love my new coffee pot! I let my husband choose the color as I had an awful time deciding. He doesn't even drink or like the smell of coffee. I had a Bunn before this one ... loved it because it was done brewing in 3 minutes. With this one I set it to brew before I get up, so it's ready!! Also I have found that I use way less coffee grounds. I love the look of it, and the taste is great! I don't use the charcoal filter, because I always use distilled water. I also use the #4 coffee filters just to save time.
