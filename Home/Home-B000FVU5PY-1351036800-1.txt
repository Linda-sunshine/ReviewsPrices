review/summary: Beautiful Color. A Tad Smelly.review/text: These sheets are very comfortable, wash beautifully and the color is gorgeous. It is really almost a slate blue, not very dark, almost silvery. The quality is very good. Deep enough pockets to cover the mattress plus a mattress pad with ease. My only complaint is that the sheets have a petroleum smell or a rather off-putting stench about them. I will keep them and just deal with the stink, and hope that it goes away after repeated washings. So while gorgeous, I'm kinda wondering what they are doing to my lungs! However as Fernando would have put it, it's better to look good than to feel good, right?!
