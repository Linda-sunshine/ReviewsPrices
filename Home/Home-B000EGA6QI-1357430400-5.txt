review/summary: A great gadget to havereview/text: I love this thing! Makes several recipes so much easier. Even made my own spaghetti sauce by roasting tomatoes and veggies in the oven and then cooking in crockpot for a while. Then just blended quickly with this. So simple and easy and clean up is very easy. It is really strong and seems to blend up anything with out a problem. I havent tried ice yet but the package says to use crushed ice. Way easier then transferring hot things into your blender and pouring back into the pot which is what I was doing before for such recipes. Great for making soups or secretly pureeing veggies into things so the kids can't tell! It is bigger than I expected so had to clear some room for it in the cabinet.
