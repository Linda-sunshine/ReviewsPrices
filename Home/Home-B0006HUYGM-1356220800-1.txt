review/summary: Proof is in the dirtreview/text: This did what I'd hoped and picks up every, lint, hair, fuzzy, and thread from our plush type carpet! Prior to now, I had a laborious routine of scrubbing the carpets with a brush to pick up all the aforementioned crap which our upright vacuum doesn't get. My carpets were not particularly dirty today and I wasn't planning to vacuum, but decided to give my new toy a spin. Did three bedrooms and FILLED the little container with dust and fuzz!!! Every lint is gone and I can't stop staring at my pretty carpets that look like I worked all day to clean!!! I thought I had to pay over a hundred dollars for this good a workhorse!
