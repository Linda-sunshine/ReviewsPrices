review/summary: Love love love these sheets!review/text: Oh my goodness, these sheets are the best sheets I have ever slept on! They are so soft and warm. No more ice cold sheets at bedtime! They fit wonderfully on my 18 in mattress, too. I've been telling my friends who need flannel sheets to get these! I read one review that said the sheets smelled strong when they opened the package. Mine definitely had an odor of some sort from the manufacturing process, but I washed them before I put them on my bed and that smell washed right out.
