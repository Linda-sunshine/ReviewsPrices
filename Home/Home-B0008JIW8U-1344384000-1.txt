review/summary: Fourth One in Six Monthsreview/text: I once had this model and it worked fine for quite a while. Then I got a new one when the carafe broke and it did not work at all. Got a replacement which worked fine for about two-three months. Now it is does not work at all. I have checked the manual but none of their suggestions works. I feel like I have the coffee maker curse. In any case, I will not be buying another of this model or brand. Too many coffee makers in the landfills :(!ADDED 11/01/12 Another not even one month old just died. I am so DONE with Mr. Coffee.
