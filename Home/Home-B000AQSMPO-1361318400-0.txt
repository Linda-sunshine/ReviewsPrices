review/summary: Nice brewerreview/text: I wasn't going to buy one of those single serve coffee brewers because as the old folks say, "That's how they get you!" And what I mean is that you end up a slave to buying overpriced coffee k-cups.I bought the K-cup model, because of all of the single serve coffee machines, this is the only one I know of that you can buy a do it yourself k-cup and put your own coffee into it.I am the only person who drinks coffee in my household, so this is a nice convenient way of getting a great cup of coffee without having to make a whole pot...because as you know...it just comes out better when you brew a whole pot.On the "That's how they get you note." I probably should add that I've actually enjoyed buying some of the fancy flavors and I enjoy those too sometimes. Those little cups keep pretty well and don't go stale. But I still like the idea of not being forced to buy some prepackaged coffee.So there you go...enjoy!
