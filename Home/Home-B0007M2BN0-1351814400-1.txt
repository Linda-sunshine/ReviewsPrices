review/summary: Easy to use and maintainreview/text: This is first ever review on Amazon and I had to write a few words on this Egg Boiler. The egg boiler is very simple to use anyone can use it. I bought it after I read reviews here and seemed like an easy and hassle free product. Like other users have commented, depending on the microwave and watts of power the microwave has, the timing has to be set accordingly. First time users, I'd suggest putting 3 eggs and try different combinations of minutes to get your own individual timing right. I usually fill the bottom container with hot tap water and microwave it for 10 minutes. Have to be very careful to not touch the boiler immediately after the set time is over, its very hot.The best thing I like about this boiler is that each time I boil eggs they are consistently boiled to the same level each time. I don't have to worry about over boiling or under boiling the eggs. I will buy some of my boiled-egg-lover friends.
