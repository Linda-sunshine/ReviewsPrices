review/summary: Best juicer everreview/text: I bought it because It wasn't so expensive, I read all the reviews and seemed to be a good deal. The thing is that I am amazed with it, really! it's easy to set and easy to clean, is not that big, makes a perfect juice without any pulp and has a lot of power!
