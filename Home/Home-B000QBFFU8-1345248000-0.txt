review/summary: where is the juice?review/text: It looks beautiful and looks great on my counter,but I had a Jack La Lane juicer and after 12 years it died, I wanted something new, I juice every day the same amount of fruit and veggies, this juicer does not give me the amount of juice that the other one did, it discard's a lot of pulp with juice in it, I acctually could squeezed out with my hands, I expected a more advanced and better product and was very disapointed, that after all these years the old ones still do a better job than the new ones
