review/summary: Good purchasereview/text: It has good suction, and when you use the brush it does not kick dust backwords. It has a long chord that makes it convenient to use without plugging and unplugging often. I bought it because I have a cat and needed something that would work with cat hair, and it does. The only complaint is that it is loud, but that might be because it has a powerful engine.
