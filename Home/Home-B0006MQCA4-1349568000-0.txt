review/summary: Good water filterreview/text: This is my second Pur Filter.The first one lasted over 10 years. To me it's the best water filter for the money and convenient to place in the refrigerator. Only problem is sometimes it's not so easy to find the filters.Merchants seem to be stuck on Britta filters which are probably okay but I am satisfied with Pur so why change.
