review/summary: Something seems off...review/text: While these filters seem to be identical to the factory ones that came with my brita pitcher, they just don't seem to fit as snugly- either a little too large or a little too small. They still fit and filter correctly, but you'll have a hell of a time getting them in and the sneaking suspicion they aren't working as well.
