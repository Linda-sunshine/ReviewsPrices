review/summary: Read the Care Guide!review/text: I almost passes on this wok after reading some of the lower reviews on this Wok. I had a feeling that most, if not all, of the complaints sounded like user error so I took a chance and bought it anyway. Then after I read about the lid, I almost wasn't going to use it. I did anyways and here is my review.Today was the first time I used it and it performed wonderfully. Simply followed the instructions on the Manufacturers Care Guide and it couldn't have performed better. The meal came out great and cleanup was as easy as described by the guide. The lid was utilized and did not shatter because I did not let a vacuum seal form from temp fluctuations.Now if you don't have the common sense to follow simple use and care instructions or even open the instructions and read them to begin with, then you should give yourself 1 star, not this product.Btw, to avoid always burning food, be sure to use an oil with a high smoke point, grape seed oil or peanut oil, for instance. Happy cooking, all.
