review/summary: Bought it for baby food, use it for a lot more!review/text: If you're looking for something to prepare baby food, don't look any further, this is what you need.I initially bought this product to prepare homemade baby food and it wroked so well that I fell in love with it, and now I use it everyday for soups, sauces, smoothies, etc. I love it so much that I no longer use my regular blender because I don't needed it! This Immersion Hand Blender is very practical.Note: I must clarify that I followed the instructions and have never tried to blend/break ice or anything hard.
