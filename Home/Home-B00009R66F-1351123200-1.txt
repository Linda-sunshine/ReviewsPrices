review/summary: Good purchase for cleaning carpetreview/text: I read all of the reviews so I knew to really read instructions before assembly. Opened the box this morning before work and had it put together in about 20 minutes or less. Snapped the trigger as suggested. It seemed like the handle was a little wiggly, so I took a few minutes to look in the Hoover forum to see if it had happened to others. It had, but didn't seem to be an issue to any of them, so I came home and started cleaning my light cream carpeting with a husband who won't take his shoes off as he goes in and out. (*&^&^&%%%#@! It took several passes but the carpet actually looks clean, not perfect but clean. The reservoirs work as others describe, the dirty water reservoir does fill up before you run out of cleaner and water, but I didn't find it difficult to change and it might have been easier to take a few more breaks. In the past I owned a Bissell and this Hoover is slightly lighter. The new one does take more water changes but is a little easier to move around so it is an OK tradeoff. I think this one gets more water out and the carpet ends up drier when you are done. All and all, I'm pleased so far.
