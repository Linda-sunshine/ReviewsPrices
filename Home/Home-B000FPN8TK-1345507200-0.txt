review/summary: Best teapot ever!review/text: This little "tea maker" is the best loose tea brewer I've ever used! It works as described, you put the loose tea in, pour in the heated water, wait three minutes and put it on top of your cup and the tea leaves stay in the pot and the tea goes into your cup!!! With no mess, no drips! It rinses clean in a jiffy and can be put in the dishwasher. If more than one person enjoys tea you may want to consider the larger version. The 16 ounce "Ingenuitea" makes enough for two cups of perfectly brewed tea. If you prefer a mug, it will make a mug and a half. I'm considering buying a larger version for when we have company. Thanks Adagio Teas for a great product and thanks to Amazon for offering it!
