review/summary: Very Pleasedreview/text: After my last Cuisinart coffee maker gave up the ghost, I tried two other brands from local retailer who does not carry Cuisinart. Was unhappy with both purchases. I am very pleased with this model, with the only complaint being that the hole where you put water could be a bit larger. Other than that, couldn't be happier!!
