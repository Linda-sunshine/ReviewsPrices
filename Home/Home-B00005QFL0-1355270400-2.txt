review/summary: Easy as can be to make healthful bread.review/text: I had the great-grandson of this Panasonic breadmaker for 18 years. I reckon I made at least 1000 loaves before it went kaput. This model promises to be as versitile and hopefully as dependable as the last one. It makes all kinds of bread and dough so easily I wonder why more people don't make their own bread.
