review/summary: Permanent fixture now, on my glass GE cooktop...review/text: I was concerned about how it would work on glass/ceramic cooktops, but really wanted a decent sized griddle.This is a huge surface and it works GREAT!We rarely us the grill side. If I want to grill I go outside and fire up the BBQ, but the grill side works out fine when we need it.My biggest concern was scratching the surface of the cooktop; not a problem, hasn't happened in the year that we've had it.In fact, I've added a couple other nice Lodge frying pans and use them with the same success.The consistent temperature I can attain with cast iron is really nice, and it does get hot. I set my bridge and rear element temps at 2 for frying eggs, cooking hashbrowns, and pancakes. About 4, if I'm cooking something like burgers.So nice to have a griddle surface large enough to accommodate family-size cooking.For darned good, steakhouse style steaks I can easily get 4 nice New York strip steaks on the griddle side. Season with salt and pepper, maybe little Lawry's if you like it, and I sear them for two minutes on each side and then finish them in pre-heated cast iron frying pan in a 500 degree oven. Put some compound butter on each one, or even just regular butter, when you put them in the over for 4 minutes and they are incredibly well cooked.4 minutes in the oven gives me a medium-rare 1 1/2" thick steak. Pour the hot butter over the steaks when you serve them.Love my Lodge cast iron with my glass/ceramic cooktop.
