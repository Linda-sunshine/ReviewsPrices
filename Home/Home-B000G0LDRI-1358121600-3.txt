review/summary: does the jobreview/text: I bought this to supplement the humidifier on the furnace. Evidently, my townhouse is too 'loose' for the furnace unit to keep up with MN winters. It h as been working great. I used another reviewer's idea about turning over the filter (I do it every 2-3 fills) and that is keeping the hardening and discoloration down, extending the filter life. the tanks take a perfect set in the bottom of my kitchen sink, so I don't have to hold on to them while they fill. In 0-10 degree weather, I fill one of the 2 tanks daily. This is with the unit set to maintain a 38-40% humidity, according to my (separate) hygrometer. This is all done running on the low fan speed setting, which is not noisy or intrusive. I'm hoping this model has a longer life, as I never got more than 2 years out of the 310-315 series humidifiers. It certainly has a higher output than the other two.
