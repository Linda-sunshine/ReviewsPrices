review/summary: Big Disappointmentreview/text: Although I was skeptical about this machine, after reading so many positive reviews, I decided to order it.I've had the machine for about a month. I've experimented with trying to get the flow to run 20-25 seconds, but it is simply not possible without producing a thin, tasteless "espresso".The machine is so light, that when you put the portafilter into it, you have to hold onto the machine to get it firmly screwed in. The water continues to drip after you turn off the machine. The filters do not fit firmly in the portafilter. Lastly, when you rinse it, coffee and water remain in it.I don't recommend this product.
