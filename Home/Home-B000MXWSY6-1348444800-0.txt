review/summary: Good purchase for mereview/text: I found this cheaper alternative to an atomic clock when we lived in a neighborhood that constantly lost power. My husband had an atomic alarm clock and I hated constantly having to reset mine. We lost power for a week and when it came back I still had the time and it remembered my alarms. 1 1/2 years after I purchased this, we moved and it had no power source for several days--plugged it in at the new house and the time was fine. Still have not had to replace the factory installed battery.I like the dual alarm feature. I also like that even if the power goes out, my alarm will go off (this has happened). I have it set to the radio because I hate buzzing alarms, it gets decent reception for such a cheap clock. I have pretty bad eyesight but the display is easy for me to read. I really like that the display is not so bright that it will bother your sleep or act like an accidental nightlight. I can also find the off button on the alarm just by the way it feels (the alarm off button is indented, the rest are raised; the snooze button has tiny raised bumps on it) so I can turn it off very quickly--a feature my husband appareciates ;) The off button is also an alarm reset. You have to turn a little dial to enabled or disable the alarm, so I don't ever do it accidentally. I've been using this to get my kids ready for school for nearly two years, hasn't let me down once, not even without power.Now my husband's clock is not working properly so I just bought him one.
