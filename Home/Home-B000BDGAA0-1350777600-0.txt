review/summary: Pinzon MicroBead pillowreview/text: This pillow is pretty firm but will relax as time goes by. I like it though because there are 2 choices for height & aligning your spine & neck for relieving pressure. You also can take out some bead if you want to & save them to add back latter as needed. Use 2 pillowcases like a zippered one & regular pillowcase as your bodyheat can make them warm & w/the pillowcases it keeps it more relaxing & cool. I like it alot & it works to prop a leg up, put to your back for comfy support too, many uses.
