review/summary: My first cast iron pan -- I love it!review/text: I have used cast iron before, but I've never owned one myself, so I was hesitant to buy one -- especially since the price is so affordable. I worried about the quality and weight. As soon as the package arrived I knew that my worries were moot -- that puppy is heavy duty! I have cooked with it three times (beef, chicken, and eggs) and it cooks perfectly every time and is easy to clean (I use rock salt as my "scrubber" and it cleans easily with a paper towel; then I just dry it, oil it up, and it's ready to go!) The 12-inch size is really perfect for just about everything.And call me a crazy patriot, but I absolutely love that this beautiful, functional, affordable product is made in the U.S.A. :) I highly recommend this for everyone, and I will definitely purchase more from this company in the future. Wonderful quality!
