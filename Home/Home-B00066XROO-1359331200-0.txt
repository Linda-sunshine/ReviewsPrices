review/summary: Great for a Big Crowd!review/text: This griddle is bigger than it appears in the picture! You can cook a whole package of bacon at once ... it's terrific for sitting a big crowd all at one for breakfast or brunch. The only real drawback (if you call it that), is finding a space to store this monster when not in use!
