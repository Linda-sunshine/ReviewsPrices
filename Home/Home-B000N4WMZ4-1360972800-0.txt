review/summary: A great dutch oven at a great price!review/text: I compared this product with a nearly identical cast iron dutch made by Le Creuset. In terms of quality and performance, this dutch oven is as good if not better than the one made by Le Creuset. I can't understand why would anyone pay 4-5 times for the Le Crueset unless they just didn't know any better or they are just too hung up on possessing high-cost cookware.
