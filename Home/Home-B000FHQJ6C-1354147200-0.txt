review/summary: I almost love it!review/text: I really am pleased with my Big Mouth. It is just what I wanted for making my green juice. My only concern is that it does take a bit of time to clean. I had seen one that claimed to clean itself by running the juicer with water, but it was nearly $400 so I decided to try the Big Mouth and be a little bit inconvenienced. It really is not that much trouble and it makes fine juice. Perhaps as I get healthier and healthier, stronger and stronger from all the leak and spinach and broccoli and cucumbers I drink, cleaning the juicer will be fun who knows. I have recommended this product to other folks and do recommend it to you. It is a best buy.
