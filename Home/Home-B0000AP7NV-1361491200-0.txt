review/summary: Good pitcherreview/text: This is a good pitcher, very simple and cheap! You'll find this at walmart for $5-$10 more! It's a little too small for our family of five, but it really doesn't take that long to fill it up again. The only con I have with it is that the lid and filter department doesn't secure to the pitcher, so you want to be careful when pouring your water. I plan on buying a bigger one later, but in the meantime this is great! Probably best for singles/couples or a backup, not for large families.
