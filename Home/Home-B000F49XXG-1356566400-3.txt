review/summary: Good, reliable machinereview/text: I would definitely reccomend this machine to people who pull their own esspresso shots. If you know how to grind the coffee and how to pull the shot properly, this machine performs very well for the money. It is an affordable price for the 15 BARs of pressure and pretty good quality. I feel that my husband and I are able to pull shots that are comparable to local coffee shops on this home machine. De'Longhi is a great brand and we also own two space heaters by this brand and are happy with their products.
