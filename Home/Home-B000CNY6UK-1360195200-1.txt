review/summary: My number 1 method for making coffeereview/text: Love my Bialetti !This is my preferred method of making coffee these days and it is great with milk, added water or straight up. Here are some tips after using it for a few months.1 - Use cold water, don't take a short cut with warmer water.2 - Small flame is best, take your time.3 - Grind the coffee slightly coarser than an espresso grind. Too coarse and the water will pass through too quickly. Use freshly ground beans. (A ceramic burr hand grinder is cheap and works great)4 - Tamping - definitely do not tamp with 30 pounds of pressure and a twist...but do pack it in a bit with your thumb or the palm of your hand. The trick is to achieve an oozing of the coffee through the top, not a gushing flow. Experiment but be careful not to tamp too hard. The grind also plays a factor here.5 - keep lid open while brewing. This way you can monitor the process (set a timer for 5-6 minutes or just stick around)and see when coffee is ready.6 - Enjoy. You have just made amazing coffee!
