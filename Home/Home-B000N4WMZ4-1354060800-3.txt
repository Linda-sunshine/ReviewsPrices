review/summary: IN LOVE!!!review/text: I am in LOVE with this dutch oven!! I bought one in Caribbean Blue and it is just BEAUTIFUL. Everytime I bring it out, guests always compement me on it. The color gradient is slightly more pronounced than in the picture, but the blues are wonderful. I use this pot for two things, really: Deep frying catfish in 350oC peanut oil, and making gumbo. It works wonderfully for both applications. I will say the Amazon's price is a bit high on this. I paid $59 at my local target, and that was not a sale price. I don't understand why someone would pay triple that price for something just because it was made in France, esp when the reviews say both ovens pretty much perform the same. I will leave it up to Bobby Flay and his peers to buy the $200 pots. This works great for us home cooks who still want quality.
