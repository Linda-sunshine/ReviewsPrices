review/summary: Need coffeereview/text: This is a basic coffee pot. I like the small size since I am the only one in the house that drinks coffee. I like the new design where you can see the water amount. I don't know why I got the one with the clock since I never find time to use it. It is makes a fair cup of coffee.
