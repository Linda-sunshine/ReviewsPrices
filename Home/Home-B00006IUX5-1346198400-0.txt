review/summary: Great little product!!review/text: I love this coffee grinder. I wish I could find more items for this price that are so nifty!! I love the size and the cord feature (winds up inside of it) is so wonderful, wish all my appliances did that. I use this for grinding up my little red peppers from my garden. If I were a coffee drinker, I would purchase one for coffee beans as well. At this price, I have certainly gotten my money back and would replace it with the exact same item. Well, I might get it in black this time!
