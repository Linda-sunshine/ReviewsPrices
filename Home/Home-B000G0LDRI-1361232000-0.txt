review/summary: Loud but effective...review/text: Reviews saying this unit is loud are certainly right.. Even at the lowest setting it can interfere with TV watching. However it is very effective, and if you can put it another room, or like white noise while you sleep, it is a great product. Refilling is a bit of a challenge since the containers have rounded tops and won't sit in stable position, but having two keeps it from getting too heavy. I was refilling 3 times a day till humidy got to about 40 after a week.. then was down to 1.5 times to maintain it.. My condo is about 1500 square feet, so if you are bigger, might be refilling it even more.
