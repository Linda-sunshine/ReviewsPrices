review/summary: Really good (but not for Australians!)review/text: I made the error of buying an American appliance for use in Australia - power supply is different and blew the motor. For the one grind that it did manage to survive it did a really good job though.Would be good if you had the option to grind directly into the group handle like some other grinders do though.
