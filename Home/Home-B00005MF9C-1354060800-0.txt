review/summary: Perfect for my morning coffee runreview/text: The coffee maker has performed really well for me, I don't have any complaints. It takes about 3-5 minutes for the coffee to get done. It takes less than 5 minutes to clean the coffee maker. I love the cup that comes with the coffee maker too, it's very handy.
