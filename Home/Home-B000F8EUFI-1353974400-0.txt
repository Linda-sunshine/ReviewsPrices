review/summary: Makes a great 2nd vacuumreview/text: We use this guy as our "upstairs vacuum" so we don't have to lug our big Kenmore up and down the stairs. It's a nice light vacuum with lots of power, and is great on stairs. The suction is actually so strong that it makes it hard to push. My 8 and 9-year old kids have to really put some muscle into it when vacuuming their rooms. But those little punks are too soft anyway; pushing a vacuum with super duper suction is probably the worst thing that will happen to them all month.
