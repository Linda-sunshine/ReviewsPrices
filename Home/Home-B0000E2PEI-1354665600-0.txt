review/summary: It's &#34;arthritic&#34;review/text: The first time I weigh myself in the morning it is 1 lb less than accurate. I know this because the next few times I weigh myself - within 30 seconds of the first time - my weight is the same but 1 lb more than the first time. But it does this consistently - every day- so I decided to keep it - after all, I have my idiosyncrasies too. LOL
