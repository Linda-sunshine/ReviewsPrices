review/summary: Dependable giftreview/text: Old dependable standard, helping set up a new household with the basics of decent coffee, for economy and getting the most out of the beans one chooses/can afford. While a burr grinder is superior...this is affordable and sufficient for most folks. Have had one, going strong for many many years...and we go through up to 5 pounds of beans a month.
