review/summary: I really like this machinereview/text: This review is a little late, but I thought I should express my love for it anyway. I'm not such a great cook, but I try to do my best. I love fresh baked bread, but I was never able to make my own dough. I bought this machine 4 years ago and I've using it since. It's wonderful. Although I have had it for this long, I only use it to make the dough, which I bake in the oven. For some reason, I think the bread comes better this way. I like it so much, that I bought one as a birthday/Christmas gift for my MIL. She is very excited and has been experimenting with it. The only complaint I have is that all the writing on the front came off when I wipe it off, trying to clean it...
