review/summary: No more worrying about running out of paper filtersreview/text: This thing does exactly what it says it does.....it filters coffee (I know it's shocking to see a product actually do no more and no less of what it advertises).Makes my coffee taste just like coffee so no arguments here. I recommend it to anyone who makes coffee every day because paper filters get nasty and it's really annoying when you reach up for a paper filter and realize you used your last one yesterday.
