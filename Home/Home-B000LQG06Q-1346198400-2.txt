review/summary: Very comfortablereview/text: I was concerned about this topper at first because it does not have the same density as prior toppers I've purchased. It doesn't leave a handprint in the foam when pressed as the typical advertisement for memory foam boasts. It is, however, just as comfortable as others I've used. There is a 'minty' odor that last for 2-3 days. I have no complaints about that as the older toppers had an unpleasant odor that lasted much longer. I'm very happy with this purchase.
