review/summary: I cut my fingers three times already, becareful!review/text: There is no lack of review for this item, so I'm not going to say much. I just wanted to confirm to you that I have used this Victorinox 8-in knife for about two weeks now and it is light, sharp but solid at the same time. I noticed that some manufacturers cut corners to stay competitive after raving reviews, but not this product. I found this knive to be in par with its reviews. Please be very careful with this, it it so sharp that i cut myself three times in just 2 weeks of use.
