review/summary: Sad little grinderreview/text: Doesn't hold enough beans, the grind is too coarse to make strong coffee, and it makes a mess. If you want to make coffee for four people you end up grinding the beans in batches, holding the button down for like a minute to try to get the grounds smaller. Then it stopped working after a week of daily use.
