review/summary: Using it every dayreview/text: I bought this juicer a few weeks ago and I am using it every day. It cleans up really easily since it all goes straight into the dishwasher. The juice it produces is perfect. A coworker but the next model up and her juice comes out thicker. The consistency of the juice produced from this juicer is just what it should be.
