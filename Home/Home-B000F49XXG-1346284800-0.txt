4.0
review/summary: Better than the previous version - its my secondreview/text: I had a Saeco and it leaked after 2 months. This unit seems far more reliable. This is my second. The pros are:- Better design with removable water tank- Doesnt clog like the old one didCons:- Does NOT take a full sized cup if you are making a latte (I really DO NOT like having to use a little cup to pour it into another cup etc. Just let it have more clearance!)Coffee quality is improved over last years version, and I would say "very good" and EXCELLENT for the price
