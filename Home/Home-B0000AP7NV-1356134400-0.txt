review/summary: Replaced my old one that brokereview/text: Not much else to say that everyone else hasn't already said. My old one broke and this one had a great price and I love it even better than my old Slim Pitcher!Was thrilled it came with a filter and I like the little reminder sticker, too. Way to go, Brita!
