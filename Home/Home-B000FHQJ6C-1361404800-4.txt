review/summary: Machine broke but GREAT customer servicereview/text: Although my machine stopped working after only a few weeks (it was properly cleaned and maintained...just stopped working mid juice while juicing some kale), I have NO complaints. It is a fabulous juicer for beginners and Hamilton Beach had AMAZING customer service. When I contacted them to let them know the juicer had broken, they let me know that there was a 90 day garauntee and said they would ship another out the same day. I didn't expect that at all. FABULOUS customer service!
