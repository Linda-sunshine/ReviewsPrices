review/summary: Perfect for small fridgesreview/text: Brita pitchers come in all shapes and sizes. Having grown up with massive pitchers, I was pleasantly surprised to find a slim version come available, and at a reasonable price, for being just plastic.I don't like the taste of tap water, so Brita filters to me are very important. They make water taste better, and it gives me a placebo peace of mind, as I'm able to filter the water myself prior to drinking.Let's be realistic- the pitcher is slim, so it's small. So know you'll have to refill it more often than a large one. But I'm fine with that; water has less of a chance to grow stale if you're constantly refilling.Cleaning is simple, as every part of the pitcher is easy to reach.The only issue I have is that the pouring nozzle does not have a cover, which means dust can potentially float in onto the water. The larger pitchers have a beak cover, preventing this, but as this is more of a budget/economical version of the larger variety, you can't get too picky.
