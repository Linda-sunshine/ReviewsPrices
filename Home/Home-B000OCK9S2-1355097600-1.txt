review/summary: I just bought a second one of thesereview/text: I bought one of these a few years ago when I needed a second sound machine for our bedroom. My girls sleep with one too. There's a decent variety of sounds, volume is adjustable. The antenna wire that comes out the back was fairly easy pulled out, it was too flimsy in my opinion. But it still picks up most decent radio stations when we want to listen to music. The tuner is also digital, which I like. The face has a dimmer but it's still bright enough to light a room, which annoys my husband, so I usually turn it around or stick it under a chair. The one in my girls' room doubles as a night light for them. I chose this one specifically because it has the option of staying on all night, there is no timer that makes it stop halfway through the night. You can set a specific alarm on it to, though I've never used that function. We travel A BUNCH and this always goes with us, so it's gotten shaken around quite a bit. Sometimes the buttons need mashing hard to make them work, but for the price and durability of the first one I bought, I'm back for a second, knowing it will last a few years.
