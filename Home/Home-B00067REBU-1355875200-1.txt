review/summary: Great machine for the moneyreview/text: Almost any appliance with a heating element has a limited life span, bread machines included. Having that said, this is one durable appliance that gave us about a year of great breads and doughs. We use it once or twice a week and even more during the holiday season. We were lucky it died while still under warranty so we got a replacement. I would suggest buying the extended warranty since its for two years and its only about $8. If you want a bread machine, this is a good buy especially for the money.
