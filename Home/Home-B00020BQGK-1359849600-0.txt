review/summary: Works great!review/text: Find this really convenient to use for quick cleaning. Does a good job on my area rugs and laminate flooring. Wish it had a nozzle to pick up dust in some hard-to-reach spots, but that's just not the nature of the tool. For cleaning floors, it is lightweight and efficient.
