review/summary: A bit small for me, but great!!review/text: This item was shipped very fast and placed right on my doorstep in a safe dry place. The package was light enough for me to slide/roll into the house & I'm 20 wks preg. The ottoman was already completely put together (plus!). The rest of the chair came with all necessary instructions/parts/tools. It took me about 10 minutes to put together by myself with simple directions. The chair is beautiful (I got cherry wood color), and looks just like the pictures. It even has large pockets on the sides of the arm rests, which I did not notice before. The only downside is that I feel it is a bit small, which on a good note makes it very light weight & easy to move around the room/house. I'm kind of a bigger girl 180lbs, 5'8". My head goes over the top of the chair back, unless I slouch. The arm rests touch comfortably at my sides. I will use this chair & I think it will be great. It also glides very smooth & quiet. Hopefully it continues to do well! I will write another review after good use. Thanks
