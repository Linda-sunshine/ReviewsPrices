review/summary: Buy this product with confidence.review/text: I had one of these years ago, and don't know why it took me so long to get another one. I was a little concerned that the newer design would be inferior, but it still works just as well as the original.If you hate waiting for boiling water, then this is an incredible investment. Tea, instant coffee, hot chocolate, ramen, oatmeal, etc. All ready faster than you're used to getting them. What else do you need to know? *Add to cart.*
