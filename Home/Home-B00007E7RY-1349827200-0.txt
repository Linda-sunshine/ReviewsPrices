review/summary: Almost perfectreview/text: Ohhhh the wonderfulness of clean fresh air. Does exactly as advertised and exceedingly well. Only annoyance is bright blue light emitting from control knob. Simple fix by just throwing a shirt over it at night (or removing the light entirely but few have time for such mechanical intricacies.) A bit loud at the lowest setting as well, but ends up humming me right to sleep. Has helped significantly with odors and allergies. Highly recommended.
