review/summary: Easy, Breezy, BEAUTIFUL cup of coffeereview/text: We love us some French Press Coffee. But I started looking around for something with a filter (this has to do with keeping our cholesterol levels not to get tangential) and I found this little device.I also bought a Hario set-up. It's okay but not my favorite.The AeroPress is extremely easy if you have access to a kettle or microwave. It's insanely easy if you have instant hot water. Clean up is a breeze. You just unscrew the bottom and push the plunger through to pop out the puck of used grounds. I would still be knocking the french press against the garbage can 3 minutes later.And it makes it most deliciously BEAUTIFUL cup of coffee.
