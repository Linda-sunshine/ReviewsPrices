review/summary: Great kettle for a good prizereview/text: I have used this little kettle at least 3-4 times a day since I received it! It's a great product for the price, heats water for teas, hot chocolate, or instant soup quickly. Brings water to a boil then has an automatic shut off. Small enough that it heats very quickly {and much better than microwaving} and is a perfect size for one or two people. highly recommend!
