review/summary: It worked for the Familyreview/text: This was intended as a mattress for family members to sleep on. We took out this air mattress and filled it up at first just to test it out and let the smell of newness waft away. It stayed inflated for days without having to reinflate. We took it down, used it for family and they didn't seem to have any complaints so I call it good. I was impressed how long it stayed inflated. Easy to take down, put away, etc.
