review/summary: Great!review/text: It has a great sucking power... it is easy to manuver, not too heavy. It is perfect for small spaces... It comes with an extra piece that helps grab dirt in small areas... The only downfall is the fact that it is a plug in and not cordless... but that is also another reason why we got it... so that it would have the intense sucking power that a vacuum should have. Definitely recommend!
