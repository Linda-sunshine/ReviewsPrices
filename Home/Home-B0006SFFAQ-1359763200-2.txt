review/summary: Great Coffee Makerreview/text: This is my second Cuisinart coffee maker, and it makes the very best coffee. I love the fact that it has a changeable water filter and a wire mesh instead of having to use coffee filters. The &#34;clean needed&#34; feature is also a plus and easy to put into a self clean mode.
