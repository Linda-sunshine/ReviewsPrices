review/summary: Durable, cute, reasonably pricedreview/text: My daughter has had the Hello Kitty model for years. I've had the green frog for years, and we recently purchased the owl model. This is a good, durable product that is easy to maintain. Our tap water is very hard, so we use bottled distilled water. After several years of use, our Hello Kitty one no longer puts out enough humidity, so we'll replace it with the same product. Reasonably priced.
