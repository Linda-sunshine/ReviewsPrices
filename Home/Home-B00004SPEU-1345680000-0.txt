review/summary: Great grinder for drip coffeereview/text: If you are looking for a grinder for coffee beans to use in an automatic drip coffee maker that uses paper filters then look no further!! The Krups 203-42 Coffee Grinder with Stainless steel Blades in Black is exactly what you want/need!!I got this as a gift. As soon as i got it, I ground up what was left of my Kona Coffee beans that I had brought home with me from Hawaii.The beans had stayed in my freezer becasue I couldnt find any appliance in my kitchen that ground the beans fine enough for my automatic drip coffee maker (it uses paper filters). I had tried multiple times with different devices and the grind was too coarse every time (and I have plenty of devices that grind, chop, blend etc...).This made a perfect grind. Not too fine. Not too coarse. There were a few bigger flakes but over all the consistency of the grind was excellent. I do not think this would grind fine enough for espresso but it is GREAT for drip coffee.The beans were still frozen right out of the freezer.First I did a small test batch then I tested at full capacity.It created a vortex and sucked every single bean down into the blades within seconds!!It was so good to FINALLY be able to enjoy a proper cup of Kona coffee made with beans that I had actually brought back from Hawaii!!
