review/summary: Leaking on first usereview/text: Very disappointed.Consumer Reports gives this such a good rating. I purchased from a local retailer and got it for a good price. I did see the reviews about leaking from the bottom. But figured - "not everybody has had this problem".On first use - making a fruit and vegetable smoothie, it leaked. While the blended result was what I wanted (liquefied fruits and veggies) the fact that it leaked around the bottom on the first use was unacceptable. I have an old $40 Cuisinart that doesn't leak while making the same smoothie - how can this $100 machine have such problems?It wasn't "bad" leaking but it did leak "ON FIRST USE". I can only assume that it would get worse overtime. Took it back to the store I purchased from.
