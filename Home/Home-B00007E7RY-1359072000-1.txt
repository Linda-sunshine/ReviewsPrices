review/summary: Great, esp when on salereview/text: My review for this takes into account that I got it for $100 off the usual Amazon price. Some folks have complained about the sound, but tbh I expect some sound to come from a good filter, esp of this size. The turbo setting, which is only really used when first turning on, is quite loud. The every day setting, is normally fine esp in a room you don't visit often. Finally the 'night' setting would work for almost anyone I think. I've had it in the main tv room and was fine with it as long as it was set on night. I usually keep in the bedroom and use it for white noise to fall asleep too as well. If you want one to put in bedroom and can't take any noise at all, then spend more and try out the 'quiet' models. Otherwise this is a great bargain and works amazingly.
