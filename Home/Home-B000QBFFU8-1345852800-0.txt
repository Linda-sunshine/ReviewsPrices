review/summary: Foodie cook boyfriend says "this is pretty impressive".review/text: I bought this Breville as a gift for my boyfriend, a serious cook and foodie. We use it mainly as a supplement to our bar as well as for weekend breakfast juice. He loves whipping it out to impress guests.PERFORMANCEI bought this model specifically because it has a variable speed motor, which I find really nice. One speed settings just don't adjust for the different consistencies and reduces the amount of juice extracted from the fruit. I was impressed with the quality of construction and performance - no wobbles, whines, or leaks.COMPARISONMy parents bought a Jack LeLane juicer a few years ago. I thought it worked pretty well until I started using the Breville. Hands down, this baby extracts more juice from the fruit, leaving dry compote behind. When the Breville claimed "easy clean up" I didn't think it could get much faster than what I already experienced, but I was wrong! Clean up is super quick - and dishwasher safe. However, the unit is relatively heavy. I would set aside some counter space (it's aesthetically pleasing enough for display) or have a special easy-to-reach cabinet space.WHAT THIS JUICER IS NOT:1) This model has a pineapple setting. It's helpful, but it still leaves very moist fruit compote after juicing. It's fine with me, because I'm using it in mixed drinks, and pineapple bits are oh so tasty in them. NOTE: Pineapples are notoriously difficult to juice; buy a commercial pineapple juicer or lower you expectations a little.2) a masticating juicerBOTTOM LINE: I knew I made the right choice when my discerning boyfriend said "wow, this is pretty impressive". score.
