review/summary: Beautifulreview/text: I had a 3" memory foam topper on my old twin size bed. After that, any mattress without one felt like sleeping on rocks- no joke. Well, I guess that's one reason not to get one of these, if you think you're going to be spoiled as a result.Anyway, I found myself in need of a new one due to a change of bed size (yeah... marriage) and this looked like a decent and not super-expensive option. A few notes on the item:It doesn't have a cover, as some do. This is essentially a slab of memory foam. I don't have a problem with this since I simply cover it with a bedsheet, but it's worth pointing out. I don't think memory foam itself is particularly cleanable (and for sure, this isn't going to fit in any washer), so it's probably a good idea to cover it with at least two layers of bedding.It comes rolled up and folded in a box, but returns to its flat form the moment it's unrolled. I had a king-size and it covers the entire bed area well. There's a few inches of space vertically, but it's not noticeable when covered.The foam itself is very soft and retains its shape. It feels great, more firm than an airbed and softer than any regular spring mattress.When new, the topper had a faint mint scent. I didn't mind it, but some others might. After a few weeks of use, the scent dissipated.Overall, great price and great product. If you haven't tried memory foam yet, you have no idea what you're missing.Pro:Feels greatGood fitNot super expensiveCon:No cover includedHas a temporary scent, if you're sensitive to that.
