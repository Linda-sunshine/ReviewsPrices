review/summary: great vacuum and carpet powder suckerreview/text: This vacuum has been such a blessing. We just moved into a new house in which the carpet had been saturated in carpet powder. We went through a two vacuums trying to suck up all the carpet powder but it just ruined the vacuums. They were both bag less vacuums. We bought this one hoping it would not ruin it and it didn't. We were on the verge of replacing all the carpet because we didn't know if there was a vacuum out there that could handle all the carpet power. This vacuum powered right through it and sucked it almost all up. So we can continue vacuuming with no problems. It still sucks up some of the deep down carpet powder but it seems like its almost gone and it didn't ruin the vacuum.We have had no problems with this vacuum although a bag full indicator light would be helpful.
