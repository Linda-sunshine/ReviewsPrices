review/summary: Works well for mereview/text: I bought this item from Amazon five years ago and have had no problems with it. The only problem I had at first was not having the pressure valve seated properly so it wouldn't come up to the appropriate pressure; completely my fault. I use it frequently but only for cooking beans (I don't eat meat and would never cook vegetables in a pressure cooker) so I don't know how other foods would turn out. If somthing should happen to mine, I would not hesitate to replace it with the same one.
