review/summary: Dont buy this - Horrible Lid Designreview/text: Brita has been adamant about not redesigning this lid. Since this model has been out for a long time. Amazoners have been pretty vocal about this for some time but Britta has NOT listened yet. May be if we stop buying this, they will. Also, filters are really inexpensive at Amazon or Costco or Kmart during a sale.
