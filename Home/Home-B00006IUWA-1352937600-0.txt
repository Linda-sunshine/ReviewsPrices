review/summary: Gloriousreview/text: Perhaps the cheapest popcorn maker on amazon, but it does what it's intended to do and that's pop popcorn. My only complaint is that there is no on off switch so you simply plug it in to turn it on. I prefer to leave it plugged in so its always on, this keeps it primed and ready to pop those kernels at a moments notice.
