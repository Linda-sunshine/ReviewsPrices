review/summary: EVEN 80 YEAR OLDS NEED GOOD COOKWAREreview/text: My brother is a wonderful cook, but used old, out-dated cookware gathered at garage sales and Goodwill Stores. On his 80th birthday this year we got him a beautiful Cuisinart MCP 12 MultiClad Pro Stainless Steel 12 piece Cookware Set. He loves every piece - especially the fry pans. We look forward now to each visit to enjoy his excellent kitchen skills with the new cookware.
