review/summary: I Love Amazon But This Product Leaks! Ruined Car Seat!review/text: I purchased this product a couple of years ago. Am just now getting around to writing the review. Why? Because I found this FORGOTTEN bottle tonight tucked away in a cabinet and it brought memories flooding back in.My wife eats healthy. But she does like to take coffee to work. I bought this Thermos brand container for her for two reasons: To be a convenient method to take coffee to work and because the brand is Thermos. You see... when I was a young man I had a great Thermos which I took to lunch with me. Daily. I loved it. But this bottle turned out to be a huge disappointment. Unless it is kept upright, it leaks. One day she put it into her lunch bag sideways. Sat the lunch bag in the back seat of her NEW car. By the time she got to the office the contents were all over the seats! What was a real bummer is that the coffee stained the seats and we were supposed to go to the dealer on the weekend to have the upholstery sealed against spills!I couldn't believe this happened accidentally so I checked the container myself. It was NOT her fault. Placing the bottle on its side made it slowly leak. And, after a 30 minute drive to work, the contents would be emptied.I just put it back on the shelf. I keep forgetting to put it on that famous Internet website where people sell JUNK so I can get rid of it. My recommendation? Be careful if you buy it. Thermos use to be made in America by Americans. The bottom of mine clearly says "Made in China." It's incredible how a good company like Thermos can throw away American quality and American jobs and have cheap quality products made by (almost) slave labor. As far as I'm concerned, they have also thrown away their name. I'll NEVER buy Thermos brand again. Let 'em sell to the Chinese.
