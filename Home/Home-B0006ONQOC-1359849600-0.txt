review/summary: Hey Mikey they love it!review/text: I bought this for my parents as a Christmas present. I remember as I was growing up in the summer we would make ice cream a couple times a month, and it was one of the big 2 gallon Wh**e Mo**tain hand crank freezers. Through the years as we all grew up and moved away they bought a couple of the small 1 gallon electric, but they had the wood bucket and eventually would dry out or rot. They haven't had one in nearly 10 years or so. So when seen this I thought it would be great because they wouldn't have to worry about ice or salt to make it melt and all the mess afterwards. They really love it. Just freeze the bowl then take it out of the freezer add your mix to it, plug it in and let it do its work. This is a good product, and just from my parent&#8217;s reaction to what it does and how easy it is to do it. I think you will be pleased with this item too.
