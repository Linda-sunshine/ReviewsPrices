review/summary: Good For Water Boilerreview/text: I own a Zujiruishi Water Boiler and wasvery amused at the instructions that say you need to clean it every couple months. With the hardness of our water even with a water softener, I need to clean ours at least twice a month, sometimes on a weekly basis depending on usage.I recently was looking up some new teas and it was recommended to use either spring or filtered water for the best taste. Well, I certainly wasn't dropping the money to fill my boiler with spring water, so I did a little research and went with the Pur 18 Cup dispenser. My water boiler holds 4 liters, so I wanted a dispenser that could refill the whole thing at once. As I only use this for the water boiler, I leave it on the counter and the slim design takes up little space.I cleaned the boiler and then refilled it with filter water. My husband noticed the taste difference with his first cup of coffee and I have noticed a slight improvement in the taste of my tea. Not Holy Cow why did I not buy this years ago, but it was enough to notice. I am also hoping it helps keep the mineral deposits from forming so quickly on the inside of the boiler so it requires cleaning less often.
