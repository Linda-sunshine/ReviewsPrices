review/summary: Great Vacuum but 2012 model has no light!review/text: I just bought another Hoover widepath tempo because it has worked so well for us over the last few years and is very well priced. It picks up cat hair and baby/toddler crumbs well. However, I am VERY disappointed that there is no longer a light on the vacuum (2012 models)...the light on our previous model worked very well and was very handy to have. Thus, I can only give it 3 stars this time around.
