review/summary: perfect little machinereview/text: I am so glad I got this, grinds perfectly, and the clean up is so easy, it comes completely apart for easy clean up, and to dry I just stick everything in a colander(strainer) as it dries so the blade doesn't get misplaced or in the wrong hands.this is a perfect grinder to get if you live in an apartment with very little kitchen space.
