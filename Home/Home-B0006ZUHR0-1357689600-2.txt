review/summary: Reliable, but a bit heavyreview/text: We've been using this for about a year. I like the available settings and it certainly does the job well. I particularly like the automated reminder to clean it. Once I found the instructions, cleaning was a breeze. My only beef is that this sucker is a bit heavy. And that's coming from a big guy who can swing a pick axe all day with no hassles.
