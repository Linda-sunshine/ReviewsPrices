review/summary: works great in the officereview/text: This little thing works. I have other fancier ones with a nice base at home, but this works well for me. I like how i can unplug the power cable and use it as a pitcher. It heats up fairly quickly for the price point. There is no plastic smell or taste as another reviewer stated, at least in what was delivered to me.
