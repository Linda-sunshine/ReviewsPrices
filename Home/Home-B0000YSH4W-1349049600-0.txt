review/summary: Fast paced and engagingreview/text: SPOILER ALERTHigh interest book for middle grade readers. Some sensitive issues are covered, opening up opportunities for dialog and discussion about euthanasia, socialism, etc. If you have a reluctant reader in your family, this book may be worth looking at. My son is a reluctant reader, even with a higher than average reading level for his age. This was one of the few books he has read without a lot of nagging. However, the topics contained in this book would not make it suitable for a kid under the age of about 10 or 12.
