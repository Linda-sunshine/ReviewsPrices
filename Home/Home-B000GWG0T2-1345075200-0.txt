review/summary: Good but not greatreview/text: This pan is very good, but because it isn't completely flat, I take away 2 stars.When buying a new pan, and paying a few (not too many) dollars, you expect a flat cooking surface. At least for a while. This pan became "deformed" after first use! Now when you fry an egg for example, it always goes towards the edges. same thing when using a bit of oil, none of it stays in the center. It all goes to the edges.Now don't get me wrong, heat distribution and non-stick capabilities of this pan are awesome. But like I said, you expect more from a pan that is new.And as always, Amazon performed perfectly with shipping and customer support whenever needed.
