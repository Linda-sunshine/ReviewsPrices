review/summary: Drive shaft stripped after 6 months. Warranty requires $$.review/text: Like many of the other 1 star reviewers, I loved my blender until it suddenly made a terrible stripping gear noise and stopped functioning. The warranty requires you pay for shipping to Cuisinart along with a check for $10. For that price, it almost makes sense to buy a replacement and forgo the warranty.
