review/summary: Love this productreview/text: I bought this pressure cooker a few years ago from Amazon. I love using it. Makes things simple, delicious and healthy. I only have 2 burners on my stove (and a grill) so I didn't want one for the stove. This is easy to use, easy to clean. It's amazing how lesser cuts of meat can become so tender so quickly. The front panel is clear and simple to understand. Would suggest double checking the position of the steam vent, however. I have not lined it up correctly and so the food did not pressurize. Now that I am used to it, it's no big deal. Love the non-stick interior, too! This machine is only second to my crockpot!
