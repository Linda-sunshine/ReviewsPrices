review/summary: Better than a pizza stonereview/text: For over 20 years I used two pizza stones. I swore by them and told everyone to get one (or two). They were cherished. Their color was that of a good coffee bean. That was until I received a cast iron pizza pan. The stones will now be gathering dust (or at least old cornmeal).Originally a good review in a trusted source (Cooks Illustrated) had me put a cast iron pan on my wish list. For the past year or so I've been doing a side by side comparison with my stones. The crust of the pizza on the cast iron always turns out better, crisper. That was enough for me right there. But, there were other advantages as well.Durability. I lived in mortal fear of someone putting a skillet or something heavy on the pizza stone and cracking it. Needless to say, the cast iron will not crack easily.Access. The handles are great. Getting a stone out of the oven was often tricky. The handles don't get in the way of putting the pizza on the pan, as I had initially feared. The lip helps more than it hurts. It provides a bit of a back stop when putting in the pizza and the lip doesn't make getting the pizza peel under the pizza difficult at all.Stickiness. The pizza doesn't stick to the cast iron any more than the stone, which means that sometimes it will stick if some sauce and cheese gets under the crust. I don't take care of the cast iron that much. Just using it often keeps it seasoned. If you're afraid of cast iron, don't be. There's a reason it has been used for years, it lasts without much attention needed.Pre-heat. Huge difference. I don't always have an hour to preheat the stones. Also, I feel a bit guilty leaving the oven on at 500 degrees with nothing in it (the house does get heated though). The cast iron fully heats in 30 minutes.Clean-up. About the same for both. I don't use soap on either. Just let then cool and scrape off any stuck on bits with a plastic scraper.I'm switching to cast iron.
