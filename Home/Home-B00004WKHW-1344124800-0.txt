review/summary: Just what I wantedreview/text: I'm retired and live alone and only cook for one. I wanted a small processor appliance that met my needs and I didn't have to have a lot of trouble with. This item did the trick. I am most pleased with it and it it easy to use and clean. I got the red one from Amazon and they only had 4 left, the other sites I checked including Cuisinart site were either out or Red was not available so I lucked out there too.Downside is the little plastic spatula that comes with the processor looks like an afterthought and something that might have been dropped in the box by mistake instead of the garbage. I ended up buying the Silicone three set in matching red of standard kitchen spatulas becuase of this.Progressive International Silicone Spatula 3-Piece Set, RedI really don't like short cords on appliances either but since they have made it a safety feature on almost all appliances I just suck it up and use an extension cord.Speaking of safety, the blades are razor sharp so one must be mindful of that when cleaning. I also like the bowl and top locking mechinism to make sure everything is connected correctly before the machine works.
