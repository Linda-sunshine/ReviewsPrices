review/summary: love the maker but be careful.....review/text: I have read the reviews with the overflowing issue and it DOES infuriate you when it happens, especially two or three times in a row!!! We have discovered it isn't the lid on the pot but the basket holder that fits into the swing out bucket. You have to "learn" the feel of closing that arm to know it is fitting in there the correct way. There is a lot of give on how that basket can fit in there and still be able to close with no problem but there is just a different "feel" when you know it is "just right". I hope those of you reading this can understand what I am saying as it is so hard to explain without SHOWING you what I mean. I have the hardest time showing my husband what I am talking about so it is for sure a "tricky" situation. SOOO, I can see why so many people would just rather FORGET the whole deal. I have sworn to throw it away too after my husband floods the kitchen over and over and finally I have just made him leave the coffee making to me. If it didn't make such "hot" coffee I would just ditch it too but there are just so many coffee makers that just don't make the coffee hot enough for us.
