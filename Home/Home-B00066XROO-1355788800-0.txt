review/summary: Outstandingreview/text: Outstanding! Haven't had any issues with uneven heating... So nice to be able to do a families worth of food at once, all the right temp without having to worry about keeping things warm/drying out. Only drawback is that it is hard to fit in sink/ dishwasher....but that is really minor...super easy to clean.
