review/summary: review on pressure cookerreview/text: I bought this pressure cooker for my daughter for Christmas,because I have one like it and don't know what I would do without it.I use it at least 3 times or more a week.It always preforms well Is easy to use and cleans up well.My daughter used to have one a different kind and it never worked right so she got rid of it and always says she wish's she had one like mine.If you have been afraid to use pressure cookers .this easy method will calm your fears and allow you to enjoy cheaper meats good recipe's and a much shorter cooking time.I love mine.
