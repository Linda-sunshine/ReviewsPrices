review/summary: Messier than I thought it would bereview/text: This was my first juicer. Im not sure if all juicers are this messy but, from the reviews, I thought it would be cleaner.The spinning of the filter motor creates a slight wind tunnel in the chamber which blows specs of the pulp out the top of the feed chute. I wish they could have designed it to be more of a vacuum which sucks air in through the top instead of blowing it out. Instead, small specs of pulp fly out before you have a chance to insert the food pusher (milliseconds) and after you insert the food pusher, as the food pusher does not completely cover the diameter of the chute.Other than that, no probs.
