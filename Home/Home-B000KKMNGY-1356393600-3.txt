review/summary: It works but has some wigglereview/text: It works. I use it for boxes of jello and pudding mixes under a shelf in out pantry closet. The distance between the arms and the rack is not adjustable. Despite the good width of our shelves, it wiggles. For this reason I would not use it inside the kitchen cabinets.
