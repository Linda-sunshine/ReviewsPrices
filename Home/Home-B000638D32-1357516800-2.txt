review/summary: Cooks Illustrated is right!review/text: I have a $125 J.A. Henckels chef's knife (and do love it, especially the balance and weight of it), but I wanted to try this because Cooks Illustrated said it was a nice Japanese-Euro hybrid. I LOVE IT. I only use my Henckels when this one is dirty. SO worth it. Even if it did break, I'd just buy another one. Handle looks cheap and probably is, but it's non-slip and good for when your hands might be damp as another reviewer said. High recommended after about sixth months of use.
