review/summary: Best Coffee Maker I've ever Ownedreview/text: This coffee maker brews a mean pot of coffee. For years I'd been baffled by the fact that, although I enjoyed coffee whenever I went out to eat, I never enjoyed it in my own home. I tried various brands of coffee and went through several low-end coffee makers before I finally decided to stop being cheap and just shell out for the excellently reviewed DCC-1200. I'm very glad I did. I've had it for just over a year now and it's been brewing phenomenal coffee since the day I plugged it in. I haven't even replaced the charcoal water filter (which I know I should have, and promise I'm about to!) and it's still brewing great coffee. I also own a french press, and while that device does outshine the DCC-1200 it doesn't win by much, and this coffee maker definitely wins the convenience battle. Don't waste your time being cheap like I did - just buy this coffee maker. You'll be glad you did.
