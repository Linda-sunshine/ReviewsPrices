review/summary: Excellent cup of Coffeereview/text: I have two of these, one at home and one at work. Makes a perfect cup of Americano. I have made me somewhat a coffee snob as I have started to notice when Starbucks or some other coffee shop tries to pass me a poorly made cup of expresso/americano. Device is simple to clean and the filters seems to last multiple uses with only a simple rinse so the filter pack can last a lot longer than expected.I initially got it because I wanted decaf and my office rarely had a pot of decaf going. Now I have coffee that easily beats anything brewed in the office as well as nearby coffee shops.
