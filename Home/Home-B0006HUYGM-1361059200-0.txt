review/summary: Great little productreview/text: This hand held vacuum is great for spills and cleaning small areas with the hose and accessory. It can get a little heavy if you use it for long periods and you can't really use it to vacuum large areas. I also wish it came with more attachments. But it is a great compliment to a regular size vacuum cleaner.
