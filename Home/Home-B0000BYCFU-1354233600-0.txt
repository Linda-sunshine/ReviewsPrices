review/summary: Great Pressure Canner for Flat Glass Top Rangereview/text: I have a FLAT GLASS TOP range and the this pot works great on it. Reason: The bottom (that fits exactly over the large burner 8 1/4") is lower by about 1/4" then the surrounding pot which is about 12 1/4". I Bought the Pressure canner-2 weeks ago- Used it to make Beef Stew, Chicken Soup, Lentil and Navy Been Soups. All jars of food turned out great. I ate some of the soup already and it tasted good. High Altitude cooking at 15 for 90 minutes. The recommended 3 quarts of water in pot was good.Still had some water in pot after 90 min. The pressure stayed constant with no issues. I never felt scared of any explosion. It was so safe, and easy to use. I followed exactly all instructions! Read the simple instructions pg 10-14 and there is no reason you would have any problems.I wiped clean the rubber sealing ring and put some Wesson oil on it and wiped off excess. TIPS: Add small amount of vinegar to water so no discoloring of jars- Be sure to wipe clean the top of jars with moist vinegar on paper towel after you put food in jar. This removes any grease, etc. Also, when finished- let the pot cool down by itself- This was about 40 mins- Don't rush it. Remove the rings and clean under them and put back on if you like. The Presto customer service was helpful when I called to ask questions about cooking times, etc. You can also use in the water bath method-taking off the rubber sealer and not apply the pressure regulator. You can double stack Pint jars without another rack...simply stagger the upper row directly above the lower.
