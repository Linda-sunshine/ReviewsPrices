review/summary: Very pleaseantly surprised expecting it to puree but hoping it would rather chop and dice which it does!review/text: I got this hoping I could dice and chop things like onions, celery, water chestnuts, carrots, bell peppers ..... yada yada. I kind of assumed that this would end up pureeing the vegetables instead of chopping and dicing but I'm lazy so I took a chance on this bad boy. JEEZ was I sure wrong about the puree part. I noticed the blades are not so close together so I thought that maybe diced chunks may come out better and it sure turned out right. All you have to do is pulse the food chopper until the desired size is attained. The 3 cup bowl comes in handy too. Be careful when washing the blades. They are razor sharp. I learned when I first washed the blades and sliced my finger deeply. See my review on Celox. It may come in handy.This food chopper does an excellent job if you are watching what you are doing. The only drawback, which gave it a 4 rating is the fact that the top of the chopper is exposed and you can't wash it as it contains the electronics. If they put a removable cover that can be washed after taking it off the motor I'd rate it 5 in a heartbeat. Clean the inside top with a clean wet paper towel. Do not clean or dry the inside top using your dishrag.This is a great 2 speed chopper at a very reasonable price and does what is supposed to do VERY WELL! I really like this chopper and would recommend it to anyone sitting on the fence.
