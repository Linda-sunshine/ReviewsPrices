review/summary: Solid Knifereview/text: It's a great knife. I've had absolutely no problems with it and it cuts like a charm. I will say, however, that I also have a no-name knife, for maybe a third of the price, that works pretty much just as well for me. So I don't really know if it's worth paying up for this.
