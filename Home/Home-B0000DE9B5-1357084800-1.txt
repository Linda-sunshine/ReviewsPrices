review/summary: Nice pitcher but not really 77-3/4 ouncesreview/text: The pitcher is listed as 77-3/4 ounces when, in fact, it is really 2 liters. Since 1 liter = 33.8 oz, it really is only 67-2/3 oz. Other than that, it appears to be a good quality product that closes tightly and pours well. Peculiarly, in the order history, the item is described as 2 liter but that description is not on the product page nor in the product choice box.
