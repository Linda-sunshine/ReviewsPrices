review/summary: worth every centreview/text: best $18 dollar coffee maker in the history of coffee makers...I bought it for my office b/c I hate the single serve K Cups...I would much rather have the option of making a single serve cup of coffee w/ fresh ground, which this does...and it comes w/ a sweet cup! Buy it for your office, you won't be disappointed.
