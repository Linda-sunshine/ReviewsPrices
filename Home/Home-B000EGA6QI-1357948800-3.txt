review/summary: "Brushed Chrome" is misleadingreview/text: Blender seems to work fine, but I chose the "Brushed Chrome" model, but it is in reality silvery plastic that looks nothing at all like brushed chrome or stainless. Older reviews specifically mention how this is "easier to clean than the plastic ones." I suspect it used to be chrome, but was changed to plastic for cost reasons. The bottom portion is shiny stainless steel, but this is the case for every color for this model.
