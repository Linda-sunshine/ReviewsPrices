review/summary: Great for making tea at the end of the worldreview/text: This was the last item I received from Amazon before the dead walked the earth... And as these things go, not a bad decision. It's quite durable, was able to withstand life on the road and although it's got its fair share of nicks and scratches, the Governor really seems to appreciate his earl grey whenever he drops by the lab. Wish I had another, but I've searched all of Woodbury without any luck. Would definitely buy again, if I survive the apocalypse.
