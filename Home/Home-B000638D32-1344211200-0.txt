review/summary: Great Valuereview/text: This knife is an amazing value: I would choose it over my expensive Henckel chef's knife. Of course, I've only owned it a short while, but it has the weight & 'feel' I want. It's light, with a little flexibility, which makes it good for certain tasks like carving the rind off a pineapple, and it slices like a dream.
