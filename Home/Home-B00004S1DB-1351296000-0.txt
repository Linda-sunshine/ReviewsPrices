review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I bought this coffee press because I had a glass one and it didn't last very long. This press seems very sturdy, and is easy to clean. It holds 2 huge mugs of coffee. I have a cheap grinder and as long as you don't grind the coffee too fine it works very well. The press doesn't leave much mud in the mug as long as you don't grind the coffee too fine. I have only used this for a couple weeks but have no complaints!
