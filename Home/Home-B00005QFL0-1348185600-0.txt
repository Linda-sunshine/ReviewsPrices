review/summary: Gets it done quite wellreview/text: Panasonic SD-YD250 Bread Maker - This is my fourth bread maker, my first Panasonic. The previous ones all did well and lasted a good length of time. So far my new Panasonic is the quietest and the bread is the best of all I've had. I have begun experimenting, modifying recipes, etc., and look forward to a good number of years of a happy partnership.
