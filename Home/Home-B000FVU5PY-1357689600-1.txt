review/summary: Very Rough Sheetsreview/text: I'm quite disappointed with this set of sheets. I washed them prior to using, and honestly, they have a very scratchy and rough feeling. I'm hoping that with time and additional washings they'll feel more like sateen. Now, they feel like poplin or light weight canvas. No exactly what I want to sleep on!
