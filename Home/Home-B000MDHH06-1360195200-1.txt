review/summary: It's way better than the no-names or multiuse kitchen systems, A good budget Juicerreview/text: Like I said in the title, this thing way outperforms your average junky juicer, but it doesn't exactly stack up to the high end stuff, well worth the money though, and it DOES however, compete in a price range higher than it's own. You get the quality name of Breville behind it, what more can you ask for?
