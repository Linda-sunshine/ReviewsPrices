review/summary: Great to have for guestsreview/text: We don't drink coffee, but wanted a coffee maker for my guests so they wouldn't feel the need to go out somewhere to get a cup of coffee.After researching reviews, I chose the Mr. Coffee DRX5 4-cup Programmable Coffeemaker. My guest have been very pleased and the wonderful auroma of the brewing coffee filled the house with a marvelous smell.
