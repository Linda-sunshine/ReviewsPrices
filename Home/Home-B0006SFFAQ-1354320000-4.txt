review/summary: Finally a good coffee maker!!review/text: We have have over the years had a number of coffee makers which have been okay but not really great. They have all been lower priced Mr. Coffee type products. The last one we had would often fold over the filter and deposit most of the grounds into the pot or all over the counter. We decided to upgrade to something better. After researching many products the Cuisinart seemed to be the best one for our needs. We purchased the matte black version of the DCC-1200BW and have used it for the first time today. So far it is a great coffee maker. The product is stylish looking and compact. The permanent filter seems to work well, but is a bit more difficult to clean. The unit is quiet and has some neat features. It beeps when the coffee is done, but can be poured at any time during the cycle. The warming tray can be set to stay on from 1-4 hours and has three heat settings. The hot setting was to hot for us, so we set it to medium. They say the pot is drip proof and it really is! We selected the black color because it made reading the selection items on the switches to be easily read. Many of the features we have not tried as yet. Tomorrow we will try programing the maker to start by it self. The only thing that is not great is that the clock is not lighted and is difficult to read. Overall the product is great!! Plus the shipping was super super fast. Ordered it on a Sunday and we had it delivered on Thursday and it was free shipping!!
