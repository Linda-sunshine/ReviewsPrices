review/summary: You may not get the color you orderreview/text: This same item is available on Amazon for $5 less, but I paid more to get the "Midnight Blue". Instead I got a solid black one, which I already owned (and wanted two different colors so my kids could easily distinguish their own cups). Returning is a hassle and time waster, so now I'm stuck with it AND out five hard-earned bucks. The bottle is awesome, but Amazon's service for this item is definitely NOT. Just be sure you're not paying more than $16 for this or relying on a specific color ot be delivered.
