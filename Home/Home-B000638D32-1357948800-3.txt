review/summary: What a difference a sharp knife makes!review/text: I bought this knife based on the recomendation from America's Test Kitchen. I watch their videos and have tried to make many of their recipes. I have struggled due to my dull knives that I purchased years ago. Chopping onions was more like smashing a knife into them. Tomatoes squashed down under the dull blade of my 8 yr old chef knife. Forget mincing herbs!This knife is a good price point for if you're just starting to get serious about cooking and want to try out techniques before going on to purchase more expensive knives. Build quality is great and the blade passed the paper test right out of the box. ''Finally, I feel like i can follow along with the ATK folks. Chopping onions is a breeze, tomatoes get sliced like soft butter, herbs mince down to uniform tiny pieces. Cooking is a lot more fun (and safer) when you're not struggling to cut up your vegetables.
