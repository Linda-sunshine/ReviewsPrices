review/summary: Very quiet, auto on timer, prettyreview/text: We bought the Keurig B70 brewer after two years of trouble with the Dolce Gusto system. (They replaced that machine FOUR times under warranty due to water leaking daily and I had had enough) I am so glad I made the switch! 90 days of use all day long by four adults and everyone is happy with both the machine and the K-Cup varieties. Turns out the Keurig is much easier to use and provides more flexibility with regard to size, temperature and types of drinks available. This machine is very quiet so you can use it early in the morning without waking anyone else up. I love the auto on/off feature - it turns on and heats the water at 4:30am so it is ready to go as soon as you are - even if you're running late, you can have a travel mug of coffee in less than 90 seconds.This machine does eat up some counter space, it's not small by any stretch of the imagination, but it's worth it. I am really glad we made the switch from the Dolce Gusto system - can't get Butterscotch coffee or Hot Apple Cider with that system!
