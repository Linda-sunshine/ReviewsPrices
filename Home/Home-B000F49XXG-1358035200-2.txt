review/summary: Easy to Use. Great Espresso.review/text: This is an efficient, basic, easy to use espresso maker. Making morning espresso really cannot be any easier. Lights light up when water temps are right, you turn a knob, You turn it the other way to steam your milk. The crema is lush. Cleaning the unit occasionally as recommended will keep it running for along time. (Unscrewing the basket, maybe dealing with the filter plate (less often) if you get really ambitious. The water reservoir is easily removed (if you take it out to clean it) and also easily re-seated.
