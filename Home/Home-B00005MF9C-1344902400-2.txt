review/summary: Works great!review/text: I bought these for a premium coffee club at work, to help support a great local coffee roaster. I wanted something that could make a cup at a time, and something that was easy to use and made good coffee. It didn't need to make the world's greatest coffee, because the coffee we get from our local roaster is out of this world, so a good coffee maker would be great automatically. You put in great ground beans, out comes great coffee, what more could you ask?
