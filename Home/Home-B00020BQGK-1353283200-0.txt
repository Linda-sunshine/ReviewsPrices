review/summary: Fantastic vacuum!review/text: I have owned this vacuum for over a year now and feel like I can write a qualified review. I live in a 2-story town home, the first floor being mainly hard wood and tile with some carpet in the tv area. Wanting to preserve my hardwood, I didn't want to use my old Hoover, even on its bare floor setting because the brush didn't stop spinning. This vacuum has been perfect. I love that it is corded so I can vacuum whenever I want, for as long as I want. It is small and convenient enough that I can pull it out daily and do touch-ups (I have dark wood floors = shows everything!). The suction is strong all around the head, or in other words you don't lose suction out the sides. It doesn't throw the dirt behind it like the spinning brush vacuums do. I can go from tile to wood floor, then flip the switch and go to carpet seamlessly. The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the awful sound it makes when you turn on the brush to vacuum rugs. The brush does best on non-shaggy carpet. I like the bagless feature and never knew how much my cat actually shed until I cleaned it out! I call it my sexy little vacuum.
