review/summary: For me their roughreview/text: They look good. But for me who sleeps without pajamas they feel very rough. My wife doesn't have an issue. We put them downstairs for our guest beds so it does not affect me any more. Went for the Costco sheets which feel great and are about the same price, style, color etc.
