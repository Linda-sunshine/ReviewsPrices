review/summary: Very cool.review/text: My girlfriends loves popcorn so I thought I'd get her one of these bad boys. It's very efficient and usually pops all the kernels in one run. Clean up is really easy and it's pretty fun to watch the kernels pop and fly into the bowl. Simple mind, simple pleasure? Maybe, but I don't care!
