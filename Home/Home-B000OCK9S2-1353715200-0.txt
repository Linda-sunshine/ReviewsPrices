review/summary: Doesn't work after only 6 months!review/text: We bought this for the nursery and it worked pretty well until just this week. For no reason, it now just shuts off the sound randomly whenever it feels like it. Really unreliable when our baby doesn't sleep well without white noise. And it's not like we can sneak into his room to turn it back on without fully waking him up. We started using this thing back in April or May of 2012 and it's only the end of November!Another annoying thing is the the time on the LED screen is super hard to read unless you are the perfect angle. So you basically can only read it if you are standing up or sitting down in the rocker, not both. The screen is also a bit too bright when you are trying to keep the room dark.Other than that, the number of sounds is nice and it's fairly small/light enough to travel with, although the batteries die after 2-3 nights of use.
