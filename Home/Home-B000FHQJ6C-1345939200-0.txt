review/summary: It has served its purpose.review/text: I happened to see "Fat Sick and Nearly Dead" which inspired to try a juice diet.Based on reviews I ordered this HB Big Mouth juicer for the project. And it worked.On June 28th I began juicing for 60 days, today was day 60 and I weighed myself. 30 lbs lighter so I was done. I skipped day 60 and started eating veggies and fruits today.The only drawback to any juicer I guess is the cleanup. I juiced about 2 or 3 times with the HB and would wash the attachments with hot water and dish soap using the included brush and a dish rag.You have to do this because fruits will attract fruit fly right away and I'm sure it can get gunky if you don't.Anyway, it comes apart easy, it washes pretty easily.The juicer never failed me. I juiced carrots, cucumbers, melons, kale, celery, oranges, strawberries, mangos and spinach. Carrots are the only item that made it slow down a touch. Just cut the carrots in 3 inch lengths and fill the mouth with 3 or 4 and push slowly and steadily.So its still working fine. I'll use it one or two days since I'll probably do a quick weekly juice fast so it fails anytimes soon I'll update the review.Save some $ and go for the Hamilton Beach!
