review/summary: Thick and luxuriousreview/text: These sheets are amazing... the flannel is nice and thick, and so warm. The corner pockets are nice and deep and this goes on so easily every time, even right out of the wash (no wrestling with tight corners). I kind of go too long between changing them because I love them so much. I should probably pick up a couple extra sets. The first couple washings yielded quite the fuzzballs in the lint trap, and I thought that they would be less fluffy because of it, but that's not true - they're still great, and the color's held up pretty well, too.
