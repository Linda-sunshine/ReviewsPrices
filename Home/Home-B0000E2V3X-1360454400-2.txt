review/summary: Love it for runny gluten free pizza crustsreview/text: I bought this as an early Valentines Day/Anniversary gift for my husband (romantic I know...). He is following a gluten free diet, yet still misses pizza. All of the gluten free pizza dough recipes we have found have been extremely runny and ran right off our pizza stone. This pan is perfect...it heats evenly and the lip keeps the dough (or almost batter) contained.
