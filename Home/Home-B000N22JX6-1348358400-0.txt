review/summary: Great Heaterreview/text: I have tried many electric heaters. Most of them burn out after one winter. I am on my 3rd winter with this in a room very large. It actually gets almost to warm which is great and so I have purchased another one for my home to take the cool edge off. Also my son has one and his is 3 years old to. Great buy worth every penny and the heat is just right. The look is pretty cool to.
