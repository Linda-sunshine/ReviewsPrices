review/summary: Stopped working after 7 months!review/text: We purchased this to replace a similar trash can that had lasted almost 7 years! I'm extremely disappointed that this one only lasted 7 months!! The lid sensor stopped working. At first it wouldn't open if you had opened it in the prior 60 seconds. Now it just plain old doesn't work. I wish the company would be better about replacing the faulty top. I have read several reviews that state what bad customer service the company has. I'm very unhappy with this product. It's very deceptive that this has 1,200 reviews with an average of 4 stars!! Do not buy.
