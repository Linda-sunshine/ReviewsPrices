review/summary: Great Rice on Regular Cycle, Very Good on Quick Cyclereview/text: I started out using the regular cycle and the rice it made was fantastic, but occasionally I'm in a hurry and I use the quick cycle. Even on the quick cycle, the rice is very good, better than the average Chinese restaurant rice. And it is so easy to use. As someone else pointed out, the instructions are a written in bizarre English, but it's so easy to use - who cares? I've used the regular cycle, the brown rice cycle, the quick cycle, and the cycle where you add little bits of food. All good. Well worth the investment.
