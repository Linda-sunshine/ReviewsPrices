review/summary: uneven and bulkyreview/text: Tie rack can hold a number of ties but it is very bulky and not very convenient. Taking ties off &#34;rack&#34; can be a bit tricky with larger hands and with a lot of ties on the device it is hard to quickly identify the tie you are looking for. I prefer a vertical style tie rack.
