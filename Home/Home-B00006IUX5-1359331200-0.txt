review/summary: Great deal!review/text: Does the job as advertised. Easy enough to clean, just wet a paper towel. I say this because the blades are so sharp that they could cut a cloth or your fingers.It's not very loud, compared to some grinders, but it might wake people in the morning.Also grinds spices!
