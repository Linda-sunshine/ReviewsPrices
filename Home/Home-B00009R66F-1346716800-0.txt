review/summary: Easy cleaning.review/text: This cleaner was easy to assemble and super easy to use. The dirty water holder rinses out easily. The carpets came out sparkling clean and smelling great. It is a very good cleaner for the money. The cord is shorter than my old one so I have to use an extension cord but that is a minor detail.
