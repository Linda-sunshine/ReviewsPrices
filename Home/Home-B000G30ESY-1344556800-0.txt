review/summary: great for what it is, but wish I'd have known more about what that wasreview/text: I did notice in other reviews that this 3-"Cup" rice cooker referred to a cup that wasn't actually a cup. Turns out that it is 3/4 of a cup. Also to cook brown rice you are restricted to just 2 "cups" which is actually then just one and 1/2 of a cup, which I'm sorry to say ain't a lot. I was also unhappy to learn that there is no setting for sticky rice. It does make great rice.
