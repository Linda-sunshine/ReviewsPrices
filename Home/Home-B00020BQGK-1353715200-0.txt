review/summary: Great for hardwood floors!review/text: Purchased to vacuum my new hardwood floors.Works great! Small, light weight, and easily reaches under furniture.Draws the dirt right in! Although I do realize now why they keepsending me emails about exhaust filters. They quickly fill up withdirt and dust. Oh well. I would still highly recommend for hardwood floors.
