review/summary: Great for a quick cup of hot chocolate! :)review/text: It was getting cold outside, and I joked with my boss about getting a hot chocolate machine. Then I remembered these awesome electric kettles they had when I visited England! I was thrilled to find that they are so affordable. It takes a minute or two to boil, but I usually stop it halfway, since I don't like having to cool off the chocolate for ten minutes after. Everyone loves it, and it's a great way to start off a cold day. :)
