review/summary: seems great, but i'm a novicereview/text: I'm new to juicing but it's done what it says it'll do... I'm still not sure how it so efficiently removes pulp... so much so that it's almost dry when I empty the pulp hopper. Everything about the delivery was good too. I hope it lasts, and considering it'll be under heavy use over the next two months, I might be back here to edit my initial review.
