review/summary: Didn't work but B&D is AWESOME!review/text: Received the item but once plugged in lasted about 3 minutes, shut off and would not work again. I think the either the seller or whomever they received this item had the same thing happen to them and, instead of just returning, sold it to us. HOWEVER, I called Black and Decker, explained the problem, told them it was purchased through Amazon and without question, gave me the information on how to return it for a brand new iron. Should be to us soon! I'll look to buy a B&D item just because of the awesome customer service.
