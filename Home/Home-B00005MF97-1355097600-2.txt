review/summary: Use it all the time.review/text: I own this and the smaller B&D chopper and they are very handy. This one holds a little more liquid but can still be effective for mini jobs. It is easy to clean because the bowl and blades are removable. I needed a replacement bowl because of a crack soon after purchase. It was promptly replaced and everything has held up for the past year or so.
