review/summary: Bad SteamVac Good Shampooerreview/text: This is not a STEAM Vacuum. It uses warm to hot Tap water and has no heating element to boil the water to get steam. If you are looking for a Sanitizing STEAM cleaner do not buy this product. If you are looking for a decent Carpet shampooer, then this is a good buy. The name is very misleading.
