review/summary: Very powerful for its size/price, lack of brush toolreview/text: Is very powerful, small enough to clean every corner (at least with the crevice tool), very simple to operate. The cord is decently long.My only complain is the lack of brush tool (the reason for my 4 stars, not 5). Some narrow surfaces need to be brushed in order to remove the dust and the rotating brush is too wide. Is not a big deal but its' annoying.
