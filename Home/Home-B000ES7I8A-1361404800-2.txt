review/summary: Boils water like it's supposed toreview/text: Boils water like a boss.Only 4 stars because the pour spout isn't as accurate as I'd like, and when/if limescale starts to build up, I'm probably going to have to make sure it remains clean, as I'm not sure the filter creates a great seal that all the water goes through.
