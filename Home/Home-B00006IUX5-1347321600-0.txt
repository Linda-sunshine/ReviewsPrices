review/summary: Great while it worked.review/text: We bought this coffee grinder for our office since it got great reviews. It worked well for a few months, but it has since stopped working well, and I suspect it will soon stop working at all. It looks like the grinds accumulate inside the case, and since the screw on the bottom needs some kind of triangle tool to open it, we can't get them out. We have to shake the case into the garbage, roll the cord in and out, and do crazy maneuvers to try to get it to work in the morning. Not recommended for ongoing use.
