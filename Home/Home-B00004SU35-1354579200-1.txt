review/summary: Soon to have two!review/text: I bought this thing to roast coffee in and decided to try it out for popcorn before my latest shipment of beans came in. Long story short, the lady says I have to order another one for the coffee 'cause this is the best popcorn maker ever. It seriously leaves no kernel unpopped, and since they all get even heat, there's no scorching. Super legit.Pro tip: get some good kernels and make your popcorn with coconut oil and a little salt. It's real good.
