review/summary: Excellent Kettlereview/text: After considering all of the reviews and complaints about the smell, I went ahead and bought one. Yes, there is a silicone smell (I haven't used a lemon juice soak yet), but the kettle functions perfectly and I cannot taste anything in the tea.I have used every night for two weeks and thus far, no issues.
