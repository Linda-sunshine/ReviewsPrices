review/summary: So Awesome!!!review/text: Everything was perfect! Packaging was great, arrived in perfect condition and sooner than expected (used Prime, got it in a day and a half). I received this item as I was running a bath, what great timing! I was feeling a little tired and stiff after a three day work stretch of 12+ hour shifts, really crummy, and as I started the water heard UPS at the door. Anyway, this was incredibly easy to use and gave me the best bath I can remember. I read the instructions (although it was a no brainer) and set it up before the water even reached it, and the bath stayed full and hot and bubbly for as long as I stayed it it. I wish I had heard of this little gadget long ago!!
