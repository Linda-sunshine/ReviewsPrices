review/summary: Comfortable!review/text: These sheets are the most comfortable sheets I have ever used. They fit my deep, pillow-top mattress very well. Even with an additional 4-inch memory foam on top of the mattress they don't slip off and still fit very nicely. They wash well without pilling and are very soft.
