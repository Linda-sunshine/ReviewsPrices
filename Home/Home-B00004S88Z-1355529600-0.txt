review/summary: The Rolls Royce of canners!review/text: My Dear Hubby bought this for me for Christmas. I've canned for many years and have two cheaper brand canners ...and they work fine... but last spring we saw an All American canner at a garage sale for $70. I drooled, and mentioned that it was neat...hint, hint... Dear Hubby said something about I could buy a new one for that price...and we drove off...As we were talking in the truck and heading to the next sale, Dear Hubby was educated about All American canners (grin) ... We ended up going back to buy it and of course there was a older gentleman and his wife buying it to fry fish in!!! Needless to say, hubby was more upset than I was...But I'm tickled pink with this shiny new addition to my fleet of canners! I 've run 3 loads so far and love it! My 33 year old daughter is drooling now and can't wait to see and use it when she visits for Christmas....I think this will cost her Dad the price of another one before long...I may even hint for another one myself!
