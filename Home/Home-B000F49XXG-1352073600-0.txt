review/summary: Worst customer experience EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!review/text: The machine is great when it works but Delonghi has the worst customer service EVER!!!!!!!!!!! Our machine broke after 3 months and then told us they would replace once we cut the cord and sent it in. 3 months later and they still have not sent us a new one and every time we call they have a different story. If you buy a machine just hope it works properly so you dont have to deal with them
