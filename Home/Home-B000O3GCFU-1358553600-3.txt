review/summary: Nice updatereview/text: Originally I bought this same type of thermos in pink a year ago. I was quite happy with it. It has wide enough mouth so you can freely move you utencil as needed. It keeps hot food hot until lunch time in my daughters school and it washes off beautifully. Unfortunately, the bottom part of it became loose this year and I had to replace it. But, since I loved the functionality of this thermos, I bought the same one again, just a different design. I hope I get much more use out of this one.
