review/summary: A Must For Every Cookreview/text: Amazing product. I was skeptical prior to purchase because 1) I had never used a food processor; and 2) I didn't think I'd use it that much. Man, alive - I use that thing all the time to chop up veggies for various recipes and such. I even made hummus and black bean hummus in it! Great purchase, great value, multitude of uses!
