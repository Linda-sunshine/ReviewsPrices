review/summary: Toasty - As Advertisedreview/text: I've only run these thru the wash twice but I did not have any discolorations or pills - yes there was quite a bit of lint. The pillow cases fit my standard queen pillows just fine and the fitted sheet is generous so no tug of war to get them on the mattress. They feel great. I'm pretty pleased so far!
