review/summary: Satisfactory Knife Sharpenerreview/text: An economic alternative to spending a chunk of money for a knife sharpener for normal household use. It sharpens my Chicago Cutlery just fine and I can't complain about the price. Motor could be a little stronger if not applying too much pressure, but gentle strokes produce a good edge. I'm happy with it.
