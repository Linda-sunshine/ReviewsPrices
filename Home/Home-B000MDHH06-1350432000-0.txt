review/summary: I love this thing!review/text: This is my first juicer, and I love it. Well, it's not my first- before we bought this one, my husband and I bought another from Target and it stopped working.This Breville is amazing- it really does produce more juice, holds lots of pulp, and is actually pretty quiet! It's easy to clean, and I really like that the pitcher it comes with skims off some of the foam.I use it at least once daily, sometimes twice- it juices everything: oranges, whole apples (I get the smaller granny smith ones), lemons, beets (I chop them in half, though), cucumbers, celery... pretty much anything you like. OH, and it does kale very well- I have heard that other juicers get clogged easily with leafy greens, but this juicer juices 'em like a champ!I haven't had any issues with this juicer, and when it dies (one day...) I will buy another.
