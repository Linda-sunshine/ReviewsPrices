review/summary: Very useful lidsreview/text: Great to cover jars of pickles or other acidic contents. The two-part screw lids corrode and are unwieldy once you unseal them. Keep these plastic lids on hand to tightly cover all jars you've canned and opened. They work well with any size wide-mouth Ball jar. Can't find in stores, glad to find here. Theyare very durable, I've had some for years. Dishwasher safe too.
