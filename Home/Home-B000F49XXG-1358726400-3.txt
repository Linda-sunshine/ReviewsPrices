review/summary: disappointing...review/text: I had to return this machine because the small boiler simply doesn't allow it to produce espresso. even when properly warming the machine as stated in the instructions, the green light only stays on for about 10 seconds. it takes about 25 seconds to make a double shot. after the green light goes out the espresso turns watery instead of producing crema. the result is watery coffee with very little crema instead of rich espresso. additionally, my machine leaks water and it arrived with the handle to the water tank broken off. I was excited about this machine because I bought it as a lightning deal but unfortunately, you get what you pay for. I plan to purchase a more expensive high quality machine to replace this one. no great price makes up for a machine of poor quality. to me, it's worth it to pay even several times the amount of this machine to get something that actually makes good espresso and will hold up over time. I strongly recommend you pass on this machine and save up to invest in a real espresso maker.
