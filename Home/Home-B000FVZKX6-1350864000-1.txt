review/summary: Pamper yourselfreview/text: I was in a mood to indulge myself when I ordered these. We are experiencing a cold autumn this year and these flannel sheets are just what I needed. So warm and soft, they will make you feel pampered. My old flannel sheets, from Kohl's, have held up well but they were never as soft as these. I hope these remain as nice through repeated washing and drying.Note: Several weeks after purchasing these, I received a gift of flannel sheets ordered from Overstock.com. Overstock's heavy German flannel sheet set is not nearly as heavy or as soft as these sheets from Amazon.
