review/summary: great but a little problematic.review/text: I love micrbead pillows. They are really cool. I decided to splurge on a bigger one. It came with a case that seemed a little too small and its also a little too firm to actually sleep on. It softens up a bit though after time. Just make sure you watch the seems because if one goes, its basically an explosion of microbeads. I had never seen microbeads close up since they were always in my pillow. But I guess they are pretty cool. A little problematic though. If you manage to find one with an open seem. dont move it because it will literally be a waterfall of microbeads that will stick to everything. They seem to be statiky. I also hear a few going around in my computer fan. Its a mess. But if you do manage to have this problem. Fear not, because amazon has your back. I talked to customer service about this and they sent me a new one. They want the old one back as well, I guess to prove that it was actually defective, which is okay with me, except for the packing was a little messy. Other than that ordeal. I love this pillow. Its good for hugging and feels cool most of the time. Its also good for sitting up and back support. not good for pillow fights either. wow that would be a mess also.The new one is great though and seems to have all its seams intact!
