review/summary: Lovely, but only lasted a week!review/text: I really liked this humidifier as did my 2 1/2 year old. It pumps out moisture well and raises the humidity even in a large room.BUT.... and it's a big but... the nebulizer stopped working after a week (it first started putting out large droplets then stopped altogether) I returned it and didn't get another one after seeing that many have had similar issues. If quality issues could be addressed, would be a great product.
