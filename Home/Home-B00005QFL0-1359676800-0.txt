review/summary: Panasonic SD-YD250 Automatic Bread Maker with Yeast Dispenserreview/text: I've had a couple of Panasonic bread machines in the past, and as far as I'm concerned, they're the best. I just got a new one at Christmas, and from the very first bread I baked in it, every loaf has turned out perfect! I also like that the &#34;bake rapid&#34; cycle on this model takes only 1:55 minutes.I would definitely recommend this product.
