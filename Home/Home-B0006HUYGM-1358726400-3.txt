review/summary: Getting rid of itreview/text: The suction power decreases quickly - even when cleaning off the filter after every other use. Well actually that is the problem - I don't want to clean the filter regularly. And trying to find a replacement filter has been a pain. Ask yourself what you want a small hand vac for - if you only need very light cleaning once in awhile then this is fine - but for anything greater I would look elsewhere.
