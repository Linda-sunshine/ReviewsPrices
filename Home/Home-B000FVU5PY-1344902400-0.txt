review/summary: Simple and Nicereview/text: I'm not very well educated in the matter of sheets so I wasn't sure what to expect out of 400 thread count sheets. These are not impressively soft, they actually have a little bit of a silky texture but I didn't find that to be a bad quality. They're still an absorbant cotton and I sleep comfortably on them and they wash well. My main complaints would have to be that the sheets seem to be a bit larger than full size. I have a standard full size bed but I had to tuck the sheets in quite far under the mattress. Also, the pictures makes the sheets look almost a light blue color but they are very gray blue.
