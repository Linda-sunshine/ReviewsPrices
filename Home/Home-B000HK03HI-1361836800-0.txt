review/summary: Buy itreview/text: Our old Zyliss got to the point where it just wouldn't open cans any more. It gave us 8-10 years of reliable service so why change. I'm happy to report they still make 'em like they used to, perhaps even better. This new model is easier to use (ergo dynamic) and opens everything we've attempted. I don't work for Consumer Reports so I can't remark on how it compares to the competitors but based on its sturdy looks and performance to date, I'm sure this will give us another 8-10 years of service.
