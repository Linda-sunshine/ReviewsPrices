review/summary: Great coffee grinderreview/text: I agree with all of the positive reviews.Ignore complaints of noise, I have no idea how anyone could dislike it. It's about the same noise level as my dishwasher or microwave.This is a very quiet coffee grinder. Compared to our old, loud rotary grinder, it's virtually silent.I have a boiler-type espresso machine (also by Capresso) and this grinder vastly improved the taste compared to the rotary grinder.Similarly, my coffee maker can use gold tone coffee filters again because this grinder produces no dust to slip through and make sludge.Build quality is impressive and I expect this to last many years.I'd recommend to anyone looking to upgrade from a rotary grinder.
