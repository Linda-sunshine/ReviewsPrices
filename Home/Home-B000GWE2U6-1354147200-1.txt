review/summary: short livedreview/text: 2 months and this unit no longer works. I walked into my daughter's room and it was off. I tried to turn it off and back on to see if that would work and nothing. :( VERY DISAPPOINTED because I thought this was the cutest and quietest unit I have purchased. And Amazon is not accepting this return because they say the time to return this unit expired. :( Now I have to purchase a new one. I'M NOT HAPPY!! I don't recommend this unit.
