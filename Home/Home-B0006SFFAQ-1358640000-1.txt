review/summary: Freaking great little coffee machinereview/text: I have owned this coffee maker for over 5 years now and it's performed beautifully without a hitch. My only complaint is how loud the beeper is when the coffee is finished brewing. My house is very tiny and it annoys everybody in the house. The coffee tastes great, I use a paper filter in addition to the gold mesh filter because we have very hard water here. I remember to clean it when the light comes on and have never had any problems with clogs. I would recommend this coffee maker.
