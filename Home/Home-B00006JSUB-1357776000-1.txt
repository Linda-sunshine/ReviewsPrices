review/summary: Great Skilletreview/text: Bought this along with the Lodge Logic 12 inch cover. Although a little heavy for my wife, it works great for cooking a quick meal in one pan. The front handle is useful for cleaning and carrying the skillet. I keep it seasoned with olive oil and it looks good.
