review/summary: Plastic gear housingreview/text: My 600 pro had a plastic gear housing that cracked long ago. I got a metal one from a repair shop, but the gears themselves were already damage. The result was the paddle is misaligned so it binds up on the bowl. nothing but trouble, even after repair. Now it is completely unusable. That was a big waste of money and it created a lot of worry during times when the kids and I should have been enjoying ourselves. In the market for a new mixer; reluctant to try another kitchen aid.
