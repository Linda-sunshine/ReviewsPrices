review/summary: Useful enough to have aroundreview/text: I tried using this thing as directed several times and was never terribly impressed with the results--still too acidic for my taste. I switched to merely using it as a filter for batches of cold-brewed coffee that have already been steeping for 24 hours and it does a really good job of keeping the sediment out of the cup.It's pretty tall and narrow which means it's pretty easy to topple with even a slight misapplication of pressure. This is a significant design drawback, but other than that it's reasonably sturdy. You definitely won't have to baby it the way you would a French press.
