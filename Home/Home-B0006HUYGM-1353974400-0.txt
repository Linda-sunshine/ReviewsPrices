review/summary: A handy portable corded Vacreview/text: This vac is convenient and powerful. It has a wide swath and you can attach the suction from the rollers for finer cleaning. I do not like chargeable devices because I always forget to charge them or the battery wears out over time. This vac has a long cord so you can use it all over and the cord wraps around the handle for storage. There is a set of attachments that are separately sold.
