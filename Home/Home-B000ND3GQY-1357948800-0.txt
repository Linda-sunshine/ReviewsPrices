review/summary: Deceptive Price--Againreview/text: This is not a product review, per se, but a caution about Amazon's price claims. The pan itself is fine: distributes heat evenly to sear food well, cleans easily, has good weight, etc. That said, buyers should be aware that Cuisinart recommends a retail price of $34.95 for this pan. So while Amazon offers a savings, it is not a discount from a retail price of $100, which Amazon suggests. I am finding more and more incidents of this type of deceptive pricing on Amazon--very disappointing and totally unnecessary. Everyone should check other websites before buying here to make sure the savings and expected quality are legitimate.
