review/summary: Performs well, but wish the clip was more functionalreview/text: This unit is absolutely perfect for use in the oven as well as when making confections on the stove top. The probe is ample size and doesn't leave a HUGE gaping hole where it's inserted.The only feature that I wish was improved is the clip for attaching to the side of pots. It's a piece of metal that doesn't flex at all, so it tends to be difficult to use on thick walled cookware. Otherwise, it's a great value!
