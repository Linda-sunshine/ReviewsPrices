review/summary: Fantastic Valuereview/text: Fabtastic value! Did a lot of research on different models at various prices. Decided I would go with an economy model to determine how often I would actually use it first. After 1 year, the juicer is still going strong. It has been used as many as 10 times in a week to as few as 0. I even have been able to juice leafy greens which most reviews would say you need a masticating juicer for. Just wad the spinach or lettuce up nice and tight and put it in with hard veggies.
