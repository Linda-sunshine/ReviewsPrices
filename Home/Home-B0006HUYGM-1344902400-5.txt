review/summary: Excellent hand held vacuumreview/text: I purchased this product hoping to use it to win the battle my off white living room furniture wages against my four long-haired miniature dachshunds. It didn't disappoint! I found it a bit unwieldy at first but was able to quickly adapt to the proper way to hold as I cleaned behind the back cushions. The brush has wide bristles so even with the large amount of long hair being vacuumed up none of them appeared to get caught up in the brush. Additionally the dust cup is easy to work and in a smart engineering move the release button was worked into being part of the on/off switch. Also the cord is plenty long enough though on a side note I think it may weigh more then the machine itself. I would caution that some may find the vacuum starting to feel a little heavy after a few minutes if you have to hold it up against something. Another suggestion I would make is to spend the few extra dollars on the reusable filter. I would suggest this item to anyone looking for a corded hand held vacuum.
