review/summary: Best Keurig modelreview/text: We've had a Keuring, Elite 40 for 7 or 8 years now. It works fine but it always made a racket when brewing. we finally decided to buy a new system and bought the B70 Platinum brewer. Wow, what a difference. It seems we made a jump from the stone age to the 21st century. Quiet, more water capacity and we jumped from have two cup sizes to five. We're hoping that this one gives us as many years of service as our old Kreurig.
