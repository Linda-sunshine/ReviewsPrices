review/summary: Does the Job, A little Bigreview/text: I like this mini-chopper so far after about two weeks of use. I replaced a smaller chopper that is about 1/3 of the capacity thinking I would like the extra room. It's not that I don't, it's just that this model is a little too large for my liking in terms of storage in a cabinet -- it works, but I have to separate the top from the bottom to do it. In terms of functionality, I'm very satisfied. I'm not sure I understand the difference between the chop and grind buttons, but in practice I like how it works because one spins the blade one way and one spins it the other way. That obviously has a practical impact on how the blades affect what they are processing too. On the whole, I think this is a good product that I would recommend. They only reason it's not 5 stars is more personal preference. I might look for a two cup capacity (this one is 3 cup) if I were doing it over.
