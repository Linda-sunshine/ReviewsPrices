review/summary: Great pressure cooker.review/text: I have used it to make Kabsa, a Saudi traditional food, several times. It is perfect. It gets scratched from inside very easily, especially while cleaning with something rough. the only flaw is that the screws get loose on the sides, probably due to the pressure. you still can tighten them. Also takes a while to get it the pressure out. 5 stars to this beast.
