review/summary: Works great, easy to clean outreview/text: A vacuum doesn't have to be all complicated, and this one isn't. It cleans like crazy, and the dirt container pops out with one hand. It even has a push-button release to dump the dirt out into the trash. The other great things is the automatic retracting cord. Never had a problem in about 2 years.
