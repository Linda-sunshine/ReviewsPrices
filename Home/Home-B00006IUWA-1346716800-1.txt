review/summary: Excellent Corn Popperreview/text: I was used to hot air poppers throwing the corn around the room and having to run the unpopped through 3 or 4 times. The Presto lived up to other reviews: it put everything in the bowl and the first (and only pass) popped almost all the corn.Amazon's shipping was very good; it arrived well before the promised date.
