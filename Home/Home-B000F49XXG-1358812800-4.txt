review/summary: The little engine that couldreview/text: This little guy makes a legitimate espresso with crema and produces frothy milk with only a little practice. For the money that achievement is amazing. I've only had it a couple weeks so I have no idea how (or if) it will hold up over time. But at this point, it's a winner! (Not a bad idea to pop for the stand alone tamper and the milk pitcher, which is the perfect size given the wand doesn't give you much room.)
