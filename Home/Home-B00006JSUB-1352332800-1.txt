review/summary: great cast iron!review/text: We got this as a gift from our wedding registry.It's solid, heavy, and it's already taken a great deal of cooking, including stovetop to oven.We were so pleased with the way it cooked, we bought another as a gift to a friend.So far, no cracks, no breaks, no scratches, no defects. Looking forward to seasoning this further!
