review/summary: Not too greatreview/text: We have struggled to find a humidifier that will work on our large bedroom. We hoped that this would be the one. Unfortunately not. It does get the humidity up, but the only way to keep it there is to have it running on high. That is just too loud for us. It drowns out anything. We were trying to get around this by getting the humidity up and then turning the fan to low while we slept. The low fan setting is not bad, but wouldn't want it any louder.That worked OK, but not ideal. Then when I turned it on today it smelled like a wet sweatsock. Here we go again - the filter change fun seen with other models. Less than 2 weeks in and the filter smells. And the replacements aren't cheap. This unit is going back in the box and being sent for return.
