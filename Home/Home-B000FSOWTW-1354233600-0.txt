review/summary: Manual Corkscrew winsreview/text: Was not what I expected. Must have the wine opener position a specific way to ensure it works properly. Cannot just place over the cork and operate. Also, the chiller doesn't not keep wine cool very long. Something things I whether keep old school this is one of them back to the manual corkscrew.
