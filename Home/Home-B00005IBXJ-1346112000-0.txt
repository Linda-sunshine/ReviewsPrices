review/summary: Worked fairly well for a year or so then...........review/text: .....the bottom element stopped heating.. Pretty much useless now.. I have since learned that my oven at 525degrees makes a much better and more consistent pizza.. I do not miss the Presto Pizza oven and the space that it used.. Presto does make Pressure Cookers that are the BOMB..
