review/summary: Works as well as any we have ownedreview/text: Our last Hoover carpet cleaner lasted for over a decade. Well enough pleased with the brand that we repurchased the brand again and are NOT disappointed!Easy to use, even for me and I am not into that sort of thing. Does a great job of lifting up dog accidents, is easy to clean.Not as loud as our last unit either and a bit more compact.Would buy again!
