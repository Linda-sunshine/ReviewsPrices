review/summary: Not happy.review/text: The first time I filled this thing with water it all came out the vent holes on the bottom of the machine. Looking in the bottom of the reservoir I found a 1/4" hole that the water escaped through. The area around the hole looked like someone with a drill purposely put it there. Not sure if this machine is missing a part or if the hole was an accident, either way it renders this machine useless.
