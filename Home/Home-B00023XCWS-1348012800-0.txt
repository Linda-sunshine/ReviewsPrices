review/summary: long lastingreview/text: I got this when my child was a baby. She is ten now. I love hot-pots in general. This one looks nice. Has the easy view feature. You can see the water boil, not just hear it. It has automatic shut off, in case you forget about it. (I often do) I use it for boiling water for tea, instant noodles, coffee, cocoa, and other soups. It is a nice modern convinience. Very much worth the price. Still going strong, through two moves.
