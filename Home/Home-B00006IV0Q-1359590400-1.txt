review/summary: MADE WELLreview/text: I HAVE OWNED 3 FARBERWARE PERCULATORS AND THEY ALL DIDN'T LAST VERY LONG. THE PRESTO IS MADE WELL OF STAINLESS STEEL AND HAS A LIGHT WHEN IT IS DONE. I WOULD HAVE LIKED ON AND OFF SWITCH BUT NOT SO IMPORTANT. THE COFFEE GETS REALLY HOT UNLIKE THE FARBERWARE. THE ONLY BAD THING I CAN SAY ABOUT IT IS IT IS VERY LOUD WHEN IT STARTS TO PERK, THEN GETS QUIETER. HOPE IT LASTS LONGER THEN MY FARBERWARES.
