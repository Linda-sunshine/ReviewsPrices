review/summary: Deep Bath!review/text: I bought this little device because I have fallen in love with taking long hot baths. I noticed that I would fill the tub to where I wanted it and then it would start to drain out. I know it drained at least 3&#34; out of the tub each time. With this little gadget the water level stays exactly where I want it. I have the option to fill the tub up to the edge if I want. I did what other reviewers said, and soaked it in hot water before I put it on the first time. I had no problem getting it to stay put! I would recommend this to anyone that wants to regain the 2&#34;-3&#34; of water in the tub. It's amazing what a difference 3&#34; of water make!
