review/summary: same one i found today at the dollar storereview/text: I had to stop at the dollar store today to get a few things and right by the check out I found this. Same exact name and item, for ONE DOLLAR ($1). Complete rip off if you would just drive to the store you can get the same one for way cheaper. It's a good tie holder for a dollar and also if you would like to leave your house, Target has $5 ones every year during Christmas time, just depends on whether or not you will actually leave the couch.
