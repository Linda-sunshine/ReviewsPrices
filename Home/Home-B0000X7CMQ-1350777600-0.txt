review/summary: Adequate, with some serious problemsreview/text: The coffee maker works well enough, but it has too many problems for a unit of this price level:1. The coffee isn't all that hot to begin with and cools rapidly in the supposedly thermal carafe. If you don't plan to drink it all within a half hour or so, you will need a separate, more effective, carafe to keep it in.2. If you do keep it in the stainless steel carafe, you're supposed to use a separate lid to plug the inflow hole. That's an additional component that is easy to misplace. Once you lose it, you're sunk.3. The lid sticks very tightly after the coffee is made, and it has no easy handhold. You can either make your hand bloody trying to open it, or find a dish towel to provide some cushioning. And you have to be pretty strong to get it open.I will use this maker until it needs replacement because having paid for it, I don't want to just discard it. But I would not buy another one, nor would I recommend it to anyone.
