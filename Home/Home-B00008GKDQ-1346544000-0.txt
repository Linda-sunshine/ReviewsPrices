review/summary: Just what we need...awesome!review/text: The griddle is just as described and even better than imagined! It is really well made and have used it several times since it arrived. We have cooked pancakes, bacon, fajitas, and even roasted hot peppers for our favorite salsa! We really love the dual surfaces and fits perfectly on our gas cook top. If you are looking for a great griddle then you wont go wrong buying this bad boy....buy it and enjoy!
