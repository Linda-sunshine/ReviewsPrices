review/summary: Very good!!review/text: After reading the reviews on this site, I decided to take the plunge and purchase the Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite 1000-Watt Juice Extractor. I unpacked and washed it the day that I received it and immediately got my carrots, beets, apples & celery. Carrots were a breeze and the discharged pulp was dry meaning I got all of the carrot juice. Same with the beets. There were chunks of celery and chunks of apple in the discharge container so about 3/4 of those were actually juiced - the rest was waste. The juice was full of foam and fairly pulpy. Not very impressive. I have owned a GreenStar for 6 years. This juicer is slow and apples have to be alternated with carrots or beets to clean out the chute as the pulp overflows in the feed tube if you do not alternate. But the GreenStar makes great juice, very little pulp which I get rid of by running the juice through a screen and about 1/3 of the foam that I got with the Breville Juice Fountain. And the GreenStar has no waste. I will continue to use the Juice Fountain, but mostly for citrus and hard vegetables.UPDATEIt has been a couple of weeks now and I am getting used to the juice fountain. If you crowd your vegetables into the juicer, you have far less waste and a better end product. It is much faster than the Greenstar and much easier to clean. I am changing my original rating from a 2-star to 4-star. If the discharge was drier, I would have no problem with 5 stars.
