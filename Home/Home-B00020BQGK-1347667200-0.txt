review/summary: Handy Little Vacreview/text: I bought this vacuum as a housewarming gift for a friend of mine, and I liked it so much that I am thinking of getting one for myself.It's pros are that it is small and light, has very high suction, has a carpet roller that can be turned on and off, and does not require disposable bags to collect the dust in. It has an extremely long cord so that you can get quite a distance away from your electrical outlet before having to replug it. Best of all, it has a cheerful red color that is nice to have around. It does have a hole in the handle for hanging it when not in use.The fact that it has a cord to power it is a very big plus, because in my research into stick-vacs, apparently those that run on batteries do not generate as much suction as those that connect directly to the wall. Also, you will not run out of juice halfway through your apartment as you would if you had a battery-powered unit.Personally, I prefer a vacuum that has a filter bag to collect the dust in, because I do not like the mast generated by dust and dirt in an open cup. However, since this vacuum was a gift intended for a friend with a low income, I thought that having no need to buy replacement filters was a big plus in this case.Personally, I have a big heavy vacuum in my apartment that I just hate to drag out and push around. It does a great job of cleaning my carpets, but I think this little stick-vac would be ideal for cleaning up smaller messes.
