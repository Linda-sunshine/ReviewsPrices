review/summary: Serious Design Flawreview/text: I just started using and so far like it, and glad I bought it. There are however two very obvious design flaws. The maximum size of 12 ounce output, is the minimum size of coffee that they sell at almost every place that sells coffee nowadays. Could this be a clue that people want larger output? A quick check here on Amazon shows that the average travel mug is 16 oz and larger. Could this be a clue of what people want? Of course I happen to be one of the millions that own a travel mug, and like most, it will not fit the machine. Looking at all the travel mugs sold here you will note that if they made the area 1 inch higher most mugs would fit. Come on engineers, wake up! Because of the poor design, I have to output to a coffee cup and then poor into the travel mug. I would bet a lot of others are having to do the same. Now, I have to buy a new travel mug. Open for suggestions.
