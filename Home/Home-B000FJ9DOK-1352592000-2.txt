review/summary: seal falls out of capreview/text: This is a great Thermos .. for a few weeks... then the ring seal will fall out of the cap, and might get lost (I haven't found mine yet) The seal between the cap and the stainless bottle is set in the cap without any retaining mechanism .. except, perhaps glue? .. It will come loose in time, and fall out of the cap. If you don't see that happen, the next time you use the bottle, it will dribble all over you. I have only used it with water & some ice ... never washed it, just rinsed it out. It was made in China, unlike other Thermos bottles, so that might be a factor. I've emailed Thermos to see if I can get another ring seal .. in the meantime, I'm ordering another bottle from Amazon... and will keep an eye on the seal status .. now that I know what to watch for .. so, if you buy one, always check to see if the seal is still in the cap ... and you will be happy with this product.
