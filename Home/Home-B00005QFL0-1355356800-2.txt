review/summary: Great appliancereview/text: I have started making our own sandwich bread with this because it is just so easy. Just add the ingredients and turn it on! Come back in 4 hours, and you have hot and TASTY bread with the included recipes. I have used the dough function as well for a family recipe that is several generations old. It comes out excellent every time.
