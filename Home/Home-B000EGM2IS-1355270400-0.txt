review/summary: Junkreview/text: Hi. I bought this hotshot as a gift for my parents a year ago for Christmas. I dont usually write reviews but this deserved one. I have recently moved about an hour and a half away from my parents but once a week stay overnight at their house because my office is there...I work remotely.In any event, myself and my dad are the only two people who have used this. No kids, no excess use. It is used 1-2 times per day.First gripe: You cannot fit a coffee cup in it unless it is a very small one. Soda can height not a chance. Try almost cutting it in half.Second gripe: In November the button broke off to dispense the hot water.In less than a year the product is junk. Not impressed.
