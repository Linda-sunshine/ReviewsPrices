review/summary: Good appliancereview/text: Shipped quickly and arrived in good shape. Easy to clean and use. Really like the mug that came with the unit. Only issue and it is minor was the strainer. Tended to be a challenge to get clean and there was occasional minor spillage of coffee grinds, very little and it did not affect the taste or quality of the coffee.
