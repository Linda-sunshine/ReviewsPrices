review/summary: Finally, Deep Bath Waterreview/text: This product does exactly what it is supposed to do. It feels like it's made out of soft silicone rubber and it seals very well. I am impressed with it because it even fits over my big old square overflow drain. I no longer have to hold a washcloth against the hole while I bathe. Hooray!
