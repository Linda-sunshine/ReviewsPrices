review/summary: Thank You Hooverreview/text: Oh my gosh... I have four kids, three cats, and a dog -- one of the cats with a digestive, barfing problem. I have spent thousands on professionally cleaning my carpets. I was a bit skeptical when I bought this machine. I chose it because it received high ratings from a consumer magazine. I have fallen in love with it! It cleaned up not only the current cat barf and felt-tip marker spots, but also remnants of the old spills that the spray spot cleaner had left behind. It was easy to use, about as loud as my vacuum, and easy to clean up after use. I cleaned two rooms and only had to empty the dirty (filthy, nasty, disgusting) water tank twice. I had no leaks. The only problem I had was my own darn fault -- I didn't fully seat the dirty water tank back on when I emptied it. If you don't see water sucking back up in the cleaner after you've emptied the tank, you need to re-seat the tank.
