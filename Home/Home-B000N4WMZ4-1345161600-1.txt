review/summary: Fantastic Pan - Need Recipesreview/text: I really love this pan. It now comes with a stainless knob so it can go in the oven without needing a new knob. I made braised short-ribs in here, and it made a wonderful dish. I did, though, have trouble with the wine staining the interior of the pot. Can anyone recommend a good cookbook made specifically for enamel cast iron pans?Thanks.
