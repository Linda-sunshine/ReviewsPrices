review/summary: Makes great coffee and keeps it hot!review/text: My husband and I have had several different models of thermal coffee makers and none were as good as this. Most of them tended to drip from the spout each time we filled our cups, but what we also didn't realize was the coffee wasn't very hot. It seemed fine at the time until we got this Cuisinart and there was no more dripping, the coffee itself was much hotter and it stayed hot a lot longer after brewing. When we have to replace it, we will definitely get the same thing.
