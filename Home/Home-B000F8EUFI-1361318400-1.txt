review/summary: less than 8 months and does not work properlyreview/text: I have had this machine since June 2012. First when I got it I was amazed of how it works. It was very powerful. In the past 2 months, it has not been functioning properly. After the suction of a place, when you lift it or move it, it rejects(throw) what it was vacuumed. It is like moving dirt from one place to another.I am really upset about it because I have not used it that much since I live in a very small apartment with no kids.
