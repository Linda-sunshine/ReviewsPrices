review/summary: Best thing I could of purchasedreview/text: I was that person that would go buy a ton of water bottles because my tap water isn't the greatest. It got extremely annoying since I lived in apartments and to lug those water bottles up the stairs got old really fast. Finally i wanted something that i could pour my tap water into and would filter it. This thing works like a charm! It taste like bottled water and you don't get that taste of tap water. It comes out very clean and it fits perfectly in your refrigerator. Highly recommended!!! Also the filter last about 2 1/2 months and then you need to replace it. You will tell right away if it needs to be replaced because the water won't taste like its been filtered.
