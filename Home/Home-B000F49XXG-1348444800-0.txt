review/summary: Worked great for a year then stopped workingreview/text: I hadn't bothered to check other reviews until today. My machineworked beautifully for about a year and then the problems began.Drip too slow, coffee tastes subpar, etc. I tried cleaning andall the other "remedies" suggested in the manual, but nothinghelped. Going to try another espresso maker. I guess you getwhat you pay for.
