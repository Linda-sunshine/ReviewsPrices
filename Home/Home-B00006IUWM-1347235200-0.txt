review/summary: Works like it shouldreview/text: After trying several manual and electric knife sharpeners, I finally found one that works like it's supposed to. I have very hard water and use a salt softener that tends to dull out my knives rather quickly. The hand held manual sharpeners I had tried just didn't seem to do the trick. Could be that I didn't know how to use them properly, but with the Presto, you don't really have to. Just follow the simple directions and watch as a nice sharp edge returns to your once dull blade. Couldn't be easier. Suctions cups stick it to your counter while sharpening, keeping it nice and still. Just takes a few minutes, and your done. Good buy.
