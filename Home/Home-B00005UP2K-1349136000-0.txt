review/summary: A must have for anyonereview/text: Two months before my wedding in 2007 I moved in with my now husband and wanted to cry every time I had to make something without a mixer (I grew up with one in my house). Luckily grandma came though and we got this for our wedding and we use it all the time. We of course use it to bake, mix meatloaf, knead bread, make dips, etc. We also have the pasta extruder, juicer, and meat grinder attachments. I love them all! Use this all the time! Love the colbalt blue, it matches my dishes but is not an eyesore on my counter.
