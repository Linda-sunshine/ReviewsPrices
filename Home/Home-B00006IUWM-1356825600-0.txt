review/summary: Be careful if you are on blood thinners!review/text: I bought this item back in August. I was not looking for a sharpener but Amazon advertised it along with two knife purchases and the reviews got my attention.I prefer to sharpen my knives the old fashioned way. I take them to a professional knife sharpener. However, this is irritating and time consuming.....and kinda expensive.The Presto arrived promptly, well packaged and appeared new. Instructions were clear. Learning curve was fairly short and simple. Although I did not expect this item to do as well as the professional, it does. Now, every knife in the house is super, scary sharp. I have sharpened old knives, cheap knives, expensive knives, meat cleavers and a large hunting knife. Very dull or thicker knives may take multiple passes so be patient.You cannot sharpen serrated knives, ceramic knives and whatever you do, do NOT attempt to sharpen very lightweight, thin bladed knives in the Presto. Knives like those thin, cheap paring knives. The Presto will eat it. This requires delicate surgery. Fine point needle nosed wire pliers work best for a bladectomy.In October, when I got the snail mail reminder from the professional to sharpen before the holidays, I tossed it in the garbage. The Presto 8800 is well worth the price and exceeded my expectations.
