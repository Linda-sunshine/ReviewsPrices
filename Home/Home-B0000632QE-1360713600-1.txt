review/summary: An old friendreview/text: found again! I lost my old Borner in a move, and none of my other kitchen appliances can replace it--not even my Cuisanart. If you're looking for a slicer/shredder that will never leave your counter-top, this is it. And cleanup is as simple as running hot water over it when you've finished your task, making it simple and time saving. The best mandoline I've found for the price, or even for a higher price tag.
