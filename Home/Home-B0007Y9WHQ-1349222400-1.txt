review/summary: MUST HAVEreview/text: Just wanted to share in case my experience of my new slicer helps others make a good decision. I went raw about 9 months ago and finding a slicer that really works was harder than you'd think. I stopped by all the kitchen stores in town and nobody had what I was looking for. I even had my best friend purchase one for me. ( the small round stacking kind) It works but not well! So I jumped on Amazon and ordered the World Cuisine. I read a lot of the reviews and wondered what in the world the lady was talking about when she said it wasted the center piece of everything she sliced. I laugh almost every time I use it because her idea of waste was my dog's gain. She loves the center piece and it is seriously only a quarter of an inch thick.My daughter stopped by and was so amazed with the masterpieces I was creating we ran in an ordered one for her too! :)
