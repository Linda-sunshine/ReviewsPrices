review/summary: Preforms consistently!review/text: My husband suffers from Menderes disease. He has to be on a very strict low sodium diet. Most of the baked good products from super markets are loaded with sodium. I have to make all homemade breads,rolls,and doughs. I bought a zojirushi first and was very disappointed. After extensive research I decided to buy the Panasonic sd-yd250. I have had it for over a month and use it almost daily. I am so pleased with its performance. Always consistent and the recipes are fantastic. I highly recommend this machine.
