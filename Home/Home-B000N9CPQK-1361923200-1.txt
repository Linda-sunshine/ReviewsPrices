review/summary: Love it.review/text: I just got my air purifier yesterday and unpacked it this morning. I am switching my cats to a different food and it seems to be upsetting their tummies and their poo really smells right now. My house smelled so bad this morning. I have a different kind of air purifier going in the laundry room where their cat box is, with a specialty odor filter. Doesn't help but I plugged this in and set it on high in the living room. I went into the bathroom to do my hair and when I came out, there wasn't even a little poo smell anymore. I love this so much that I ordered another for the laundry room. Maybe I can stop the smells at their source. Love it.
