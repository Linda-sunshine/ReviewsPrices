review/summary: Keurig B70 Platinumreview/text: Purchased the B70 as a replacement for the B40 which had recently died after less than a year. I'm not a coffee drinker myself, but my wife uses it at least once (sometimes multiple times) per day. Four months into it, it keeps going strong and have had no issues. My wife is very pleased not only with its performance, but also with the aesthetics. Highly recommend this one over the more "entry level" brewing systems.
