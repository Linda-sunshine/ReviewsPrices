review/summary: Broke after about a year's usereview/text: I love a clean carpet and since the vacuum cleaner I currently have works fine, I decided to buy a carpet shampooer/steamer. l went to my local store and bought Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge which worked ok, not as good as my old platinum, but it did the job. Low and behold the machine worked for about a year and the suction mechanism stopped working! I have a fairly big house, but I am the only person living in it and I mainly used it on the high traffic areas. I wear no shoes nor do I allow anyone to wear shoes in my home and these 2 machines just gave up on me. I am extremely disappointed.I will probably not buy any more hoover products ever again.
