review/summary: very satisfied!review/text: One year ago I watched &#34;Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead&#34; documentary on the recommendation of my teenage daughter. It inspired me to start juicing. We bought a cheap centrifugal juicer, which worked okay (didn't want to invest much $ in case juicing turned out to be a passing fad for us). Then a few months later, Macy's had a good sale on the Breville centrifugal juicer, and since we were still gung-ho on juicing, I decided to buy that one and keep the old one as a backup.The Breville works very well for juicing just about everything (apples, carrots, kale, cukes, cabbage, blueberries, cranberries) and I was satisfied with it and would not have looked any further. But I wanted to try growing my own wheatgrass for juicing and I read how the slow masticating juicers were better for softer greens. I had my eye on the Hurom Slow Juicer for a few months but $300 (Costco price) was too much to spend for me (couldn't justify that purchase since after all I already had 2 juicers! good grief)When I saw the Omega J8005 on Amazon's Gold Box Deals one day a few weeks ago for $159 I could not resist. Since I juice every single morning, and since it was half the price of the other one, I jumped on the deal.I am very happy with the Omega. I use it every morning. I have been adding some home-grown wheatgrass to my daily mixture of fruits and veggies (wheatgrass has a strong, almost nasty taste on its own). The pulp from the Omega is drier than the Breville, so I am getting more juice out of the produce. It's also much quieter. It makes a pleasantly satisfying &#34;crunching&#34; sound when carrots or celery go through it. The pieces are smaller on the Omega, so it's easier to fit into the top rack of dishwasher or do a quick hand wash. The only drawback of the Omega is the need to cut the produce into smaller pieces, but it's worth it.Highly recommend!
