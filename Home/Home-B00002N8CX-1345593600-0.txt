review/summary: Light weight with a lot of powerreview/text: I bought this because I am tired of lugging around my Dyson up and down steps. I have wood floors on my first level with a couple oriental rugs....I really like this sweeper...does a great job on the carpet and easy to manuever under chairs and cabinets.
