review/summary: Exceeds my Expectations!review/text: I had originally purchased the 910 model fearing that this model would not fit on my stove. The problem was that I could not find concrete measurements from the top of the canner to the bottom as I have a low height hood above my stove.I was also concerned about using this on a glass top stove, as you will read that the manufacturer explicitly claims that it is not to be used on glass stoves for various reasons. If you search why, some places you will find that the weight could crack the stove, others say that the heat sensor below the glass will create an uneven amount of heating from cycling etc. I have found neither concepts to be the case.After I purchased the 910 model and used it successfully on my glass top stove, I returned it to Amazon and took a chance on the 921 model. WOW. It is a heavy, massive son of a gun and of course reflects another fine example of American manufacturing, as opposed to the chincy chicom manufactured canners.. Thankfully it fits perfectly on the stove.Since the canner arrived, I have put it through heavy use. Every time I use the canner, it is filled to capacity of 7 quart size jars or 12 wide mouth pint size jars. The canner works like a dream and I am confident that it will last my family generations. So, even on a glass top stove (GE Spectra model), it works well and isn't damaging the stove. I figured with the massive sized pots of meat sauce that I make, there can't be that much difference in the weight load my stove is usually exposed to.One unintended consequence of the canner as we progress through the winter, I may be able to cut down my heating bill by the amount of heat from steam that is dispersed in the room lol.
