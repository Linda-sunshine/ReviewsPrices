review/summary: Eh... there's a reason it's the cheapest on Amazonreview/text: If I had more to spend on a coffee grinder at the time, I would have purchased a better-quality one, but for $13... hey, it does its job. It takes much longer than other grinders to get a really fine ground; I've found that shaking it a lot while it grinds seems to help. Definitely don't recommend it if you intend on using it mostly or only to do really fine grinding. I'm also perpetually afraid that yanking out the cord like that is going to eventually break it. It's nice that it has that storage function built in but I much preferred my last one, where you could just wind the cord around the bottom instead of yanking it out and twisting it back inside the machine.
