review/summary: Follow the directions and customer reviews!review/text: After moving into my new apartment I was excited to get everything unpacked and set up right away. Installing this shower caddy took seconds and in no time I had all the shower items in their proper place... for a day. The first time I used the shower and the moisture level increased the caddy peeled from the tile and crashed into the tub.I'm happy to say it's now been over a month and the re-mounted caddy has not budged at all. I followed the directions (and the suggestions from other reviewers) and waited for the adhesive strips to cure before installing the caddy. So thank you to 3M for providing a second set of strips but take my advice - be patient! Clean the surface with the alcohol wipe. Let it dry. Mount the caddy with the strips pressing against the wall for 15 seconds. Remove the caddy by carefully pulling in an upward direction (not away from the wall). Apply a solid even pressure on the strips for 30 seconds. Allow them to cure on the wall for 1 or 2 days (and preferably, do not use the shower for the first 12 hours). Once they are good and cured then place the caddy back in position and evenly distribute the weight of your toiletries between both baskets.Best of luck!
