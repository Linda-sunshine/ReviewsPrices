review/summary: No more nose bleeds, thanks to this humidifierreview/text: My wife is 6 months pregnant, and out of blue she started getting nose bleeds almost every morning. I looked up in amazon for a humidifier that is simple yet functional and of course reasonably priced. After going through bunch of reviews I decided to go with this, and I'm glad I did. We have been using this since 2 weeks every night in our bedroom, it produces cool mist with a low hissing sound, we use it in its lowest setting and even that is enough. Thanks to this product, my wife doesn't have to breathe dry air in this cold winter anymore.The only reason why it misses a star is because of its looks:)
