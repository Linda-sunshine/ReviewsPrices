review/summary: I seriously LOVE these knives.review/text: I had to replace my other set because they broke and fell apart. I shopped online a while to find a good set that is not too expensive and these are great! When I compared them to the ones I'm giving away the quality is unbeatable. They are thick and very sharp not to mention they look great on my counter! The scissors could have been made better (did not like them) so I kept the ones from the other set and replaced them. I STILL gave this set 5 stars because they really are good. Another set I have had for 5 years came from IKEA and they are still going strong.. let's see how long these last.
