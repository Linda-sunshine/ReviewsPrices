review/summary: Not 8 cup!review/text: We bought this Kettle to fill our 8 cup Brown Betty Tea Pot, which we use every morning.The description says that it heats 8 cups of water, but we have found that it is actually 6 cups to the fill line on the inside.Pros:- It is warm to the touch after the water heats. The kettle we had before, a Krups, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ES7I8A/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 , was HOT when it was done. Burned fingers were not uncommon when we first started using it.- Heats quicklyCons:- Does NOT hold 8 cups. We measured the number of cups of water it holds up to the &#34;Fill&#34; line and it is only 6 cups.- Blows our GFCI circuit on a regular basis.- Pours awfully. We always end up with a puddle on the counter every time we try to fill the tea pot.Going to shelve this kettle and buy another Krups. That one worked much better in my opinion. Only switched due to the cooler exterior after heating that it touts.
