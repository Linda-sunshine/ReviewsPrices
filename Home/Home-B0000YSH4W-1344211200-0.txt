review/summary: Good book, horrible endingreview/text: What might have been a decent book, was all killed in the end. I am not sure how anyone gave this book 5 stars. It does not seem like a completed book at all, the ending completely left you hanging. I thought at first that it was the first set in a trilogy, only to find out that the subsequent books are not actual follow-up books but rather books with seperate characters, plots and societies. How disappointing! Its like the author got bored with writing the book and decided to just end it. Save yourself some time and skip this book.
