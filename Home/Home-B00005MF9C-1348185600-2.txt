review/summary: Defective Right Out Of The Boxreview/text: Black and Decker should never put their name on this item.The best thing about it is the Mug. Right out of the box, defectiveswitch and no light or heat. Now I have to go through the pain ofpacking and returning while I am away from home.I have had several of the older white models for at least ten yearsand they never failed; only replaced because they were stained.
