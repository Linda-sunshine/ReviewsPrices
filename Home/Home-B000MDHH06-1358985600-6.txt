review/summary: Great product!!review/text: This smaller Breville juicer is perfect for me and my small kitchen. I didn't want to buy an expensive juicer because I wasn't sure how committed I would be to juicing. This juicer works perfectly, and the container, which holds about 3 cups, makes enough juice for two mornings. I only have to make juice every other day and have tried combos of spinach, other vegetables and most fruits. Kale didn't work well but I'm not complaining. It's easy to operate, easy to clean. If you pay attention to the manual and follow the instructions, you won't have any problem.
