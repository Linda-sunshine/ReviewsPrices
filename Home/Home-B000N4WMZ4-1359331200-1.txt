review/summary: Great buy!review/text: This was a really great buy, for a bargain price for the particular color - other colors much higher. It compares quite favorably with my old Le Creuset, in fact so favorably, I'd never buy an LC. It cleans up like a dream and is so versatile! I highly recommend Lodge for a dutch oven, the value for the money is unbeatable
