review/summary: Okayreview/text: After some use the beads are no longer as plump as they once were, so the pillow is not as firm. If you don't like the firmness of the new pillow, leave the cover off of it. When using a regular pillowcase, the beads can spread out a little more. However, when using a regular pillowcase, it is VERY difficult to keep this pillow in the pillowcase. It tends to scoot out every night! I ordered it for myself but found out I prefer a waterbase pillow due to a neck injury. However, my husband started using it (when I rejected it) and he loves it! Just goes to prove pillows are a very personal preference!!
