review/summary: Way too loud!review/text: This filter does a pretty good job cleaning air, but we almost never can benefit from that because the noise level is all but unbearable. At the lowest setting, it sounds like other HEPA filters at the medium or high setting. And at the highest setting this pretty much makes conversation impossible in that room. It's like this thing doesn't have a low setting.After this, we got the Holmes HAP756-U True HEPA Allergen Remover for Very Large Rooms. MUCH quieter and still pushes about the same amount of air.
