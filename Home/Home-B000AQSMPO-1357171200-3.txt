review/summary: Expensive junkreview/text: Bought this for the convenience of being able to snap down the lid and have a cup of coffee. Was just informed that they will give me a DEAL on my SECOND replacement for only $80! Bought one for my sister; she just tossed her replacement out of frustration. The definition of convenience IS NOT having to prod the thing to make sure you don't end up with a cup full of grounds every morning! Guess there must be a reason for the class action suits they are in the midst of!
