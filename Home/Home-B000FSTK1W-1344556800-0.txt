review/summary: 48 Hours...And Holding!review/text: After super-gluing and silicon-gluing my chrome/ suction cup shower caddy more than a few times (and it still fell off the wall), I bought a similar replacement. After three days and multiple suction cup failures (with resultant shampoo bottle leaks and other messiness) and a test proving that a standard suction shower caddy can't even stay on the shower wall with merely a sponge (total time: 10 minutes), I decided it was time to go to the next level. The Command shower caddy is fairly industrial-looking, the directions (which I always ignore) actually do need to be read, and are sort of confusing, but the system allows for mistakes that you can fix, as long as you figure it out before affixing the adhesive strips to the shower wall. End result: for the last 48 hours, after the 24-hour recommended adhesive curing process, the Command caddy has held two half-empty 16 oz. shampoo bottles, two 8-ounce bottles of body wash, an 8 oz. screw-top jar of deep conditioner, and two bath puffs. And I haven't heard any middle-of-the night clatters as the contents of a shower caddy spill on the bathtub floor.Thank you, 3M. I love your Minnesota ingenuity!
