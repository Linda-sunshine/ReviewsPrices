review/summary: Great product for the money.review/text: This is a very good hand vac to have because it is powerful. I got one for the stairs and the treadmill in my home. My beau tends to drag his feet while on the treadmill leaving lots of bits of rubber on and around it. The traditional vac we have is powerful but has no potential for accessories so getting a hand vac was a must. This thing easily picked up the rubber, dust, and lint on/around the treadmill.It was very good on the stairs, pulling out dirt that I would have sworn wasn't there. Because I got tired of lugging the traditional vac on the stairs, I anxiously waited a couple of days to get this Eureka on my doorstep. I immediately opened the box and used it. Very good product overall. I didn't find it to be overly noisy, actually it seems quieter than my traditional vacum and I didn't need earplugs as one commenter suggested. Also, this vacum has two crevice tool options that come in handy. It's very useful and easy to use.
