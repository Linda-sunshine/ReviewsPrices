review/summary: Surprisingly useful for such a cheap plastic itemreview/text: This rack is made out of cheap looking plastic and is not the most aesthetically pleasing but I have used two of them (loaded to capacity with ties and belts) for over a year and neither has broken or shown any wear. It is actually a great way of organizing numerous ties in a very small space. It can even hold belts but you have to use multiple legs to support each buckle if you choose to go this route. This item is very cheap but effective and sturdy if used as intended.
