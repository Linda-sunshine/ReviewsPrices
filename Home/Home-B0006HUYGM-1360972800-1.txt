review/summary: strong suctionreview/text: I love love love this vacuum! It is so easy to use... compact...well designed..and has amazing suction. My stairs have not looked this good since we moved in. The cord is very long which makes it nice for stretching across a room or using up and down steps. This was by far the best, simple product I have bought in a really long time. I'm very happy with this purchase. I expect it to last for a long time, but when the time comes to replace it, I will purchase another one of the same!
