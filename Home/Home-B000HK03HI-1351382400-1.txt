review/summary: BEST CAN OPENER EVERreview/text: This is a really good value. It's worth every penny. It's kid friendly too! I love the lock feature. Smooth, sturdy, and stylish. If Pixar ever makes a film about talking home appliances, this model should be the inspiration for the "can opener" role.
