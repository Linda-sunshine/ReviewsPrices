review/summary: No buzzerreview/text: Clock even has molded into the blaster a setting for "buzzer". All it has is an extremely quiet beep. Like beep..... beep beep.......... beeep beep beep beep.. a beep once or twice after 20 seconds isn't doing anything to wake me up. It ends up being shut off like 50 times before I even notice it is actually an alarm to wake me. If you need a clock it's fine and sets itself. If you need an alarm to wake you for work then look elsewhere.
