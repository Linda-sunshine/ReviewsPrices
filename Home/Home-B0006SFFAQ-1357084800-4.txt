review/summary: Cuisinart DCC-1200BCH Brew Central 12 Cup Programmable Coffeemaker...review/text: I had another one just like this and it last 8 years. When it wore out I went on line to Amazon and found another one. It was cheaper than my original one. We just love this coffee pot. The one special feature I love is the cleaning cycle. It let you know when the pot needs cleaning. No surprises. I highly recommend this pot.
