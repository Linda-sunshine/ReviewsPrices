review/summary: Looks cheap, but cleans okreview/text: I had to return the first vacuum Amazon sent me because it was clearly used and defective. I was a bit apprehensive about receiving the second one and was disappointed at first. The vacuum seems cheap and even the second one did not look brand new. My husband insisted that once you return an item, you never receive a brand new one as a replacement, so it is possible we got again a refurbished item. We tried it once, it seemed to clean ok, but it is still hard for me to love this vacuum. I guess for this price you can't expect anything fancy, but even looking at the vacuum it has an old and cheap feeling.
