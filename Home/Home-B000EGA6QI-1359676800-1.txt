review/summary: Why did I wait so long?review/text: I have wanted this for so long, but put off buying it as I had other gadgets that did similar things. The ease of the hand blender is understated. I puree vegetables, smoothies, shakes and soups. There are also more uses than I imagined, and now I can not understand how I lived without it, especially seeing as I made all my son's baby food.Well worth it.
