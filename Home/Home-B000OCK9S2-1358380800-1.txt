review/summary: Blue light too strong ~review/text: The product is usable, but have to cover that blue light every night. Even sleep experts advise against blue light in one's room while trying to sleep.Also, a few too many bells and whistles, so it's hard to figure out. The sounds are good, but too many alarm choices -- &#34;first&#34;, &#34;second&#34;, etc. All that's necessary is one alarm, and maybe a snooze button.~
