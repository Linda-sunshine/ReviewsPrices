review/summary: Very Pleased!review/text: I have been using this machine for 3 months now and it makes great coffee!. Very pleased!It is important that you turn it on ahead of time to warm up, maybe 10min and then it makes great foam on top.I also switched to Greek coffee, which I found in an International store (1 lb for $8) and the coffee is just amazing!Definitely recommended!
