review/summary: Reliable, waterproof, perfect for every day usereview/text: Although I find the sleeve to be totally useless, the thermometer is fast, accurate and most of all waterproof so no more foggy screen! The price is right, the product is well constructed. Taylor is known for reliability and this is no exception.I would highly recommend it as a useful gift for yourself or someone that &#34;has everything&#34;.
