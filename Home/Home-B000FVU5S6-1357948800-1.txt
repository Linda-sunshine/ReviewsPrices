review/summary: Egyptian Cotton?? I Think Not.review/text: These sheets are extremely stiff and rough. After numerous washings and ultimately soaking in vinegar overnight they became somewhat soft enough to use. They are unlike any Egyptian cotten sheets I have ever owned, and I am skeptical that there are what they are advertised to be . They were not worth $59. I regret my purchase.
