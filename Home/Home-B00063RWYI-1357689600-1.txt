review/summary: Great Dutch Ovenreview/text: I bought this Dutch Oven to make Artisan Bread. Mix 1/2 tsp. yeast, 3 cups flour, and 2 tsp sea salt in large mixing bowl.Add l 1/2 cups warm water and mix well. It will look like a rough shaggy mess. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit for 12-18 hours on the counter. Do not refrigerate. Dough will be quite sticky. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Place your empty covered dutch pot into the oven for 30 minutes. While oven and pot are heating, place the dough on a heavily floured surface and shape it into a ball. Cover again with plastic wrap. Remove the hot covered pot from the oven. Pick up your dough ball and place it in the pot. Cover it and return to oven for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and bake another 15 min. Place bread on cooling rack until completely cooled. Once you have tried the original recipe, start experimenting with adding in flavor like rosemary, roasted garlic, lemon or cheeses. Very easy and good!
