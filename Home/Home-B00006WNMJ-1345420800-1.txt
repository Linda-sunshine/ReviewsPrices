review/summary: So much better than PURreview/text: We are so pleased with the faucet Culligan Water Filter. It's easy to install, takes up a lot less room than other filters, much less expensive (filter unit and replacements)and works very well. Instead of a red/green light system, you will need to estimate the time the filter needs to be replaced (200 gallons). I use two gallons of purified water a day, so in three months I'll replace the filter---no big deal.
