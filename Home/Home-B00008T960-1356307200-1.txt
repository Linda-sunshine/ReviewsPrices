review/summary: Works Great!review/text: I had not heard of these before trying some new recipes and it was mentioned on a blog for getting better results when making cookies. I ordered one and just love it. You put it right on your baking sheet and bake the cookies on it and it's nearly impossible to burn anything, something I am famous for. You can also roll dough out on them. I bought another one so now I have two to make it easier when doing a big batch of cookies especially this time of year.
