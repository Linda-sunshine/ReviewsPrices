review/summary: Awesome little vac!review/text: I bought this to keep in the garage to vacuum both of my vehicles and it has so far been great! Incredible power and performance for such a small unit. Small and easy to store. Power cord has good length. Hose could be longer but still extends to an acceptable length. When I use long attachments(from previously owned vacs)hose length is a non-issue.I have two Dyson vacuums for my house and was considering buying one of the portable ones but decided on this Eureka instead. So glad I did! Saved at least $150 on this purchase by not getting the handheld Dyson. Buy it and you'll love it!
