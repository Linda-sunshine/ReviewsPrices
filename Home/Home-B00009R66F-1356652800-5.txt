review/summary: Pulled black water from the carpetreview/text: After living in a home for a year, we decided it was time to clean the carpets for Christmas. The carpets in the rental are brown, so we really didn't notice them getting dirtier (except for some stains), so I was surprised when I pulled black water out of the carpet with this thing. It was amazing! The carpets look like a much nicer shade of brown now. The wand on this thing is Amazing for stains where you don't want to clean the whole carpet, and the smaller upholstery brush is great for couches (even microfiber!). Highly recommend, would buy again!
