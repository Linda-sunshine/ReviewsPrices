review/summary: Great tasting waterreview/text: First of note, I live in a place where the water is very hard, so these filters have a lot of work to do normally. I had a brita pitcher before this and it improved the water taste a lot though it was still a bit hard tasting compared to reverse osmosis or whatever. The filters for these are a step above the brita ones, they make the water taste great and seem to last a good while to.It doesn't filter too fast, but the spigot design makes up for that. I also love the spigot design, so you can use the pitcher without waiting for all the water to filter out. The brita pitcher and had would spill water everywhere if the top reservoir still had water in it, so you had to take it out temporarily if you didn't want to wait.
