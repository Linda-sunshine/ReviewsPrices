review/summary: Good for the price.review/text: Nice looking. Lots of varied sounds as indicated.The Contrast button for the display doesn't seem todo a thing though and it is rather bright with all theroom lights off. I keep a cloth over it so the light doesn'tdisturb me! Regrettable. Otherwise the clock is fine....
