review/summary: almost perfect...review/text: Great set of knives and accessories. Super sharp and they really get the job done. I would have given this product 5 stars but the largest of the knives was missing a stud at the end of the handle which makes the blade a little loose. Simple things like that are crucial to customer satisfaction, it kind of downgrades the company and product because it makes you wonder about quality control. If it wasnt for that unpleasant surprise I would be completely satisfied...like I said in my title...almost perfect.
