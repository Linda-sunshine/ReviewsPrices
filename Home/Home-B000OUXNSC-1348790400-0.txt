review/summary: Very pleased, they work great.review/text: All my mattresses and box springs get zippered covers. I then like to put a good quality, comfortable mattress pad over the top and then the sheets from there.I bought one to try on the bed, and then bought another as I was pleased with the first since I have 2 twin beds.For the price, I think this is a good value. It fit well too. Washable. No problems.
