review/summary: Food for thought...review/text: I'm about to go buy this based on other reviews.One thought to many other reviewers, and to readers....We Should be unplugging all appliances whenever we can (obviously not the fridge! haha!) to 1) save energy, 2) decrease chance of electrical fire.Maybe they left out the on/off switch on purpose...:)
