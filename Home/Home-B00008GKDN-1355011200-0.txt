review/summary: Gritty Surface, Uneven heatreview/text: I SO wanted to love this pan. But alas, it infuriates me every time I use it. The gritty surface that has not gone away, in spite of use and seasoning, makes eggs, pancakes, etc stick terribly. When used for things like grilled cheese, the center portion over the flame heats WAY hotter than the edges of the pan and the sandwiches brown completely uneven. I hate it. Glad it was cheap so I'm not out that much money. Should have returned it. Too late.
