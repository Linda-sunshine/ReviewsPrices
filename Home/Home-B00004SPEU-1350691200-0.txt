review/summary: French Press Yes -- Espresso Noreview/text: This little machine is reliable and gives a nice coarse to medium grind which suits the french press. However, read the owner's manual -- you'll see one sentence in small print that the manufacturer does NOT recommend it for making espresso grind. Amazon would do well to be sure that Krups 203-42 does not appear among grinders suitable for espresso. Burr grinders.
