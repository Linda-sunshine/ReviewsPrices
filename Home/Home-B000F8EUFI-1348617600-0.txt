review/summary: Great So Far.review/text: I've been using this vacuum for a couple of months now and I'm very satisfied with it. It picks up dirt well and is easy to clean/empty. Some reviewers have mentioned that it's exhaust vent is in the front and will blow debris around on hard surfaces but this hasn't really been an issue for me as I mostly use it for carpeted areas.
