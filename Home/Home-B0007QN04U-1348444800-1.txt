review/summary: Best mixer everreview/text: Try this mixer and you will never be satisfied with any other mixer. It has a controlled start and a mixing shield that eliminates the "explosions" that you can get with other mixers. If you like to mix more that one recipe of something at a time, especially bread, this is the mixer for you. It has the power to do any mixing job but it also has the lower speeds for when you need that type of mixing. This is our second KitchenAid . . . our first one is twenty years old and still perfectly good but we just gave it to one of our sons so that we would finally have an excuse to buy a new one with more power and greater capacity (even if we didn't really need it.)
