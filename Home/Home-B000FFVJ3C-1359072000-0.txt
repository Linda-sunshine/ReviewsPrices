review/summary: Works great until the trays warpreview/text: I found the ease of use and the design of the Nesco FD-75A dehydrator to be pretty high. I was able to make a batch of thicker cut jerky after 6-7 hours of use. The temperature setting is easy to use and the top of the machine has common dehydrating temps listed for various items. The folding handle on the top of the machine makes it convenient to open the machine and see what's going on; it folds down as well.My main issue and the reason why this review nets 2 stars is that I had one tray warp substantially during the dehydrating cycle (first time using the machine). This isn't from washing in a hot dish washer, this is from just using the machine. The warped tray is now concave (dips down towards the middle) and now it rests on the center column of the tray below it. What that means is that there is now a substantial air gap between the edges of the trays. I have photos up as well of this issue.Great to see this hasn't happened to everyone however, it's an issue that's cropped up on myself.
