review/summary: Helps with a full housereview/text: The Insta-Bed queen inflates very easily and quickly. It's quite large and thus requires a good size room for set-up. Perfect, when our Grandkids came to stay, but, when my husband and I gave it a try, we each woke up achy and not well rested. Save it for the young, strong visitors. Still, I think it was a good value and glad to have it on reserve.
