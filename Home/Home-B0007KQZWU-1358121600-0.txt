review/summary: High Quality and Excellent Valuereview/text: Very well pleased with the sturdy construction and professional design (great handles and solid fit on the lids). I have only used three of the pans so far, but they have peformed as expected and I look forward to using them more in the future. I took the time to research cooking with stainless steel cookwear before putting them into use. Seasoning the cookwear prior to use and proper cleaning seem to make all the difference in getting the most from SS (although seasoning the pans before use was not mentioned in the instructions). Quality product at a good price = excellent value.
