review/summary: Good value for the price but has another design flawreview/text: I got this iron as a Christmas gift 4 years ago. It worked like a charm for all this time until all of a sudden the power stopped. The swivel ball cord attachment which seemed like a nice feature has a design flaw - once it gets out of whack, that's it. There is no way to open the iron to check the connections, as the iron uses security screws that require special tools to open. So basically it went from great to trash from one day to the next, there wasn't even a warning that anything is wrong with the cord, it just stopped working. I know it's that for sure, because when I plug in and forcefully swivel the ball and push on it the power comes on momentarily.Now I wonder if I want to experiment with another model, or do I just purchase the same unit?
