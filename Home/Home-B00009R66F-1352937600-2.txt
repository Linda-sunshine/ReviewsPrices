review/summary: Cleans Great, But Finicky and Not Durablereview/text: I've had this cleaner for about 15 months now. As many others have noted, it's extremely finicky with its suction. If the seals are not tightly closed, the unit has no suction, and a LOT of things can cause a seal problem. Mine has stopped suctioning several times now; each time it was a different issue causing the problem (all resolved by me with lots of trial and error, no need for a service call yet).On the plus side, it really does clean well. My carpets are cleaned every year, but when I got this machine and started cleaning every month there was a noticeable difference in the brightness of color.What's not so great (in addition to the suction issues) is the durability. One month ago, after it was out of warranty, the release mechanism broke. Not the handle release lever, which might be understandable because it's exposed, stepped on, and generally subject to wear-and-tear, but the part of the chassis that the handle clicks onto to hold the body upright. That's a $60 part, plus shipping, plus labor -- in other words, more than the original cost of the machine. I either buy a new one, or deal with having to prop the steamer up against a wall whenever I'm not holding onto it. For the time being I'm propping, but I can tell that's going to get old really fast.
