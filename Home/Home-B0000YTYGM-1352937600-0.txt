review/summary: Best coffee maker.....everreview/text: No hot plate to burn coffee being left on too long. Brews and the amazing thermos server holds coffee hot for several hours. Sleek design, looks great on the counter. Always has my best brew ready when I am. A good buy and does exactly as it is advertised to do. Dependable, reliable and safer than a hot plate burning all day.
