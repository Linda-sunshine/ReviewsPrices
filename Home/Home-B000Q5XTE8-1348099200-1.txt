review/summary: Not for a long ride sadlereview/text: Complete plastic contraction, witch is okay... but:1. Seat can't go lower & it's impossible to remove rollers to get it a bit down because the pipe will not aloud to (too long).2. Quality of plastic is very solid but the curve of the back-frame is not so comfy.3. Mesh material is stretched already after only 2 months of very light use (I'm 5.7" 125 lbs and sitting upright position most of the time).4. The under-elbow arms are too hard with almost no cushioning.5. Seat made out of thin fabric with a very little cushioning also (I'm using a foam pillow to soften it).Overall = for this kinda discomfort...price must be twice cheaper. About bells & whistles... who needs it, if comfort is THE priority #1 for any type of chair.Just think about; nobody in the whole industry trying to do the comfort of the home/office chair, that would be equal or even close to the comport of the cheapest car driver-seat. Folks can travel in for day's. I wonder why?
