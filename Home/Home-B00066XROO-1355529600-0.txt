review/summary: So far so good.review/text: Only used once but a really nice dispersion of heat, quick warm up and did the trick.Disappointed that it was shipped in the retail box and could have been subjected to a lot of handling damage. The box was only taped closed, no glue on the flaps. Could it be that it was previously opened???
