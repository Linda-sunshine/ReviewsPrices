review/summary: good for small roomreview/text: This humidifier is cute and throws out plenty of steam, but is really only good for a small room. It's easy to put together and keep clean, but think I would buy a bigger unit next time. We were using it in a 10x12 room and it really needed to be almost next to the bed to be really effective.
