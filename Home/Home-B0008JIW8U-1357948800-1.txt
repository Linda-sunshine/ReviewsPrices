review/summary: Love itreview/text: I have had several of these though the years and i love them. My parents drink another kind of coffee and much stronger than I can handle. So this works out great for me and does not take up much room on the counter. Though I stil admit I miss the old Black and Decker coffee pots that used to mount under the Cabinets. It left more work space available and it always made good coffee. This machine makes good coffee as well.
