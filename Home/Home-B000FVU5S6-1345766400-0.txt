review/summary: False Advertisingreview/text: I just got the sheets and I am not happy. These sheets are certainly not sateen and don't even feel like 200 thread count Egyptian cotton. They are rough and scratchy. I like a soft sheet and really was looking for sateen. It's hard to find quality sheets these days and I thought these were a bit pricey, but it would be worth it. Do not believe all those positive reviews. If you have ever slept on 300+ thread count Egyptian cotton sateen sheets before you will be seriously disappointed when these arrive.
