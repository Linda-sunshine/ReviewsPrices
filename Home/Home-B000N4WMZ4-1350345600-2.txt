review/summary: LOve it!review/text: I got this in April for my birthday. I love to cook in it, I love the color. It never goes in the dishwasher. I have another Lodge pot in apple green that is made in China and it had gotten chipped several times.I got them the same time. You can see the pictures on my review of it. This one doesn't seem to chip as easily but I don't use it quite as much as the green one.
