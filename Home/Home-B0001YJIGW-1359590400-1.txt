review/summary: Exactly what I neededreview/text: After being disgusted at the annoying overflow drain in my awesome new tub in my awesome new house I went on a search for a way to get rid of it. This thing popped up in my amazon search. Excitement!! Longing for instant gratification I went to the local Bloodbath and Beyond and picked one up for a couple dollars less than listed here. Took it home, soaked it in the hot water as my tub filled, pushed the little sucker buttons against the garden tub wall and voila!!! Perfect submersion.I made it a point to wash off all my lovely bath water from the cover and let it air dry. So far no gross moldy goo.
