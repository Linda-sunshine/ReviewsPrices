review/summary: Not many options in this price range but product needs improvementreview/text: Hi, I ordered this coffee maker for my camper. I am the only one in my family that drinks coffee and I thought brewing one cup at a time would be helpful. Overall, the coffee pot works so I'm giving it two stars. However, you MUST transfer the finished coffee from the "travel mug" to a different mug as the include mug allows coffee to dribble down your chin and shirt. Also, the mug has virtually no insulating properties (this was evident immediately when I felt the temperature of the mug itself). Unfortunately, I could not find many options for the sub $30 price range. Oh well, you get what you pay for.
