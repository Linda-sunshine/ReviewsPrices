review/summary: Mom loves itreview/text: Got this as a birthday gift for my mom, and her email back to me sounded so much like an Amazon review that I had to post it:"Tried out the slicer tonight. After getting past the fear of slicing my finger off and having to read the directions (I don't do that often) on how to use it, I found out the gadget was amazing! I had purple cabbage from Green Grocer this week. The only thing I could do with it was a slaw. The slicer sliced up the cabbage beautifully in just a few minutes. It was equally successful with the apples and onions I used in the recipe. And it cleaned up and stored so easily! I've found a great accessible spot for it as I think it will become a regular tool in my kitchen."
