review/summary: durable enough for a toddler!review/text: This is a fantastic matress pad. I have it on my three-year-old's bed and it gets washed (and dried on low) at least twice a week without issues. It is holding up great. I was skeptical after the negative reviews, but after a month of heavy use and about 10 dryer sessions, I am planning to buy more for all our beds!
