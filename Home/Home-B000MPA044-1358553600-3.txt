review/summary: Cuisinart CPC-600 1000-Watt 6-Quart Electric Pressure Cookerreview/text: Great pressure cooker! First time we used it we thought, there's no way it could be done already, so we reset the cook time and started it again. Was back to pressure and cooked only 3 minutes. We reset it again with the same 3 minutes. Decided to release the pressure and check our food. OH MY!! It was AMAZING!! Everything was done and cooked to perfection! And very tasty! We bought The Easy Pressure Cooker Cookbook by Diane Phillips and Bob Warden's Slow Food Fast by Bob Warden with the pressure cooker and couldn't be happier. Recipes are easy to follow, tasty and best of all, made to work with the electric pressure cooker. A must buy combination!
