review/summary: glass jugreview/text: Love this glass jug! Yes, as mentioned in other reviews, the handle is a little too close to the body of the jug but it doesn't bother me. You cannot pour with the lid on. It's easy to get the lid to seal once you figure it out. Don't mind that because when it seals it's spill/leak proof and that's what I wanted. Because of the shape and low-profile handle it fits great in the 'fridge. Would definitely buy again.
