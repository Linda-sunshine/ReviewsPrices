review/summary: Aluminum pressure cooker/cannerreview/text: I bought this item to use for canning and cooking. So far, I've only used it as a water bath canner for jars of applesauce. The cooker/canner is extremely heavy-duty and seems very safe due to the screw-down knobs all around the top. The first time I used it as a water bath canner, the inside became very discolored and I had deposits of minerals on my jars of applesauce. I didn't like this, but I contacted the manufacturer and was told that this is normal(!?!) The cooker/canner is still discolored, but the mineral deposits on my jars have become barely noticeable in subsequent batches of water bath canning. Before I bought this item, I wish I had known the limits on pressure canning, such as not being able to cook or can anything with pasta, rice and some types of beans in it. As I read the instruction book, I noticed that pressure cooking some foods requires the use of "pan" to contain the food inside the cooker/canner. I also asked the manufacturer about this. I wrote, "All my pans have handles. I can't use them in the cooker." I was told that they sell a special "pudding pan" used for this purpose. I think this pan should have been included with the cooker. I was tempted to return the cooker/canner after the initial discoloration. But after searching in vain for an equivalent (same size) stainless steel cooker/canner, I decided to keep this one. I don't know if I'll cook with it. I am concerned about aluminum possibly leaching into my food!
