review/summary: Nice Unit - Very Quiet - Affordablereview/text: The heater was as described on Amazon.com. It arrived sooner than expected and there was free shipping. It is quiet and does heat a small room perfectly. I did receive an Owner's Guide. One is not needed to know how to operate the heater but at least it contains warranty information. Some of the reviews state that there is a three year limited manufacture's warranty and it is stated on the box as well. I hope it doesn't break down after 30 days because I'll have to pay $15 to $20 to have it repaired/replaced by the manufacturer. For that price you may as well buy a new unit.
