review/summary: Disappointing and defectivereview/text: I have this exact model at our cabin, but that is an earlier one that was made in the US. It works so perfectly that I decided to leave it there and buy a second one to use at home. The new one was made in China, and I had to stand next to the machine and hold it so that it wouldn't shake right off the counter. It was making horrible noises, but I let it finish because I wanted the loaf of bread I was baking. The bread turned out okay, but the instability and noise were unacceptable, and I would not have been able to program the machine to start up during the night to have fresh bread in the morning. I was extremely disappointed, but it was easy to return it to amazon for a refund. I did not want to take a chance on exchanging it for a replacement that would also have been made in China. The recipe book was also of poor quality compared to the excellent one that came with the old machine. The new one was made of very cheap paper, with hard-to-read tables and questionable quantities that did not match the ones in the original recipe book. Kudos to amazon for an excellent return policy, however!
