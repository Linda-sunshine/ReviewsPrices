review/summary: Works Great! (says my wife =P)review/text: I bought this as a gift for my wife who loves to bake. She absolutely loves it and wants more now. She doesn't know how she ever got by with out it.After reading reviews just to be cautious we "broke it in" by baking it by it's self for 10 minutes at 350. Don't know if that helped but there is no bad taste using it as some have described.Also we had several hand-me-down baking sheets that I guess aren't standard sizes that this won't fit in so be sure to measure the pans you want to use or just buy a new one like I did. From what I read cutting the mat is a big no no.
