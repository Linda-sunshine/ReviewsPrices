review/summary: First 4 months and it's been in for warranty repair twice.review/text: The Hoover Steam Vac works well, when it does work. The problem is that it's prone to breaking -- most recently, the brushes stopped spinning. I took it in for repair under warranty and just got it back today. No sooner had we started using it than it immediately stopped working again: this time the brushes have stopped spinning and the soap isn't dispensed unless you hit the clean surge button. I have done all the things recommended by the manual, cleaning the little screen, the brushes, etc., and nothing gets the brushes going again. This thing is just shoddily made, and I wouldn't recommend taking a chance on it. I don't have any faith that it will last beyond the warranty, so unfortunately I have to say that it's just a waste of money.
