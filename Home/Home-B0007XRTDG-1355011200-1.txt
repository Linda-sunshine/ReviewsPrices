review/summary: Indispensiblereview/text: Several times a year I fry chicken for my family's Sunday dinner and make milk gravy with the drippings. There are, so far, 7 adults and 2 children and they LOVE their fried chicken, so I usually fry the equivalent of 2 1/2 chickens (leaves leftovers.)These pans don't stick (and I'm careful to use only wood or plastic and I do NOT store the cord unit inside the pan!) I can cover the entire kitchen island with newspaper and set up the assembly line for draining the chicken after its buttermilk marinade, seasoning it and then flouring it. Then into the pans and, when the chicken is done, onto racks to drain. These two pans hold all the chicken pieces and cook them evenly (each holds one small can of Crisco which is, of course, the only thing chicken should be pan fried in - and the only time I ever use shortening to cook!) Then one pan is used for gravy.I have TWO of these pans that I bought for this purpose. They are perfect. I also make a sauteed chicken the family loves that these pans come out for when I do a lot. And when I brown chicken pieces for stewed chicken, they will hold a LOT of chicken so I can do it all at once instead of in shifts (my family clearly loves chicken.)The kids just left after their first fried chicken of the cold weather season and my eldest, who tried "Mom's chicken" for his wife and son a couple of weeks ago, hinted that a pan like mine would be appreciated for Christmas. So I am getting him one!The only drawbacks are that you must occasionally flip them over so the handles can be screwed down tight. Other than that, I love these pans.
