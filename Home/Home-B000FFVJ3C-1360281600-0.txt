review/summary: Works Great!review/text: This unit works great. I got the jerky bug after eating some a friend made. Pulled out my old American Harvest Snackmaster Elite (20 years old and hasn't been used in 15 years) and dusted it off. Never really liked that model, fan was on the bottom (everything dripped on it) and it was only 400 watts (took forever to make a batch of jerky - around 24 hours). Looked online to find a newer model. Received this unit two days ago and I am on my second batch. Each batch only takes 5 to 8 hours and the temperature settings are great. On top of that, the trays from my old unit are exactly the same as the new unit so I can really stack them up and dry 5 or 6 pounds of meat at a time.
