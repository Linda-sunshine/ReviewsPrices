review/summary: Yummy!review/text: This might be a little longer than a regular coffee pot but so worth the wait! Wow to have a cup of coffee from this is a delight! I was getting sick of the bunn and my coffee tasting burnt. I had even purchased a new bunn thinking something was wrong with the old pot and I cleaned them thinking maybe it was dirty and affecting the coffee flavor. I don't have any issues with my Presto! The coffee is perfect every time! I can't wait to wake up and have some!
