review/summary: B60 Heating Element Failedreview/text: I purchased the Keurig B60 a little over a year ago as a gift for my husband (I don't drink coffee). He really enjoyed it and had nothing but praises for the product. Then, last week, he just couldn't get it to work. After calling Keurig, they told him that the heating element was the problem and it could not be fixed and would have to purchase a new one. After much discussion, they offered a new B60 for about $70 (about 1/2 off). He did order the new one and it arrived today. I would take into consideration how much you're going to use it (he only used it in the morning, about 3 cups/daily)., and if you're willing to take the chance of the heating element burning out on you. &lt;>&lt;
