review/summary: Great for blending soupsreview/text: I bought this two years ago so I could blend my homemade soups right in the pot. It works great and even if I never used it for anything else, it would be worth it. But I also use it for making yogurt shakes, chopping up nuts, making small amounts of flour out of oatmeal, and sometimes if my mixer didn't mix enough, like when I was making pumpkin pie last week, I just stick it in the bowl and in a few seconds, it blended the pumpkin (it was freshly cooked) so that the whole recipe was smooth. I thought I would review it now, because when I bought it, some people had given it unfavorable reviews. Mine is still working well after two years.
