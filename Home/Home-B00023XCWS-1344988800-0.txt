review/summary: Piece of junkreview/text: You get what you pay for, and I should have known better. Do not make the same mistake I did by buying this piece of junk that is unworthy even of a dorm room. I bought it so we wouldn't be using our microwave all the time, come to find that: if you start with cold water, it takes about 10 minutes to heat up, all the while making enough noise to raise the dead. An old fashioned tea-kettle on the stove is far better, and doesn't have the same awful taste. Buyer please beware!
