review/summary: Very Noisy !review/text: My old KitchenAid blender finally wore out after 35+ years. After researching on Amazon, I decided to stick with the brand I knew and trusted. Now I am not sure.This thing is extremely noisy compared to the older blender; maybe because of the plastic pitcher, not glass like the old one. And of course it has a more powerful motor too. But the performance is no better than my old blender;especially for making fruit smoothies. Finally, there is a burning odor every time the motor is under load, this does not seem right.
