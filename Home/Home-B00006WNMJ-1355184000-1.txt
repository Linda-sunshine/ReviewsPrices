review/summary: perfect!!review/text: This filter is perfect and it fits so well. I get a new one sent every three months as part of the replacement program that automatically sends you one when its due for replacing. It's easy, cheap, and the water tastes great from this filter. The price point of this beats any brita, pur, or zerowater, and you won't know the difference in taste.
