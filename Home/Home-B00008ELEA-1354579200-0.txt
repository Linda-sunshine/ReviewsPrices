review/summary: unreliable, stopped brewing after 3 weeksreview/text: be advised, don't buy...all the critical reviews are true...after less than 3 weeks, the brewing cycle just died, the result always weak coffee...i was up to 10 tablespoons of coffee for the 4 cups and finally gave up and am returning this chinese knock off to amazon...cheaply made, it will shut off brewing for you, sooner or later, giving you a consistent cup of lightly colored water to ruin your morning...this product should not be sold by amazon
