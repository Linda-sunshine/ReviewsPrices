review/summary: A handy little powerhouse!review/text: I recently bought a Roomba to do the floors as vacuuming is difficult for me due to health issues. I bought this Eureka as a supplement to the Roomba to do the furniture and areas the Roomba couldn't reach and I love it.I took a man's leather belt & attached it through the handle so I could sling it on my shoulder & it works like a charm! I was also pleased that my attachments for my old vac fit this, even the wand so it's wonderful!!!It's very powerful and does a great job!
