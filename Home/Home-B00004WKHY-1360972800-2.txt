review/summary: WOW, I love this processor!review/text: I got this processor to make some recipes that I've been coming across in some Paleo cookbooks and this one works great. It's easy to use almost no food gets &#34;hung up&#34; and unchopped. Great for slicing items for stir fry, even mushrooms.
