review/summary: ice ice babyreview/text: The only ice tray type to own, the silicone trays are absolutely the best. They do not stain, hold odors, are dishwasher safe and can make so much more than ice. Try frozen yogurt cubes for the kids, homemade chocolates or make your gin and tonics with tonic cubes so they don't get watery. Try freezing egg whites for later use when you only needed to use the yolk for a recipe, or leftover soup. place cubes into a ziptop bag and store in freezer.
