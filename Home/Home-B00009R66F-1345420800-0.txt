review/summary: I LIKE CLEAN CARPETSreview/text: THE HOOVER STEAMVAC CARPET CLEANER DID A GREAT JOB CLEANING THE CARPET WITH RELATIVE EASE. CARPET DRIED QUICKLY AND LOOKED GREAT. THE UPHOLSTERY CLEANER IS SOMEWHAT OF A JOKE. IT WAS NOT USER FRIENDLY AND LEAKED, FOUND A LOOSE HOSE IN THE UNIT AND REATTACHED IT WHICH STOPPED THE LEAKING, HOWEVER WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE UPHOLSTERY.
