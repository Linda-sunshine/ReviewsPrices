review/summary: Everyday delightreview/text: Ok so arrived a week and a half after order placed. Juices well if you push down slowly on the pusher thingy, if you push down to hard/quick it will leave some fruits and vegetable chunks in the bin bit. Very happy with it, cleaning is fine if you do it right away. We uses a lot of leafy greens and fruits every morning. It does splatter so be careful to keep it away from walls or be prepared to wipe them down. My husband juices for us every morning and he loves it... he washes up once done too :)
