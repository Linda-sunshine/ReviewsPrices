review/summary: Programmable Mr.Coffee Maker From Amazonreview/text: The coffeemaker was easy to use. It did not require an engineer to set it up. Brews very nice tasting coffee. The only thing I wanted to change is to have the warmer stayed on longer than 1 hour before automatically shut itself off. But that in it self a very good safety feature.
