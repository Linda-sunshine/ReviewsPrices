review/summary: twirl-a-scarfreview/text: This is a great item, but I'm not using it for ties. I bought five scarves for a friend for christmas, and she was just laying them everywhere around the house. I seen this tie rack and thought it would work great for her scarves.It does'nt take up a lot of space, use it for ties,scarves,belts,etc. nothing heavy though. An awesome deal.
