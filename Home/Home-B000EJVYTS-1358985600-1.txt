review/summary: Works wellreview/text: I've had this trash can for well over a year and I have had no problems with it. It's very convenient to have the lid open automatically and I don't think I will ever get a regular kitchen trash can again. It opens whenever you stand in front of it, so you need to put it in a location (or face it in a direction) so people don't stand in front of it.
