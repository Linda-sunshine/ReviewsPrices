review/summary: Best Carpet Cleaner Yet for Mereview/text: this is the best rug cleaning system I have ever used. Instead of just swirlingthe dirt around it actually sucked it up and out of the carpet. I had stain areasthat other systems could not remove; but this carpet cleaner did the trick.While it is still work, it was easier than most others to use. I was worriedthat I would just end up with a totally wet carpet that would take days to dry; butthis was not the case with this cleaner. After using my carpet was damp butdried quickly; and there was no after smell like with some of the carpet cleaningsolutions.
