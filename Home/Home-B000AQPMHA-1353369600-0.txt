review/summary: Super convenient, great taste!review/text: One of the best buys I've had this year, my Keurig allows me to have coffee every morning, even if I'm in a rush. I have it in my bedroom so that I get out of bed and have my coffee as I'm getting out of bed. Great product, I recommend it to all my family and friends.
