review/summary: Fabulous!review/text: The lids are air tight. There are no instructions on how they work, but here it is. There is an inner lid and a lid outside the inner lid. To keep the top loose, turn the INNER lid to the left of the outside lid: &#34;Lefty-loosy.&#34; If you want to tighten the lid, turn the INNER lid to the right: &#34;Righty-tighty.&#34; That's it. Heavy glass and a sturdy lid that stays put if turned: Right-Tighty. In the summer, we are going to make sun tea in this jug.
