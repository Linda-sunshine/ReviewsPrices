review/summary: Best 1 or 2 cup coffee maker ever.review/text: This coffee maker is better than ANY kerig or single cup coffee maker on the market. Everyone raves about the Kerig line of coffee makers I bouhght one and made a huge mistake. I went back to this coffee maker. The Kerig brews a half cup of coffee as far as I am concerned. I drink 1 maybe 2 cups of coffee a day and when I say cups I don't mean 8 ozs. My cups are 16 ozs. This coffee maker you can make as much or as little as possible. Every cup tastes great and only $29.95 how can you beat that. No need to purchase filters it has a washable filter. No need to purchase expensive pods buy any coffee you like and start brewing.
