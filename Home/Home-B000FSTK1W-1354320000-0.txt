review/summary: Best Caddy Everreview/text: I bought this 3M Command Large Shower Caddy with Water-Resistant Strips and two Zenith Corner Bath and Shower Caddy. Outstanding products. I highly recommend these items for small or large shower stalls that need that extra storage/shelving. Once the surface is properly prepped the surfaces, using a level and a soft leaded pencil, I outlined where I wanted the items. I went over the area again with alcohol just to ensure I did not touch the area where the two-way tape would be. Mounted the shelving and then took Windex to clean the pencil marks. After letting it cure overnight, I am now able to use the shelving with no problems. Yes, this is the perfect addition to a shower stall and I would buy again. Great products and very well packaged.
