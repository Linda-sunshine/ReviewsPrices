review/summary: It's pretty...review/text: But it did not take long until the seal around the blade assembly started leaking. Noise and vibration are very annoying on the highest settings, and the plastic vessel is no longer clear and bright as food has scratched up the inside. On our old model, the glass was much durable through years of use. Wish I had saved that part!
