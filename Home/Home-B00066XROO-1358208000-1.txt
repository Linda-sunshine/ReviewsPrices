review/summary: Top Notch Grillreview/text: I shopped around before settling on this grill. Basically I wanted a large enough surface so that we could all have our pancakes at once, even cooking from edge to edge, a temperature setting nob and easy cleanup. This grill satisfies every requirement and my daughter absolutely loves it.
