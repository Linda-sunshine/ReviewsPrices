review/summary: Very Pleasedreview/text: After researching several brands of air mattresses and reading the reviews we decided on the Wenzel Insta-Bed. My 17 year old grandson, who is 6'2" found it to be extremely comfortable. My brother and his wife visited us for a week and each morning they reported a very good and comfortable nights sleep. The height of the bed made it extremely easy to get in and out of. It is very easy to inflate and deflate. The sheets stayed in place. We did have to add more air twice during that week, but I believe that is to be expected. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this bed to anyone.
