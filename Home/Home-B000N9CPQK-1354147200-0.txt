review/summary: Works well---review/text: This air purifier certainly has a bit of power for such a small item. It works well in my bedroom, I don't find it to be too loud at all, sure it would have been nice if it was just a bit quieter but it is definitely tolerable. The only thing I do no care for is the cover for the filter will easily come loose if you bump it. Also, it doesn't seem to be quite level, if I don't have it in just the right position (no matter where it is) it will rattle. However, it functions just as it should and this aren't even really 'complaints' just points of observation.
