review/summary: Good, but....review/text: Dual alarms that are easy to set are not all that easy to find; the Sony fits the bill. The radio is adequate for it's purpose; the selectable brightness is a definite plus; the forward/backward time/alarm set saves time and frustration --- all on the good side of the ledger. The one drawback is the buzzer setting on the alarm; it is the most apologetic alarm I have found regardless of which of the soft/loud settings you select. If you need to be rousted out of bed in the morning, this alarm is not going to cut it.
