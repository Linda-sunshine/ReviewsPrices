review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: Love the large size, all glass. The Brita water pitchers don't say BPA free so after filtering, I put the water into these. I will use one for tea, since they are so easy to wash with the big water opening. I love they are square, very efficient storage in the fridge as well as on counter tops next to other things.
