review/summary: Great Price for a Great Clockreview/text: My wife hinted that she wanted a new alarm clock - she needs to wake up at 5 to take a certain medication then goes back to sleep for an hour. This fit the bill. I like the battery backup and auto change for daylight savings time. I've had many Sony clock radios in the past and have always liked the build, performance and relative ease of use. You can't beat the price/performance ratio on this item!
