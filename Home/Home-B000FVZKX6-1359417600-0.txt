review/summary: Good Choicereview/text: I'm very pleased with these sheets. The color is darker in person than the photo would indicate. Fortunately, they still look good with the rest of my bedding. They're nice and warm, especially when you first climb into bed on a cold winter's night. The feel is soft and nice. Overall, I'd say they're good.
