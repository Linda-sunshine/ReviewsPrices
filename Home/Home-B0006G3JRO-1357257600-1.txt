review/summary: A great little hand-blender!review/text: This is a wonderful little immersion blender. Very well-built, and reasonably powerful. I routinely use it for blending soups (think: bisques, etc.) and it has held up very well. The food processor attachment seems almost like an afterthought, but is surprisingly good, and is just gravy added on top of an already great product.
