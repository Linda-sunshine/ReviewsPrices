review/summary: Nice Kettlereview/text: I bought this kettle for my daughter as a gift and she told me she uses it every day. I have similar kettle and I use mine for everything from tea to heating water for oatmeal or hot chocolate.So much quicker then a tea pot on a stove top! Now that I've had one I wouldn't want to be without! I had it delivered directly to my daughter and she received it quickly and in good condition.
