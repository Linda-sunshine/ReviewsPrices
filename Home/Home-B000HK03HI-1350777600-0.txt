review/summary: Best manual opener on the marketreview/text: After my Zyliss opener broke after years of reliable use, I found this one. It works just as good as the original all metal model. It has a built in magnet which grabs the lid after you have severed it from the can and a release button which you have to push to release the opener from the can after opening. I've had this for a couple of trouble free years.
