review/summary: Excellent little grinderreview/text: This grinder was purchased to grind cooked meat, and does an excellent job. It's easy to assemble, easy to break down, and simple to clean. The built-in suction mechanism keeps it firmly in place on a smooth countertop surface so you don't worry about it moving about while you're using it. Very satisfied.
