review/summary: It performs as advertisedreview/text: I bought one of these because it was cheap. My expectations were low, but let me tell you - it works as well as a larger metal one, is easier to clean, and does everything I want for occasional meat grinding. It comes with two grinding blades and three pasta attachments, which I have not tried. It's mostly plastic, very light yet strong. The crank turns easily, and the knife cuts meat at the plate very cleanly.After going to the store for some ground meat and seeing the price, I wanted to try grinding my own from a cheap cut of beef. My existing large metal grinder was too cumbersome, so I got this from Amazon. Two days later, I am at the counter grinding beef. I followed instaructions and in 10 minutes has a half pound of ground meat, with great texture. I also knew exactly what was in it! That's a plus.After cooking, my two burger patties had low shrinkage and great flavor.I love it!
