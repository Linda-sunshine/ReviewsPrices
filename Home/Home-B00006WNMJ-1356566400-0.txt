review/summary: effective, low hastlereview/text: I have gone through a few of these and they work well, they are easy to install. I like to weigh the filter in my hand compared to the next replacement filter before I put it in and feel the weight of the extra lead and junk that it has in it. You will not regret using this filter, one drawback is that the filter faucet mount is not so-so.
