review/summary: Decent Food Processorreview/text: This is my first food processor, and I bought it about five months ago after researching quite a bit. I have been using it pretty often since I've had it, but I think it is a little dissapointing. It often leaves big chunks of things while everything else is grinded (basically processes unevenly). For instance, when I tried have the machine process some potatoes for mashed potatoes, it left huge pieces of potato that refused to be cut up, even when I moved them downward. It often does this with vegetables too (like onion, which I hate cutting by hand), so that I have to process it much finer than I would want to because it would otherwise have big chunks of onion amongst the smaller pieces. Due to this, I find myself cutting many vegetables by hand to get bigger and even pieces. In addition, I tried using the dough blades for some bread this evening, and it didn't seem to work that well...one of the blades bent.Overall, though, I don't have anything to compare this to, and perhaps these flaws are typical of all food processors, but it seems as if they shouldn't be. I shouldn't have to grind my vegetables to an oblivion to have them evenly cut. Perhaps if I bought better dough blades (if they offer it?) or one of the ad-on slicers, it would fix the problems. It just seems as if these problems shouldn't exist in the first place!
