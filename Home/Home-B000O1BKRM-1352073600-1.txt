review/summary: Takes longer to freeze than regular ice cube traysreview/text: I read several reviews on this product and noticed that while most people mention the need to use 2 hands when handling the tray with water in it, they did not say that it takes a lot longer for the water to turn into ice cubes than "normal". I've had these for a couple of years and have had no problem with odor. I do like that fact that they take up a lot less room than other trays (I have four of them and stack them up) and all the cubes come out nicely (no shards), but you'll have to figure out your own technique. Love the colors. Be careful when ordering them online. One site was charging $24 dollars PLUS shipping. God bless Amazon!
