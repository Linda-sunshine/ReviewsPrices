review/summary: Looks cute, but isn't built cute.review/text: Looks cute, kids love it, though hard to find a spot for it that's out of reach so they don't get tempted to play with Panda's ears, leaving their cute little bacteria on it. Expected poor construction when purchasing, but have been pleasantly surprised. Good, clear instructions as well, especially about cleaning, which is really important due to aforementioned cute little bacteria peddlers.
