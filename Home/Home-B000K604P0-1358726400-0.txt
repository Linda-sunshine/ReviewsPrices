review/summary: The punisher is the best coffee cup everreview/text: My brother and I dubbed this coffee mug the punisher after it kept our drinks so hot, for such a long period of time, that we would think to ourself "this has to be drinking temperature by now". We'd go and take a big sip and scorch our mouth with the still piping hot beverage inside. If you want to drink you beverage immediately simply leave the lid off until your beverage is just about the temp you want then put the lid on and consume slowly. Don't worry you probably have 2-3 hours and it will remain in like a 4 degree range. If you want to make your afternoon coffee first thing in the am, put the lid on immediately and it will still be hot for you in the afternoon.
