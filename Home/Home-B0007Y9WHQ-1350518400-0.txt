review/summary: Spiral slicerreview/text: I have only used the slicer on two occasions. It takes a bit of getting used to, but I picked a hard tuber, sweet potatoes for my first try. The directions could be a bit better, but i think I am going to love it. I would recommend it to anyone who is living raw or even just vegetarian. I am looking forward to using it again.
