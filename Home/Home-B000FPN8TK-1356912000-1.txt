review/summary: without a doubt, 5 starsreview/text: This is my favorite way to make tea. Combine a piston check valve with a plastic mug and strainer and you've got this contraption; an easy to use tea pot / infuser which is easy to clean. There will be a few drops or two underneath this after you've emptied the contents into your cup but that's the only drawback and hey, nothing is perfect. But this is damn near close.
