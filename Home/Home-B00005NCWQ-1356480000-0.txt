review/summary: No more electric coffee pots that don't heat your coffeereview/text: If yoiu want a great cup of hot (not luke warm) coffee-this is your best bet. It's simple to use and simple to clean-it's like the old perked coffee my mom used to make. The basket will accomodate any grind of coffee too. I love it-will never go back to Keurig which is expensive and doesn't last and will never go back to any kind of drip coffee maker.
