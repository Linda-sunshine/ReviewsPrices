review/summary: Loose plungerreview/text: This sprayer would have been terrific except the pump plunger repeated fell out the sprayer cap. Since the plastic of the plunger is glue-phobic, I used "MR GRIP" perforated aluminum strips to secure a tight firm cap grip on the plunger. All is now well in the land of green non-toxic sprayers.
