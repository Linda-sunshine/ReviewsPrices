review/summary: Great water jugreview/text: The shape means it fits nicely in the fridge door and doesn't require too much height.Because it is made of glass, it doesn't impart an flavor into the water, unlike some plastic jugs.My only criticism is that, due to the shape of the handle, it can be uncomfortable to hold when it is heavy and very full of water.
