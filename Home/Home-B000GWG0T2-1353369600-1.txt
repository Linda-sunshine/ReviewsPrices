review/summary: As exciting as a frying pan can getreview/text: This pan was recommended on the TV cooking show "America's Test kitchen." It performs exactly as they said it would--the non-stick surface is virtually impervious to wear, cleanup is a snap, it heats evenly, the handle is comfortable, and it doesn't hurt that it's oven safe to 450 degrees. It is an incredibly well designed basic kitchen essential.
