review/summary: One Minor Problem But Easy To Fixreview/text: This product does a great job of filtering out all kinds of bad-tasting chemicals from the water, including the chlorine that most communities have to add per federal regulations. The result is water that is very refreshing to drink, especially on a hot summer day. As I'm the only user the filter lasts for several months before needing to be replaced.I did run into one minor problem, however. The spring on the spigot is somewhat strong and takes a good pull to dispense the water. The base of the unit consists of a thin plastic rail. This rail is smooth and I found that when pulling on the spigot the whole unit would sometimes slide forward a bit, causing some minor spills. I fixed the problem by cutting some thin strips of Gorilla Tape and folding them around the plastic rail until it was fully covered. The tape adds just enough friction to keep the unit from sliding when pulling on the spigot but still lets me easily slide the unit on and off the refrigerator shelf when necessary. I wasn't certain how well the tape would function in that dry, cold environment but it is still holding firm after 7 months.
