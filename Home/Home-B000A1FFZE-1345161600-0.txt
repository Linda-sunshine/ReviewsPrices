review/summary: Glass Shattered After 2 Weeksreview/text: We liked this product while it worked, although it did take a bit longer to heat up in general and toast things. But after only 2 weeks of use, I was preheating the oven and the glass completely shattered for no apparent reason. Guess we'll be buying a separate toaster and oven.
