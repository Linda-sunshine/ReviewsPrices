review/summary: Great for back sleepersreview/text: Saw all the rave reviews on this and decided to give a shot. I was kind of skeptical about spending $100 for a pad on my bed, but I am impressed.Note on the size:I had to order the queen for my full size bed. I am glad I did because there is only about an extra 2+ inches hanging off the end of the bed. Can just cut it off if I want. If I would have gotten the full size it definitely would have been to small for my full bed.It did have a peppermint smell to it that lasted about a week. It is not unpleasant.As far as how you sleep:I noticed that if I sleep on my side I will occasionally wake up from a pain around the side of my stomach. Maybe too much pressure is being put there because the pad is not shaping properly to my body, I do not know. This is why I am knocking a star off. However, if I sleep on my back, I go the whole night no problems. I just need to train myself to do this from now on.Conclusion:All in all, this is big improvement from the regular mattress I was sleeping on and the $10 bumpy foam pads on top it. I do not regret my purchase one bit.
