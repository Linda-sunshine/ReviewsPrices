review/summary: I use it weeklyreview/text: I love this dutch oven. I cook with it about once a week and I've been very pleased with the results every time. I did quite a bit of research on it and everything I have read indicates that there is no discernible difference between Lodge and Le Creuset. I even read an account of someone who made the exact same short rib recipe, side by side, with both brands, and she said they came out exactly the same. None of her taste testers could tell the difference either. In other words, you don't need to spend over $200 on an enameled dutch oven.Why four stars? Within two weeks, of use, it had a scratch on bottom of the pot. I am very careful with this pot and I have no idea how this happened. My cooking utensils are mostly made of wood and/or nylon. My husband and son do the dishes as well, but none of us can figure out where the scratch came from. Also, it had a pronounced pink/red stain around the bottom within the first week. I use a lot of red spices in my cooking (paprika, chili powder, etc.) and I also use it for spaghetti sauce. I didn't think the pot would stain that quickly, but according to customer service, it's normal. Ultimately, it's not very attractive while empty, but most guests see it when it's filled with good stuff, so I suppose it doesn't really matter. :)
