review/summary: Worth the money!review/text: This is an amazing Bread making machine. Just put in all the required ingredients by following one of the recipes in the included book and in 4 - 6 hrs depending on the recipe you chose, you will have a tasty fresh bread.I made 3 breads with the machine so far and all of them came out prefect.The machine is quite, the only time that you can hear it, is during mixing time, but that's hardly disturbing. The next time you will remember that the machine is actually working is when you smell the bread!overall a great purchase!.
