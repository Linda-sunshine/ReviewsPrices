review/summary: Cozy sheetsreview/text: Buy these sheets. They are warm, cozy, thick and very high quality. I washed them before using them and they did shed a bit, but came out of the dryer wrinkle-free. I ordered the chamois color and they are slightly darker than pictured, but very, very nice. We are having a cold snap here in Buffalo, NY and these sheets make it so much more tolerable.
