review/summary: Whacked with a bat.review/text: I recieved my order in 2 days time, very fast ! But, who ever packed the box put one piece of crumbled paper inside to protect it. When i opened the box, it looked like someone whacked it with a baseball bat, putting a rather large indentation on the rim of the pan. When i called up T-Fal, the rep said that i would have to ship it back. When i went to the shipping store to get the box. They wanted another $10 dollars for the box and shipping peanuts. I then called t-fal back and told then that im not willing to pay ANOTHER $10 for there shipping incompitance. Why should the customer be punished ? She basically said " Sorry sir, i can't help you then"In a nut shell: Was shipped superfast,good looking coating, weak metal that dents rather easily,t-fal dropped the ball on customer service. Thanks for nothing t-fal.....I think i will take my business elsewhere. As will the hundred people that i tell my story to every chance i get ! ( ps....i threw the box away, and then called t-fal 2 days later, so i couldn't reuse the old beatup box)
