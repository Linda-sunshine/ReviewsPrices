review/summary: Quit working after two days of heavy usereview/text: I bought this steamer in October 2011 to steam garments and linens used in a relative's wedding. It got a good work out for two days using only distilled water as instructed. I drained the unit and dried it as well as I could and stored it in a closet until last weekend (August 2012)when I pulled it out to steam some shirts. It worked for about five shirts before it began cycling off and cooling down every minute or so. It would steam a minute and then I would have to wait for it to get hot enough to produce steam again. Eventually, it quit steaming altogether. If you're looking for a disposable steamer, this one did a great job first time around. I was not looking for a disposable steamer, so I'm not all that excited about its performance any longer. (At least it made it through the wedding.)
