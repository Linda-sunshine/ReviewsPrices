review/summary: 5 critical pointsreview/text: Ok i have worked in Coffee shops for about 4 years and i have enough experience to make a review about this , this espresso maker did not much my expectations at all , here my 1st point is : i used to best coffee beans that you can get ( Italian Lavazza ) and the best size coffee millstone and doze to make the best espresso and i did not get a strong one . 2ed point is; the steam maker is a big joke it's just water , and it changed the milk flavor which effect the good taste of cappuccino . 3rd point is ; you can not move the the steam tap up and down , when you're done heating your milk and because the machine is very small your milk pitcher will stack between the steam tap and your counter . 4 th point is ; very small water barrel or whatever you wanna call it , and it is about enough for 2 cups of coffee considering your cleaning cycle in the beginning with and after you make your coffee and the 5 th point is : while you start brew you espresso the machine will make a a loud sound and start shaking around which move the cups and slide them off and of course making a mess . i'm giving this product and 2 stars , one because i'm able to make just ok espresso if i combine the 2 on one , and an other star for the price which is unbeatable wherever a looked . thx .
