review/summary: Worried but got a good unitreview/text: Got this for my wife Xmas 2012. I did not notice any weird taste or odor and she uses it almost every day. It takes about 2-3 minutes to boil a pot and is fairly handy .Additional use:Use this to heat up water and toss in a pot for cooking other items rather than heat up water on the stove. Can shorten prep/ cook time.
