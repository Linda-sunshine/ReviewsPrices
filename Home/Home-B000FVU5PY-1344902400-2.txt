review/summary: The perfect purple!review/text: These sheets are exactly what I was looking for, the perfect color that I was looking for and for a great price. The sheets are generously sized, with extra to tuck in at the foot of the bed and accomodate my large mattress with memory foam topper with deep pockets but without the sheets becoming loose.After 1 wash they were soft and comfortable and have gotten softer with each consecutive wash. After 2 months with weekly washing they are holding up very well with no signs of wear or pilling (which I have had with other sheets). I will definitely buy this brand of sheets from Amazon again.
