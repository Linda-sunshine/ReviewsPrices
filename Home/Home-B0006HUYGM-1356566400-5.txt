review/summary: Sweet vacuumreview/text: This thing is petty sweet. I would def recommend it to a friend. It has only 2 flaws in my opinion. The first major issue is that despite the great utility of this thing, it has a cord. Boo. Second minor issue is the air exhaust on he vac can sometimes blow stuff away when it bounces the air off of other surfaces like surrounding walls or cabinets. So for those reasons I dock a star. Other than that I'm happy with the performance so far.
