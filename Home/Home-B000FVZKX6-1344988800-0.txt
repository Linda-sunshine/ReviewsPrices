review/summary: Soft and Smooth After Over a Yearreview/text: We've had these sheets for about 18 months now and they are still and soft and smooth as the day we bought them. The other flannel sheets we bought from Target at the same time have pilled and are now scratchy and horrible. When I wash these, I have to put them in in the morning so they'll be ready for the evening, since I refuse to use the others.Definitely the best flannel sheets I've bought. I'm planning to order another set now so I don't have to worry about them not being dry by nighttime.Also, I always wash and dry them on cold.
