review/summary: Nothing Like Homeade Breadreview/text: I asked "santa" (my mom) for this for Christmas this year. We still do gift exchange even though we are older.It's REALLY simple to use. You basically add ingredients, select bread type, size, and color, and hit start. It starts to kneed, which is quite fun to watch. It will go fast, which seems to work the bottom of the dough, and then slow down, which catches it a lot more and turns it over. There are a number of patterns it works in. The kneeding is really quiet, much more so than expected. Mom has a noodle maker with an incredibly loud gearmotor, whereas this thing is almost silent.It will work a cycle, depending on the bread. It will kneed, rise, kneed, rise, punch down, rise, bake, for example. My first batch came out good, although it got alittle too high. I poked it, with caused the top to collapse. Don't do this ;) It was still quite good though. I think I used too much yeast. The second batch was excellent. I also made beer bread, which is a quickbread (baking powder instead of yeast). This is more like a batter. For normal dough, you get a dough ball which the kneeding blade really gets under and lifts and kneeds. When the bread bakes, the blade is sticking into, but not engulfed in, the bread, and therefore easy to remove. For the quickbread, its more of a gooey batter that the blade pushes through. As a result, the blade gets baked more into the bread and you have to pick it out. Not a big deal, but be careful not to lose it.One thing to note is that the mixing bowl is NOT dishwasher safe according to the directions. It is however non stick and very easy to clean. I'd recommend removing the kneeding blade as soon as possible else it gets stuck to the shaft.It can also make pizza dough and some other things I haven't tried yet. It was a really good choice so far.
