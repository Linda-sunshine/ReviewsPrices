review/summary: a staple in my kitchenreview/text: This machine is wonderful! It does exactly what I need it to do in a juicer. With the juices I make I am able to keep my weight stable and I do feel a whole lot better when I stay the course of regular juicing. I like that all the part are removable and easy to clean...just be sure to employ the included brush for scrubbing the inside of the collection chamber. I will recommend this juicer as a first choice if one can afford it.
