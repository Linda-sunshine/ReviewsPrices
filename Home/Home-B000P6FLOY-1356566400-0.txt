review/summary: Excellent purchase.review/text: Great item for checking out meat temps. We like the fact that the probe can be inserted and left in the meat while the reader is magnitized on the front of the stove.Only down-side is that there is no on-off switch, nor does this shut itself off after awhile. However, we've had this for at least a year - and we are still on the first set of batteries.
