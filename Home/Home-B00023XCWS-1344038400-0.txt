review/summary: Amazing Product of the Industrialized World!review/text: This inexpensive plastic electric kettle boils up to a liter of water quickly, shuts off automatically, and comes complete with a short detachable cord. Yes, your water will taste a bit like plastic and you will wonder why the cord is so short - but for what it is, this device performs with aplomb. It was a staple of my college tea-making kit and kept me satisfied with more than six years of good use. But now it sits unused on my kitchen counter as I heat water in a proper stainless steel kettle on the stove top, like a grownup.
