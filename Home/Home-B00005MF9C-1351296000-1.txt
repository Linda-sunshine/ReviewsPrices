review/summary: Toxic Coffee Makerreview/text: I was looking forward to a nice little coffee maker I could use at work and thought this Black & Decker product would work. When I made my first mug of coffee and started to drink it, I wondered where the terrible taste was coming from. Since I've made coffee before and was using the usual brand name, I was puzzled. After following the scent, it became obvious that the disgusting odor was coming from the coffee maker itself. For some reason, the part underneath the cover lift tab where you place the filter was giving off a noxious stench that gets transferred into the coffee. Whatever material is used for this item can't be healthy. There's been controversy with some plastics in recent years but this item goes to the point where you can't help but notice it, unless you've lost your sense of taste and smell. Black & Decker probably should've stayed with making tools instead of coffee brewers. Maybe they lost their sense of craftsmanship with tools and are trying to make a buck foisting contaminated articles on an unknowing public. Do not put your health in jeopardy by drinking from this polluted container. Based on this experience I'll be taking a close look at any Black & Decker product in the future. Never mind that, I don't think I'm going to look at any Black & Decker products.
