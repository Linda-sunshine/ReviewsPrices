review/summary: Don't hesitatereview/text: If you are tired of your waffles sticking to your present waffle maker, throw it out and buy this one. It works great and way faster than any other that I have used. I followed the directions for first time use, and each time I use it I spray it with Pam, and then clean it with a damp paper towel when I am done. Hopefully, that will keep it happy. The waffles are done in just over TWO minutes (will have same color as the one shown in the photo), they taste great and do not stick to the surfaces. Couldn't be happier.
