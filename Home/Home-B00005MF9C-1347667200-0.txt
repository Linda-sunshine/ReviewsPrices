review/summary: One of the Best Product Ever Ownedreview/text: I purchased this product 6 years ago, use it two or three times a day, and it always works, just as well as it did the first time I used it 6 years ago. Furthermore, it works very well! I have not had to "fix" it, replace any parts, "clean" it (beyond rinsing the grinds out with each use), or accept any compromise in diminished service over time. The filter works fine - no sludge and no overflows, and the time it takes to brew is the same as when new. There have been no leaks, sounds, stains, shorts, cracks, overflows or meltdowns. For the coffee cynosure, it has simple elegance.
